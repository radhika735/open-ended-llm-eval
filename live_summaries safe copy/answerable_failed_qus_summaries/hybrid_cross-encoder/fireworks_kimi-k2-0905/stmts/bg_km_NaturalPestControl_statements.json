Retaining or creating hedgerows (action ID 2314) was found to increase the ratio of natural enemies to pests and provide more natural enemies in fields.

Growing cover crops in arable fields can help reduce weed numbers, with studies showing fewer weeds in plots with cover crops compared to plots without them, though effects can vary between different cover crop types and conditions. Crop rotations have been shown to reduce weed biomass, particularly when using sequences like canola-wheat compared to wheat-wheat sequences. Farmers can also grow competitive plants such as clovers, fescues, ryegrass, and turnip to reduce weed weight, ground cover, reproduction, and survival. Converting to organic farming generally results in more weeds, but this system promotes natural weed seed predation by beneficial organisms. For specific weed problems like creeping thistle, biological control methods including cutting, infection with fungal pathogens, and use of weevils to infect plants with systemic rust have proven effective. Cultural practices like lenient grazing can also provide long-term control of certain weed species.",

Using chemicals to attract natural enemies showed positive effects in multiple studies, with some chemicals increasing parasitism rates and attracting more natural enemies, though results varied by chemical type, crop, and location (Action ID: 754). Genetically modified maize expressing Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki (Btk) toxin targeted European corn borer (Action ID: 3895).

Studies show that excluding ants from trees resulted in greater parasitism of pests in some trials, as ants can protect pest insects from natural enemies (Action 886). Leaving parts of the crop or pasture unharvested or uncut has demonstrated increased predation and parasitism rates of pest eggs in unharvested strips, with one replicated, controlled study from Australia showing these benefits (Action 725). Incorporating parasitism rates when making insecticide spraying decisions has been shown to maintain acceptable levels of crop damage while reducing unnecessary pesticide applications, as demonstrated in a controlled study from New Zealand on tomatoes (Action 726). Growing non-crop plants that produce chemicals that attract natural enemies has proven effective, with four studies from China, Germany, India, and Kenya finding decreased pest populations or damage when such plants were present, though effects on parasitism specifically varied (Action 724). Planting hedgerows has shown promise, with one replicated, paired site comparison from the USA finding that a higher proportion of pest eggs were parasitized in fields with hedgerows compared to fields with weedy edges, though this effect was only observed up to 100 meters into the crop (Action 1401). Using mass-emergence devices to increase natural enemy populations showed mixed results, with one randomized, replicated, controlled study in Switzerland finding higher parasitism at one site but no effect at another site (Action 775).",

Natural regeneration of ground cover beneath perennial crops can provide habitat for natural enemies (predatory insects and spiders), with some studies finding more natural enemies in natural ground cover compared to bare ground, though effects vary between different groups of natural enemies (Action 720). Planting flowers or maintaining flowering strips within agricultural areas increases the abundance and species richness of butterflies and moths (Actions 3932, 442), with 23 studies showing that sown wildflower strips had higher species richness and abundance of butterflies compared to conventional field margins or cropped fields. \n\nFor pest regulation, maintaining ground cover in orchards and vineyards can increase natural enemy numbers, with four studies finding more natural enemies in plots with ground cover compared to bare plots (Action 1395). However, effects on pests are mixed - some studies found fewer pests in areas with natural vegetation while others found variable effects depending on pest species (Action 720). Planting flower strips can enhance pest regulation, with three studies showing greater pest reduction or higher proportions of parasitized pests in fields with planted flowers (Action 1400).\n\nLeaving part of crops or pastures unharvested or uncut provides important habitat, with three studies finding increased abundance of predatory insects or spiders, and five studies finding more predators in the unharvested areas themselves (Action 725). Growing native trees within perennial crop plantations can increase butterfly diversity, with one study in Costa Rica finding higher diversity in coffee farms with both native and non-native tree species compared to farms with only non-native trees (Action 3920).",
