Creating habitat features is the most consistently effective approach. Creating hole habitats (>50 mm) on structures increased brown crab abundance (action 3434). Creating pit habitats (1–50 mm), along with holes, grooves and environmentally-sensitive material, had mixed effects on invertebrate abundances depending on the species group (action 3455). Creating groove habitats (1–50 mm) similarly had mixed effects on invertebrate abundances (action 3448). Creating grooves and small protrusions, ridges or ledges (1–50 mm) together led to colonization by non-mobile invertebrates (action 3452). \n\nCreating flexible habitats also showed positive effects. Short flexible habitats (1–50 mm) had mixed effects on mobile and non-mobile invertebrate abundances depending on species group and site (action 3450). Long flexible habitats (>50 mm) supported higher biomass (mostly mussels) and non-mobile invertebrate species that were absent from structure surfaces without flexible habitats, though effects varied by species group and survey timing (action 3451).\n\nTransplanting or seeding organisms onto structures increased invertebrate species richness and altered community composition (action 3471). Using textured surfaces (≤1 mm) had mixed effects on non-mobile invertebrate abundance depending on the site (action 3449). \n\nOverall, creating physical habitat complexity through holes, pits, grooves, flexible habitats, and transplanting organisms provides the most reliable interventions for increasing invertebrate abundance on subtidal artificial structures, though effects can vary by species group and environmental conditions.",

      "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from 22 studies examining pit habitats (1-50 mm) and 18 studies examining rock pools on intertidal artificial structures, these are the most consistently effective habitat creation methods for altering overall community composition. Pit habitats consistently altered combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition in four of six replicated, controlled studies, with nine of sixteen studies showing community composition changes and twelve of fifteen studies demonstrating increased species richness/diversity. Rock pools were equally effective, with sixteen of seventeen studies showing they supported macroalgae, invertebrate, and/or fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without pools, and thirteen of sixteen studies reporting altered community composition. Hole habitats (>50 mm) also showed strong effectiveness in three studies, altering community composition and supporting unique species. In contrast, groove habitats (1-50 mm) showed mixed results with only two of three studies altering community composition, while small ridges/ledges (1-50 mm) and small swimthrough habitats showed limited effectiveness. The combination of grooves with small protrusions, ridges, or ledges showed better results in nine of fourteen studies, but still less consistently than pit habitats and rock pools alone. Short and long flexible habitats showed limited evidence with mixed effects on community composition.",
