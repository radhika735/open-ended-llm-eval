For crop-raiding primates, changing to crops less palatable to primates (action 1439) has been proposed, though no effectiveness studies were found. Using loud-speakers to broadcast primate alarm calls (1447) or sounds of potential threats like barking dogs and gunshots (1446) have been proposed but lack effectiveness evidence. Humans chasing primates using random loud noise (1449) reduced crop raiding by orangutans in Indonesia and returned gorillas to protected forest areas in Democratic Republic of Congo. Using chili as a deterrent (2492) has shown mixed results with elephants but no specific primate evidence is available. GPS/VHF tracking devices on problem troops to provide early warning to farmers (1443) has been proposed but not studied. Diversionary feeding (2323) reduced nuisance behavior by black bears in two USA studies, though this was not specifically tested on primates. Translocation approaches have been studied for other mammals (2341, 2336) but specific evidence for primates is lacking, with general translocation showing mixed results including high return rates and continued nuisance behavior.",

In the Democratic Republic of Congo, community control was more effective at reducing illegal bushmeat hunting, including primates, compared to nearby national parks. Similarly, in Cameroon, no incidents of gorilla poaching occurred over three years after implementing community control and monitoring of illegal activities, and in Nigeria, there were more gorillas and chimpanzees in areas managed by community conservation organizations. Implementing local no-hunting community policies or traditional hunting bans also proved effective. Studies from China, Democratic Republic of Congo, Belize, Cameroon, and Nigeria showed that primate populations increased following the implementation of local hunting bans, with very few snub-nosed monkeys killed annually in areas where wildlife killing was forbidden, and populations of gorillas, black howler monkeys, drills, and Sclater's monkeys all increasing after hunting prohibitions were established. Strengthening or reinstalling traditional taboos that forbid the killing of primates was found to be effective, with Laotian black crested gibbons occurring at higher densities in areas protected by local hunting taboos compared to sites without such taboos.",

Providing better equipment to anti-poaching ranger patrols has shown positive results, with studies in DRC and Rwanda finding increased gorilla populations.

For species-specific legal protection (Action ID 1524): A before-and-after study in India found rhesus macaque populations increased over 17 years following an export ban. However, studies in Thailand and India showed primate populations declined despite legal protection. In Malaysia, most introduced Müller's Bornean gibbons died despite legal protection, and in Cameroon, drill populations declined at four of five sites despite protection.\n\nFor habitat legal protection (Action ID 1578): Studies in China showed primate numbers increased or no more individuals were killed after areas received legal protection. A study in Kenya found Tana River red colobus monkey and crested mangabey numbers decreased despite legal protection. A study in China showed Hainan gibbon numbers increased by 34% over nine years after habitat protection. In Brazil, most golden lion tamarins did not survive over seven years despite being in a legally protected area, though they reproduced and surviving offspring partly compensated for adult mortality. Studies in Republic of Congo and Gabon found most central chimpanzees and lowland gorillas reintroduced to legally protected areas survived over 4-5 years. A study in Mexico found black howler monkeys in protected areas had lower stress levels than those in unprotected forest fragments.\n\nOverall, the evidence suggests habitat protection may show more positive outcomes than species-specific protection alone, with multiple studies documenting population increases or improved welfare measures when habitats are legally protected.",

Reintroducing primates in groups has shown mixed results, with some studies showing population increases while others found declining populations after reintroduction (Action 1567). Translocating mammals away from development sites has been attempted, with limited success as some animals return to their capture sites (Action 2517). Other suggested interventions include restoring habitat corridors (Action 1583), certifying mines and marketing their products as 'primate friendly' (Action 1454), and reusing old roads rather than building new ones (Action 1463).

Educating local communities about primates and sustainable use in Cameroon led to increased drill populations when combined with another intervention (Action ID: 1563). Multimedia campaigns using theatre, film, print media, and discussions have demonstrated significant benefits, including 61-138% increases in black howler monkey numbers over 3-13 years in Belize alongside other interventions (Action ID: 1571). These campaigns also improved attitudes and knowledge about tamarins in Brazil and Colombia, informed large numbers of people about lowland gorillas in the Republic of Congo, and led to the apparent cessation of poaching for diademed sifakas and black and white ruffed lemurs in Madagascar after distributing conservation books in local primary schools. Community involvement in conservation management has mixed but encouraging results. Involving local communities in management showed benefits for black howler monkeys in Belize, with numbers increasing over 13 years when combined with other interventions (Action ID: 1565). A community-based monitoring scheme in Cameroon successfully stopped gorilla poaching incidents when implemented alongside other conservation measures. However, some proposed community-based strategies lack supporting evidence. Paying farmers to cover the costs of non-harmful strategies to deter primates (Action ID: 1429), compensating farmers for produce loss caused by primates (Action ID: 1428), employing hunters in the conservation sector to reduce their impact (Action ID: 1484), creating buffer zones around protected primate habitat (Action ID: 1577), and installing billboards to raise primate conservation awareness (Action ID: 1566) all have no evidence available to assess their effectiveness.",

Wearing protective equipment such as face-masks to prevent transmission of viral and bacterial diseases to primates (Action 1537) has shown positive results, contributing to the same 168% increase in mountain gorilla populations over 41 years.

For butterflies and moths, reduced impact logging had mixed effects: Brazilian forests managed with RIL had similar community composition and species richness to primary forest but different from pristine forest, with intermediate intensity RIL showing higher butterfly abundance than high or low intensity (Action 3867). Moth species richness in shelterwood harvesting recovered faster than after clearcutting, while thinning showed higher species richness than clearcutting (Action 3871, 3868). For bats, reduced impact logging had smaller effects on abundance than conventional logging, though activity varied by species (Action 989). Primate studies showed variable results: low intensity selective logging had higher primate densities than high intensity logging in Sierra Leone, but similar densities in Uganda studies, with lemur numbers increasing following selective logging in Madagascar (Action 1485).
