For solitary bees, 29 out of 30 replicated trials showed occupancy by bees, with many species readily using nest boxes including endangered species. Occupancy rates for solitary bee nest boxes ranged from 1-26% of available cavities, and studies demonstrated that nest provision could double the number of occupied nests over three years. In contrast, bumblebee nest boxes showed very low uptake rates of 2% or less in recent UK trials, with only 0-2.5% occupancy in three replicated trials since 1989. While some older trials (pre-1978) showed higher bumblebee occupancy rates of 10-48%, current evidence indicates underground nest boxes are most effective for bumblebees with 6-58% occupancy, whereas surface wooden boxes commonly marketed for gardens show very low success rates of 0-1.5%.",

One large replicated controlled trial (Action 362) found that the average abundance of long-tongued bumblebees on field margins was positively correlated with the number of pollen and nectar agri-environment agreements in a 10 km grid square. For habitat restoration along watercourses (Action 1408), one replicated, paired site comparison found similar numbers of bees and bee species, but different bee communities, in restored and remnant sites, with bee visitation rates to native flowers not differing between restored and remnant sites. Studies examining habitat corridors (Actions 1580, 1730, 2576) provide very limited evidence for bees specifically, with no studies directly testing corridors for bee conservation. One study in Indonesia (Action 1730) found that a peat swamp forest corridor contained substantial tree density but did not assess bee populations. For increasing natural or semi-natural habitat in farmed landscapes (Action 6), no evidence was found demonstrating effects on bee diversity or abundance. Similarly, increasing landscape diversity of nectar and pollen plants (Action 21) has limited evidence showing positive correlation with long-tongued bumblebee abundance.",

The primary intervention is creating patches of bare ground, which five studies (four replicated trials and one un replicated study) showed can be successfully colonized by ground-nesting solitary bees and wasps within one to two years. However, there is no evidence demonstrating the effect of bare ground creation on bee populations or communities at larger scales. For cavity-nesting solitary bees, providing artificial nest sites has been extensively tested across 30 replicated trials in 10 countries, with 29 trials showing successful occupancy by various bee species. Nest boxes made from cut hollow stems, tubes, or drilled wooden blocks are readily occupied and can increase local bee populations when placed within 150-600m of foraging resources. Repeated nest box provision at sites over three years can double the number of occupied solitary bee nests. Bumblebee nest boxes have shown very low uptake rates of 0-2.5% in recent studies, with underground designs performing better than surface boxes, but overall effectiveness remains limited for ground-nesting bumblebees.",

      "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from multiple studies, several actions can be taken to create or enhance nesting sites for various bee species, beyond providing bare ground. The most consistently effective approach is providing artificial nest sites using specific materials and designs. Studies across 10 countries demonstrate that solitary bees readily occupy nest boxes made from cut hollow stems or tubes (23 replicated trials) and blocks of wood drilled with holes (11 replicated trials), with 29 out of 30 trials showing occupancy by bees, including endangered species. Reed stems and wooden grooved-board designs were found to be particularly productive, while plastic-lined holes and paper or plastic tubes had lower success due to parasitism and mold issues. For bumblebees, underground nest boxes proved most effective, with seven replicated trials showing 6-58% occupancy for boxes buried 5-10 cm underground with 30-80 cm entrance pipes, compared to very low uptake (0-2.5%) for surface wooden boxes commonly marketed for wildlife gardening. However, nest boxes for stingless bees showed no uptake in one Brazilian trial. Protecting existing nesting sites is also important - excluding ants from solitary bee nests increased offspring production, and using sticky barriers to exclude introduced European earwigs significantly increased native bee use of nest boxes. Nest boxes should be strategically placed within 150-600 m of foraging resources, as this represents the foraging range of medium to large European solitary bee species.",

For road verges, a replicated paired site comparison study in the USA found that restored roadside prairies where herbicide application was restricted had greater species richness and abundance of butterflies compared to verges dominated by non-native vegetation with no herbicide restrictions. Areas under power lines showed similar results, with a replicated site comparison study in Canada finding that transmission lines (including power lines) which were neither sprayed with herbicide nor mown had greater abundance of northern pearl crescent and pearl crescent butterflies compared to sprayed and mown areas. Altering mowing regimes by reducing mowing frequency or timing also proved effective, with replicated studies in the UK and Canada finding higher abundance of adult butterflies in unmown public parks and road verges compared to regularly mown areas, and a replicated site comparison study in Poland finding fewer dead butterflies on less frequently mown road verges.",

At the local patch scale, multiple replicated trials demonstrate that planted flower patches consistently attract substantial numbers of foraging wild bees, with studies documenting 8-35 bee species on such patches. Field margins sown with wild flowers or agricultural nectar and pollen mixes support significantly higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees compared to cropped edges, grassy margins, or naturally regenerated strips. However, at the wider landscape scale, the evidence is more mixed. One large replicated trial found positive correlation between long-tongued bumblebee abundance and the number of pollen/nectar agreements in 10 km grid squares, but other trials show that bee numbers and species richness are not significantly higher in farmland 50-1,500 m away from planted flower patches. Additionally, two replicated trials found that bumblebee populations were not enhanced on farmland managed under agri-environment schemes at the landscape scale. While local patches can significantly enhance bee reproductive success - such as blue orchard mason bees showing enhanced reproductive success with planted lupine patches in commercial orchards - the wider landscape effects appear more limited.",
