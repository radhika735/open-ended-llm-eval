Organic farming compared to conventional farming demonstrates mixed results: five of nine studies found no difference in overall bat activity, while four studies found higher activity on organic farms, including higher feeding activity and species-specific benefits for Brazilian free-tailed bats and Myotis species over water habitats (action 961). Field size matters, with one study finding higher activity for six of seven bat species in landscapes with smaller fields compared to larger fields (action 1939). Hedgerow management shows benefits when trimming is less frequent: hedges trimmed ≥3 years prior had more bat species and higher activity for two of eight species compared to recently trimmed hedges (action 1943). Creating tree plantations on agricultural land showed no difference in species richness, with two of three studies finding no difference in bat activity, though plantations next to remnant vegetation had higher activity than isolated plantations (action 958). Agri-environment schemes showed no significant benefits, with two of three studies finding no difference in overall bat activity compared to conventional farms, and one study finding lower activity on scheme farms (action 962). Creating artificial water sources such as farm ponds and reservoirs can increase bat activity compared to surrounding habitats (action 959). Riparian buffers showed no effect on pipistrelle activity in one study (action 2284). No significant difference was found for pipistrelle activity between species-rich grassland created on agri-environment scheme farms and conventional farm fields (action 2051).",

Benefits include increased occupancy over time, with nine studies finding bat box use increased 2-10 times up to 10 years after installation (Action ID: 1024). However, there are significant limitations and negative impacts. Common pipistrelle bats used heated bat boxes at only one of seven sites, and none were used by maternity colonies (Action ID: 2052). Displaced bats often fail to use provided alternatives - two studies found bats displaced from buildings did not use any of 43 bat houses of four different designs or 12 heated bat boxes of one design (Action ID: 1024). When alternative roosts are created within developments, two studies found bats did not use any of the alternative roosts provided in bat houses or purpose-built bat walls after exclusion from buildings, and a UK review found new bat boxes/lofts built to replace destroyed roosts were four times less likely to be used by returning bats than roosts retained during development (Action ID: 949). Success rates vary considerably, with 22 studies finding bats occupying less than half of bat boxes provided (0-49%) while nine studies found bats occupying more than half (54-100%) (Action ID: 1024).",

For foraging habitat, creating or restoring bat foraging habitat in urban areas has shown positive results, with studies finding greater bat activity over biodiversity green roofs compared to conventional unvegetated roofs (Action 954). Protecting brownfield or ex-industrial sites can also provide habitat, with one study recording five bat species within a protected urban wildlife refuge on an abandoned manufacturing site (Action 953). For roosting habitat, multiple approaches are available. Providing bat boxes has been extensively studied, with 41 of 43 studies finding that bats used bat boxes installed in various urban settings including buildings, bridges, and urban areas (Action 1024). Studies have found that 72 bat species used bat boxes across Europe, North America and Asia. Creating artificial hollows and cracks in trees can provide natural roosting opportunities, with one study finding that eight of 16 artificial hollows cut into trees were used by roosting long-eared bats (Action 2047). Retaining veteran and standing dead trees as natural roosting sites is also recommended, though this approach lacks direct study evidence (Action 993). Additional urban habitat protection measures include increasing semi-natural habitat within gardens (Action 1933) and protecting greenfield sites or undeveloped land in urban areas (Action 1934), though these actions also lack direct evaluation studies.",

Bat boxes have been studied most extensively across 44 studies, with 72 bat species using them worldwide, though only 18 species commonly used them and 31 species used them as maternity roosts. Black bat boxes were found to be used more than grey, white, or wooden boxes. Two-compartment bat boxes were preferred over single compartment designs during breeding season. Concrete bat boxes had higher occupancy rates than wooden ones. Rocket boxes were preferred by Indiana bats over conventional wooden bat boxes. Artificial caves and hibernacula created in the UK and Germany were used by up to four bat species, with one UK study showing bat usage increased over nine years. Artificial tree hollows and cracks carved into trees in Australia were used by long-eared bats, with eight of 16 hollows being occupied. Spaces created in road bridges and culverts in the USA successfully recolonized by bats in similar or greater numbers at four of eight sites. Bat box placement also affected effectiveness, with boxes on buildings showing higher occupancy than those on trees. However, some studies found displaced bats did not use provided bat boxes, and heated bat boxes showed limited success with common pipistrelles and Natterer's bats.",
