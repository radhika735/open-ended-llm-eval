Planting turf from intact heathland sites has shown positive results, with two randomized, controlled studies in the UK finding that this technique increased the abundance or cover of heathland species and increased seedling abundance for a majority of heathland plant species. Topsoil removal combined with planting or seeding has also demonstrated effectiveness, with replicated, controlled studies showing that this approach increased cover of heathland plants, heather and gorse, while reducing cover of perennial rye-grass. \n\nFor shrubland restoration more broadly, studies have found that restored areas can achieve similar species richness and abundance compared to undisturbed areas for various taxa. A replicated, controlled study in Mexico found that restored shrubland had similar reptile and amphibian species richness but higher lizard abundance compared to unrestored areas. Similarly, site comparison studies in the USA and Mexico found that mammal species richness in restored desert scrub or shrubland was similar to that in undisturbed areas.\n\nHowever, some interventions showed mixed or limited results. Simple topsoil removal without additional interventions did not consistently increase heather cover or heathland species richness. Spreading clippings of heathland plants showed variable outcomes, with some studies finding increases in heather seedlings but not in other heathland species. Adding sulphur to soil alongside planting or seeding generally did not significantly improve outcomes. A study from the Netherlands found that heathlands restored by topsoil removal had lower butterfly species richness compared to the surrounding landscape, although abundance was higher in areas where heather litter had also been spread.",

Ceasing livestock grazing through fencing exclusion generally increases shrub cover and biomass, with studies showing enhanced shrub abundance and increased height of individual heather plants. However, some studies found mixed or no effects on shrub cover. When grazing pressure is modified, such as through changes in grazing intensity, results show variable impacts - some studies found lighter grazing increased vegetation cover while others observed no clear effects. Changing the type of livestock can lead to mixed effects on shrub cover. The specific effects on shrubland vegetation depend on factors such as the baseline grazing intensity, the type of alteration implemented (cessation, modification, or livestock type change), and local environmental conditions. These findings indicate that while grazing alterations can influence shrubland vegetation, the outcomes are context-dependent and may vary by specific shrub species and ecosystem characteristics.",

Cutting has been shown to increase the abundance of butterflies including high brown fritillary and small pearl-bordered fritillary. Herbicide application can effectively reduce grass cover and increase cover of heathland species, although results are mixed for some grass species. Livestock grazing management, including rotational grazing, can control vegetation succession - rotational grazing has been found to increase species richness of butterflies and burnet moths compared to continuous grazing. Increased livestock numbers can reduce dwarf shrub cover and decline heather cover while increasing grass cover and plant species numbers. These mechanical and grazing approaches provide fire-free alternatives for maintaining open shrubland habitats and controlling woody plant encroachment.",

Combining prescribed burning with increased livestock grazing has also been tested, with an Italian study showing this approach reduced both common heather cover and tree basal area (Action ID 1722). Herbicide application represents another chemical control option, with a South African study showing it increased plant diversity though it did not increase shrub cover, while a UK study found it increased common heather seedling abundance (Action ID 1629).

Mechanical methods such as manual control or removal of midstorey and ground-level vegetation (including mowing, chaining, and cutting) have been studied for their impacts on bird communities, with mixed effects on species diversity and abundance (Action ID 337). However, evidence is lacking for some proposed methods - no studies were found evaluating the effectiveness of cutting/mowing shrubland specifically to control trees (Action ID 1633), removing trees/crops to restore shrubland structure (Action ID 1683), or removing trees along with leaf litter and topsoil (Action ID 1684).",

Strip turf removal has been studied in the UK and showed increased heathland plant presence while decreasing non-heathland plant presence in one controlled study. Prescribed burning to control grass has shown mixed results - one replicated controlled study found it reduced vegetation height initially (though this recovered over time) but did not reduce purple moor grass cover. Mechanical methods including rotovating (mechanical soil cultivation) showed varying effectiveness, with one controlled study indicating that mowing followed by rotovating increased heathland plant species in one of two sites, while rotovating alone did not alter plant presence compared to other methods. The impacts of these methods vary, with some showing limited effectiveness for grass control while potentially affecting other vegetation components differently.",

In wetland/pond management (action 3950), cutting prevented succession with mixed effects on butterflies - Swiss fens managed by mowing had greater butterfly species richness than grazed fens, though Dutch studies found recently cut fens had fewer large copper eggs and lower caterpillar survival than uncut fens. For reptile populations (action 3713), vegetation cutting generally maintained similar species richness and abundance compared to uncut areas.\n\nRegarding grazing intensity modifications, increasing livestock numbers (action 1628) showed mixed effects on shrubland vegetation - two UK studies found common heather cover declined with high livestock density, while a Netherlands study found lower dwarf shrub cover in grazed versus ungrazed areas. However, some studies showed increases in heather seedlings and variable responses across sites. For grassland management (action 3962), increasing grazing intensity or cutting frequency reduced butterfly and moth abundance compared to lightly grazed or ungrazed areas, with intensive grazing sites having lower species richness.

Studies from the UK, Netherlands, and France found that high livestock density areas had lower dwarf shrub and ericaceous shrub cover but higher grass and sedge cover compared to ungrazed areas. However, increasing livestock numbers can increase the number of heather seedlings and plant species diversity in some cases. Reducing livestock density or excluding large herbivores produces opposite effects: removing grazing animals increased shrub cover and allowed common heather to increase in height and cover. Using fences to exclude deer increased shrub height but not necessarily shrub cover. The effects appear to be species-specific, with ericaceous shrubs being more sensitive to grazing pressure than non-ericaceous shrubs. Vegetation height generally decreases with increased grazing intensity, and plant species richness can be higher in grazed versus ungrazed areas, though results vary by location and specific grazing management approach.",
