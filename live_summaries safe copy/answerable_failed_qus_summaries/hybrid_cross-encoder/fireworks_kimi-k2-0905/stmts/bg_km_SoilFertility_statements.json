Fresh plant material and crop remains incorporation also improved yields, with a trial from the Philippines finding higher grain yields when crop remains were incorporated earlier in the season. Adding manures and agricultural composts proved effective with four controlled, replicated studies from India, Spain and Turkey finding higher crop yields when manures or compost were applied. Bacterial and fungal amendments also showed positive results with two randomized, replicated trials from India and Turkey finding higher crop yields. Formulated chemical compounds (fertilizers) showed yield increases in trials from India and the Philippines where maize, wheat and rice yields increased with increased fertilizer application.

      "relevant_summary": "Several actions can improve soil structure by reducing compaction based on the evidence found. Reducing grazing intensity allows compacted soils to recover - one study from Australia found that excluding sheep for 2.5 years enabled compacted soils to recover. Amending soil with organic processing wastes or composts can improve soil structure and reduce soil loss, as demonstrated by a controlled trial from Spain that found applying high rates of cotton gin compost and poultry manure improved soil structure. Amending soil with fresh plant material or crop remains, such as straw incorporation, was found to improve soil structure in a study from India, and also reduced soil loss in a study from Canada. Growing cover crops when fields are empty can improve soil structure and nutrient retention, with studies from Denmark, Turkey, and the UK finding higher soil porosity, interconnectivity, and lower resistance in soil under cover crops. Using brash mats during harvesting can help avoid soil compaction, though no direct evidence was available for this practice. Reducing tillage intensity, including using no tillage or reduced tillage instead of conventional tillage, can improve soil aggregation and stability, with multiple studies finding that soils without tillage were more stable than tilled soils.",

Retaining crop residues (Action 907) reduces water runoff and increases water storage while also increasing soil organic carbon and nitrogen levels, making it particularly effective for sandy-loam soils. Growing cover crops or living mulches (Action 897) reduces soil erosion and can increase soil organic matter, with studies specifically on sandy loam and sandy soils showing these benefits. Changing tillage practices (Action 906) can improve the soil's ability to absorb water and increase soil water content through subsoiling, which is particularly relevant for drought conditions on sandy soils. Amending soils with organic processing wastes or composts (Action 891) can also improve soil structure on sandy loam soils, reducing soil loss and improving nutrient retention.
