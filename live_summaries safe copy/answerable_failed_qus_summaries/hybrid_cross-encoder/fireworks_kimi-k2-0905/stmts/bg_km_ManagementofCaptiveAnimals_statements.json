For primates, puzzle feeders decreased food sharing, increased foraging behavior and tool use, but also increased aggression levels in some cases. Puzzle feeders also increased time spent feeding and reduced inactive time in primates. For carnivores, prey simulation devices including lures, pulleys and bungees increased activity levels and behavioral diversity in felids, while decreasing pacing behavior and increasing walking in cougars, though tigers initially showed increased pacing when presented with carcasses on bungees. Alternative feeding methods like scattering food throughout enclosures increased exploratory behaviors and reduced abnormal behaviors and aggression in various primate species including chimpanzees and lemurs, while frozen food in ice decreased stereotypic behaviors and increased activity levels in bears and felids. These complex feeding interventions appear to generally enhance natural foraging behaviors and reduce inactivity, though some implementations may initially increase stress behaviors like pacing or aggression in certain individuals.",

Artificial rainfall simulation has proven effective, with studies in Germany and Austria demonstrating that simulating wet and dry seasons stimulated breeding and egg deposition (action 1872). Lighting variation is another approach, involving changes in UV percentage or gradients to simulate seasonal light changes, though one UK study found no difference in clutch size from UV boost treatments (action 1865). Pre-breeding cooling periods combined with other husbandry practices like allowing females to gain weight before breeding, separating sexes during non-breeding periods, providing mate choice, and playing recorded mating calls have been shown to increase breeding success (action 1864).

      "relevant_summary": "Research shows several food-based enrichment strategies are effective for increasing activity and reducing pacing in captive felids. Hiding food around enclosures (Action ID 1915) was found to significantly increase exploring and foraging behaviours while decreasing stereotypical pacing in leopard cats and black bears, and reducing daytime sleeping in Canadian lynx. Providing food on a random temporal schedule (Action ID 1904) reduced stereotypic pacing behaviors in tigers and cheetahs across multiple studies, while also increasing behavioral diversity in red foxes and alertness in black-footed cats. Using devices to simulate live prey including lure and pulley systems (Action ID 1927) increased activity levels and behavioral diversity in felids, though tigers initially showed increased pacing before behavior improved. Presenting food frozen in ice (Action ID 1923) decreased abnormal or stereotypic behaviors while increasing activity levels in felids. Presenting food inside objects like Boomer balls (Action ID 1924) also increased exploratory behaviors while decreasing stereotypic behaviors in bears. However, allocating fast days (Action ID 1906) was found to increase pacing behavior in large felids on non-feeding days, making it counterproductive for reducing stereotypic behaviors.",

Scattering food throughout enclosures increased feeding and exploratory behaviours in rhesus macaques, reduced aggression in lemurs, and increased foraging activity (Action ID 1315). Presenting whole foods instead of chopped foods increased both consumption and time spent feeding in macaques (Action ID 1323). Hiding food in containers such as boxes and bags, particularly when combined with browse items, increased foraging behaviours and activity levels in lemurs (Action ID 1316). Providing cut branches (browse) enabled captive gorillas to demonstrate natural processing skills similar to wild counterparts (Action ID 1332). Puzzle feeders increased foraging time and reduced inactive time, though they also increased aggression in some cases (Action ID 1318).",

      "relevant_summary": "Beyond dietary changes, several environmental and social husbandry actions can promote amphibian breeding success in captive settings. These include providing specific enclosure furniture such as rotting logs, hollow bamboo pipes, and varied substrates to create calling sites and breeding areas [1876]. Simulating seasonal changes through temperature variation (dropping from 20-24°C to 17°C) has been shown to stimulate breeding [1864], as has varying artificial rainfall to simulate wet and dry seasons [1872]. Managing social dynamics through allowing female mate choice [1882], separating sexes during non-breeding periods [1880], and playing recorded breeding calls to simulate the breeding season [1881] are also effective strategies. Using surrogate species to refine husbandry techniques before working with target critically endangered species has proven beneficial [1862]. Hormonal treatments can also be used to induce sperm and egg release, with 30-71% of females producing viable eggs following treatment [883]. A combined approach incorporating multiple factors - such as pre-breeding cooling periods, allowing females to gain weight before breeding, providing mate choice, playing recorded calls, and using enclosures with proper furniture and flowing water - has shown increased breeding success and larger clutch sizes [1864, 1882, 1880, 1881].",
