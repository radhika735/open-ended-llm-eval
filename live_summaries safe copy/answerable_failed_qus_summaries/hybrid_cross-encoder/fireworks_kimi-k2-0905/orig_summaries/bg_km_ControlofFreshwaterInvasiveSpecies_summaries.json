Additionally, temperatures of 36\\u00b0C or higher killed Asian clams within four days in controlled laboratory conditions (action ID: 1116). For Ponto-Caspian gammarids, a UK laboratory study demonstrated that heating water to temperatures above 36\\u00b0C killed all shrimps after 15 minutes exposure, while temperatures exceeding 43\\u00b0C caused immediate death (action ID: 1092). Regarding salinity control for gammarids, mixed results were observed: one replicated laboratory study (one controlled) in Canada and the UK found that increasing salinity levels killed the majority of invasive shrimp within five hours, while another study found that increased salinity did not kill invasive killer shrimp (action ID: 1091).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"1115\",\n    \"1116\",\n    \"1092\",\n    \"1091\"\n  ]\n}"

Evidence indicates that trapping with food bait (tinned meat) is more effective than using pheromones or unbaited traps, with over half of all crayfish caught in food-baited traps (Action 1029). Creating physical barriers using concrete dams specifically designed with features to prevent crayfish from crawling over them has been shown to effectively contain population spread upstream in Spain (Action 1037). Combining trapping with predator encouragement has demonstrated significant population reductions - a Swiss study found that introducing predators combined with trapping significantly reduced crayfish populations, and an Italian study showed this combination was more effective than predation alone (Action 1031). Natural predation by eels has been shown to reduce crayfish populations in Italian studies, and pike also predate on red swamp crayfish according to French research (Action 1030). Sterilization of males through X-ray exposure reduced offspring production by 43% in laboratory studies (Action 1032). However, no evidence was found for the effectiveness of draining waterways (Action 1034), electrofishing (Action 1035), or removal of food sources (Action 1033).",
