Research shows that created ponds are highly effective, with 28 studies demonstrating that amphibians consistently use newly created ponds, with 64-100% of ponds being used and 64-68% supporting reproduction. Created wetlands have also proven successful, with 15 studies showing they support similar or higher numbers of amphibian species compared to natural wetlands. Pond restoration has yielded positive results in 15 studies, with restoration increasing amphibian species numbers and maintaining breeding populations. Ditch management under agri-environment schemes significantly increases amphibian species abundance and numbers compared to conventional management. Key factors affecting success include pond permanence, vegetation cover, surrounding landscape characteristics, distance to existing water bodies, and presence of fish. While pollution prevention and buffer strips are recommended practices, there is currently insufficient evidence to assess their specific effectiveness for amphibians in agricultural settings.",

Creating refuge areas in aquatic habitats (Action 813), adding woody debris to ponds (Action 814), and encouraging aquatic plant growth as refuge against fish predation (Action 796) are additional interventions available, though no studies have yet tested their effectiveness. Leaving coarse woody debris in forests provides habitat features, with studies showing juvenile amphibian survival was higher in wood piles compared to open areas within clearcuts (Action 843).

Pond creation and restoration have been fundamental, with studies showing that pond creation along with other interventions significantly increased natterjack toad populations or maintained/increased populations at 75% of sites (Action 866). Created ponds showed lower tadpole mortality from desiccation compared to natural ponds, though higher predation mortality (Action 866). Translocation efforts have established breeding populations at 30-70% of sites, with re-establishing toads on dune or saltmarsh habitat proving more successful than on heathland (Action 859). Population increases were particularly observed with replicated translocations of wild rather than captive-bred toads (Action 859). Adding lime to reduce water acidification showed mixed results - while it helped establish translocated populations and increased species-specific habitat management effectiveness (Action 748), it also caused high tadpole mortality and pond abandonment in some cases (Action 748). Habitat management including reintroduction of grazing helped maintain or increase natterjack toad populations, with pond restoration combined with terrestrial habitat management maintaining or increasing populations (Actions 780, 878).",

    "relevant_summary": "Captive breeding programs for amphibians show varied success across different groups, with frogs being the most extensively studied. For frogs (action 835), 23 of 33 studies found successful egg production in captivity by captive-bred females, though 7 studies showed mixed results with 17-50% of populations reproducing successfully. Seventeen studies successfully raised captive-bred frogs to various life stages, with egg hatching rates of 30-88%, metamorphosis survival of 75%, froglet survival of 17-51%, and 50-90% reaching adulthood. Hormone treatments (action 883) proved effective for inducing reproduction, with 9 of 10 studies showing increased sperm production in males and females producing viable eggs in 30-71% of cases. However, success varied by species, hormone type, dosage, and treatment combinations.\n\nFor salamanders (action 838), 4 of 6 studies achieved successful egg production in captivity, with some captive-bred females reproducing. Larval development, body condition, and survival varied based on water temperature, density, and whether animals were raised in laboratory versus semi-natural conditions. Environmental factors proved critical across groups, with breeding success depending on temperature simulation, wet/dry season replication, and appropriate enclosure furniture including calling sites and breeding areas (actions 835, 1876).\n\nRelease outcomes showed mixed results (action 871), with 41% of captive-bred amphibian release programs demonstrating multi-generational breeding in the wild, 29% showing some breeding evidence, and 12% showing survival after release. Key challenges include species-specific differences in reproduction difficulty, dependency on environmental conditions like temperature and seasonal changes, and low survival rates in some populations. Head-starting programs (action 881) showed promise, with 6 of 10 studies establishing breeding populations or increasing existing populations, though adult survival varied from 1-17% over four years in some cases.",

Environmental factors proved critical across groups, with breeding success depending on temperature simulation, wet/dry season replication, and appropriate enclosure furniture including calling sites and breeding areas (actions 835, 1876).\\n\\nRelease outcomes showed mixed results (action 871), with 41% of captive-bred amphibian release programs demonstrating multi-generational breeding in the wild, 29% showing some breeding evidence, and 12% showing survival after release. Key challenges include species-specific differences in reproduction difficulty, dependency on environmental conditions like temperature and seasonal changes, and low survival rates in some populations. Head-starting programs (action 881) showed promise, with 6 of 10 studies establishing breeding populations or increasing existing populations, though adult survival varied from 1-17% over four years in some cases.\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"835\",\n    \"838\",\n    \"871\",\n    \"883\",\n    \"834\",\n    \"1862\",\n    \"1876\",\n    \"1882\",\n    \"1865\",\n    \"881\",\n    \"876\"\n  ]\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "Based on evidence from multiple studies across different countries, several key factors significantly influence the success or failure of amphibian colonization and breeding in newly created ponds. Pond permanence is a critical factor, with studies showing that numbers of species colonizing created ponds can be similar or lower depending on the permanence of created water bodies. Fish presence represents a major negative factor, with research demonstrating that draining ponds to eliminate fish significantly increases numbers of amphibian species, and pond drying to eliminate fish increases breeding success of frogs and newts. Vegetation cover and shading also play important roles, with canopy removal affecting breeding success of different species differently - it enabled translocated garlic toads to establish breeding populations, but did not increase hatching success of spotted salamanders in another study. Landscape context matters significantly, with pond age, vegetation cover, surrounding landscape characteristics, distance to existing ponds, and permanence all affecting amphibian use, colonization, and reproductive success in created ponds. Water level management is crucial, with studies showing that maintaining appropriate water levels enabled successful breeding by species like dusky gopher frogs, while draining ponds in particular seasons significantly increased abundance and species numbers. The success rates for amphibian establishment are highly variable, with studies reporting that amphibians established stable breeding populations in 50-100% of created ponds, used 64-100% of created ponds for reproduction, but individual species success rates varied dramatically from 2-62% depending on the species. Pond creation alone may not guarantee success, as some studies found that populations in created ponds were less stable than natural populations.",

However, six studies reported that specific fungicides caused death or other negative side effects in amphibians. Temperature treatment has also shown promise, with four of five studies (including four replicated, controlled studies) in Australia, Switzerland and the USA finding that increasing enclosure or water temperature to 30-37°C for over 16 hours cured frogs and toads of chytridiomycosis. Antibacterial treatments showed mixed results - two studies in New Zealand and Australia found that treatment with chloramphenicol antibiotic ointment or solution cured green tree frogs and Archey's frogs, while another study found that trimethoprim-sulfadiazine increased survival time but did not cure blue-and-yellow poison dart frogs. Treatments using antifungal skin bacteria or peptides showed limited effectiveness, with three of four studies finding no reduction in infection rate or death, though three studies did find reduced weight loss. Immunization with formalin-killed chytrid fungus did not significantly reduce infection rate or mortality in mountain yellow-legged frogs. A field study in Mallorca found that treating wild midwife toads with fungicide along with pond drying reduced infection levels but did not eradicate chytridiomycosis.",

Another study in Taiwan found that halting pesticide use along with habitat management increased a population of Taipei frogs (Action 832). Creating wetland habitats has been extensively studied, with fifteen investigations showing that created wetlands can support similar or higher numbers of amphibian species and abundance compared to natural wetlands, though success depends on factors such as wetland design, vegetation, water levels, surrounding habitat, fish presence, and distance to source wetlands (Action 880). However, one replicated, controlled study in the USA found that planting riparian buffer strips along streams did not increase amphibian abundance, numbers of species, or the ratio of adults to tadpoles (Action 819). Additionally, there is currently no evidence available for the effectiveness of preventing pollution from agricultural lands or sewage treatment facilities entering watercourses (Action 802), or establishing riparian buffers to reduce pollutants reaching water bodies (Action 2882) specifically for amphibian populations.",

Pond creation has been extensively studied with 28 investigations showing amphibians used created ponds, with 64-100% of ponds used for reproduction and establishment of stable populations in 50-100% of cases. Pond restoration showed mixed results, with some studies finding increased amphibian species numbers and breeding success, while others found no increase in populations. Wetland restoration and creation also proved effective, with 89% of cases showing similar or higher amphibian abundance compared to natural wetlands, and 4-15 amphibian species colonizing created wetlands. Engaging landowners and volunteers in aquatic habitat management increased natterjack toad and Taipei frog populations, with programs restoring up to 1,023 ponds or over 11,500 km2 of habitat. Habitat connectivity is also important, as retaining native vegetation corridors maintained populations of eight of 13 frog species over 20 years. Success of these interventions depends on factors such as pond permanence, vegetation cover, distance to existing ponds, and surrounding landscape characteristics.",

One found that numbers of species were similar or lower depending on the permanence of created water bodies. One found that populations in created ponds were less stable.\\nOne review and two replicated, before-and-after studies in Denmark and the USA found that amphibians established stable populations in 50\\u2013100% of created ponds. Six replicated studies (including one randomized study) in France, the Netherlands, UK and USA found that amphibians used 64\\u2013100%\\u00a0and reproduced in 64\\u201368% of created ponds, or used 8\\u2013100% and reproduced in 2\\u201362% depending on species. One review and 15 studies (including 12 replicated studies, one of which was randomized) in Europe and the USA found that created ponds were used or colonized by up to 15 naturally colonizing species, up to 10 species that reproduced, as well as by captive-bred amphibians. Five replicated studies (including three site comparison studies) in Denmark, Estonia, France, Italy and the USA found that pond creation, and restoration in three cases, maintained and increased amphibian populations or increased numbers of species.\\nSeven studies (including one review) in Austria, Denmark, Poland, the Netherlands and USA found that use or colonization of or reproductive success in created ponds was affected by pond age, permanence, vegetation cover, surrounding landscape, distance to existing ponds and presence of fish.\"\n}"

For antifungal treatments against chytridiomycosis, 12 of 16 studies found that treatments cured or increased survival of amphibians, with 6 of 8 studies finding itraconazole specifically effective at curing chytridiomycosis. However, 6 studies also found that specific fungicides caused death or other negative side effects in amphibians. Hormone treatments have been used to induce sperm and egg release in amphibians. For chemical pollution prevention, one study found that halting pesticide use along with habitat management increased a population of Taipei frogs. Salt treatment showed benefits, with one study finding that adding salt to ponds kept green and golden bell frogs free of chytridiomycosis for at least six months. However, treating wild midwife toads with fungicide along with pond drying reduced infection levels but did not eradicate chytridiomycosis. Studies on pesticide reduction showed that agricultural areas managed with reduced or no pesticide, herbicide, or fertilizer input generally had greater species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths compared to areas with conventional chemical applications.",
