Hedgerow management shows benefits when trimming is less frequent: hedges trimmed â‰¥3 years prior had more bat species and higher activity for two of eight species compared to recently trimmed hedges (action 1943). Creating tree plantations on agricultural land showed no difference in species richness, with two of three studies finding no difference in bat activity, though plantations next to remnant vegetation had higher activity than isolated plantations (action 958). Agri-environment schemes showed no significant benefits, with two of three studies finding no difference in overall bat activity compared to conventional farms, and one study finding lower activity on scheme farms (action 962). Creating artificial water sources such as farm ponds and reservoirs can increase bat activity compared to surrounding habitats (action 959).

Benefits include increased occupancy over time, with nine studies finding bat box use increased 2-10 times up to 10 years after installation (Action ID: 1024). However, there are significant limitations and negative impacts. Common pipistrelle bats used heated bat boxes at only one of seven sites, and none were used by maternity colonies (Action ID: 2052). Displaced bats often fail to use provided alternatives - two studies found bats displaced from buildings did not use any of 43 bat houses of four different designs or 12 heated bat boxes of one design (Action ID: 1024). When alternative roosts are created within developments, two studies found bats did not use any of the alternative roosts provided in bat houses or purpose-built bat walls after exclusion from buildings, and a UK review found new bat boxes/lofts built to replace destroyed roosts were four times less likely to be used by returning bats than roosts retained during development (Action ID: 949). Success rates vary considerably, with 22 studies finding bats occupying less than half of bat boxes provided (0-49%) while nine studies found bats occupying more than half (54-100%) (Action ID: 1024).",

One study in the UK\\u00a0found higher occupancy rates in concrete than wooden bat boxes. One study in the USA\\u00a0found that Indiana bats used rocket boxes more than wooden bat boxes or bark-mimic roosts. One study in Spain\\u00a0found that more bats occupied bat boxes that had two compartments than one compartment in the breeding season. One study in Lithuania\\u00a0found that bat breeding colonies occupied standard and four/five chamber bat boxes and individuals occupied flat bat boxes. Four studies in the USA, UK, Spain\\u00a0and Australia\\u00a0found bats selecting four of nine, three of five, three of four and one of five bat box designs.

Action 2331 found that farms using few or no chemicals had different bat species compositions and higher overall bat activity than those using high chemical inputs. Action 2013, encompassing broader research on reducing pesticide, herbicide or fertiliser use, found that four studies across Mexico, Portugal, Germany and Columbia showed positive effects: farms with few or no chemical inputs had higher bat abundance and diversity than those with high chemical inputs, and bats in chemical-free areas had better body condition.

    "relevant_summary": "During building developments, several actions can be taken to mitigate disturbance and loss of bat roosts. Retaining existing bat roosts and access points within developments has shown positive results, with three studies finding that bats continued to use retained roosts after development, and retained roosts were more likely to be used than newly created ones (Action 947). Creating alternative bat roosts within developments has been attempted in eleven studies, with mixed results - while some bats used purpose-built roosts after original roosts were destroyed, new bat boxes/lofts were four times less likely to be used by returning bats than retained roosts (Action 949). Relocating access points to bat roosts within developments showed variable outcomes, with fewer bats using relocated access points in some cases (Action 946). Legal protection during development has been implemented, though one review found that 68% of roosts were still destroyed despite licensing requirements (Action 1935). Excluding bats from roosts during building work did not change roost switching frequency or foraging behavior of soprano pipistrelle colonies (Action 1930). No studies were found evaluating the effectiveness of training for conservationists and developers (Action 997), educating homeowners about bat laws (Action 1931), installing sound barriers (Action 2023), or sound-proofing insulation (Action 1929).",

For roosting habitat, multiple approaches are available. Providing bat boxes has been extensively studied, with 41 of 43 studies finding that bats used bat boxes installed in various urban settings including buildings, bridges, and urban areas (Action 1024).

Creating artificial hollows and cracks in trees can provide natural roosting opportunities, with one study finding that eight of 16 artificial hollows cut into trees were used by roosting long-eared bats (Action 2047). Retaining veteran and standing dead trees as natural roosting sites is also recommended, though this approach lacks direct study evidence (Action 993).

Retaining veteran and standing dead trees as natural roosting sites is also recommended, though this approach lacks direct study evidence (Action 993). Additional urban habitat protection measures include increasing semi-natural habitat within gardens (Action 1933) and protecting greenfield sites or undeveloped land in urban areas (Action 1934), though these actions also lack direct evaluation studies.\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"954\",\n    \"953\",\n    \"1024\",\n    \"2047\",\n    \"993\",\n    \"1933\",\n    \"1934\"\n  ]\n}"

Bat boxes have been studied most extensively across 44 studies, with 72 bat species using them worldwide, though only 18 species commonly used them and 31 species used them as maternity roosts. Black bat boxes were found to be used more than grey, white, or wooden boxes. Two-compartment bat boxes were preferred over single compartment designs during breeding season. Concrete bat boxes had higher occupancy rates than wooden ones. Rocket boxes were preferred by Indiana bats over conventional wooden bat boxes. Artificial caves and hibernacula created in the UK and Germany were used by up to four bat species, with one UK study showing bat usage increased over nine years. Artificial tree hollows and cracks carved into trees in Australia were used by long-eared bats, with eight of 16 hollows being occupied. Spaces created in road bridges and culverts in the USA successfully recolonized by bats in similar or greater numbers at four of eight sites. Bat box placement also affected effectiveness, with boxes on buildings showing higher occupancy than those on trees. However, some studies found displaced bats did not use provided bat boxes, and heated bat boxes showed limited success with common pipistrelles and Natterer's bats.",

Position factors include: orientation and sunlight exposure significantly affect occupancy, with some studies finding preferences for certain orientations (1024); height affects occupancy in some locations (1024); bat boxes on buildings have higher occupancy than those on trees (1024); and boxes are more likely to be occupied when installed in areas where bats previously roosted (1024). Temperature management is also important, with studies showing more bats in artificial roosts after modifications to reduce internal temperatures (2052) and heated boxes generally having lower occupancy rates (2052).

One study in the UK\\u00a0found higher occupancy rates in concrete than wooden bat boxes. One study in the USA\\u00a0found that Indiana bats used rocket boxes more than wooden bat boxes or bark-mimic roosts. One study in Spain\\u00a0found that more bats occupied bat boxes that had two compartments than one compartment in the breeding season. One study in Lithuania\\u00a0found that bat breeding colonies occupied standard and four/five chamber bat boxes and individuals occupied flat bat boxes. Four studies in the USA, UK, Spain\\u00a0and Australia\\u00a0found bats selecting four of nine, three of five, three of four and one of five bat box designs. One study in the UK\\u00a0found that different bat box designs were used by different species.

Restoring bat foraging habitat at ex-quarry sites demonstrated that gravel-sand pits had higher overall bat activity 10 years after restoration compared to before or during quarrying. Creating artificial hollows and cracks in trees for roosting bats proved successful, with 8 of 16 artificial hollows being used by roosting long-eared bats. Managing microclimate of artificial bat roosts increased bat numbers in modified roosts with reduced internal temperatures. Creating artificial caves or hibernacula also showed positive results, with artificial hibernacula being used by up to four bat species and increasing bat numbers over nine years.",

    "relevant_summary": "One study found that maintaining the microclimate in closed/abandoned mines can be effective - modifying the microclimate by closing a man-made entrance resulted in a greater number of bats hibernating within the mine (Action ID: 1964). Installing and maintaining gates at mine entrances to restrict public access has been extensively studied across nine studies in the USA and Australia. The evidence shows mixed results: fewer bat species and fewer bats overall were found in mines after gates were installed, though some locations maintained stable or increased bat activity. Bat behavior was affected, with bats circling more and entering mines less after gates were installed, and up to 7% of bats collided with gates (Action ID: 1963). Other proposed conservation actions include excluding bats from roosts prior to mine reclamation (Action ID: 1961), providing artificial subterranean bat roosts to replace roosts in reclaimed mines (Action ID: 974), relocating bats from reclaimed mines to alternative subterranean roost sites (Action ID: 975), reopening entrances to closed mines and making them suitable for roosting bats (Action ID: 1965), and retaining access points for bats following mine closures (Action ID: 1962).
