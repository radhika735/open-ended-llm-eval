Herbicide application sometimes increases native plant species cover but can have variable effects on individual heathland species abundance.\n\n**Herbicide combined with seeding or removal**: Applying herbicide along with sowing shrubland plant seeds or manual removal of plants shows effectiveness, with studies reporting increased shrub seedlings, higher native grass and forb cover, and reduced non-native grass cover compared to untreated areas.\n\n**Prescribed burning**: Research indicates mixed effectiveness for grass control - one UK study found burning did not reduce purple moor grass cover but did reduce common heather cover. Burning initially reduces vegetation height, which recovers over time.\n\n**Grazing management**: Grazing or altering livestock shows mixed effects, with studies reporting variable responses in grass species like wavy-hair grass, common heather, and cross-leaved heath.\n\n**Strip turf removal**: Cutting and removing turf increases heathland plant numbers and can enhance presence of heathland plants while reducing non-heathland species presence.\n\n**Combined burning and grazing**: Using prescribed burning in combination with grazing shows varied effects on vegetation composition and structure in shrubland habitats.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from action documents, several interventions have been studied for restoring degraded shrubland habitats. Planting turf from intact heathland sites has shown positive results, with two randomized, controlled studies in the UK finding that this technique increased the abundance or cover of heathland species and increased seedling abundance for a majority of heathland plant species. Topsoil removal combined with planting or seeding has also demonstrated effectiveness, with replicated, controlled studies showing that this approach increased cover of heathland plants, heather and gorse, while reducing cover of perennial rye-grass. \n\nFor shrubland restoration more broadly, studies have found that restored areas can achieve similar species richness and abundance compared to undisturbed areas for various taxa. A replicated, controlled study in Mexico found that restored shrubland had similar reptile and amphibian species richness but higher lizard abundance compared to unrestored areas. Similarly, site comparison studies in the USA and Mexico found that mammal species richness in restored desert scrub or shrubland was similar to that in undisturbed areas.\n\nHowever, some interventions showed mixed or limited results. Simple topsoil removal without additional interventions did not consistently increase heather cover or heathland species richness. Spreading clippings of heathland plants showed variable outcomes, with some studies finding increases in heather seedlings but not in other heathland species. Adding sulphur to soil alongside planting or seeding generally did not significantly improve outcomes. A study from the Netherlands found that heathlands restored by topsoil removal had lower butterfly species richness compared to the surrounding landscape, although abundance was higher in areas where heather litter had also been spread.",

    "relevant_summary": "Altering livestock grazing practices in shrublands produces varied effects on vegetation. Ceasing livestock grazing through fencing exclusion generally increases shrub cover and biomass, with studies showing enhanced shrub abundance and increased height of individual heather plants. However, some studies found mixed or no effects on shrub cover. When grazing pressure is modified, such as through changes in grazing intensity, results show variable impacts - some studies found lighter grazing increased vegetation cover while others observed no clear effects. Changing the type of livestock can lead to mixed effects on shrub cover. The specific effects on shrubland vegetation depend on factors such as the baseline grazing intensity, the type of alteration implemented (cessation, modification, or livestock type change), and local environmental conditions. These findings indicate that while grazing alterations can influence shrubland vegetation, the outcomes are context-dependent and may vary by specific shrub species and ecosystem characteristics.",

Cutting has been shown to increase the abundance of butterflies including high brown fritillary and small pearl-bordered fritillary. Herbicide application can effectively reduce grass cover and increase cover of heathland species, although results are mixed for some grass species. Livestock grazing management, including rotational grazing, can control vegetation succession - rotational grazing has been found to increase species richness of butterflies and burnet moths compared to continuous grazing. Increased livestock numbers can reduce dwarf shrub cover and decline heather cover while increasing grass cover and plant species numbers. These mechanical and grazing approaches provide fire-free alternatives for maintaining open shrubland habitats and controlling woody plant encroachment.",

One study found that mechanical cutting over 13 years resulted in higher abundance of Karner blue butterflies compared to rotational burning or unburned refuges.\n\n2. **Prescribed fire** - Using prescribed fire to maintain disturbance in grasslands and shrublands has been extensively studied. Evidence shows varied effects on butterfly abundance, with some species (like heath fritillary adults and Fender's blue caterpillars) having higher abundance after burning, while others (like Brenton blue butterfly and regal fritillary) showed lower abundance. Reptile studies indicate mixed effects on species richness and abundance.\n\n3. **Combined approaches** - Using prescribed burning in combination with vegetation cutting has shown benefits for reptile populations, with some studies finding increased abundance of lizards and skinks compared to single management methods.\n\n4. **Manual vegetation control** - Removing midstorey and ground-level vegetation through methods like chaining and cutting has been found to benefit some bird species, with grassland-specialist species present on managed sites, though effects vary by species.\n\nThese methods provide disturbance similar to grazing by removing vegetation, creating open areas, and maintaining habitat structure, though specific outcomes depend on the method used and the target species or habitat goals.",

A combination of cutting/mowing followed by sowing shrubland seeds increased shrub seedling abundance and reduced grass cover according to one randomized controlled study. Strip turf removal has been studied in the UK and showed increased heathland plant presence while decreasing non-heathland plant presence in one controlled study. Prescribed burning to control grass has shown mixed results - one replicated controlled study found it reduced vegetation height initially (though this recovered over time) but did not reduce purple moor grass cover. Mechanical methods including rotovating (mechanical soil cultivation) showed varying effectiveness, with one controlled study indicating that mowing followed by rotovating increased heathland plant species in one of two sites, while rotovating alone did not alter plant presence compared to other methods. The impacts of these methods vary, with some showing limited effectiveness for grass control while potentially affecting other vegetation components differently.",

However, some studies showed increases in heather seedlings and variable responses across sites. For grassland management (action 3962), increasing grazing intensity or cutting frequency reduced butterfly and moth abundance compared to lightly grazed or ungrazed areas, with intensive grazing sites having lower species richness.

    "relevant_summary": "Evidence from multiple studies shows that manipulating livestock density has significant effects on shrubland plant communities. Increasing livestock density generally reduces shrub cover, particularly ericaceous shrubs like common heather, while increasing grass species cover. Studies from the UK, Netherlands, and France found that high livestock density areas had lower dwarf shrub and ericaceous shrub cover but higher grass and sedge cover compared to ungrazed areas. However, increasing livestock numbers can increase the number of heather seedlings and plant species diversity in some cases. Reducing livestock density or excluding large herbivores produces opposite effects: removing grazing animals increased shrub cover and allowed common heather to increase in height and cover. Using fences to exclude deer increased shrub height but not necessarily shrub cover. The effects appear to be species-specific, with ericaceous shrubs being more sensitive to grazing pressure than non-ericaceous shrubs. Vegetation height generally decreases with increased grazing intensity, and plant species richness can be higher in grazed versus ungrazed areas, though results vary by location and specific grazing management approach.",

For most infrastructure-related actions targeting shrublands specifically, no studies have been found that evaluate their effectiveness. For actions directly addressing transportation infrastructure, no studies were found evaluating the effects of maintaining habitat corridors over or under roads (action 1617), creating buffer zones beside roads (action 1618), or maintaining habitat corridors in developed areas (action 1543) on shrublands. Similarly, no studies have evaluated removing residential or commercial development to benefit shrublands (action 1542). Regarding recreation infrastructure, one before-and-after trial in Australia found that closing paths did not alter shrub cover but did increase the number of plant species in alpine shrubland (action 1619). For wildlife corridor management in residential areas, one study in Botswana found that retained wildlife corridors in residential areas were used by 19 mammal species, including African elephants (action 2354). Research on roadside verges in other habitats has shown that restored species-rich grasslands with native wildflowers can support higher species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths compared to non-native vegetation (action 3854). Overall, the systematic evidence base for conservation actions to mitigate infrastructure impacts on shrublands is currently lacking for most intervention types.",
