Reported negative impacts included population declines of Tana River red colobus and crested mangabeys in Kenya despite a tourism project; increased stress in Tibetan macaques under an intensive tourism regime that included provisioning and range restrictions, with infant mortality reaching 100% in some years; and declines in population size and/or body size and group size for two lemur species in Madagascar, although one lemur species increased (1512).

Additional community-oriented ideas with no direct evidence found in the documents include employing hunters in conservation roles (1484), providing alternative livelihoods such as fish- or domestic meat farms (1483), integrating religion/local taboos into conservation education (1574), and informing hunters about disease risks from wild primate meat (1480).",
