For nutrients, Mediterranean evidence was mixed for both practices: under no-tillage, studies from Italy, Spain, and Portugal found more nitrogen in some comparisons and less in others, and phosphorus was sometimes higher and sometimes lower; under reduced tillage, studies from Italy and Spain reported more nitrogen or phosphorus in some comparisons, with other studies in Spain and Syria finding similar or lower nitrogen in some cases [1369, 1371]. Soil biological responses were also mixed but frequently positive: no-tillage increased microbial biomass in some studies from Italy and Spain, with other Spanish studies finding similar or lower biomass; reduced tillage similarly showed increases in microbial biomass in some studies from Italy and Spain, with some Spanish and Syrian studies reporting similar or lower biomass [1369, 1371]. Soil structure tended to improve under both systems in Mediterranean contexts but with variability: no-tillage commonly produced more stable soils in Spain (with some mixed results), while reduced tillage in Spain increased aggregate water-stability or large aggregates in some comparisons, with other studies reporting similar or lower stability [1369, 1371]. Regarding water-related soil health indicators, no-tillage in Spain often increased soil water content and improved water-use efficiency for barley in some comparisons; reduced tillage in Egypt and Spain often increased soil water content and improved crop water-use efficiency in Spain and Turkey, though Lebanon studies reported lower water content under both practices in some comparisons [1384, 1386]. Greenhouse gas fluxes relevant to soil processes showed mixed outcomes in Mediterranean studies for both practices, with some Spanish and Italian studies finding higher or lower CO2 under no-tillage, and Spanish studies reporting higher, lower, or similar CO2 and N2O under reduced tillage [1369, 1371]. Overall, Mediterranean evidence indicates both no-tillage and reduced tillage can improve aspects of soil health relative to conventional tillage, with direction and magnitude varying by indicator and study [1369, 1371, 1384, 1386].",
