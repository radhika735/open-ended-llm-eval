Mixed organic–inorganic amendments raised soil organic carbon and nutrients in several trials, with manure alone also boosting carbon; one trial found inconsistent nutrient effects [902]; incorporating plant material increased soil carbon across multiple studies and sometimes increased aggregate size, and straw combined with NPK raised carbon [910]; retaining residues increased soil organic carbon and nitrogen, sometimes only when fertilizer was applied [907]. Straw addition reduced soil loss in one study, with mixed erosion effects depending on soil type [910]; residue retention reduced water runoff, increased water storage and reduced erosion, though some soil physical properties showed mixed responses and tillage influenced erosion when residues were removed [907]; mixed amendments reduced the size of cracks in dry soil compared to inorganic fertilizer alone or no fertilizer [902]. Nitrogen levels rose with compost or straw in several studies, and straw incorporation reduced nitrate leaching, although processed wastes showed mixed nutrient results and site effects were mixed in some comparisons [910]. Yields increased with mixed manure–inorganic amendments for maize [902]; barley yield rose with straw, and earlier incorporation of crop remains increased grain yields in one trial [910]; retaining residues increased yields, sometimes only with fertilizer and no-tillage [907]. Incorporating allelopathic plant remains sometimes reduced weeds relative to weeded or unweeded controls but effects varied by year, weed group or residue; suppression could be short-lived; crop growth was sometimes inhibited but could be mitigated by timing; yield effects were positive, negative or mixed, and profit exceeded unweeded but not weeded controls in one study [728]. In a salt marsh, adding organic alginate increased smooth cordgrass density and later plant height, while biomass after 52 weeks was similar to unamended plots [3244].",

Manure applications reduced soil loss and water runoff in at least one trial when combined with other treatments [911], and high rates of cotton gin compost with poultry manure improved soil structure and reduced soil loss in another trial [891]. Nutrient outcomes were mixed: several trials reported higher soil nitrogen and reduced nutrient loss with farmyard or poultry manure, with timing (e.g., winter vs autumn) affecting losses [911], while other evidence showed increased nitrate leaching or increased nutrient loss at high compost/manure rates [911, 891]. Soil carbon generally rose with manure additions, with multiple trials and a review finding higher soil organic carbon under manure or mixed organic–inorganic regimes [911, 902], though effects on overall organic matter were inconsistent, with some studies showing increases in organic matter and aggregation under manure/compost and others showing no change [911]. Mixed organic–inorganic amendments frequently increased microbial diversity/activity, nutrients, and organic carbon, and improved dry-soil physical condition compared with inorganic-only inputs [902]. Crop yields often improved with manure or compost, including gains when combined with cover crops or in mixed amendment systems [911, 902], and barley yield increased with added molasses in one trial [891].",

Comparing organic vs conventional farms, multiple studies found either no difference in bat species richness or higher richness on organic farms in some cases; bat activity was sometimes higher on organic farms (overall activity, feeding activity, Brazilian free‑tailed bat activity, and activity of some species), with other studies finding no difference; higher activity of Myotis spp. over water/rivers and for some species over organic fields was also reported [961]. For butterflies and moths, several studies found greater species richness and abundance on organic arable farms than conventional, sometimes increasing with time since conversion, while other studies found similar richness/abundance; in one before‑and‑after study, two butterfly species decreased after conversion alongside other management changes; effects varied with landscape context and farm age in multiple studies [3907]. For mammals, reducing pesticide/fertilizer use did not increase small mammal species richness or use of field margins in Argentina; one UK/Italy study found increased wood mouse abundance with organic farming, while another found no increase for European hare [2539].

In perennial systems, cover or ground covers increased microbial biomass in some or all comparisons across four replicated studies [2304]. Reduced tillage increased microbial biomass in many comparisons (11 of 15 studies), though some studies found less or no difference compared to conventional tillage [1371, 2307]. No-tillage sometimes increased, sometimes decreased, and sometimes did not change microbial biomass, though several studies reported higher microbial biomass without tillage [2306]. Grass buffer strips increased microbial biomass in one replicated, randomized, controlled study [2308]. Adding sewage sludge produced similar microbial biomass to controls in two studies [2303].
