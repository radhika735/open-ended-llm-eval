    "relevant_summary": "Studies evaluating habitat and farming management practices show mixed effects on bat populations in agricultural landscapes. Organic farming versus conventional farming has been the most studied practice, with twelve studies showing varied results: five of nine studies found no difference in overall bat activity between organic and non-organic farms, while four studies found higher overall bat activity, bat feeding activity, Brazilian free-tailed bat activity, and activity of four of seven bat species on organic farms compared to non-organic farms (action 961). Additionally, five of seven studies found no difference in bat species numbers between organic and non-organic farms, though two studies found more bat species on organic farms (action 961).\n\nHedge management shows some positive effects: hedges trimmed three or more years prior had more bat species and higher activity of two of eight bat species/species groups than hedges trimmed during the previous winter, though pipistrelle activity did not differ between hedges managed for wildlife on agri-environment scheme farms versus conventional farms (action 1943). Field size appears important, with agricultural landscapes containing smaller fields showing higher activity of six of seven bat species compared to landscapes with larger fields (action 1939).\n\nTree plantations on agricultural land showed limited benefits: three studies in Australia found no difference in bat species numbers or activity between agricultural areas with and without native tree plantations, though bat activity was higher in plantations next to remnant native vegetation than in isolated plantations (action 958). Artificial water sources generally benefit bats, with five studies showing bat activity was similar or higher over reservoirs, ponds, and drainage ditches compared to natural wetlands or surrounding agricultural areas (action 959).\n\nOther management practices showed no clear effects: pipistrelle activity did not differ between species-rich grassland created on agri-environment scheme farms versus conventional crop fields (action 2051), and pipistrelle activity did not differ along waterways with vegetation buffers on agri-environment scheme farms compared to conventional farms (action 2284).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence from studies evaluating artificial roosts for bats, several benefits have been documented. Bat boxes show positive uptake, with nine studies in Europe and the USA finding that the number of bats using bat boxes increased by 2-10 times up to 10 years after installation (Action 1024). Forty-one of 43 studies found that bats used bat boxes installed in various habitats including forests, woodlands, farmland, wetlands, and urban areas, with 72 bat species documented using bat boxes, though only 18 species commonly used them and 31 species used them as maternity roosts (Action 1024). For artificial caves or hibernacula, studies in the UK and Germany found that these structures were used by up to four bat species, with one UK study showing increasing use over nine consecutive years (Action 2049). One study in Spain found more bats in artificial roosts within buildings after modifications were made to reduce internal temperatures (Action 2052).\n\nHowever, significant negative impacts and limitations have also been documented. Multiple studies found low occupancy rates, with 22 studies showing bats occupying less than half of provided bat boxes (0-49% occupancy) (Action 1024). Studies of alternative roosts during development showed mixed results, with some bats using purpose-built roosts in lower numbers than original roosts, and one review finding that new bat boxes/lofts were four times less likely to be used by returning bats than roosts retained during development (Action 949). Failures in replacement roosts were documented, with one USA review finding that bat houses provided during bridge replacement were used by fewer Mexican free-tailed bats than the original roost at one site and were not used at all at three sites (Action 2942). Additionally, two studies found that bats displaced from buildings did not use any of 43 bat houses of four different designs or 12 heated bat boxes, and heated bat boxes were only used at one of seven sites with no use by maternity colonies (Actions 1024, 2052).",

Wetland restoration appears beneficial, with one study in the USA finding that restoring wetlands increased overall bat activity and restored wetlands had similar bat activity to undisturbed wetlands (Action 2036). For forest restoration, results are mixed - one study in Australia found that forests restored after mining had significantly higher or similar bat activity as unmined forests for five of seven bat species, while a study in Brazil found that a reforested area had significantly lower bat diversity than a native forest fragment (Action 2050). Grassland restoration showed neutral effects, with a UK study finding that pipistrelle activity did not differ between species-rich grassland created on agri-environment scheme farms and improved pasture or crop fields on conventional farms (Action 2051). Ex-quarry site restoration demonstrated positive results, with a French study finding that gravel-sand pits had higher overall bat activity 10 years after restoration than before or during quarrying (Action 2286). Urban habitat restoration showed promising results, with US and UK studies finding that restored forest fragments and biodiverse green roofs had greater bat activity than unrestored sites or conventional roofs (Action 954).",

For reducing agricultural chemicals, multiple studies demonstrate positive effects: four studies across Mexico, Portugal, Germany and Columbia found that reducing pesticide, herbicide and fertiliser use resulted in higher overall bat activity, different species compositions, higher diversity of insect-eating bat species, and better body condition in bats (Action 2013). Additional evidence from a Portugal study specifically showed that farms with few or no chemical inputs had higher overall bat activity and different bat species compositions compared to farms using high chemical inputs (Action 2331). Furthermore, twelve studies across Europe, USA, Canada and Chile on organic farming found mixed but generally positive results, with some studies showing higher bat activity, feeding activity, and species numbers on organic farms compared to conventional farms (Action 961). In contrast, there is no available evidence for the effectiveness of changing effluent treatments: no studies were found that evaluated the effects of changing effluent treatments used in agriculture and forestry on bat populations (Action 1016), and no evidence exists for preventing pollution from agricultural lands or sewage treatment facilities entering watercourses on wildlife populations (Action 802).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available studies, the documented effects of modifying subterranean bat roosts show both benefits and harms. Benefits include: maintaining microclimate in closed/abandoned mines resulted in greater numbers of bats hibernating within the mine (Action 1964). Installing cave gates to restrict public access led to more or similar numbers of bats in caves and bunkers after gates were installed in three of four studies, with population increases or decreased rates of decline for 13 of 20 Indiana bat colonies, and increased numbers of bats within caves after gated entrance sizes were increased (Action 999). Creating artificial caves or hibernacula showed that bats would use these structures, with one artificial hibernaculum showing increased use over nine years and use by up to four bat species (Action 2049). However, documented harms include: installing cave gates resulted in one study finding fewer bats in caves after installation, bats hibernating in a cave with a wall and gate lost more body mass than bats in unmodified caves, bats circled more and entered caves less after gates were installed, fewer bats flew through gates when bar spacing was reduced, and significantly fewer bats emerged from gated caves compared to fenced caves (Action 999). Installing mine gates showed similar negative effects with fewer bat species entering mines after gates were installed, fewer bats in mines or at mine entrances after gate installation, bats circling more and entering mines less, bats abandoning four mines with 'ladder' design gates, and up to 7% of bats colliding with mine gates (Action 1963). No studies were found evaluating the effectiveness or impacts of providing artificial subterranean roosts to replace those in reclaimed mines or disturbed caves, restoring microclimate in modified caves, relocating bats from reclaimed mines, reopening mine entrances, retaining bat access points to caves, or minimizing cave alterations for tourism.",

    "relevant_summary": "Several actions can be taken during building developments to mitigate disturbance and loss of bat roosts. Retaining existing bat roosts and access points within developments shows that four of nine bat roosts retained within developments were used as maternity colonies, with two cases showing similar or greater numbers of bats after development, and bats used two-thirds of retained and modified bat roosts after development (Action 947). Creating alternative bat roosts within developments has shown mixed results, with bat boxes or bat lofts being used by bats at 13-74% of development sites, though new bat boxes/lofts built to replace destroyed roosts were four times less likely to be used by returning bats than roosts retained during development (Action 949). Changing the timing of building work can be effective, as one study found that carrying out roofing work outside of the bat maternity season, along with retaining bat access points, resulted in a similar number of brown long-eared bats continuing to use a roost within an attic (Action 950). Relocating access points to bat roosts within developments has shown limited success, with one study finding fewer brown long-eared bats used a roost after access points were relocated, though the design of alternative access points affects success, with 'straight' designs being more effective than 'bend' designs for lesser horseshoe bats (Action 946). Legal protection of bats during development through licensing shows that 68% of roosts are destroyed during licensed activities, but 31-67% of compensation roosts provided under licence were used by bats (Action 1935). Managing the microclimate of artificial bat roosts can increase bat abundance, with one study finding more bats in artificial roosts after they were modified to reduce internal temperatures (Action 2052). Providing bat boxes shows widespread use across different habitats, with 72 bat species using bat boxes according to a worldwide review, though only 18 species commonly used them, and occupancy rates varied from 0-100% across studies (Action 1024).",

The other two studies in the USA\\u00a0and UK\\u00a0found that bats displaced from buildings did not use any of 43 bat houses of four different designs\\u00a0or 12 heated bat boxes of one design. One review\\u00a0of 109 studies across Europe, North America and Asia found that 72 bat species used bat boxes, although only 18 species commonly used them, and 31 species used them as maternity roosts. Twenty-two studies (including 17 replicated studies, one before-and-after study and two reviews)\\u00a0found bats occupying less than half of bat boxes provided (0\\u201349%).

One of two studies in Spain\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0found higher occupancy rates in larger bat boxes. One study in the USA\\u00a0found that bats used both resin and wood cylindrical bat boxes, but another study in the USA\\u00a0found that resin bat boxes became occupied more quickly than wood boxes. One study in the UK\\u00a0found higher occupancy rates in concrete than wooden bat boxes. One study in the USA\\u00a0found that Indiana bats used rocket boxes more than wooden bat boxes or bark-mimic roosts. One study in Spain\\u00a0found that more bats occupied bat boxes that had two compartments than one compartment in the breeding season. One study in Lithuania\\u00a0found that bat breeding colonies occupied standard and four/five chamber bat boxes and individuals occupied flat bat boxes. Four studies in the USA, UK, Spain\\u00a0and Australia\\u00a0found bats selecting four of nine, three of five, three of four and one of five bat box designs. One study in the UK\\u00a0found that different bat box designs were used by different species. One study in Costa Rica\\u00a0found that bat boxes simulating tree trunks were used by 100% of bats and in group sizes similar to natural roosts.\\nBat box position (11 studies): Three studies in Germany, Spain\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0found that bat box orientation and/or the amount of exposure to sunlight affected bat occupancy, and one study in Spain\\u00a0found that orientation did not have a significant effect on occupancy. Two studies in the UK\\u00a0and Italy\\u00a0found that bat box height affected occupancy, and two studies in Spain\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0found no effect of height.

One study in the USA\\u00a0found higher occupancy rates in areas where bats were known to roost prior to installing bat boxes.

Studies on unmown field margins found that pipistrelle activity did not differ between wildlife-managed margins on agri-environment scheme farms and conventional farm margins (action 1940). However, research on diverse plant species in field margins showed that soprano pipistrelle and barbastelle bat activity increased with greater plant species diversity within field margins, though this had no effect on common pipistrelle activity or occurrence of six bat species studied (action 1941). Hedge management provides stronger evidence, with studies showing that hedges trimmed ≥3 years prior had more bat species and higher activity of two of eight bat species compared to recently trimmed hedges (action 1943). However, wildlife-managed hedges on agri-environment schemes showed no difference in pipistrelle activity compared to conventional farm hedges (action 1943). Field size also appears important, with agricultural landscapes containing smaller fields showing higher activity of six of seven bat species compared to landscapes with larger fields (action 1939). No studies were found evaluating the effects of planting new hedges or creating linear habitat features specifically for bat populations (actions 1942, 2035).",

Green bridges show the highest effectiveness, with one study in the UK finding that a green bridge was used by 97% of bats crossing a road (Action 979). Overpasses show mixed effectiveness depending on design features. Three studies in Europe and Australia found that two or three bat species/species groups used overpasses, but up to three-quarters of bats still crossed the road below at traffic height or at other nearby locations (Action 977). However, design matters significantly - one study in the UK found that an overpass with planters was used by two-thirds of crossing bats, while an unvegetated overpass with a paved road over it was not used by crossing bats at all (Action 977). One study in Australia found that the same number of bat species were recorded at an overpass as in nearby forest and bushland (Action 977). Bat gantries or bat bridges appear to be the least effective option. Three studies in the UK and France found that fewer bats used bat gantries than crossed the road below at traffic height, with one bat gantry not being used at all (Action 978). In France, a temporary bat gantry was used by three bat species/species groups, but almost half of crossing bats flew over the road at other locations (Action 978).",

    "relevant_summary": "Several actions can be taken in urban environments to create or protect bat foraging and roosting habitat. For foraging habitat, creating or restoring bat foraging areas using green roofs has shown effectiveness, with studies finding greater bat activity over 'biodiverse' green roofs than conventional unvegetated roofs, and greater bat activity for three of five bat species over green roofs than over conventional unvegetated roofs (action 954). For roosting habitat, multiple approaches are available: providing bat boxes is widely studied with 41 of 43 studies finding that bats used bat boxes installed in various urban habitats including urban areas and buildings, bridges, and underpasses, with the number of bats using bat boxes increasing by 2-10 times up to 10 years after installation (action 1024). Creating artificial hollows and cracks in trees has been tested, with eight of 16 artificial hollows cut into trees being used by roosting long-eared bats (action 2047). Creating alternative bat roosts within developments shows mixed results, with bat boxes or bat lofts/barns being used by bats at 13-74% of development sites, though new bat boxes/lofts built to replace destroyed roosts were four times less likely to be used by returning bats than roosts retained during development (action 949). Creating spaces for roosting bats in road/railway bridges and culverts has proven effective, with spaces created in road bridges being recolonized by bats in similar or greater numbers to the original roosts at four of eight sites (action 1967). Creating artificial caves or hibernacula for bats shows promise, with artificial hibernacula being used by up to four bat species and the number of bats using an artificial hibernaculum increasing in each of nine years after it was built (action 2049). Managing the microclimate of artificial bat roosts can improve effectiveness, with one study finding more bats in two artificial roosts within buildings after they had been modified to reduce internal roost temperatures (action 2052).",

One review found that 72 bat species used bat boxes, though only 18 species commonly used them. However, 22 studies found bats occupying less than half of bat boxes provided (0-49%), while 9 studies found occupancy rates above 50% (54-100%).\n\nRegarding bat box design effectiveness, action 1024 found that black bat boxes were used more than grey, white or wooden boxes. Larger bat boxes showed higher occupancy rates in one of two studies. Resin and wood cylindrical boxes were both used, but resin boxes became occupied more quickly. Concrete boxes had higher occupancy rates than wooden boxes. Indiana bats used rocket boxes more than wooden bat boxes or bark-mimic roosts. Bat boxes with two compartments were used more than single-compartment boxes during breeding season.\n\nArtificial caves and hibernacula (action 2049) were used by up to four bat species, with one study finding increasing bat usage over nine years after construction. Purpose-built roosts within developments (action 949) showed mixed results - bat boxes or bat lofts/barns were used by bats at 13-74% of development sites. Three of five studies found bat colonies using purpose-built roosts in higher or similar numbers after original roosts were destroyed.\n\nManaging microclimate in artificial roosts (action 2052) showed that modifications to reduce internal roost temperatures resulted in more bats using two artificial roosts within buildings. However, heated bat boxes showed limited success, with use at only one of seven sites.\n\nBridge spaces for roosting bats (action 1967) showed that spaces created in road bridges to replace lost roosts were recolonized by bats in similar or greater numbers at four of eight sites.",

Design factors include: black bat boxes had higher usage than grey, white or wooden boxes (Action 1024). Larger bat boxes had higher occupancy rates in one of two studies (Action 1024). Concrete bat boxes had higher occupancy rates than wooden ones (Action 1024). Bat boxes with two compartments had higher occupancy than single compartments during breeding season (Action 1024). Indiana bats preferred rocket boxes over wooden bat boxes or bark-mimic roosts (Action 1024). Bat boxes simulating tree trunks achieved 100% occupancy with group sizes similar to natural roosts (Action 1024). For placement factors: bat box orientation and amount of sunlight exposure affected occupancy in three studies (Action 1024). Bat box height affected occupancy in two studies (Action 1024). Bat boxes on buildings had higher occupancy than those on trees in two studies (Action 1024). Higher occupancy was found in farm forestry sites compared to native forest, and in pine stands compared to mixed deciduous stands (Action 1024). Areas where bats were previously known to roost had higher occupancy rates (Action 1024). Installing a greater number of bat boxes across a site increased likelihood of occupancy (Action 1024). Temperature management also matters, as artificial roosts modified to reduce internal temperatures had increased bat numbers (Action 2052).",

Red lighting showed varied effects: it resulted in higher activity for one of three bat species groups compared to white or green lighting in the Netherlands, while in culverts it produced similar Daubenton's bat activity as white or green light. Additionally, more soprano pipistrelles emerged from roosts when lit with red light than with white light, but no difference was found between red and blue lights (Action 2021). In cave environments, both low intensity white lights and red lights resulted in fewer bat flights than full white lighting, though the number of bat movements was similar between all three light treatments (Action 1994). Studies also demonstrated species-specific responses to artificial lighting along commuting routes, with lesser horseshoe bats and myotis bats showing greater activity along unlit hedges than illuminated ones, while common and soprano pipistrelles and Nyctalus/Eptesicus species showed similar activity regardless of lighting conditions (Action 2017). Notably, no studies were found evaluating the effects of using 'warm white' rather than 'cool' LED lights on bat populations (Action 2020).",

Creating artificial caves or hibernacula has been evaluated in four studies from the UK and Germany, with findings showing that an artificial hibernaculum's use by bats increased in each of nine years after construction, and artificial hibernacula were used by up to four bat species (Action 2049). Installing and maintaining gates at mine entrances to restrict public access has mixed effects based on nine studies from the USA and Australia - while gates can protect sites from disturbance, they may reduce bat species richness and abundance, with gate design affecting bat presence differently across species (Action 1963). Additional approaches include providing artificial subterranean bat roosts to replace roosts in reclaimed mines (Action 974) and in disturbed caves (Action 1005), retaining access points for bats following mine closures (Action 1962), retaining bat access points to caves (Action 1990), and restoring and maintaining microclimate in modified caves (Action 1001), though these latter actions have not yet been evaluated in studies.",

    "relevant_summary": "Several conservation actions can be implemented to mitigate the impacts of mining operations on bats, though scientific evidence for their effectiveness varies. Installing and maintaining gates at mine entrances to restrict public access has been studied in nine studies across the USA and Australia (Action 1963). These studies found that gates can reduce the number of bat species entering mines and result in fewer bats at mine entrances, though bat activity remained stable or increased at five of seven gated mines. Gate design and installation timing affect success, with some bats abandoning mines with 'ladder' design gates, and up to 7% of bats colliding with mine gates.\n\nMaintaining microclimate in closed/abandoned mines can be beneficial, with one USA study finding that modifying the microclimate by closing a man-made entrance resulted in greater numbers of bats hibernating within the mine (Action 1964). Other proposed actions include excluding bats from roosts prior to mine reclamation (Action 1961), retaining access points for bats following mine closures (Action 1962), reopening entrances to closed mines and making them suitable for roosting bats (Action 1965), providing artificial subterranean bat roosts to replace roosts in reclaimed mines (Action 974), and relocating bats from reclaimed mines to alternative subterranean roost sites (Action 975), though no studies have evaluated the effectiveness of these latter actions.\n\nArtificial caves or hibernacula can be created as replacement habitat, with studies from the UK and Germany showing that artificial hibernacula are used by up to four bat species and that bat use can increase over time (Action 2049). However, many mining-specific mitigation strategies lack scientific evaluation of their effectiveness on bat populations.",
