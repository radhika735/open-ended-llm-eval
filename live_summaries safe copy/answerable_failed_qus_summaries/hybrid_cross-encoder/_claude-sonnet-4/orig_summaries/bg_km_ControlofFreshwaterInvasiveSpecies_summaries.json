Three out of four studies found that diquat or diquat alginate reduced cover or eradicated submerged C. helmsii (Action 1279). Salt water treatment showed high effectiveness, with two replicated controlled container trials and two before-and-after field trials finding that seawater eradicated C. helmsii (Action 1288). Among combination approaches, covering with carpet followed by glyphosate treatment killed 80% of the plant (Action 1313).\n\nThe least effective non-physical control methods documented include hydrogen peroxide, which in one controlled study using tank trials did not control C. helmsii (Action 1281). Aquatic dye application to reduce light levels was found ineffective, with one replicated controlled study showing it did not reduce coverage (Action 1293). Some herbicides showed limited effectiveness: dichlobenil led to only partial biomass reduction in one out of two studies (Action 1279), and terbutryne only partially reduced biomass of submerged C. helmsii in container trials (Action 1279). Grazing showed inconsistent results, with one study finding reduced abundance when grazing was excluded, while another found no difference between grazed and ungrazed plots (Action 1301).",

Salt water treatment has proven effective, with two replicated, controlled container trials and two before-and-after field trials in the UK finding that seawater eradicated Crassula helmsii (action 1288). Lightproof barriers using black sheeting or carpet strips showed significant results in five before-and-after studies in the UK, which found that covering Crassula helmsii eradicated or severely reduced plant cover, though progressive recolonization occurred at two sites where initial eradication was reported (action 1294). A combination approach using carpet covering followed by glyphosate herbicide treatment killed 80% of Crassula helmsii in one UK pond study (action 1313). For skunk cabbage eradication, physical removal methods show effectiveness but require sustained effort. A study in Switzerland found that annual physical removal of recently established skunk cabbage plants over five years removed the entire stock, while a study in the Netherlands found manual removal effective for small outbreaks of small-growing plants (action 1101). However, a German study reported that after four years of twice-yearly full removal, a large number of plants still needed to be removed annually (action 1101). Chemical control using herbicides shows mixed results for skunk cabbage. One UK study found that both glyphosate and 2,4-D Amine killed all skunk cabbage plants in test areas, but another UK study found that while 2,4-D amine at 9 litres/ha successfully eradicated skunk cabbage, glyphosate was unsuccessful and only achieved limited reduction in plant growth (action 1102).",

Lightproof barriers using black sheeting or carpet strips showed significant results in five before-and-after studies in the UK, which found that covering Crassula helmsii eradicated or severely reduced plant cover, though progressive recolonization occurred at two sites where initial eradication was reported (action 1294). A combination approach using carpet covering followed by glyphosate herbicide treatment killed 80% of Crassula helmsii in one UK pond study (action 1313). For skunk cabbage eradication, physical removal methods show effectiveness but require sustained effort. A study in Switzerland found that annual physical removal of recently established skunk cabbage plants over five years removed the entire stock, while a study in the Netherlands found manual removal effective for small outbreaks of small-growing plants (action 1101). However, a German study reported that after four years of twice-yearly full removal, a large number of plants still needed to be removed annually (action 1101). Chemical control using herbicides shows mixed results for skunk cabbage. One UK study found that both glyphosate and 2,4-D Amine killed all skunk cabbage plants in test areas, but another UK study found that while 2,4-D amine at 9 litres/ha successfully eradicated skunk cabbage, glyphosate was unsuccessful and only achieved limited reduction in plant growth (action 1102).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"1288\",\n    \"1294\",\n    \"1313\",\n    \"1101\",\n    \"1102\"\n  ]\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "Several factors influence the success of chemical control for invasive aquatic plants like water primrose and parrot's feather:\n\n**Herbicide Type for Water Primrose:**\nTriclopyr TEA applied at 0.25% concentration killed 100% of young cultivated water primrose within two months (action 1139). Glyphosate controlled water primrose with 97% mortality when mixed with a non-oil based sticking agent and 100% mortality when combined with TopFilm (action 1139). Halosulfuron-methyl (Sempra) resulted in significant reduction in water primrose coverage (action 1139).\n\n**Herbicide Type for Parrot's Feather:**\n2,4-D reduced growth of parrot's feather and led to greater reduction compared to diquat, glyphosate or imazapyr (action 1606). The combined application of 2,4-D and MCPA completely eliminated parrot's feather (action 1606). Triclopyr reduced cover and led to greater reduction than glyphosate (action 1689). Other effective herbicides included carfentrazone-ethyl (action 1676), endothall (action 1681), diquat (action 1680), imazamox, imazapyr, glyphosate, gluphosinate-ammonium, flumioxazin, and florpyrauxifen-benzyl (action 1699). Some herbicides showed limited effectiveness: fluridone, clopyralid and copper chelate did not reduce growth (action 1699).\n\n**Use of Adjuvants:**\nFor water primrose, glyphosate showed differential effectiveness depending on adjuvant type - 97% mortality with non-oil based sticking agent versus 100% mortality when combined with TopFilm (action 1139). For water primrose, glyphosate combined with surface active agent Cygnet-Plus followed by mechanical removal achieved 75% kill rate (action 1140).\n\n**Application Factors:**\nConcentration affects effectiveness, as demonstrated with triclopyr TEA at 0.25% concentration achieving complete mortality in water primrose (action 1139). Some studies showed that effectiveness can vary between laboratory and field conditions, with some herbicides showing reduced effectiveness in field applications compared to laboratory studies (actions 1680, 1681).",

However, no evidence was captured for the use of predatory fish (Action 1087) or disease-causing organisms (Action 1090) to control Ponto-Caspian gammarids. For Procambarus crayfish, evidence focuses on predator encouragement rather than parasites or host-specific herbivores. Two replicated controlled studies in Italy found that eels fed on red swamp crayfish and reduced population size, and one replicated controlled study from France found that pike predated red swamp crayfish (Action 1030). A before-and-after study in Switzerland found that introducing predators combined with trapping significantly reduced red swamp crayfish populations in a pond, and a replicated controlled study from Italy demonstrated that trapping and predation in combination was more effective than predation alone (Action 1031). Regarding host-specific herbivores, no evidence was captured for their use against these specific invertebrate species. A replicated laboratory and field study in South America examined a South American weevil on floating pennywort, finding it caused more feeding lesions than on other plant species, but field results showed the weevil did not reduce floating pennywort biomass (Action 1123). No evidence was found for biological control using herbivores on other invasive plant species (Actions 1098, 1277).

    "relevant_summary": "Several factors influence the success of chemical control for invasive plants based on evidence from skunk cabbage and water primrose management. Herbicide type appears critical, as demonstrated by skunk cabbage studies where 2,4-D Amine at 9 litres/ha successfully eradicated skunk cabbage while glyphosate was unsuccessful at eradicating the same species, achieving only limited reduction in growth (Action 1102). For water primrose, herbicide concentration affects outcomes, with triclopyr TEA at 0.25% concentration achieving 100% mortality of young cultivated plants within two months (Action 1139). The addition of adjuvants enhances effectiveness, as shown in water primrose control where glyphosate achieved 97% mortality when mixed with a non-oil based sticking agent and 100% mortality when combined with TopFilm (Action 1139). Plant age and development stage influence control success, with young water primrose plants showing complete mortality to triclopyr TEA treatment (Action 1139). Combination approaches may improve outcomes, as demonstrated where glyphosate with Cygnet-Plus surface active agent followed by mechanical removal achieved 75% kill rate of water primrose (Action 1140), and combining herbicide application with physical removal and other actions like native plant promotion achieved 85-90% reduction in Peruvian primrose-willow coverage (Action 1140). Species-specific herbicide effectiveness varies significantly, with halosulfuron-methyl effectively reducing water primrose coverage without apparent toxicity to rice plants (Action 1139).",

    "relevant_summary": "Management options to prevent the spread of invasive aquatic invertebrates like red swamp crayfish and Ponto-Caspian gammarids between water bodies include several physical and chemical approaches. Physical barriers can be effective, as concrete dams across streams with features specifically designed to prevent red swamp crayfish from crawling over them were found to be effective at containing population spread upstream (Action ID: 1037). Trapping and removal is another option, with food-baited traps being most effective for red swamp crayfish compared to pheromone baits, capturing over half of all crayfish caught (Action ID: 1029). For Ponto-Caspian gammarids, dewatering habitat by lowering water levels in sand killed three species of invasive freshwater shrimp, though one species required water content levels of 4% and below before being killed (Action ID: 1094). Chemical treatment methods have been tested but with limited field applicability - iodine solution, acetic acid, Virkon S and sodium hypochlorite killed invasive killer shrimp in laboratory conditions but were considered impractical for field application, while methanol, citric acid, urea, hydrogen peroxide and sucrose did not kill invasive killer shrimp (Action ID: 1095). For red swamp crayfish, the natural pyrethrum Pyblast at 0.05 mg/l concentration was effective but application to drained crayfish burrows was not effective (Action ID: 1036). Changing water salinity showed mixed results, with one study finding increased salinity killed the majority of invasive shrimp within five hours while another found it did not kill invasive killer shrimp (Action ID: 1091). Movement control can be achieved through water exposed to predatory fish, which slowed down or stopped movements of invasive freshwater shrimp, and carbonating water was found to stun invasive killer shrimp (Action ID: 1088). Lowering water pH was not effective for killing invasive killer shrimp (Action ID: 1093).",

Encouraging predators shows promise, with studies from Italy demonstrating that eels can reduce red swamp crayfish population size by feeding on them, and a French study showing that pike also predate on red swamp crayfish (Action 1030). The combination of trapping with predator encouragement appears particularly effective, with a Swiss study showing significant population reduction when introducing predators combined with trapping, and an Italian study demonstrating this combination was more effective than predation alone (Action 1031). Male sterilization represents another potential approach, with an Italian laboratory study finding that X-ray exposure of male red swamp crayfish reduced offspring production by 43% (Action 1032).

For crayfish control, one before-and-after study conducted between 2007 and 2010 in Spain found that concrete dams across a stream, specifically designed with features to prevent red swamp crayfish from crawling over them, were effective at containing spread of the population upstream (action 1037). For aquatic plant control, evidence exists for lightproof barriers. Five before-and-after studies in the UK found that covering Crassula helmsii with black sheeting or carpet strips eradicated or severely reduced the cover of the plant, however C. helmsii was reported to have progressively recolonized two of the sites where it had been initially reported as eradicated (action 1294). One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in iris-invaded lakeshore marshes in Canada reported that covering plots with rubber sheeting after cutting back yellow iris prevented most vegetation regrowth in an intermittently flooded marsh, but had no clear effect in a permanently flooded marsh (action 3124). For parrot's feather control, no evidence was found for the use of lightproof barriers (action 1576). Barriers are also used to protect planted vegetation from interference, with studies showing that fences or barriers protecting freshwater wetlands planted with non-woody plants increased plant survival rates over 12-18 months after planting and affected plant community composition (action 3328).",

Bullfrog adults can be captured overnight using a single trap floating on the water surface (Action 1045). Shooting of metamorphosed individuals before reproduction has been found to significantly reduce the number of recorded adults and juveniles when carried out as part of combination treatment (Action 1045). Trapping for juvenile removal also resulted in significant reduction of adults and juveniles when part of combination treatment (Action 1046). Collection of egg clutches using bilge pumps or nets has been referenced but no evidence was captured on the effects of this technique (Action 1047). However, bullfrog populations rapidly rebound following intensive removal of adults (Action 1045). For red-eared terrapins, direct removal techniques include: Aranzadi turtle traps which were effective in trapping red-eared terrapins from a river but did not eradicate the population (Action 1055). Using sein nets to trap adults and juveniles was not successful in eradicating the population (Action 1055).",

A study in Western Australia found that following a two-week program of physical removal of floating pennywort, the rate of growth exceeded the rate of removal (Action 1126).

Chemical herbicide control shows varying effectiveness depending on the specific herbicide used. A controlled, replicated study in the UK found that the herbicide 2,4-D amine applied at 4.2 kg/ha achieved near to 100% mortality, compared with the herbicide glyphosate applied at 2.2 kg active ingredient/ha (without an adjuvant) which achieved negligible mortality (Action 1127). Combination treatments can be effective, as a before-and-after study in Western Australia found that a combination of cutting followed by glyphosate chemical treatment removed floating pennywort (Action 1128). Novel chemical methods have shown limited success. A controlled, replicated pilot study in The Netherlands found that hydrogen peroxide sprayed on potted floating pennywort plants resulted in curling and transparency of the leaves when applied at the highest tested concentration (30%), but this was still not sufficient to kill the plant (Action 1129). Physical flame treatment shows promise, as a controlled, replicated, pilot experiment in 2010 in The Netherlands found that flame treatments of 1, 2 or 3 seconds had a significantly negative and progressive impact on floating pennywort, and a 3 second repeat treatment after 11 days proved fatal (Action 1131).",
