For solitary bees, 29 out of 30 replicated trials showed occupancy by bees across 10 countries including Europe, North and South America and Asia (Action 47). Occupancy rates for solitary bee nest boxes, where reported, were between 1 and 26% of available cavities (Action 80). The number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site, as demonstrated in three trials on agricultural land (Action 47). One study estimated that the number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes compared to fields without nest boxes (Action 47). In contrast, bumblebee nest box success is much lower. Three replicated trials since 1989 in the UK showed very low uptake rates of 0-2.5% for various nest box designs, while seven earlier trials in the UK, USA or Canada showed overall uptake rates between 10% and 48% (Action 48). Two replicated trials tested bumblebee nest boxes and both found very low uptake of 2% or less (Action 80). Underground nest boxes buried 5-10 cm underground with entrance pipes are generally the most effective for bumblebees, with seven replicated trials finding between 6% and 58% occupancy, but even these rates are often lower than solitary bee success rates (Action 48). However, there is no evidence captured for the effects of providing nest boxes on bumblebee populations (Action 48).",

Artificial nest sites should be placed within 150-600 m of foraging resources based on experiments with four medium to large European species (Action 47). For ground-nesting species, patches of bare ground can be created, with one replicated controlled trial in Germany and four small trials showing successful colonization by ground-nesting solitary bees and wasps in the first or second year (Action 13). Reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produce more bees per nest than plastic-lined holes or plastic/paper tubes, which are much less productive due to parasitism or mould (Action 47).

Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive due to parasitism or mould (Action 47). Two replicated trials in California showed that introduced European earwigs and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes, with these introduced species more commonly occupying the boxes than native bees in one trial (Action 47). For bumblebee reintroduction, rates of social parasitism by cuckoo bees Bombus [Psithyrus] spp. are variable, with two replicated trials finding high rates of 25-66% and 79% respectively (Action 52). For bumblebee translocation, two trials in Canada provided evidence of queen death and one showed lower colony productivity following translocation (Action 53).

For forest replanting specifically, one replicated, paired site comparison from the USA found similar numbers of bees and bee species, but different bee communities, in restored and remnant sites along watercourses (Action 1408). Regarding habitat corridors, only limited evidence was found that was not specific to bees, with studies focusing on other taxa like birds and primates. One large replicated controlled trial showed that the average abundance of long-tongued bumblebees on field margins was positively correlated with the number of pollen and nectar agri-environment agreements in a 10 km grid square (Action 21). For field margin management, four replicated trials in the UK found more bumblebees and more bee species foraging on uncropped field margins than on cropped margins (Action 20).

Nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes were occupied in 23 trials, while blocks of wood drilled with holes were occupied in 11 trials (Action 47). Reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees per nest than other types, while plastic-lined holes or plastic/paper tubes were much less productive due to parasitism or mould (Action 47). Ten studies from Germany, Poland and the UK showed solitary bee nest boxes were readily used, with local population sizes increasing when boxes were provided (Action 80). Occupancy rates ranged from 1-26% of available cavities, supporting 4.6-33 bee species (Action 80). The number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision (Actions 47, 80).\n\nFor ground-nesting bees: Creating patches of bare ground is effective, with one replicated controlled trial in Germany and four small trials showing artificially exposed bare soil areas can be successfully colonized by ground-nesting solitary bees and wasps in the first or second year (Action 13).\n\nFor commercial species: Several megachilid solitary bee species are successfully reared and managed commercially using drilled wooden blocks or stacked grooved boards of wood or polystyrene, with local populations increasing up to six-fold in one year under good management conditions with plentiful floral resources (Action 54).\n\nImportant considerations include: nest boxes must be placed within 150-600 m of foraging resources (Actions 47, 80), mortality rates from parasites and predators range from 2-56% depending on species and location (Action 47), and bumblebee nest boxes show very low uptake of 2% or less (Action 80).

Ten trials found substantial numbers of foraging wild bees on patches sown with phacelia, with six trials recording 8-35 bee species (Action 17).

Additionally, one replicated controlled before-and-after trial attempted to eradicate European buff-tailed bumblebees Bombus terrestris from trial sites in Japan by catching and killing foraging bees, which led to an increase in numbers of two native bumblebee species, but did not eradicate B. terrestris (action 38). For small hive beetle control, one replicated trial in the USA tested the effect of using mite-killing strips in commercial honey bee Apis mellifera transport packages to reduce the spread of small hive beetle, however more than half the beetles escaped the packages and were not killed by the strip (action 41). For disease management in commercial hives, one randomised controlled trial in Canada found that the antibiotic fumagillin is not effective against Nosema bombi infection in managed colonies of the western bumblebee Bombus occidentalis. One replicated controlled trial in South Korea found that Indian meal moth Plodia interpunctella in commercial bumblebee colonies can be controlled with the insect pathogen Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) Aizawai strain, at a strength of 1 g Bt/litre of water (action 42).

Reducing the intensity of farmland meadow management through delayed first cutting and reduced agrochemical use can enhance numbers and diversity of wild bees (Action 22). Agri-environment schemes implemented across Europe have shown enhanced diversity and abundance of foraging wild bees relative to conventionally-managed fields, including Swiss Ecological Compensation Areas, German organic arable farming options, Dutch botanical agreements, and Scottish Rural Stewardship Schemes (Action 24). \n\nGrassland restoration practices show positive results, with species-rich grassland managed under agri-environment schemes attracting more nest-searching queen bumblebees than unmanaged grassland, and restored grasslands developing similar flower-visiting insect communities to ancient species-rich grasslands (Action 8). Field margin management is particularly effective, with uncropped arable field margins sown with native wildflower seed mixes supporting higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees than cropped field edges, grassy margins, or naturally regenerated margins, especially when perennial leguminous herbs are included (Action 19). Naturally regenerated uncropped field margins also support more bumblebees and bee species than cropped margins (Action 20).\n\nArtificial nest site provision shows consistent success, with 29 out of 30 replicated trials across 10 countries demonstrating occupancy by solitary bees, including endangered species, with nest boxes effective within 150-600m of foraging resources (Action 47). Active management of solitary bee populations can increase local populations up to six-fold in one year under good conditions with plentiful floral resources (Action 54). Habitat restoration along watercourses creates sites with similar bee numbers and species to remnant sites, though with different community compositions (Action 1408). Planted flower strips attract more wild bee species and individuals compared to unplanted strips (Action 1406), while hedgerow planting increases bee species in fields and hedgerows themselves, with older hedgerows supporting more species than younger ones (Action 1407).",

Sowing uncropped arable field margins with native wild flower seed mixes is an alternative that five replicated trials in the UK showed supports a higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees than cropped field edges, grassy margins, or naturally regenerated uncropped margins (Action 19). Leaving arable field margins uncropped with natural regeneration is another option, with four replicated trials in the UK finding more bumblebees and more bee species foraging on uncropped field margins than on cropped margins, though the value for bees was not consistent from year to year (Action 20). Providing grass strips at field margins represents a third alternative, with three replicated controlled trials in the UK showing mixed evidence, where some trials found enhanced abundance and diversity of wild bees while others showed no improvement over cropped margins (Action 14). Planting dedicated floral resources on farmland is also documented, with fourteen trials in Europe and North America recording substantial numbers of wild bees foraging on perennial or annual sown flowering plants, particularly patches sown with phacelia which attracted 8-35 bee species in most trials (Action 17). Managing hedges is mentioned as another potential approach, though one replicated controlled trial showed that hedges managed under agri-environment schemes do not attract more bumblebees than conventionally managed hedgerows (Action 15).",

Road verges have been a significant focus area, with studies showing that restoring species-rich grassland on road verges using native prairie vegetation supported greater numbers and diversity of bees than frequently mown grassed verges (Action 30). Along road and railway verges, restored roadside prairies and verges sown with native wildflowers had higher species richness and diversity of pollinators than verges dominated by non-native vegetation (Action 3854). Altering mowing regimes on greenspaces and road verges also showed benefits, with less frequently mown or unmown urban greenspaces having higher species richness and diversity of butterflies and moths than more frequently mown areas (Action 3841). \n\nUrban environments offer additional opportunities through planting parks, gardens and road verges with appropriate native species, which showed greater species richness of butterfly and moth adults and caterpillars compared to areas with mixed or exclusively non-native plant species (Action 3842). Green infrastructure in urban areas such as green roofs had lower abundance of butterflies than urban parks, but abundance was higher on older green roofs with more nectar plant species in larger areas (Action 3837). Wildlife gardening practices in urban settings showed mixed results, with gardens where insecticides and herbicides were not used having higher abundance of butterflies (Action 3834, 3900).\n\nHedgerow planting provided benefits with more bee species found in fields with hedgerows or in hedgerows themselves compared to fields or field edges without hedgerows, and higher crop visitation rates by native bees in fields next to planted hedgerows (Action 1407). Habitat restoration along watercourses showed similar numbers of bees and bee species in restored versus remnant sites, though with different bee communities (Action 1408). Additionally, stopping herbicide use on pavements and road verges resulted in greater species richness and abundance of butterflies in restored roadside prairies compared to areas with unrestricted herbicide application (Action 3899). Commercial rearing and management of solitary bee populations has also been tested, particularly for Megachilidae species, with local populations able to increase up to six-fold in one year under good management conditions with plentiful floral resources (Action 54).",

A small trial tested three soil-filled nest boxes for the mining bee Andrena flavipes in the UK, but they were not occupied (Action ID: 47).

Heathland restoration efforts can result in impoverished communities of conopid flies that parasitize bumblebees, with one study showing this parasitic community remained impoverished 15 years after restoration began (Action 9). Nest box interventions for bumblebees have shown very low uptake rates of 2% or less in replicated trials (Action 80). For laboratory-reared bumblebee colony reintroductions, high rates of social parasitism by cuckoo bees have been observed, with rates ranging from 25-79% in trials from Canada and the UK (Action 52). Flower planting interventions have shown variable and sometimes counterproductive results, with some studies finding fewer pollinators where more flower species had been planted, and one study finding that bee numbers decreased over time in areas planted with nine flower species (Actions 1406, 2468). Commercial bumblebee colonies face disease challenges, with one trial finding that the antibiotic fumagillin was not effective against Nosema bombi infection (Action 42).

Twenty-two trials from 13 countries have documented captive rearing of bumblebee colonies using various methods including confining mated queens alone, with workers, or following different treatments (Action 50). For declining North American bumblebees, success has been limited - while two trials successfully induced spring queens of half-black bumblebee B. vagans to rear adults in captivity, and one trial succeeded with yellow-banded bumblebees B. terricola and red-belted bumblebees B. rufocinctus, all attempts to rear yellow bumblebee B. fervidus failed as larvae died before becoming adults, with similar failures observed for rusty-patched bumblebee and American bumblebee B. pensylvanicus (Action 50). For reintroduction success, seven replicated trials monitored laboratory-reared colonies introduced to the environment, with variable outcomes - in four trials where colonies developed until new queens were produced, two trials (both in the UK) showed very low or zero queen production, while two trials produced good numbers of new queens (Action 52). High rates of social parasitism by cuckoo bees present a significant challenge, with rates of 25-66% in Canada and 79% in the UK reported in two trials, though five other trials reported no parasites (Action 52). Translocation studies from the 1950s and 1960s showed additional concerns, with two Canadian trials providing evidence of queen death and lower colony productivity following translocation, though one UK trial found that early bumblebee B. pratorum colonies adapted well to being moved (Action 53). Research has identified several factors that improve success rates, including optimal pollen diets, artificial light regimes, and proper hibernation protocols for captive breeding (Action 50).",

At the local patch scale, fourteen trials in Europe and North America recorded substantial numbers of wild bees foraging on perennial or annual sown flowering plants in agricultural environments (Action 17). Ten trials monitoring bees foraging on patches sown with phacelia found substantial numbers of foraging wild bees, particularly bumblebees, with species richness ranging from eight to 35 species in six trials (Action 17). Field margins sown with wild flowers consistently supported higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees compared to cropped field edges, grassy margins, or naturally regenerated margins across five replicated trials (Action 19). However, when examining wider landscape effects, one trial in the Netherlands showed that bee numbers and species richness were not higher in farmland 50-1,500 meters away from planted flower patches (Action 17). In contrast, at the landscape scale, one large replicated controlled trial showed that the average abundance of long-tongued bumblebees on field margins was positively correlated with the number of pollen and nectar agri-environment agreements in a 10 km grid square (Actions 21, 362). Studies of artificial nest sites found that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 meters, indicating local-scale constraints on bee movement (Action 47). Additionally, landscape-scale evaluations found that two replicated trials in the UK showed bumblebee populations were not enhanced on farmland managed under agri-environment schemes when compared at broad spatial scales (Action 24).",
