For organic matter content, twelve studies found more organic matter in soils with added compost compared to soils without (Action 1362), while five studies found more organic matter in soils with added manure compared to soils without it, though three studies found similar amounts (Action 1363). Regarding nutrients, six studies found more nutrients in soils with added compost in some or all comparisons, though three studies found inconsistent nitrogen differences and one found no phosphorus differences (Action 1362). For manure, three studies found more nitrogen and two found more potassium in soils with added manure, while one found more phosphorus, though results were mixed for nitrogen in two studies and inconsistent for phosphorus in one study (Action 1363). For soil organisms, six studies found more microbial biomass in soils with added compost in some or all comparisons (Action 1362), while two studies found similar amounts of microbial biomass in soils with or without added manure (Action 1363). Both amendments reduce soil erosion and improve stability, with two studies showing less erosion and four showing greater stability with compost (Action 1362), and one study showing less erosion and three showing higher soil stability with manure (Action 1363). However, greenhouse gas emissions differ, with six studies finding more greenhouse gas emissions in soils with added compost (Action 1362), while one study found higher carbon dioxide emissions and one found higher nitrous oxide emissions with manure (Action 1363). Studies combining manures and agricultural composts found higher microbial biomass, reduced nutrient loss, higher nitrogen levels, increased organic carbon, and higher crop yields (Action 911).",

Crop yield reductions are a significant concern, with multiple replicated, controlled studies from Spain showing lower cereal yields in no-tillage plots compared to reduced tillage in some comparisons (action 1358). Seven replicated, controlled studies from Italy, Lebanon, Spain, and the USA found lower crop yields in plots with no tillage compared to conventional tillage in some or all comparisons (action 1355). Specifically for fruits and vegetables, three replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Italy found lower fruit or vegetable yields in plots with no tillage compared to reduced tillage in some comparisons (action 1358). One replicated, randomized, controlled study from Spain found lower sunflower seed yields in plots with no tillage compared to reduced tillage in some comparisons (action 1358). Regarding crop quality, one replicated, controlled study from Italy found less protein in wheat grains from plots with no tillage compared to conventional tillage (action 1355). Soil compaction issues are another concern, as three replicated trials found higher compaction under reduced tillage (action 906). Weed management challenges may occur, with one replicated, controlled study from Australia finding more weeds in plots with no tillage compared to reduced tillage (action 1398). Regarding soil nutrients, six replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Spain found less nitrogen in soils without tillage in some or all comparisons (action 1369), and one replicated, randomized, controlled study from Portugal found less phosphorus in soils without tillage compared to soils with tillage in some comparisons (action 1369). Additionally, one replicated, randomized, controlled study from Portugal found lower pH levels in soils without tillage compared to soils with tillage in some comparisons (action 1369).

Cover crops or ground cover in perennial crops increased microbial biomass, symbiotic fungi (mycorrhizae), bacteria, and nematodes in soils (Action 2304). Organic farming showed higher numbers, diversity, functional diversity or activity of soil organisms (Action 895).

No tillage was found to be even more effective, with more water found in soils with no tillage compared to reduced tillage in some or all comparisons, and crops using water more efficiently in one of four comparisons (Action 1385). Reduced tillage also increased water infiltration rates and reduced water loss through runoff in some comparisons (Action 1386), while no-tillage in the absence of crop cover increased soil loss (Action 906). \n\nMulching practices significantly improve water retention: adding mulch to crops increased soil moisture according to two replicated trials from India (Action 887). Cover crops beneath the main crop or between crop rows reduced erosion and improved soil stability (Action 897), while retaining crop residues reduced water runoff and increased water storage according to one review (Action 907). \n\nCrop rotation, particularly including legumes, increased water infiltration in replicated trials from Syria (Action 857).

For plant abundance, studies found that areas with cattle, sheep, goats, or alpacas excluded generally showed higher biomass, cover, or abundance of some or all plant groups compared to grazed areas (Action 2292, Action 1417). However, some studies also found lower biomass, cover, or abundance of certain plant groups in areas with grazers excluded compared to grazed areas (Action 2292, Action 1417).\n\nRegarding plant diversity, the effects vary considerably. Some studies in Israel and Spain found more species, or fewer non-native species, in areas with cattle or sheep excluded compared to grazed areas (Action 2292, Action 1417). Conversely, other studies in these regions found fewer species or native species, larger decreases in the number of species, or smaller increases in the number of species, in areas with cattle, sheep, or alpacas excluded compared to grazed areas (Action 2292, Action 1417). Additionally, some studies found higher plant diversity or different community composition in plots with cattle excluded compared to grazed plots, while others found no difference in plant diversity between excluded and grazed plots (Action 2292, Action 1417).\n\nStudies also examined different grazing intensities rather than complete exclusion. In Chile and Israel, lower grazing intensities resulted in higher cover of some plant species, herbaceous plants, or native plants compared to higher intensities, though some plant groups showed lower cover or biomass with reduced grazing (Action 2294). Plant diversity responses to grazing intensity varied, with some studies finding no differences between different cattle-grazing intensities, while one study in Chile found fewer native species and more non-native species in paddocks with lower sheep-grazing intensities (Action 2294).",
