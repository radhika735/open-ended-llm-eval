However, effectiveness varies with landscape context, being more pronounced in intensively managed areas, and benefits may be stronger in farms managed organically for less than 6 years.\n\nPlanting nectar flower mixtures and wildflower strips (action 3932) is highly effective, with ten studies showing that sown wildflower strips had higher abundance of all butterflies, generalist butterflies, specialist butterflies, and meadow brown butterflies than conventional field margins, unsown margins, cropped fields, and conventional grassland. Eight of thirteen studies found higher species richness and diversity in wildflower strips compared to conventional alternatives.\n\nReducing fertilizer, pesticide or herbicide use generally (action 3897) benefits butterfly and moth populations, with eight studies finding that areas managed with less frequent, reduced or no chemical inputs had greater species richness of adult butterflies and moths than areas with more frequent or conventional chemical applications. Six studies showed higher abundance of butterflies and moths in areas with reduced chemical use.\n\nIncreasing or maintaining the proportion of natural or semi-natural habitat in the farmed landscape (action 3910) is effective, with nine of eleven studies finding higher species richness of butterflies, burnet moths and all moths on farms with greater proportions of semi-natural habitat compared to conventional farmland.\n\nMaintaining species-rich, semi-natural grassland (action 3908) shows mixed results depending on management approach, with some studies finding higher abundance of butterflies in lightly grazed or annually mown grasslands compared to intensive farming, though effectiveness varies by specific management timing and intensity.\n\nPlanting new hedges (action 3976) increases butterfly and moth populations, with five of six studies finding higher abundance of butterflies, moths, and macro-moths along hedgerows than on beetle banks, grass margins without hedgerows, or field interiors.\n\nUndersowing spring cereals with clover (action 3926) shows promise, with one study finding that spring barley undersown with grasses and legumes had higher species richness and abundance of butterflies than extensively or conventionally managed grassland.\n\nPlanting wild bird seed or cover mixture (action 3930) provides benefits, with two studies finding that plots sown with wild bird seed mixture had greater species richness and higher abundance of butterflies than wheat crop or extensively managed grassland.\n\nFor specific crop types, managing vineyards to benefit butterflies and moths (action 3919) shows effectiveness, with studies finding that grass strips between vine rows and vineyards managed with fewer chemicals had greater species richness and abundance of butterflies than conventionally managed vineyards.",

      "relevant_summary": "Alternative management strategies to prescribed burning for maintaining open grassland habitats for butterflies include several mowing, cutting, and grazing approaches. Rotational mowing has shown positive effects, with grasslands managed by mowing strips in alternate years or leaving rotational areas uncut having greater species richness and abundance of butterflies than grasslands cut in full annually (action 3966). Additionally, rotationally mown grasslands benefitted 27 out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern, and two heath fritillary populations survived on rotationally mown grasslands while six populations went extinct on unmanaged grasslands (action 3966). Changing mowing regimes can be effective, with prairies managed by haying showing higher abundance of prairie specialist butterflies than prairies managed by burning, though the abundance was higher in the first year after haying than in the second year (action 3945). Rotational grazing is another alternative, where rotational cattle- and sheep-grazed grasslands had greater species richness of butterflies and burnet moths than continuously grazed or patch-burned grassland (action 3965). Reducing cutting frequency shows benefits, with meadows cut once per year having higher species richness of butterflies and moths than meadows cut two or more times per year (action 3961). Delaying cutting or first grazing dates also helps, with grassland cut once per year in July or September having greater abundance of butterflies, burnet moths and caterpillars than grassland cut once or twice per year in May or June (action 3967). Mechanical cutting of heathland can be effective, with one pine barren managed for 13 years by mechanical cutting having higher abundance of Karner blue butterflies than barrens managed by rotational burning (action 3947). Managing wetlands or ponds by cutting can prevent succession, though recently cut fens had fewer large copper eggs than uncut fens (action 3950).",

Restoring connectivity between habitat patches increased the abundance of multiple butterfly species including Karner blue, high brown fritillary, small pearl-bordered fritillary, marsh fritillary, and regal fritillary (Action 3934). Studies found that common buckeye and variegated fritillary butterflies were more likely to move between connected than unconnected habitat patches (Action 3934). Additionally, grassland strips providing nectar or shelter were more likely to be used by butterfly species than strips with no resources (Action 3934). For population retention, low quality habitat patches that were well connected were more likely to retain Alcon large blue populations than less well connected patches, though connectivity did not affect occupancy of high quality patches (Action 3832). Connectivity also influenced colonization behavior, as common buckeye butterflies were more likely to colonize farther away habitat patches when released on corridors of suitable habitat compared to unsuitable habitat, though this effect was not observed when released close to habitat patches (Action 3832). However, one study found that well connected cleared patches within woodland had similar species richness of butterflies to isolated cleared patches (Action 3832).",

Reducing management intensity on permanent grasslands shows strong benefits, with 7 of 12 studies finding that less intensively managed grasslands had higher species richness of butterflies and moths than conventionally managed grasslands (action 3958). Six of 10 studies found higher species richness, and 3 of 4 studies found higher abundance of butterflies and moths in low-input or unfertilized, ungrazed grassland managed with a single cut compared to intensively managed grassland (action 3958).\n\nRotational mowing techniques provide significant advantages, with 3 of 4 studies showing that grasslands managed by mowing strips in alternate years had greater species richness and diversity of butterflies than grasslands cut in full once per year (action 3966). Two controlled studies found higher abundance of butterflies and burnet moths in grasslands managed by mowing strips in alternate years or leaving rotational areas uncut on each mow compared to grasslands cut in full once or twice per year (action 3966). Additionally, 29 out of 32 butterfly species preferred meadows which were half mown in June and August to meadows cut in full twice per year (action 3966).\n\nConverting to organic farming demonstrates benefits, with 7 of 11 studies finding that organic arable farms had greater species richness and abundance of butterflies, burnet moths, and all moths than conventionally managed farms (action 3907). Reducing fertilizer, pesticide or herbicide use generally also shows positive effects, with 8 studies finding that farms managed with less frequent, reduced or no chemical input had greater species richness of adult butterflies and moths than areas with more frequent or conventional chemical applications (action 3897).\n\nRestoring arable land to permanent grassland provides benefits, with studies showing that restored grasslands had higher abundance of moths than conventional grassland and higher species richness of butterflies when established by sowing grasses, legumes and other non-woody, broadleaved plants compared to grass-only mixes (action 3929). Agri-environment schemes also demonstrate effectiveness, with 12 of 15 studies finding that species richness or diversity of butterflies and moths on grassland managed under agri-environment schemes was higher than on conventional fields or farms (action 3915).",

Studies show that areas not sprayed with herbicides such as glyphosate and fluazifop-P-butyl have greater species richness and higher total abundance of butterflies compared to sprayed areas (Action 3896). Similarly, plants not sprayed with insecticides like Karate Zeon have higher abundance of moth eggs and caterpillars (Action 3896). \n\nGeneral reduction of fertilizer, pesticide, or herbicide use results in greater species richness of adult butterflies and moths, and higher abundance of these species compared to areas with conventional chemical applications (Action 3897). These benefits include increases in both adult butterflies and moths as well as caterpillars (Action 3897). Additionally, unfertilized grassland shows greater species richness of specialist moths compared to fertilized grassland (Action 3897).\n\nConverting to organic farming, which eliminates synthetic chemical inputs, demonstrates that organic arable farms have greater species richness and abundance of butterflies, burnet moths, and all moths than conventionally managed farms (Action 3907). The abundance of butterflies increases with time since farms converted to organic management (Action 3907). When farms convert to organic management, the species richness of large moths and total abundance of large moths can increase within 4 years (Action 3907).\n\nLeaving headlands in fields unsprayed provides additional benefits, with unsprayed headlands showing greater species richness and abundance of butterflies and caterpillars than headlands sprayed with herbicide and insecticide (Action 3898). Butterflies also exhibit behavioral benefits, spending more time feeding and interacting in unsprayed headlands compared to sprayed areas (Action 3898).",

Selective or reduced impact logging instead of conventional logging, where studies in Sweden and Brazil found selectively logged forests had higher abundance of moth caterpillars compared to clearcut forests and similar or higher abundance of butterflies compared to primary forest (Action 3867). Group selection harvesting or thinning instead of clearcutting, where three studies in the USA found forests managed by thinning had higher moth species richness than those managed by patch-cutting or clearcutting (Action 3868). Managing woodland edges for maximum habitat heterogeneity, where studies in Belgium and Finland found scalloped woodland edges had higher abundance of brown hairstreak eggs than straight edges, and felling 5-meter-wide woodland edges with thinning of adjacent forest increased butterfly and moth species richness and specialist butterfly abundance (Action 3942). Mechanically removing mid-storey or ground vegetation to create fire breaks, where studies in Portugal and France found cork oak woodlands with more recent mechanical clearance had greater butterfly species richness and abundance than those cleared less frequently (Action 3881). Creating young plantations within mature woodland, where a UK study found pearl-bordered fritillary populations were more likely to persist in woodlands with larger areas of young plantations than in mature woodland (Action 3941).",

Thirty-two studies have evaluated the effects of paying farmers to cover the costs of conservation measures on butterflies and moths, with the majority of studies conducted in the UK (18 studies), Switzerland (8 studies), Finland (2 studies), and one each in Sweden, Czech Republic, USA, and Germany (Action 3915). \n\nFor species richness and diversity, twelve of 15 studies found that butterflies and moths on grassland, field margins, wildflower strips or whole farms managed under agri-environment schemes had higher species richness or diversity than on conventional fields or farms, while three studies found similar richness. However, one study in Finland found that species richness was lower on agri-environment scheme grassland compared to abandoned, unmanaged grassland (Action 3915).\n\nRegarding abundance, seventeen of 19 studies found that the abundance of butterflies and moths on farms managed under agri-environment schemes was higher than on conventional farms. Three of four studies found higher butterfly abundance on farms or in landscapes with higher proportions of land under agri-environment schemes. However, studies in Finland and Czech Republic found that grassland managed under agri-environment schemes had lower abundance compared to unmanaged grassland (Action 3915).\n\nSpecific interventions show varying effectiveness. For wildflower strips, eight of thirteen studies found higher species richness of butterflies and moths compared to conventional margins, and ten studies found higher abundance (Action 3932). Reducing management intensity on permanent grasslands showed positive effects in six of ten studies for species richness, with three of four studies showing higher butterfly abundance (Action 3958). Set-aside areas demonstrated benefits in three of four studies for species richness and two of five studies for abundance (Action 3980). Rotational mowing proved effective with three of four studies showing greater species richness and positive abundance effects reported in multiple studies (Action 3966).\n\nThe evidence base is strongest for the UK and Switzerland, with fewer studies from other European countries, indicating geographic gaps in the research.",

      "relevant_summary": "Based on studies across European grasslands, several grazing management strategies show beneficial effects for butterfly species richness. Reducing grazing intensity through lower stocking density appears most beneficial - five of eight studies found that grasslands grazed with lower stocking densities of sheep, cattle or mixed livestock had greater species richness of adult butterflies and moths than grassland grazed at higher stocking densities (Action 3959). Additionally, seasonal removal of livestock during critical periods benefits butterflies - one study found that grasslands where cattle were removed in summer had greater species richness of butterflies than grasslands grazed throughout the summer (Action 3960).\n\nRotational grazing also shows promise for butterfly conservation - two of four studies found that rotational cattle- and sheep-grazed grasslands had greater species richness of butterflies and burnet moths than continuously grazed or patch-burned grassland (Action 3965). Low-input management approaches that reduce overall management intensity consistently benefit butterfly communities - six of ten studies found that less intensively managed grasslands had higher species richness of butterflies and moths than conventionally managed grasslands (Action 3958).\n\nImportantly, avoiding intensive management appears crucial. Studies show that grasslands managed with more intensive grazing had lower abundance of all adult butterflies, adult burnet moths, and species-specific butterflies than ungrazed, lightly or moderately grazed grasslands (Action 3962). While ceasing grazing entirely can benefit some species, results are mixed with timing - butterfly density was higher in grasslands where grazing ceased 2-9 years ago than those abandoned >10 years ago or those currently grazed (Action 3956).\n\nMaintaining traditional semi-natural grassland management through light grazing or annual mowing also supports butterfly diversity, with several studies showing higher species richness in such systems compared to intensively managed grassland (Action 3908).",

Unflattened spoil heaps had higher species richness of moths than flattened spoil heaps (action 3862). Restored peat bogs after mining supported similar densities and caterpillar sizes of Fred the thread moth compared to undisturbed bogs (action 3862).\n\n**Heathland and Shrubland Creation**: Restored moorland had moth communities more similar to established heather moorland than degraded moorland (action 3946). Silver-studded blue butterfly populations released into sites managed for heathland restoration increased in abundance over 11 years and expanded their range beyond the initial release area (action 3946).\n\n**Grassland Restoration**: Semi-natural grasslands restored by scrub clearance and reintroduction of grazing or mowing can provide habitat, though they had different butterfly communities compared to existing species-rich grasslands (action 3955). Some species showed higher abundance on restored grasslands, with the density of blue-spot hairstreak eggs being higher in grasslands restored by scrub cutting than in unrestored or continuously managed grasslands (action 3955).\n\n**Woodland Edge Management**: Managing woodland edges for maximum habitat heterogeneity by felling 5-m-wide edges and thinning adjacent forest increased species richness of butterflies and diurnal moths and abundance of specialist butterflies two years after management (action 3942). Scalloped woodland edges had higher abundance of brown hairstreak eggs than straight woodland edges (action 3942).\n\n**Urban Green Infrastructure**: Green roofs had lower butterfly abundance and species richness than urban parks, but abundance was higher on older green roofs with more nectar plant species in larger areas (action 3837).\n\n**Verge and Greenspace Management**: Altered mowing regimes significantly benefit butterflies and moths - less frequently mown or unmown urban greenspaces had higher species richness and diversity than frequently mown areas (action 3841). Road verges mown less frequently or later in summer had fewer traffic-killed butterflies (action 3841). Restored roadside prairies and verges sown with native wildflowers and butterfly larval food plants had higher species richness and abundance than verges dominated by non-native vegetation (action 3854).

Four of five controlled studies in the UK found that unsprayed headlands had greater abundance of butterflies and caterpillars than sprayed headlands (Action ID: 3898). UK studies also showed that large white, small white and green-veined white butterflies spent more time in unsprayed arable headlands than adjacent hedgerows, and spent more time feeding and interacting in unsprayed headlands (Action ID: 3898).\n\nGrass buffer strips: UK studies found that 2-m grass margins had greater species richness of butterflies than cropped field edges (Action ID: 3982). Three of four controlled studies in the UK found that grass margins had higher abundance of butterflies than cropped field edges (Action ID: 3982). Studies showed that wider grass margins (up to 6 m wide) had greater species richness and higher abundance of habitat-sensitive butterflies, macro-moths and micro-moths than narrower or conventional width margins (Action ID: 3982).\n\nUncropped cultivated margins: UK studies found that farms managed under agri-environment schemes, including uncropped cultivated margins, had higher abundance of butterflies and micro-moths compared to conventionally managed farms (Action ID: 3923). Fields with wider margins between crops had higher butterfly species richness in one of two years (Action ID: 3923).\n\nBuffer strips to reduce pesticide run-off: A UK study found that margins next to water bodies managed with restrictions on fertilizer and pesticide use had greater abundance of moths than conventionally managed margins (Action ID: 3894).\n\nUncultivated margins: UK studies found that uncultivated margins had higher species richness and abundance of butterflies than cereal fields or cropped field edges (Action ID: 3981). Studies showed that uncultivated margins which were not cut, or only cut in spring and autumn, had higher species richness and abundance of butterflies than margins cut in summer (Action ID: 3981). Wider uncultivated margins had higher abundance of butterflies than conventional margins (Action ID: 3981).\n\nRotational mowing: UK studies reported that heath fritillary populations survived on rotationally mown grasslands while populations went extinct on unmanaged grasslands (Action ID: 3966).

Two site comparison studies found that two prairie specialists (regal fritillary and arogos skipper) and three out of nine butterfly species were less abundant in prairies managed by burning than in prairies managed by haying, while abundance of generalist and migrant species was higher in burned prairies than hayed prairies (Action 3882). Leaving unburned patches during prescribed burning improved outcomes, with six out of nine specialist butterfly species being more abundant in areas where unburned areas were left during prescribed burning (Action 3879). For haying/mowing, one replicated site comparison study found that prairies managed by haying had a higher abundance of prairie specialist butterflies, but a lower abundance of generalist and migrant butterflies, than prairies managed by burning, and the abundance of prairie specialists was higher in the first year after haying than in the second year (Action 3945). Regarding grazing, four studies found that grasslands managed with more intensive grazing or with grazing in addition to rotational burning had a lower abundance of all adult butterflies, adult regal fritillaries and other species than ungrazed grasslands, lightly or moderately grazed grasslands or rotationally burned grasslands with occasional light grazing (Action 3962).

      "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from multiple studies, several habitat creation options within European agri-environment schemes consistently show positive effects on butterfly and moth abundance:\n\n**Nectar flower mixture/wildflower strips** are most consistently effective. Ten studies across the UK, Switzerland and Finland found that sown wildflower strips had higher abundance of all butterflies, generalist butterflies, specialist butterflies and meadow brown butterflies than conventional field margins, unsown margins, cropped fields, cropped margins, conventional grassland or extensively managed meadows (Action 3932). Two replicated studies in the UK and Sweden found that field margins sown with wildflowers had higher abundance of butterflies than grass-only field margins (Action 3932).\n\n**Agri-environment schemes in general** show strong positive effects. Seventeen of 19 studies across the UK, Sweden, Switzerland and Germany found that the abundance of butterflies and moths overall, and of specific species, in woodland, grassland, field margins, wildflower strips or whole farms managed under agri-environment schemes was higher than in unmanaged woodland or conventional fields or farms (Action 3915).\n\n**Grass buffer strips/margins around fields** show more variable but generally positive results. Three of four replicated, controlled studies in the UK found that grass margins had higher abundance of butterflies than cropped field edges (Action 3982). Three of seven replicated studies found that wider grass margins (up to 6m wide) had higher abundance of habitat-sensitive butterflies, macro-moths and micro-moths than narrower or conventional width margins (Action 3982). Four replicated studies found that floristically enhanced grass buffers or wildflower strips had higher abundance of butterflies than standard grass margins (Action 3982).\n\n**Hedgerow management and creation** also supports butterfly and moth populations. Five of six studies found that the abundance of butterflies, moths, macro-moths and gatekeepers was higher along hedgerows than on beetle banks, grass margins without hedgerows, in field interiors, or 5-10 metres away from hedgerows (Action 3976). Four of six replicated studies found that hedgerows cut once every 2-3 years, cut in autumn, or cut to allow incremental growth, had higher abundance of adult butterflies and moths, moth caterpillars and pupae than hedgerows cut to the same size every winter (Action 3975).\n\n**Uncultivated margins** show more mixed results, with six of seven studies finding that abundance of butterflies and moths was actually lower in uncultivated margins than in margins sown with grasses or wildflowers (Action 3981).",

In vineyards, studies from the USA and Spain found that grass strips between vine rows had greater species richness of butterflies than vine rows themselves, and vineyards managed with fewer chemicals had greater species richness of butterflies than conventionally managed vineyards, with one study showing greater abundance of butterflies in vineyards managed to encourage native plants where insecticide was rarely used (action 3919). For coffee plantations, three studies from Mexico and Puerto Rico demonstrated that shaded coffee plantations had higher species richness of fruit-eating butterflies and caterpillars compared to sun-grown monoculture, with shade-grown coffee plantations showing greater abundance of caterpillars than sun-grown plantations (actions 3931, 3920). In orchards, studies from Germany and USA showed that managed orchards had similar species richness of butterflies and burnet moths to abandoned orchards, though managed orchards had lower abundance of butterflies and burnet moths than abandoned orchards, while unmanaged and partially managed orchards had greater species richness and diversity of leaf-eating arthropods including caterpillars than commercially managed orchards (action 3917). Regarding chemical reduction, eleven studies across Europe, USA, Mexico and Switzerland found that orchards, vineyards, and coffee plantations managed with less frequent, reduced or no pesticide, herbicide, or fertilizer input had greater species richness and higher abundance of adult butterflies, moths, and caterpillars than areas with conventional chemical applications (action 3897). Organic farming conversion showed that seven of eleven studies found organic farms had greater species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths than conventionally managed farms, though effectiveness varied by landscape context and time since conversion (action 3907).",

Four replicated studies found that floristically enhanced grass buffers or wildflower strips had higher abundance of butterflies than standard grass margins.\n\n**Wildflower and Nectar Strips**: Sow uncropped arable field margins with native wild flower seed mixes, as five replicated trials in the UK showed these support higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees than cropped field edges, grassy margins or naturally regenerated uncropped margins (Action 19). Plant nectar flower mixture/wildflower strips, as eight of thirteen studies found that sown wildflower strips had higher species richness and diversity of butterflies and moths than conventional field margins, unsown margins, cropped fields or conventional grassland (Action 3932).\n\n**Hedgerow Management**: Plant new hedges, as three of four site comparison studies found that established hedgerows had higher species richness of butterflies and macro-moths than crops or pasture (Action 3976). Five of six studies found that abundance of butterflies, moths and macro-moths was higher along hedgerows than on beetle banks, grass margins without hedgerows, or in field interiors.\n\n**Field Size Reduction**: Reduce field size or maintain small fields, as four replicated site comparison studies found that landscapes with smaller fields had higher abundance of butterflies and burnet moths than areas with larger fields (Action 3974). Two studies found that landscapes with smaller fields had higher species richness of butterflies and burnet moths.\n\n**Specialized Bank Management**: For rice cultivation specifically, manage rice field banks by keeping them unmown and herbicide-free, as one study in Italy found these had greater species richness and higher abundance of butterflies, including large copper, than banks which were mown or sprayed with herbicide (Action 3928).",

Stopping the use of herbicides on pavements and road verges has been shown to increase both species richness and abundance of butterflies, with restored roadside prairies where herbicide application was restricted having greater butterfly diversity than areas with unrestricted herbicide use, and butterflies experiencing lower mortality risk in these areas (Action 3899). Altering mowing regimes on road verges is highly beneficial, with less frequently mown or unmown areas supporting higher species richness and diversity of butterflies and moths compared to frequently mown areas, and road verges mown less frequently or later in summer having fewer dead butterflies killed by traffic (Action 3841). Restoring or maintaining species-rich grassland along road and railway verges significantly enhances butterfly and moth populations, with restored roadside prairies and verges sown with native wildflowers or more butterfly larval food plants supporting higher species richness and abundance than areas dominated by non-native vegetation (Action 3854). Managing land under power lines specifically for butterflies and moths through mechanical cutting has proven effective, with managed areas showing higher species richness and abundance of butterflies than unmanaged land, and butterfly abundance being highest 2-4 years after scrub and trees were cleared (Action 3855). Retaining connectivity between habitat patches helps maintain butterfly populations, with well-connected low quality habitat patches being more likely to retain butterfly populations than isolated patches (Action 3832). These corridor management strategies collectively create linear habitats that support butterfly and moth conservation while maintaining infrastructure functionality.",

Eight studies found that areas managed with less frequent, reduced or no pesticide, herbicide, fertilizer or chemical input had greater species richness of adult butterflies and moths, or caterpillars, than areas with more frequent or conventional chemical applications (Action ID: 3897). Six studies found that these areas also had higher abundance of adult butterflies and moths than conventionally treated areas (Action ID: 3897). Two studies found that unfertilized grassland had greater species richness of specialist moths compared to fertilized grassland (Action ID: 3897).\n\nRestricting specific pesticides shows similar benefits. Arable field margins and rice field banks not sprayed with the herbicide glyphosate had greater species richness and higher total abundance of butterflies, including meadow brown and large copper species, than areas sprayed once per year for 1-3 years (Action ID: 3896). White campion plants not sprayed with insecticide had higher abundance of lychnis moth eggs and caterpillars than plants treated with insecticide Karate Zeon (Action ID: 3896).\n\nConverting to organic farming demonstrates significant positive effects. Seven of 11 studies found that organic arable farms had greater species richness of butterflies, burnet moths and all moths than conventionally managed farms, though some studies found effects only in intensively managed landscapes or in farms managed organically for less than 6 years (Action ID: 3907). Seven studies found that organic farms had greater abundance of butterflies, burnet moths, and all moths than conventional farms, with butterfly abundance increasing with time since conversion to organic management (Action ID: 3907).\n\nConservation practices also benefit butterfly and moth populations. Unsprayed headlands in arable fields had greater species richness and abundance of butterflies and caterpillars than headlands sprayed with herbicide and insecticide (Action ID: 3898). Margins next to water bodies managed with restrictions on fertilizer and pesticide use had greater abundance of moths than conventionally managed margins (Action ID: 3894). Less intensively managed grasslands, including reduced chemical application, had higher species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths than conventionally managed grasslands, with particular benefits for specialist species and species of conservation concern (Action ID: 3958).",

      "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from action documents, the main alternatives to grazing for maintaining open grassland habitats include mowing (various regimes), prescribed burning, and cessation of management (allowing early succession).\n\n**Mowing Alternatives:**\n\nRotational mowing showed positive effects on butterfly communities. Ten studies found that grasslands managed by mowing strips in alternate years, or by mowing parts of a site at different times while leaving some areas uncut, had greater species richness and diversity of butterflies than grasslands cut in full once per year (Action 3966). Two studies found higher abundance of butterflies and burnet moths in rotationally mown grasslands compared to grasslands cut in full once or twice per year (Action 3966). A review reported that rotational mowing benefitted 27 out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern (Action 3966).\n\nReducing cutting frequency generally benefited butterflies. Two of three studies found that meadows cut once per year had higher species richness of butterflies and moths than meadows cut two or more times per year (Action 3961). Two studies found that meadows cut occasionally or once per year had higher abundance of butterflies than intensively mown grasslands (Action 3961).\n\nDelaying cutting dates showed variable effects. Three studies found that grassland cut once per year in July or September had greater abundance of butterflies, burnet moths and caterpillars than grassland cut in May or June, though effects varied by year (Action 3967). One study found that meadows where grazing commenced after 15 June had higher abundance of clouded Apollo butterflies than meadows where grazing commenced before 15 June (Action 3967).\n\n**Prescribed Burning:**\n\nPrescribed fire showed mixed effects on butterfly communities. Four of nine studies found higher abundance of heath fritillary adults, marsh fritillary caterpillar webs and other species on burned sites compared to unburned or grazed land, though sometimes after initial reductions (Action 3882). However, three studies found lower abundance of some species on burned sites compared to unburned land (Action 3882). Two studies found that prairie specialists were less abundant in burned prairies than in hayed prairies, while generalist and migrant species were more abundant in burned areas (Action 3882).\n\nRotational burning generally showed positive effects. Two studies found that sites managed by rotational burning every 2-5 years had higher species richness of butterflies than unmanaged sites or sites managed by annual burning (Action 3883). Four studies found that under rotational burning management, butterfly abundance was higher on prairies burned more than one to four years ago compared to recently burned prairies (Action 3883).\n\n**Cessation of Management:**\n\nAbandoning mowing showed variable effects depending on time since abandonment. Five of seven studies found that grasslands abandoned for 3-13 years had similar species richness of butterflies to annually mown grasslands, though one found that grasslands abandoned for more than 50 years had lower species richness than mown grasslands (Action 3957). Four studies found that grasslands abandoned for more than 3 years had higher abundance of butterflies than annually mown grasslands, while four other studies found lower abundance in abandoned grasslands (Action 3957).\n\nCessation of grazing showed similar patterns. Six of nine studies found that grasslands abandoned for more than 5 years had similar species richness of butterflies to grazed grasslands (Action 3956). However, effects varied with time since abandonment, with some studies finding that butterfly density was higher in grasslands where grazing ceased 2-9 years ago than those abandoned for more than 10 years or those currently grazed (Action 3956). Studies consistently found that abandoned grasslands favored woodland and generalist species while grassland specialists declined (Actions 3956, 3957).",
