      "relevant_summary": "The most effective interventions for creating and managing aquatic habitats for amphibians in agricultural landscapes include pond creation, wetland creation, pond restoration, fish removal, and ditch management.\n\nPond creation for amphibians demonstrates high effectiveness, with studies showing that amphibians used 64-100% and reproduced in 64-68% of created ponds, or used 8-100% and reproduced in 2-62% depending on species (Action ID: 869). All 28 studies investigating colonization found that amphibians used some or all created ponds, with created ponds supporting up to 15 naturally colonizing species and up to 10 species that reproduced (Action ID: 869). Five studies found that numbers of species or breeding species were similar or higher in created ponds compared to natural ponds (Action ID: 869).\n\nWetland creation also proves effective, with five site comparison studies showing that created wetlands had similar numbers of amphibian species, amphibian abundance or communities to natural wetlands (Action ID: 880). Studies found that four to 15 amphibian species used or colonized created wetlands (Action ID: 880). A global review found that numbers of amphibian species and abundance were higher or similar in 54% of studies and similar in 35% of studies reviewed compared to natural wetlands (Action ID: 880).\n\nPond restoration demonstrates mixed but generally positive results, with six replicated studies showing that pond restoration and creation increased numbers of amphibian species, maintained or increased populations, or increased pond occupancy and breeding success (Action ID: 878). Restored and created ponds were colonized by 1-7 species, with 6-65% of ponds colonized and 35% used for breeding (Action ID: 878).\n\nFish removal through pond drying significantly enhances amphibian habitat quality, with one study showing that draining ponds to eliminate fish increased numbers of amphibian species (Action ID: 826). Studies found that pond drying to eliminate fish increased breeding success of frog or newt species (Action ID: 826).\n\nDitch management in agricultural landscapes also provides benefits, with one study finding that numbers of amphibian species and abundance was significantly higher in ditches managed under agri-environment schemes compared to those managed conventionally (Action ID: 749). Another study found that managing ditches increased common toad numbers (Action ID: 749).\n\nWater level regulation can support amphibian populations, with studies showing that maintaining pond water levels increased natterjack toad populations or maintained newt populations and enabled successful breeding by dusky gopher frogs (Action ID: 833). Retaining connectivity between habitat patches maintained populations of eight of 13 frog species over 20 years (Action ID: 853).",

Creating artificial hibernacula or aestivation sites has been studied, with one replicated before-and-after study in the UK finding that providing artificial hibernacula, along with other terrestrial habitat management, maintained populations of great crested newts (Action 759). Another replicated study in the UK found that created hibernacula were used by common frog and smooth newts, but not great crested newts, and found four amphibian species close to hibernacula at two of three sites (Action 759). Creating refuges involves adding coarse woody debris to forest floors, where two replicated controlled studies in the USA and Indonesia found mixed effects on abundance of individual amphibian species, while one before-and-after study in Australia found that restoration including reintroducing coarse woody debris to the forest floor increased frog species (Action 772). One replicated before-and-after study in the UK found that creating refugia for great crested newts, along with other interventions, maintained four populations, and two studies in New Zealand and the USA found that artificial refugia were used by translocated Hamilton's frogs and hellbenders (Action 772). Leaving coarse woody debris in forests shows varied results, with one replicated controlled study in the USA finding that migrating amphibians used clearcuts where woody debris was retained more than where it was removed, and another study finding that survival of juvenile amphibians was significantly higher in piles of woody debris than in open areas (Action 843). However, no evidence was found for the effects of creating refuge areas specifically in aquatic habitats on amphibian populations (Action 813).",

      "relevant_summary": "Several key factors and interventions have influenced the success of natterjack toad conservation projects in the UK. Translocation efforts have shown that re-establishing toads on dune or saltmarsh habitat was more successful than on heathland (Action 859). Translocations resulted in breeding populations established at 30-70% of sites, with particular success from replicated translocations of wild rather than captive-bred toads (Action 859). Pond creation has been a crucial intervention, with studies showing that created ponds, along with other interventions, significantly increased natterjack toad populations or maintained/increased populations at 75% of sites (Action 866). However, created ponds had lower tadpole mortality from desiccation compared to natural ponds, but higher mortality from predation by invertebrates (Action 866). Habitat management through vegetation clearance has been effective, with studies showing that vegetation clearance along with other habitat management increased, stabilized or maintained natterjack toad populations, and resulted in increased occupancy by natterjack toads (Action 761). Water chemistry management through adding limestone to ponds has shown mixed results - it resulted in establishment of one of three translocated populations and increased natterjack toad populations when combined with species-specific habitat management, and temporarily increased breeding, but also resulted in high tadpole mortality and pond abandonment in some cases (Action 748). Grazing management has been incorporated into successful conservation strategies, with habitat management that included reintroduction of grazing helping to maintain or increase natterjack toad populations (Action 780). The combination of multiple interventions appears important, as studies consistently show success when translocation, habitat management, and pond creation are implemented together.",

      "relevant_summary": "Captive breeding programs for amphibians show mixed results across different amphibian groups with varying levels of success and challenges.\n\nFor frogs, 23 of 33 studies found that amphibians produced eggs in captivity, including some cases with captive-bred females (Action 835). Seven studies found mixed results with some species or 17-50% of captive populations reproducing successfully, while other species were difficult to maintain or raise to adults (Action 835). Seventeen studies found that captive-bred frogs were raised successfully to hatching, tadpoles, froglets or adults, though one found low froglet survival and another found three species could not be successfully raised to adulthood (Action 835). Specific success rates included 30-88% of eggs hatching or 75% survival to metamorphosis, 17-51% survival as froglets, and 50-90% survival to adults (Action 835).\n\nFor salamanders and newts, four of six studies found that eggs were produced successfully in captivity, with one case involving captive-bred females (Action 838). Two studies found that egg production depended on tank habitat or was more successful in semi-natural compared to laboratory conditions (Action 838). One study found 60% of Japanese giant salamander eggs survived to hatching in captivity (Action 838). However, one review noted that slimy salamanders produced eggs that did not hatch (Action 838).\n\nHead-starting programs, which involve captive rearing from eggs for later release, showed that six of 10 studies found released head-started tadpoles, metamorphs or juveniles established breeding populations or increased frog and toad populations (Action 881). Nine of 10 studies found that head-started amphibians released at various life stages metamorphosed successfully and tended to survive the first season, winter or year, or bred successfully (Action 881).\n\nKey challenges include the need for specific environmental conditions, as reproductive success depended on temperature or simulated wet and dry seasons (Action 835). Hormone treatment to induce breeding showed mixed results, with 30-71% of females producing viable eggs following treatment, depending on hormone combinations and dosages (Action 883). Some programs required working with surrogate species first to establish husbandry techniques before working with target species (Action 1862).\n\nOverall success of captive breeding for conservation purposes shows that 41% of release programs of captive-bred or head-started amphibians showed evidence of breeding in the wild for multiple generations, 29% showed some evidence of breeding, and 12% showed evidence of survival following release (Action 871).",

Pond restoration has been shown to have varying effectiveness, with studies finding mixed effects depending on site and species, but generally showing increased numbers of amphibian species, maintained or increased populations, or increased pond occupancy and breeding success (action 878). Physical modifications to existing ponds include deepening, de-silting or re-profiling, which has resulted in establishment of breeding populations of great crested newts and garlic toads, and increased populations of common frogs and tree frogs (action 817). Water level regulation can be implemented, with studies showing that maintaining pond water levels increased natterjack toad populations or maintained newt populations, while draining ponds, particularly in summer, significantly increased abundance and numbers of amphibian species (action 833). To reduce acidification, lime can be added to water bodies, which has shown results including establishment of natterjack toad populations, increased larval and egg survival of moor frogs and common frogs, though some studies found high tadpole mortality and pond abandonment (action 748). Tree canopy removal to reduce pond shading has been implemented, with one study showing establishment of breeding populations following pond restoration that included canopy removal, though effects on hatching success varied by species (action 758). Fish control can be achieved by drying out ponds, which has been found to increase numbers of amphibian species and breeding success of frog and newt species (action 826). Disease management is possible through pond treatments to remove chytrid fungus, though studies found this reduced infection levels but did not eradicate the disease (action 766).",

Changing mowing regimes (Action 783) showed promise, with one study finding that restoration including reduced mowing increased numbers of frog species. Managing ditches (Action 749) demonstrated benefits, with one study showing increased common toad numbers and another finding significantly higher amphibian species numbers and abundance in ditches managed under agri-environment schemes compared to conventional management.\n\nPrescribed fire practices (Action 877) showed variable results across 14 studies - eight found no effect on amphibian abundance or species numbers, four found mixed effects depending on species and burn timing, three found increased abundance or species numbers, and one found decreased abundance. Time since prescribed fires also showed mixed results with both increases and decreases in amphibian measures.\n\nSome practices have limited evidence.

      "relevant_summary": "Studies of amphibian colonization in newly created ponds reveal several key factors affecting success. Pond age influences colonization success, with survival of translocated Oregon spotted frogs increasing with increasing age of created ponds (action 865). Water permanence is a critical factor, with numbers of amphibian species being similar or lower depending on the permanence of created water bodies (action 869). Distance to existing ponds significantly affects colonization, as use or colonization of created ponds was affected by distance to existing ponds (action 869). The surrounding landscape context influences success, with colonization affected by surrounding landscape features (action 869). Vegetation cover in and around ponds impacts colonization patterns (action 869). Fish presence negatively affects amphibian breeding success, with studies showing that pond drying to eliminate fish increased breeding success of frog or newt species (action 826), and excluding fish using barriers increased amphibian weight gain (action 829). Numbers of amphibian species and abundance in created wetlands were affected by wetland design, vegetation, water levels, fish presence and distance to source wetlands (action 880). Colonization rates vary significantly among studies, with amphibians using 64-100% and reproducing in 64-68% of created ponds, or using 8-100% and reproducing in 2-62% depending on species (action 869). Population stability differs from natural ponds, with one study finding that populations in created ponds were less stable than in natural ponds (action 869). Success rates for establishing breeding populations vary by species and method, with naturally colonizing, captive-bred and translocated great crested newts establishing breeding populations at 57-75% of created ponds (action 863), while translocated frog species reproduced in only 31% of created ponds in some cases (action 865).",

Antifungal treatments show the strongest evidence: twelve of 16 studies found that antifungal treatment cured or increased survival of amphibians with chytridiomycosis, while four studies found treatments reduced infection levels or had mixed results (Action 882). Specifically, six of eight studies testing itraconazole found it effective at curing amphibians of chytridiomycosis, with one study showing reduced infection levels and one showing mixed effects (Action 882). However, six studies found that specific fungicides caused death or other negative side effects in amphibians (Action 882). Temperature treatment also shows promise: four of five studies found that increasing enclosure or water temperature to 30-37°C for over 16 hours cured frogs and toads of chytridiomycosis, though one study found that heat treatment at 30-35°C for 36 hours did not cure northern leopard frogs (Action 770). Antibacterial treatments show limited effectiveness: two studies found that chloramphenicol antibiotic treatment cured green tree frogs and one Archey's frog of chytridiomycosis, while one study found that trimethoprim-sulfadiazine increased survival time but did not cure blue-and-yellow poison dart frogs (Action 763). Antifungal skin bacteria or peptides show mixed results: three of four studies found that adding antifungal bacteria to amphibian skin did not reduce chytridiomycosis infection rate or death, though one study found it prevented infection and death, and one study found it significantly reduced infection rates in red-backed salamanders when added to soil (Action 764). Treatment with antimicrobial skin peptides did not significantly increase survival of common toads (Action 764).

      "relevant_summary": "The research on retaining habitat features during timber harvesting shows mixed but generally positive effects across different wildlife groups. For riparian buffers, studies focusing on amphibians found that five out of six studies comparing harvesting with and without riparian buffers showed mixed effects on abundance depending on species and buffer width, while one found significantly higher amphibian abundance with buffers (Action 747). When comparing riparian buffers to unharvested forest, six studies found mixed effects depending on species or volume of existing downed wood, four found similar abundance and species composition to unharvested forest, and two found lower numbers of species and abundance than unharvested forest (Action 747). Buffer width matters, with two out of four studies finding greater amphibian species numbers and abundance in wider riparian buffer strips (Action 747).\n\nFor coarse woody debris retention, leaving woody debris in forests after logging showed predominantly neutral effects on reptiles, with four out of five studies finding no effect on reptile species richness and abundance, while one study found higher reptile species richness and abundance when debris was left in place compared to areas where debris was cleared and burned (Action 3632). Adding woody debris to landscapes showed positive results, with four out of five studies finding similar or higher reptile species richness in areas with added woody debris compared to areas without (Action 3718). For mammals, one study found more small mammal species groups in felled forest areas with woody debris than without (Action 2647).\n\nRegarding snags (standing deadwood), the evidence shows more limited benefits. For amphibians, studies found that leaving dead or wildlife trees during clearcutting did not result in higher salamander abundances compared to total clearcutting or prevent decreases compared to no harvesting (Action 845). For reptiles, two studies found mixed effects or no effect on reptile diversity, species richness, and abundance when adding snags and woody debris (Action 3631). However, for mammals, one study found that increasing standing deadwood increased the abundance of one of three shrew species compared to removing deadwood (Action 2646).\n\nVariable retention management and patch retention harvesting showed positive effects for birds. Variable retention management resulted in nine bird species occurring at higher densities compared to control stands, though five species were found at lower densities (Action 332). Patch retention harvesting contained more birds of more species than clearcut areas and retained similar numbers to unharvested areas, with forest specialist species found with greater frequency in patch retention plots (Action 330).\n\nNegative impacts of woody debris removal include one study finding that debris removal increased young tree density while another found it decreased young tree density, with mixed effects on understory vegetation cover and species richness (Action 1213).",

Reducing pesticide, herbicide or fertilizer use has shown positive results, with one study in Taiwan finding that halting pesticide use along with habitat management increased a population of Taipei frogs (Action 832). Managing ditches under agri-environment schemes can be beneficial, as one study in the UK found that managing ditches increased common toad numbers, and one study in the Netherlands found that numbers of amphibian species and abundance was significantly higher in ditches managed under agri-environment schemes compared to those managed conventionally (Action 749). Creating wetlands shows promise for amphibian conservation, with fifteen studies investigating the effectiveness of creating wetlands for amphibians, finding that created wetlands can have similar numbers of amphibian species, amphibian abundance or communities compared to natural wetlands, with numbers of amphibian species and amphibian abundance affected by wetland design, vegetation, water levels, surrounding habitat, fish presence and distance to source wetlands (Action 880). Retaining buffer zones around core habitat has mixed results, with one study in Australia finding that grassland restoration that included leaving unmown buffers around ponds increased numbers of frog species, while one study in the USA found that retaining unmown buffers around ponds had mixed effects on tadpole survival and mass depending on species and site (Action 850). However, some actions show limited effectiveness, as one study in the USA found that planting buffer strips along streams did not increase amphibian abundance, numbers of species, or the ratio of adults to tadpoles (Action 819). Several other relevant actions including preventing pollution from agricultural lands entering watercourses (Action 802) and restricting herbicide, fungicide and pesticide use on and around ponds (Action 787) currently have no evidence available for their effects on amphibian populations.",

For translocation, four of six studies found that translocated great crested newts maintained or established breeding populations (Action 858). However, one systematic review of 31 great crested newt studies found no conclusive evidence that mitigation including translocations resulted in self-sustaining populations (Action 858). Populations were present one year after release in 37% of cases, and one study found that within three years breeding failed in 48% of ponds despite initial success (Action 858). Great crested newts reproduced following 56% of translocations (Action 858).\n\nFor habitat creation, three before-and-after studies found that great crested newts established breeding populations at 57-75% of created ponds (Action 863). Three replicated studies found that up to 88% of created ponds were colonized by translocated or naturally colonizing great crested newts (Action 863). Head-started great crested newts reproduced in 38% of created ponds (Action 863). However, one systematic review found no conclusive evidence that mitigation which often included pond creation resulted in self-sustaining populations (Action 863). One study found that providing artificial hibernacula along with other terrestrial habitat management maintained populations of great crested newts (Action 759), though created hibernacula were not used by great crested newts in another study (Action 759). Creating refugia for great crested newts along with other interventions maintained four populations (Action 772). Pond deepening and enlarging resulted in establishment of a breeding population of great crested newts (Action 817).\n\nFor legal protection, three reviews found that legal protection of amphibian species was not effective at protecting populations during development (Action 779).

Six studies in Australia, Estonia and the UK found that vegetation clearance, along with other habitat management and in some cases release of animals, increased numbers of frog species, or increased, stabilized or maintained populations of natterjack toads (Action 761).\n\nFor replanting vegetation, three studies in Australia, Canada and Spain found that amphibian abundance or community composition was similar to natural sites following tree planting, or became more similar with time since grassland reseeding (Action 849). Four studies in Australia, Spain and the USA found that amphibians colonized replanted forest, reseeded grassland and seeded and transplanted upland habitat, with three of these studies investigating restoration following mining (Action 849).\n\nFor pond restoration, six replicated, before-and-after studies in Denmark, Estonia, Italy and the UK found that pond restoration and creation increased numbers of amphibian species, maintained or increased populations, or increased pond occupancy and ponds with breeding success (Action 878). Three before-and-after studies in Denmark and Italy found that restored and created ponds were colonized by 1–7 species, with 6–65% of ponds colonized and 35% used for breeding (Action 878).\n\nFor wetland restoration, ten site comparison studies in Canada and the USA found that amphibian abundance, numbers of species and species composition were similar in restored and natural wetlands in eight cases, though two found lower species numbers or abundance and different species composition in restored wetlands (Action 879). One global review found that in 89% of cases, restored and created wetlands had similar or higher amphibian abundance or numbers of species to natural wetlands (Action 879). Three replicated studies in the USA found that numbers of species in restored wetlands were affected by wetland size, proximity to source ponds and seasonality, but not wetland age (Action 879).\n\nFor created ponds, one review and two replicated, before-and-after studies in Denmark and the USA found that amphibians established stable populations in 50–100% of created ponds (Action 869).

Retaining riparian buffer strips during timber harvest has been extensively studied, with twelve studies investigating this approach (Action 747). Six replicated and/or controlled studies in Canada and the USA found mixed effects on amphibian abundance depending on species and buffer width, with one study finding significantly higher amphibian abundance with buffers. Eleven studies comparing amphibian numbers in forest with riparian buffers to unharvested forest found six with mixed effects depending on species or existing downed wood volume, four with similar abundance and species composition to unharvested forest, and two with lower numbers than unharvested forest. Studies found that wider riparian buffer strips may provide greater benefits, with two of four replicated studies finding greater numbers of amphibian species and abundance in wider strips. Alternative harvesting methods include using selective or reduced impact logging instead of conventional logging (Action 3867), which has been evaluated in four studies across Brazil, Sweden, and the USA. Other alternatives to clearcutting include patch retention harvesting (Action 330), which one study found contained more birds of more species than clearcut areas and retained similar numbers to unharvested areas, and harvesting groups of trees or using thinning instead of clearcutting (Action 3868), though these studies focused on moths rather than amphibians. Managing silviculture practices in plantations (Action 792) was also identified as a relevant management option, though specific details about amphibian effects are referenced in logging and wood harvesting threat discussions.",

Prevention strategies include sterilizing equipment when moving between amphibian sites to prevent disease spread, though no direct evidence was found for effects on disease transmission between populations (Action 768).
