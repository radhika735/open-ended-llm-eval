Organic farming versus conventional farming has been the most studied practice, with twelve studies showing varied results: five of nine studies found no difference in overall bat activity between organic and non-organic farms, while four studies found higher overall bat activity, bat feeding activity, Brazilian free-tailed bat activity, and activity of four of seven bat species on organic farms compared to non-organic farms (action 961). Additionally, five of seven studies found no difference in bat species numbers between organic and non-organic farms, though two studies found more bat species on organic farms (action 961).\n\nHedge management shows some positive effects: hedges trimmed three or more years prior had more bat species and higher activity of two of eight bat species/species groups than hedges trimmed during the previous winter, though pipistrelle activity did not differ between hedges managed for wildlife on agri-environment scheme farms versus conventional farms (action 1943). Field size appears important, with agricultural landscapes containing smaller fields showing higher activity of six of seven bat species compared to landscapes with larger fields (action 1939).\n\nTree plantations on agricultural land showed limited benefits: three studies in Australia found no difference in bat species numbers or activity between agricultural areas with and without native tree plantations, though bat activity was higher in plantations next to remnant native vegetation than in isolated plantations (action 958). Artificial water sources generally benefit bats, with five studies showing bat activity was similar or higher over reservoirs, ponds, and drainage ditches compared to natural wetlands or surrounding agricultural areas (action 959).\n\nOther management practices showed no clear effects: pipistrelle activity did not differ between species-rich grassland created on agri-environment scheme farms versus conventional crop fields (action 2051), and pipistrelle activity did not differ along waterways with vegetation buffers on agri-environment scheme farms compared to conventional farms (action 2284).",

Bat boxes show positive uptake, with nine studies in Europe and the USA finding that the number of bats using bat boxes increased by 2-10 times up to 10 years after installation (Action 1024). Forty-one of 43 studies found that bats used bat boxes installed in various habitats including forests, woodlands, farmland, wetlands, and urban areas, with 72 bat species documented using bat boxes, though only 18 species commonly used them and 31 species used them as maternity roosts (Action 1024). For artificial caves or hibernacula, studies in the UK and Germany found that these structures were used by up to four bat species, with one UK study showing increasing use over nine consecutive years (Action 2049). One study in Spain found more bats in artificial roosts within buildings after modifications were made to reduce internal temperatures (Action 2052).\n\nHowever, significant negative impacts and limitations have also been documented. Multiple studies found low occupancy rates, with 22 studies showing bats occupying less than half of provided bat boxes (0-49% occupancy) (Action 1024). Studies of alternative roosts during development showed mixed results, with some bats using purpose-built roosts in lower numbers than original roosts, and one review finding that new bat boxes/lofts were four times less likely to be used by returning bats than roosts retained during development (Action 949). Failures in replacement roosts were documented, with one USA review finding that bat houses provided during bridge replacement were used by fewer Mexican free-tailed bats than the original roost at one site and were not used at all at three sites (Action 2942). Additionally, two studies found that bats displaced from buildings did not use any of 43 bat houses of four different designs or 12 heated bat boxes, and heated bat boxes were only used at one of seven sites with no use by maternity colonies (Actions 1024, 2052).",

Grassland restoration showed neutral effects, with a UK study finding that pipistrelle activity did not differ between species-rich grassland created on agri-environment scheme farms and improved pasture or crop fields on conventional farms (Action 2051). Ex-quarry site restoration demonstrated positive results, with a French study finding that gravel-sand pits had higher overall bat activity 10 years after restoration than before or during quarrying (Action 2286).

Additional evidence from a Portugal study specifically showed that farms with few or no chemical inputs had higher overall bat activity and different bat species compositions compared to farms using high chemical inputs (Action 2331). Furthermore, twelve studies across Europe, USA, Canada and Chile on organic farming found mixed but generally positive results, with some studies showing higher bat activity, feeding activity, and species numbers on organic farms compared to conventional farms (Action 961). In contrast, there is no available evidence for the effectiveness of changing effluent treatments: no studies were found that evaluated the effects of changing effluent treatments used in agriculture and forestry on bat populations (Action 1016), and no evidence exists for preventing pollution from agricultural lands or sewage treatment facilities entering watercourses on wildlife populations (Action 802).",

Benefits include: maintaining microclimate in closed/abandoned mines resulted in greater numbers of bats hibernating within the mine (Action 1964). Installing cave gates to restrict public access led to more or similar numbers of bats in caves and bunkers after gates were installed in three of four studies, with population increases or decreased rates of decline for 13 of 20 Indiana bat colonies, and increased numbers of bats within caves after gated entrance sizes were increased (Action 999). Creating artificial caves or hibernacula showed that bats would use these structures, with one artificial hibernaculum showing increased use over nine years and use by up to four bat species (Action 2049). However, documented harms include: installing cave gates resulted in one study finding fewer bats in caves after installation, bats hibernating in a cave with a wall and gate lost more body mass than bats in unmodified caves, bats circled more and entered caves less after gates were installed, fewer bats flew through gates when bar spacing was reduced, and significantly fewer bats emerged from gated caves compared to fenced caves (Action 999). Installing mine gates showed similar negative effects with fewer bat species entering mines after gates were installed, fewer bats in mines or at mine entrances after gate installation, bats circling more and entering mines less, bats abandoning four mines with 'ladder' design gates, and up to 7% of bats colliding with mine gates (Action 1963). No studies were found evaluating the effectiveness or impacts of providing artificial subterranean roosts to replace those in reclaimed mines or disturbed caves, restoring microclimate in modified caves, relocating bats from reclaimed mines, reopening mine entrances, retaining bat access points to caves, or minimizing cave alterations for tourism.",

Retaining existing bat roosts and access points within developments shows that four of nine bat roosts retained within developments were used as maternity colonies, with two cases showing similar or greater numbers of bats after development, and bats used two-thirds of retained and modified bat roosts after development (Action 947). Creating alternative bat roosts within developments has shown mixed results, with bat boxes or bat lofts being used by bats at 13-74% of development sites, though new bat boxes/lofts built to replace destroyed roosts were four times less likely to be used by returning bats than roosts retained during development (Action 949). Changing the timing of building work can be effective, as one study found that carrying out roofing work outside of the bat maternity season, along with retaining bat access points, resulted in a similar number of brown long-eared bats continuing to use a roost within an attic (Action 950). Relocating access points to bat roosts within developments has shown limited success, with one study finding fewer brown long-eared bats used a roost after access points were relocated, though the design of alternative access points affects success, with 'straight' designs being more effective than 'bend' designs for lesser horseshoe bats (Action 946). Legal protection of bats during development through licensing shows that 68% of roosts are destroyed during licensed activities, but 31-67% of compensation roosts provided under licence were used by bats (Action 1935). Managing the microclimate of artificial bat roosts can increase bat abundance, with one study finding more bats in artificial roosts after they were modified to reduce internal temperatures (Action 2052). Providing bat boxes shows widespread use across different habitats, with 72 bat species using bat boxes according to a worldwide review, though only 18 species commonly used them, and occupancy rates varied from 0-100% across studies (Action 1024).",

Five replicated studies across Israel, USA, Germany, South Africa and Mexico found that bat activity was similar or higher over artificial water sources including reservoirs, waste water treatment pools, heliponds, drainage ditches, retention ponds, and farm/cattle ponds compared to natural wetlands or surrounding habitats like vineyards, forest, grassland, crops, trees and orchards (Action 959). One study in South Africa found similar numbers of bat species over farm ponds compared to surrounding agricultural areas (Action 959).\n\nFor livestock water management, two studies in the USA evaluated livestock water troughs as drinking resources for bats. One study found that removing livestock modifications from water troughs resulted in bats drinking from them more frequently and approaching troughs fewer times before successfully drinking (Action 1951). Another study found that larger livestock water tanks that were full of water or surrounded by sparse vegetation had more bats drinking from them than smaller, half-full tanks surrounded by no vegetation or dense vegetation (Action 1951).\n\nSmall dams for water provision also showed positive effects, with one study in Portugal finding that reservoirs created using small dams had greater activity of four bat species than the streams feeding into them (Action 1997).",

Studies on unmown field margins found that pipistrelle activity did not differ between wildlife-managed margins on agri-environment scheme farms and conventional farm margins (action 1940). However, research on diverse plant species in field margins showed that soprano pipistrelle and barbastelle bat activity increased with greater plant species diversity within field margins, though this had no effect on common pipistrelle activity or occurrence of six bat species studied (action 1941). Hedge management provides stronger evidence, with studies showing that hedges trimmed ≥3 years prior had more bat species and higher activity of two of eight bat species compared to recently trimmed hedges (action 1943). However, wildlife-managed hedges on agri-environment schemes showed no difference in pipistrelle activity compared to conventional farm hedges (action 1943). Field size also appears important, with agricultural landscapes containing smaller fields showing higher activity of six of seven bat species compared to landscapes with larger fields (action 1939).

Three studies in Europe and Australia found that two or three bat species/species groups used overpasses, but up to three-quarters of bats still crossed the road below at traffic height or at other nearby locations (Action 977). However, design matters significantly - one study in the UK found that an overpass with planters was used by two-thirds of crossing bats, while an unvegetated overpass with a paved road over it was not used by crossing bats at all (Action 977). One study in Australia found that the same number of bat species were recorded at an overpass as in nearby forest and bushland (Action 977). Bat gantries or bat bridges appear to be the least effective option. Three studies in the UK and France found that fewer bats used bat gantries than crossed the road below at traffic height, with one bat gantry not being used at all (Action 978).

For foraging habitat, creating or restoring bat foraging areas using green roofs has shown effectiveness, with studies finding greater bat activity over 'biodiverse' green roofs than conventional unvegetated roofs, and greater bat activity for three of five bat species over green roofs than over conventional unvegetated roofs (action 954). For roosting habitat, multiple approaches are available: providing bat boxes is widely studied with 41 of 43 studies finding that bats used bat boxes installed in various urban habitats including urban areas and buildings, bridges, and underpasses, with the number of bats using bat boxes increasing by 2-10 times up to 10 years after installation (action 1024). Creating artificial hollows and cracks in trees has been tested, with eight of 16 artificial hollows cut into trees being used by roosting long-eared bats (action 2047). Creating alternative bat roosts within developments shows mixed results, with bat boxes or bat lofts/barns being used by bats at 13-74% of development sites, though new bat boxes/lofts built to replace destroyed roosts were four times less likely to be used by returning bats than roosts retained during development (action 949). Creating spaces for roosting bats in road/railway bridges and culverts has proven effective, with spaces created in road bridges being recolonized by bats in similar or greater numbers to the original roosts at four of eight sites (action 1967). Creating artificial caves or hibernacula for bats shows promise, with artificial hibernacula being used by up to four bat species and the number of bats using an artificial hibernaculum increasing in each of nine years after it was built (action 2049).

One review found that 72 bat species used bat boxes, though only 18 species commonly used them. However, 22 studies found bats occupying less than half of bat boxes provided (0-49%), while 9 studies found occupancy rates above 50% (54-100%).\n\nRegarding bat box design effectiveness, action 1024 found that black bat boxes were used more than grey, white or wooden boxes. Larger bat boxes showed higher occupancy rates in one of two studies. Resin and wood cylindrical boxes were both used, but resin boxes became occupied more quickly. Concrete boxes had higher occupancy rates than wooden boxes. Indiana bats used rocket boxes more than wooden bat boxes or bark-mimic roosts. Bat boxes with two compartments were used more than single-compartment boxes during breeding season.\n\nArtificial caves and hibernacula (action 2049) were used by up to four bat species, with one study finding increasing bat usage over nine years after construction. Purpose-built roosts within developments (action 949) showed mixed results - bat boxes or bat lofts/barns were used by bats at 13-74% of development sites. Three of five studies found bat colonies using purpose-built roosts in higher or similar numbers after original roosts were destroyed.\n\nManaging microclimate in artificial roosts (action 2052) showed that modifications to reduce internal roost temperatures resulted in more bats using two artificial roosts within buildings. However, heated bat boxes showed limited success, with use at only one of seven sites.\n\nBridge spaces for roosting bats (action 1967) showed that spaces created in road bridges to replace lost roosts were recolonized by bats in similar or greater numbers at four of eight sites.",

Bat boxes on buildings had higher occupancy than those on trees in two studies (Action 1024). Higher occupancy was found in farm forestry sites compared to native forest, and in pine stands compared to mixed deciduous stands (Action 1024). Areas where bats were previously known to roost had higher occupancy rates (Action 1024). Installing a greater number of bat boxes across a site increased likelihood of occupancy (Action 1024).

In cave environments, both low intensity white lights and red lights resulted in fewer bat flights than full white lighting, though the number of bat movements was similar between all three light treatments (Action 1994).

Installing and maintaining gates at mine entrances to restrict public access has mixed effects based on nine studies from the USA and Australia - while gates can protect sites from disturbance, they may reduce bat species richness and abundance, with gate design affecting bat presence differently across species (Action 1963).

      "relevant_summary": "Several conservation actions can be implemented to mitigate the impacts of mining operations on bats, though scientific evidence for their effectiveness varies. Installing and maintaining gates at mine entrances to restrict public access has been studied in nine studies across the USA and Australia (Action 1963). These studies found that gates can reduce the number of bat species entering mines and result in fewer bats at mine entrances, though bat activity remained stable or increased at five of seven gated mines. Gate design and installation timing affect success, with some bats abandoning mines with 'ladder' design gates, and up to 7% of bats colliding with mine gates.\n\nMaintaining microclimate in closed/abandoned mines can be beneficial, with one USA study finding that modifying the microclimate by closing a man-made entrance resulted in greater numbers of bats hibernating within the mine (Action 1964). Other proposed actions include excluding bats from roosts prior to mine reclamation (Action 1961), retaining access points for bats following mine closures (Action 1962), reopening entrances to closed mines and making them suitable for roosting bats (Action 1965), providing artificial subterranean bat roosts to replace roosts in reclaimed mines (Action 974), and relocating bats from reclaimed mines to alternative subterranean roost sites (Action 975), though no studies have evaluated the effectiveness of these latter actions.\n\nArtificial caves or hibernacula can be created as replacement habitat, with studies from the UK and Germany showing that artificial hibernacula are used by up to four bat species and that bat use can increase over time (Action 2049). However, many mining-specific mitigation strategies lack scientific evaluation of their effectiveness on bat populations.",
