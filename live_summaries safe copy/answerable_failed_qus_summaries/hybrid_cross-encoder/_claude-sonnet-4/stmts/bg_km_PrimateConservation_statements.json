Physical barriers include installing mechanical barriers such as fences and ditches to deter primates from entering agricultural areas (action 1436). Sound-based deterrents include using loud-speakers to broadcast primate alarm calls (action 1447) and broadcasting sounds of potential threats like barking dogs, explosions, or gunshots (action 1446). Other acoustic methods involve using loud noises such as banger sticks, drums, tins, and iron sheets to deter crop damage by mammals, with studies showing that loud noises activated when animals are in the vicinity can reduce or partially reduce crop damage by various species including elephants (action 2460). Target species distress calls or signals have been tested, with mixed results - some studies found that certain mammals like white-tailed deer and Asian elephants were deterred by their distress calls, while other studies found no deterrent effect (action 2488). Chemical deterrents include using chili-based methods such as chili-spray, chili smoke, chili fences and chili extract in projectiles, with studies showing that these can repel elephants at least initially, though some studies found chili smoke and fences ineffective (action 2492). Human intervention methods include humans chasing primates using bright light (action 1450). Management strategies include removing human food waste that may serve as food sources for primates to avoid disease transmission and conflict (action 1561), planting crops favoured by primates away from primate areas (action 1440), discouraging the planting of fruit trees and vegetable gardens on urban edges (action 1424), and implementing speed limits in areas with high primate densities to reduce vehicle collisions (action 1458). Translocation of crop-raiding animals away from crops is another option, though studies suggest this may have negative impacts on survival rates (action 2485).",

      "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, several community-led approaches have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing illegal hunting of primates:\n\nCommunity control and patrolling systems show strong evidence of success. Community control was found to be more effective at reducing illegal bushmeat hunting, including primates, compared to national park management in the Democratic Republic of Congo (Action 1482). In Cameroon, no incidents of gorilla poaching occurred over three years after implementation of community control and monitoring. Areas managed by community conservation organizations in Nigeria showed higher populations of gorillas and chimpanzees than areas not managed by local communities (Action 1482).\n\nLocal hunting bans and community policies demonstrate measurable impacts. Local hunting bans led to increased lowland gorilla populations in Democratic Republic of Congo and increased drill populations in Cameroon. In China, very few snub-nosed monkeys were killed annually where wildlife killing was forbidden. Sclater's monkey populations increased in Nigeria where hunting was prohibited by local taboos (Action 1478).\n\nTraditional taboos and cultural protections show positive results. Laotian black crested gibbons occurred at higher densities in areas protected by local hunting taboos compared to sites without taboos (Action 1479).\n\nEducation and community engagement programs demonstrate effectiveness. Numbers of drills increased in Cameroon after implementation of education programs. In Madagascar, poaching of diademed sifakas and black and white ruffed lemurs appeared to cease after distribution of conservation books in local schools. Multimedia campaigns using theatre, film, and print media contributed to increased black howler monkey numbers in Belize and improved attitudes towards tamarins in Brazil and Colombia (Action 1571). Education programs and local engagement showed increases in bird populations and decreased mortality in multiple studies, with one Canadian study showing significant shifts in local peoples' attitudes toward conservation (Action 274).\n\nCommunity-based conservation activities show promise across species. Areas with community-based management had higher abundance of river turtles in Brazil, and fewer sea turtle eggs were lost to poaching in Mozambique and Costa Rica when communities were involved in monitoring. In the Philippines, fewer crocodiles were killed after rural community members were paid incentives to protect sanctuaries combined with education campaigns (Action 3681).",

Regular anti-poaching patrols (Action 1471) were associated with gorilla population increases in two studies in Rwanda and reduced illegal primate hunting activities in Ghana. Training anti-poaching ranger patrols (Action 1477) was effective across multiple contexts, with studies showing no gorilla killings over 21 months in Uganda, increased immature gorilla numbers in Rwanda, increased hoolock gibbon populations in India, and no primate poaching incidents over three years in Cameroon. Providing better equipment to anti-poaching patrols (Action 1476) led to gorilla population increases in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, prevented gorilla killings for 21 months in Uganda, and resulted in increased immature gorilla numbers and decreased snares in Rwanda. Regular removal of ground snares (Action 1475) contributed to mountain gorilla population increases over five years in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda and reduced snare numbers in Ghana. Implementing monitoring surveillance strategies like SMART (Action 1481) resulted in increased observations of gorillas and chimpanzees in Nigeria. Community-based approaches also proved effective, with community control of patrolling, hunting bans and snare removal (Action 1482) being more effective at reducing illegal bushmeat hunting including primates compared to national park management in the Democratic Republic of Congo, preventing gorilla poaching incidents over three years in Cameroon, and supporting larger gorilla and chimpanzee populations in Nigeria. Local no-hunting policies and traditional hunting bans (Action 1478) led to lowland gorilla population increases in the Democratic Republic of Congo, black howler monkey population increases in Belize, drill population increases in Cameroon, and Sclater's monkey population increases in Nigeria. Traditional taboos forbidding primate killing (Action 1479) were associated with higher Laotian black crested gibbon densities in Laos.",

      "relevant_summary": "Legal protection strategies for primates show mixed outcomes depending on the approach used. For habitat protection, a review found that primate numbers increased or no more individuals were killed after areas were legally protected in China (Action 1578). Hainan gibbon numbers increased by 34% over nine years after legal habitat protection in China, and black howler monkeys in protected areas had lower stress levels than those in unprotected forest fragments in Mexico (Action 1578). However, Tana River red colobus monkey and crested mangabey numbers decreased despite legal habitat protection in Kenya (Action 1578).\n\nFor species-specific protection, outcomes were also variable. Following a ban on export, rhesus macaque populations increased over 17 years in India (Action 1524). However, primate populations declined despite legal species protection in Thailand and India, the majority of introduced Müller's Bornean gibbons died despite legal protection in Malaysia, and drill populations declined at four of five sites despite legal protection in Cameroon (Action 1524).\n\nComparative evidence from other taxa shows that habitat protection can be effective. A systematic review found that 24 of 31 studies reported increases in mammal populations in protected areas relative to unprotected areas (Action 2559). For bats, protected forests showed higher activity than unprotected forests, and protected sites had greater species numbers than unprotected sites in some studies (Action 2045). However, species composition and species richness did not differ between protected and unprotected areas in other bat studies (Action 2045).\n\nFor reptiles, species protection showed mixed results, with some studies finding similar abundance in protected versus unprotected areas, while others found increased density following legal protection and harvest regulation, such as saltwater crocodile populations in Australia (Action 3705). Legal protection combined with public awareness campaigns reduced self-reported harvesting of sea turtles in Cape Verde (Action 3705).",

Three before-and-after studies in Tanzania, French Guiana, and Madagascar found that a majority of primates survived for 5-30 months following translocation from development sites to natural habitat (Action 1558). One study in India found that rhesus monkeys remained at their release sites following translocation from a development site (Action 1558).\n\nRehabilitation can support primate survival after development impacts: Studies found that most reintroduced chimpanzees survived over 3.5-5 years after undergoing pre-release rehabilitation, and numbers of reintroduced chimpanzees that underwent pre-release rehabilitation increased by 38% over 25 years in The Gambia (Action 1597). Most reintroduced vervet monkeys survived over six months after being rehabilitated before release (Action 1597).\n\nAdditional interventions identified include: creating/preserving primate habitat on islands before dam construction (Action 1455), implementing a minimum number of roads to reach mining extraction sites (Action 1462), minimizing ground vibrations caused by open cast mining activities (Action 1451), using 'set-aside' areas of natural habitat for primate protection within mining areas (Action 1453), establishing no-mining zones in/near watersheds to preserve water levels and water quality (Action 1452), certifying mines and marketing their products as 'primate friendly' (Action 1454), and re-using old roads rather than building new roads (Action 1463).

Using selective logging instead of clear-cutting has been shown to benefit primates, with one study finding that primate densities were higher in forest logged at low intensity than in forest logged at high intensity, and another study finding that the number of lemurs increased following selective logging (Action ID: 1485). Re-planting native trees in logged areas represents another approach to restoration (Action ID: 3874). Additional management approaches include avoiding slashing climbers/lianas, trees housing them, hemi-epiphytic figs, and ground vegetation (Action ID: 1493), incorporating forested corridors or buffers into logged areas (Action ID: 1495), using 'set-asides' for primate protection within logging areas (Action ID: 1497), and planting nesting trees/shelter for primates (Action ID: 1431).

In Brazil, most reintroduced golden lion tamarins did not survive over seven years despite veterinary screens, while most black lion tamarins survived over four months. In Malaysia, 90% of reintroduced Müller's Bornean gibbons did not survive despite veterinary screening. However, most translocated orangutans in Malaysia and Indonesia survived translocation and the first three months post-translocation. For chimpanzees, four studies found that most reintroduced individuals that underwent veterinary screens survived over 1-5 years, though one study in Uganda found a reintroduced chimpanzee repeatedly returned to human settlements. Five studies found that most reintroduced or translocated primates survived at least four months or increased in population size, while five other studies found that most were assumed to have died post-release despite pre-release veterinary screens (Action 1553).\n\nQuarantine protocols showed similarly mixed outcomes.

Retaining/creating habitat corridors in farmed areas (action 1730), with one study in Indonesia documenting that a peat swamp forest corridor contained 5,819 trees/ha including large trees, saplings and seedlings, and recorded 18-29 tree species. Using alley cropping (action 903) as an agroforestry technique. Producing coffee in shaded plantations (action 3931), which studies in Mexico and Puerto Rico found to have higher species richness and abundance of butterflies and caterpillars compared to sun-grown plantations. Diversifying ground vegetation and canopy structure in the habitat around woody crops (action 3526). Growing native trees within perennial crop plantations (action 3920), with a Costa Rica study finding higher butterfly diversity in coffee farms with native tree species. Additional approaches include certifying farms and marketing products as 'primate friendly' (action 1434) and farming more intensively in selected areas to spare more natural land (action 1435), though no evidence was found for the effectiveness of these specific approaches on primate populations.",

Implementing multimedia campaigns using theatre, film, print media, and discussions resulted in black howler monkey population increases of 61-138% in Belize, improved attitudes and knowledge about tamarins in Brazil and Colombia, cessation of poaching of diademed sifakas and ruffed lemurs in Madagascar after distributing conservation books, 66% increase in hoolock gibbon numbers in India, and increased knowledge about primates among sanctuary visitors in four African countries (Action 1571).\n\nAdditional approaches mentioned include employing hunters in the conservation sector, providing sustainable alternative livelihoods such as fish or domestic meat farms, encouraging traditional hunting methods rather than guns, certifying farms as 'primate friendly', and providing domestic meat to workers, though no evidence was found for the effectiveness of these specific interventions (Actions 1484, 1483, 1469, 1434, 1501).",

Shelterwood harvesting demonstrated higher moth species richness recovery rates compared to group selection harvesting or clear-cutting, and maintained similar species richness to unharvested forests (Action 3871). Group tree harvesting and thinning showed higher moth species richness than patch-cutting or clear-cutting, with thinning achieving similar richness to unharvested forest (Action 3868). For bat populations, selective logging showed smaller negative effects on abundance compared to conventional logging in the Neotropics, with similar diversity in Germany but different species composition in Trinidad (Action 989). Primate studies indicate higher densities in low-intensity logged forest compared to high-intensity logging in Sierra Leone, increased lemur numbers following selective logging in Madagascar, though similar densities between low and high intensity logging in Uganda (Action 1485).",

For artificial nesting sites, one study in Brazil found that a translocated lion tamarin population declined after artificial nest boxes were provided alongside other interventions (Action 1530). Another study in Brazil found that a majority of reintroduced golden lion tamarins died seven years after artificial nest boxes were provided alongside other interventions (Action 1530). However, one study in Gabon found that a majority of juvenile western lowland gorillas survived for at least seven years after nesting platforms were provided alongside other interventions (Action 1530). Regarding water sources, while no specific studies on artificial water sources for primates were found, studies on artificial water sources for bats showed that bat activity was similar or higher over reservoirs, waste water treatment pools, heliponds, drainage ditches, retention ponds, and farm/cattle ponds compared to natural wetlands and surrounding areas (Action 959). For supplementary feeding as another form of artificial resource provision, studies showed variable outcomes: two studies in China and The Gambia found primate populations increased after regular food provisioning alongside other interventions, while two studies in Thailand and Malaysia found populations declined after regular provision of supplementary food alongside other interventions (Action 1526). Additionally, three studies in Brazil, South Africa, and Indonesia found that the majority of primates survived after being regularly provided supplementary food along with other interventions (Action 1526).",

      "relevant_summary": "Conservation strategies involving local community education and management participation demonstrate multiple documented benefits across different ecosystems and species. Community-based management shows positive effects on species populations, with studies documenting increased abundance of Himalayan brown bears through community involvement in park management (action 2395), and doubled populations of Taipei frogs following education programs and volunteer habitat management (actions 776, 777). Forest conservation benefits include increased forest cover in community-managed forests compared to non-community managed areas in Ethiopia and Nepal (action 1152). Marine conservation shows increased New Zealand scallop abundance in community-based fisheries management areas compared to protected and recreational harvest areas (action 2242). Reptile conservation demonstrates enhanced protective outcomes, with community-based management of fishing practices resulting in higher river turtle abundance in Brazil, reduced sea turtle egg poaching in Mozambique and Costa Rica, and decreased Philippine crocodile killing following community engagement (action 3681). Wetland management involving local communities resulted in increased mangrove forest quality and reduced illegal activities (action 3390). Education and training programs produce measurable behavior changes, with over 3,500 households in Indonesia adopting sustainable farming practices following workshops (action 1848), significant increases in conservation behaviors toward Asian horseshoe crabs among Hong Kong students (action 2281), and reduced intention to hunt bats in Ghana following education about their ecological roles (action 1973). Community engagement in conservation activities also produces broader behavioral improvements, with fewer farmers removing large carnivores from conservancy-managed land compared to non-conservancy members (action 2395), and establishment of community-based management groups following conservation seminars in Kenya (action 3391). These interventions consistently show increased conservation knowledge, improved attitudes toward species, and enhanced participation in protective behaviors across diverse geographical and taxonomical contexts.",

There is positive evidence for only two methods: One controlled, replicated, before-and-after study in Indonesia found that in areas where noise deterrents were used, along with tree nets, crop raiding by orangutans was reduced (action 1449). Additionally, one controlled, replicated, before-and-after study in Indonesia found that areas where nets were used to protect crop trees, crop-raiding by orangutans was reduced (action 1442). One study in the Democratic Republic Congo found that chasing gorillas and using random noise resulted in the return of gorillas from plantations to areas close to protected forest (action 1449). For most other deterrent methods, no evidence was found: mechanical barriers such as fences and ditches (action 1436), natural hedges (action 1437), using dogs to chase crop raiding primates (action 1444), loud-speakers broadcasting sounds of potential threats such as barking dogs, explosions, and gunshots (action 1446), and loud-speakers broadcasting primate alarm calls (action 1447). One study in Zimbabwe involving dogs to guard crops found that people with dogs took longer to repel African elephants from crops compared to scaring them by using combinations of people, dogs, slingshots, drums, burning sticks, large fires and spraying with capsicum (action 2512).",
