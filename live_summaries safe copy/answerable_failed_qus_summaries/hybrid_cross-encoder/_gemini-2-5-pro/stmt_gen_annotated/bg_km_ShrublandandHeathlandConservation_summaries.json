    "relevant_summary": "Altering livestock grazing practices has various effects on shrubland vegetation. Increasing the number of livestock can lead to a decline in common heather and dwarf shrub cover [1628]. However, it can also result in an increase in heather cover, as well as an increase in the number of common heather and cross-leaved heath seedlings [1628]. In some cases, increasing livestock numbers may not alter shrub cover at all, or have mixed effects [1628]. Grazing can also affect grass and vegetation height. For instance, using grazing to control grass has been found to increase the cover of wavy-hair grass and reduce grass height [1646]. Increasing the number of livestock has been shown to decrease overall vegetation height [1628]. When it comes to species diversity, areas with high livestock density may have a higher number of plant species, though in some cases, the number of species may decrease or show no change [1628].\n\nExcluding livestock from shrublands using fences has also been studied. Fencing has been found to increase shrub cover, abundance, and biomass [1545]. Specifically, heather presence and cover were higher in fenced areas in some studies [1545]. On the other hand, some studies found that fencing could lead to a decrease in the cover of woody plants, or have mixed or no effect on shrub cover [1545]. In terms of other vegetation, fencing has been observed to lead to a decline in grass cover in some instances, while in others, it did not alter or even increased grass cover [1545]. Fencing has also been found to have mixed or no effect on herb cover [1545].",

For instance, some studies found that a high density of livestock led to a decline in common heather cover and lower dwarf shrub cover (1628). In contrast, one study observed an increase in heather cover with grazing (1628), while another found no alteration in shrub cover (1628). The impact on plant species diversity also varies, with some studies reporting a higher number of plant species in grazed areas (1628), while others found a decrease or no change (1628). Furthermore, increased grazing intensity has been associated with an increase in grass cover relative to heather species (1628) and a decrease in overall vegetation height (1628). \n\nConversely, reducing or excluding livestock and other large herbivores has also been studied. The removal of feral sheep, cattle, and horses was found to increase shrub cover and reduce grass cover (1663). Similarly, reducing grazing pressure from red deer led to increased cover and height of common heather (1663). In another instance, using fences to exclude deer resulted in an increased height of shrubs, although it did not affect shrub cover (1662).",

A successful relocation of a black-crowned night heron colony to an area without public access was also reported (309). However, in contrast, two other studies found no impact on the reproductive success of eagles or penguins from access restrictions (309). For bat populations, the installation of gates at cave and mine entrances has produced mixed results. Some studies noted an increase or stabilization of bat populations following gate installation (999, 1963), while others reported a decrease in bat numbers and species diversity (1963). Negative behavioral changes, such as increased circling at entrances and reduced entry into caves and mines, were also observed (999, 1963). Furthermore, one study found that bats in a gated cave experienced greater body mass loss compared to those in an unaltered cave (999). The design of the gates, including the spacing of bars, was found to influence bat behavior (999, 1963), and in some cases, mines were abandoned by bats after gates were installed (1963).",
