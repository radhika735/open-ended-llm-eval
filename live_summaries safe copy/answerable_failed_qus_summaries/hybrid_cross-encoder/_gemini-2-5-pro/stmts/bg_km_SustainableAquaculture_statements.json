However, a study in Spain found no evidence of oysters and mussels feeding on fish farm waste (932). Other mitigation methods include using vaccinations to increase survival rates in salmon exposed to disease-causing bacteria (733), breeding for resistance traits to increase survival from diseases like infectious pancreatic necrosis (735), and using probiotics and immunostimulants to increase survival and reduce lice infection (732). Additionally, altering the cage size, with larger cages showing lower levels of amoebic gill disease (742), and altering lighting, with low-intensity light reducing the number of lice (741), have been shown to be effective. Aerobic training may also increase survival rates in salmon with infectious pancreatic necrosis (740). Finally, freshwater bathing has been explored to reduce amoebic gill disease, though studies show mixed results (739).",
