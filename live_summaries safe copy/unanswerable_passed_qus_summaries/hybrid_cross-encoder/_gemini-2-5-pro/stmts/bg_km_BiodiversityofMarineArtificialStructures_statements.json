Another replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK revealed that creating natural rocky reef topography on intertidal artificial structures had varied effects on barnacle and mobile invertebrate abundances on the surfaces, with outcomes differing by site (3435). It was also noted in a UK study that natural topography created on intertidal artificial structures was colonized by macroalgae and limpets, and that limpets utilized the shaded grooves and water-retaining depressions formed by the topography (3435).",

Eighteen studies on creating 'rock pools' revealed that they can support macroalgae, mobile and non-mobile invertebrates, and fish species that are otherwise absent from the structure surfaces, often increasing species richness and diversity (3476). Similarly, the creation of hole habitats has been shown to alter community composition and increase species diversity (3467). However, none of the reviewed documents for creating 'rock pools', 'hole habitats', or 'large adjoining cavities' on intertidal artificial structures mentioned the long-term effects of these modifications on the structural integrity of the engineering materials used in the seawalls (3476, 3467, 3438).",

Another study indicated that creating hole habitats along with pits and grooves had mixed effects on invertebrate abundance depending on the species group (3434, 3455). Similarly, three studies on creating short flexible habitats (1-50 mm) found mixed effects on mobile and non-mobile invertebrate abundance (3450). In contrast, transplanting organisms has also shown varied outcomes. One study on transplanting oysters did not find an increase in the combined invertebrate and fish abundance (3471).
