One study on a bog in the UK found that lower grazing intensity resulted in greater total vegetation, shrub cover, and vegetation biomass (1735). Another study found that excluding sheep from a bog in the UK led to an increase in total vegetation, shrub, and bryophyte biomass (1734). However, in the same study, excluding sheep had no effect on the plant community in wetter areas, while in drier areas, it favored dry moorland plants (1734). Additionally, five studies found that excluding livestock did not affect Sphagnum moss cover (1734).",

One replicated, paired, controlled study in a bog in the UK found that plots burned more frequently contained more biomass of grass-like plants, but less total vegetation, shrub and bryophyte biomass (1774). One replicated, controlled study in a bog in the UK found that burning reduced or limited plant species richness (1774).
