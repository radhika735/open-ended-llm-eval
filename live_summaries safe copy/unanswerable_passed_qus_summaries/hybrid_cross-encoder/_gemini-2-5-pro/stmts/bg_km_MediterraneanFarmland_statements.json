However, information on the effects of each method was available. Adding compost was found to increase soil organic matter (1362), nutrients (1362), and microbial biomass (1362) in several studies. It may also enhance soil stability (1362) and, in some instances, crop yields (1346). On the other hand, some studies noted an increase in greenhouse gas emissions (1362) and nutrient runoff (1377) with compost application. Growing cover crops, particularly in Mediterranean-type climates, was shown to increase soil organic matter and carbon (1345, 898). They also improved soil structure, nutrient retention, and nitrogen levels (898, 1345). Additionally, cover crops were found to boost microbial biomass (898, 1345), reduce soil erosion (1345), and could increase the yield of the following crop (898). Incorporating leys into crop rotation may reduce the need for fertilizer for subsequent crops (900).",

One study in the Netherlands found that ditches managed under agri-environment schemes had a higher number of amphibian species and abundance, compared to conventionally managed ditches (818). Further studies in Denmark, Sweden, and Taiwan found that payments to farmers led to the creation of amphibian breeding habitat or increased frog or toad populations (818). Thirty-two studies, predominately in the UK and Switzerland, evaluated the effects of paying farmers to cover the costs of conservation measures on butterflies and moths. These studies found that the species richness, diversity, and abundance of butterflies and moths on land managed under agri-environment schemes was higher than on conventional fields or farms (3915). One replicated site comparison from the USA found more weeds in orchards next to restored riparian habitats, compared to remnant habitats (1402). One replicated site comparison in the USA found similar amounts of water, in soils, in restored and remnant riparian habitats (1388).",
