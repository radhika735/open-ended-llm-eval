No evidence was found for the effects of using prescribed fire to remove invasive plant species on forests [1196]. In relation to the mechanical or manual removal of invasive plants, one replicated, controlled study in Hawaii found that the removal of invasive grass species increased understory plant biomass, while another replicated, controlled study in the USA found no effect of invasive shrub removal on understory plant diversity [1228]. Furthermore, a replicated, controlled study in Ghana found that the removal of invasive weed species increased tree seedling height, but a replicated, controlled study in Hawaii found no effect of invasive plant removal on the growth rate of native species [1228].",
