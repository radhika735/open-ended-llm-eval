Fifty studies found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased forb species richness in 71% of cases and increased the cover or density of forb species in three of four studies. Sowing seeds at a higher density can improve success rates, with one study showing increased forb species richness and another showing increased forb cover (Action 3405). Disturbing soil before seeding/planting enhances establishment success, with studies showing increased forb species richness in most cases compared to harrowing and increased forb cover (Action 3413). Five studies found that disturbing soil before sowing seeds increased plant emergence in most cases compared to sowing alone. Applying herbicide before seeding can improve results, with one study finding increased sown species richness and improved cover of sown grass species (Action 3418). However, this method showed mixed effects on native forb species. Planting grassland plants (transplants) showed promising results with one study finding increased species richness of forbs in 83% of cases, though this method may be more labor-intensive than seeding (Action 3399).",

      "relevant_summary": "Based on the available action documents, the direct impacts of sowing native grass and forb seeds on pollinator populations are not extensively documented. The primary action document on \"Sow native grass and forbs\" (action 3432) focuses on vegetation community responses and shows that sowing native grass and forb seeds increases forb species richness in 71% of cases and increases the cover or density of forb species. However, this document does not contain specific information about pollinator population impacts.\n\nRelated pollinator research shows that native plant restoration can benefit pollinators. Hedgerows planted with native vegetation support more bee species compared to unplanted field edges, with more bee species found on native plants compared to non-native plants in old hedgerows (action 2515). Gardens planted with native plants attract more wild bee species and individuals compared to conventionally managed gardens (action 1). Dedicated floral resources on farmland, including native flowering plants, show substantial numbers of wild bees foraging, with recorded bee species ranging from eight to 35 (action 17). Planted flower strips increase wild bee species and individuals in some comparisons, and some planted flower species are more attractive to pollinators than others (actions 1406, 2468).\n\nThe restoration of habitat along watercourses shows similar numbers of bees and bee species in restored sites compared to remnant sites, though with different bee communities and plant-insect interactions (action 1408).",

      "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence, the effects of burning vegetation on grassland species richness show mixed results depending on timing and context. Four studies from the USA found that overall species richness did not vary between burned areas, or areas burned recently, and unburned sites (Action 322). Studies on prescribed fire in grasslands found that shrubland plots and grass field margins managed by burning had a similar species richness of butterflies to those which were unburned, while pastures managed by patch-burning had a lower species richness of butterflies than rotationally grazed pastures but a higher species richness than continuously grazed pastures (Action 3882). For reptile communities, two of three studies found that areas with annual burning had similar reptile species richness and diversity compared to unburned areas, while one study found that burned areas had higher reptile species richness than unburned areas (Action 3651). Under rotational burning management, two studies found that pine-oak barrens and semi-natural grasslands managed by rotational burning every 2 years or 2-5 years had a higher species richness of butterflies than unmanaged sites or sites managed by annual burning, though one study also found that the species richness of grassland butterflies was lower in prairies managed by rotational burning than in unmanaged prairies in one of two regions (Action 3883). Two studies in fens and bogs found that burning increased plant species richness or diversity, while one study reported that burning typically had no effect on plant species richness and diversity (Action 1763).",

      "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence, fertilizer addition appears to be more consistently effective for increasing vegetation cover than mycorrhiza inoculation. For fertilizer treatments, six of nine studies found that adding fertilizer alongside sowing or planting increased vegetation cover in all or some cases (Action 3427). One study in Iceland found that adding fertilizer and sowing seeds increased vegetation cover in two of three cases (Action 1704). For mycorrhiza inoculation, the evidence is more mixed and primarily relates to inoculation before rather than after seeding. One study found that inoculating soil with mycorrhizal fungi before sowing seeds initially increased vegetation cover, but after three years, vegetation cover did not differ between areas that were and were not inoculated (Action 3429). Another study found that adding soil microbes and nutrients when planting grass plugs did not change the overall cover of herbaceous species (Action 3429). However, one study found that adding mycorrhiza to soil and sowing seeds increased the abundance of target species considered a local conservation priority (Action 3429). The available studies do not provide direct comparative evidence between fertilizer and mycorrhiza inoculation specifically after seeding for vegetation cover outcomes.",
