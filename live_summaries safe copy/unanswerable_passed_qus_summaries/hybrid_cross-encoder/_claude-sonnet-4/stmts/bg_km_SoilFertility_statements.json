For adding mulch to crops (Action 887), one trial showed that mulch improved soil structure and increased soil organic matter, along with benefits including increased soil animal and fungal numbers, diversity and activity, higher nutrient levels, increased soil stability, reduced soil erosion and runoff, increased soil moisture, and increased yields. For growing cover crops beneath the main crop (Action 897), two controlled trials from India and South Africa found that soil organic matter increased under cover crops, though one trial from Germany found no effect on soil organic matter levels. Cover crops also showed benefits including increased bacterial numbers and activity, and reduced erosion. For growing cover crops when the field is empty (Action 898), one replicated study from Denmark and one review based mainly in Japan found increased soil carbon levels under cover crops, and one replicated study from Denmark and three controlled studies found increased nitrogen and carbon levels under cover crops.",

However, these studies do not address drone-based application methods or precision agriculture technologies. One action mentions drone use in agriculture but only for crop protection from mammals rather than fertilizer application (Action 2481).",

The action documents focus primarily on the effectiveness and benefits of crop rotation practices rather than adoption barriers. Action 719 demonstrates that crop rotation in potato farming systems has been studied in Canada and the USA, showing effectiveness in reducing pest populations and crop diseases, increasing crop yield in some years, and increasing profit. Action 857 shows that crop rotation studies from Canada found benefits including increased soil biodiversity, reduced erosion, and increased soil organic carbon and matter. Action 113 indicates that training for land managers, farmers and farm advisers can improve implementation quality, suggesting that lack of training or knowledge may be a barrier, though this was not specifically studied in relation to crop rotation or in Canada. However, none of the action documents specifically identify or analyze social barriers that prevent Canadian farmers from adopting crop rotation practices.",
