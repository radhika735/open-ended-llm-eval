Action 1046 indicates that double fyke nets were effective in catching bullfrog tadpoles in small shallow ponds in Belgium. For adult removal, Action 1045 shows that while catchability of adult bullfrogs in small shallow ponds using one double fyke net for 24 hours was very low in Belgium, bullfrog adults can be captured overnight in a single trap floating on the water surface in the USA. However, Action 1045 also found that bullfrog populations rapidly rebounded following intensive removal of adults, suggesting that adult removal alone may not be sustainable. Combination treatments appear more effective, with Action 1045 and 1046 both noting significant reductions in bullfrog numbers when shooting of metamorphosed individuals and juvenile removal by trapping were carried out as part of combination treatments in France. Chemical control is also possible, with Action 1048 identifying several biocides that killed American bullfrogs, including caffeine (10% solution), chloroxylenol (5% solution), and combined Permethrin (4.6% solution) and Rotenone (1% solution). However, no direct evidence was found for pond draining or pond destruction methods (Actions 1042 and 1043).",

Regarding biological control using northern pike, one replicated, controlled study conducted in Belgium found the introduction of the northern pike led to a strong decline in bullfrog tadpole numbers (Action 1039). For direct removal of adults, the evidence shows mixed results: one replicated study in Belgium found catchability of adult bullfrogs in small shallow ponds using one double fyke net for 24 h to be very low, one small study in the USA found that bullfrog adults can be captured overnight in a single trap floating on the water surface, and one replicated, controlled study in the USA found that bullfrog populations rapidly rebounded following intensive removal of the adults (Action 1045). One before-and-after study in France found a significant reduction in the number of recorded adults and juveniles following the shooting of metamorphosed individuals before reproduction, when carried out as part of a combination treatment (Action 1045). The documents do not provide specific cost-effectiveness comparisons between these two methods.",
