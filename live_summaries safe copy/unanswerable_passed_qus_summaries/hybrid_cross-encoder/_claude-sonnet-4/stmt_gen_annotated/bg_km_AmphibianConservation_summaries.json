    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents reviewed, pond restoration appears to be an effective method for amphibian habitat restoration. Action 878 shows that pond restoration increased numbers of amphibian species, maintained or increased populations, or increased pond occupancy and ponds with breeding success in six replicated, before-and-after studies in Denmark, Estonia, Italy and the UK. Additionally, pond restoration increased the number of ponds used by breeding natterjack toads, and restored and created ponds were colonized by 1-7 species, with 6-65% of ponds colonized and 35% used for breeding.\n\nWetland restoration is also effective, with action 879 showing that in 89% of cases from a global review, restored and created wetlands had similar or higher amphibian abundance or numbers of species to natural wetlands. Seven of nine studies found that wetland restoration increased numbers of amphibian species, with breeding populations establishing in some cases.\n\nPayment schemes to farmers (action 818) created amphibian breeding habitat or increased frog or toad populations in three studies in Denmark, Sweden and Taiwan, and ditches managed under agri-environment schemes had higher numbers of amphibian species and higher abundance than those managed conventionally.\n\nHowever, the documents do not provide specific cost comparisons between different restoration methods to definitively identify the most cost-effective approach.",

Thirty-four studies (of which 21 were replicated and controlled and seven also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found some positive effects on earthworms, some invertebrates (other than earthworms), weeds or farmland birds, of reducing tillage compared to conventional management. Positive effects included increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms, greater abundance of some invertebrates other than earthworms, increased numbers of some weeds and/or weed species, higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying date and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields, and greater abundance of some birds - including Eurasian skylark, seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in late winter on non-inversion or conservation tillage. A review found tillage had negative effects on invertebrate numbers and no-till systems had more invertebrate bird food resources.\\nTwenty-six studies (of which 13 replicated and controlled and three also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found reducing tillage had either negative, no effect or no consistent effects on abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates (other than earthworms), earthworm abundance, biomass, or species richness, number of different plant species found as seeds, number of some weed species, mammal abundance, some bird species, and one study found bird preferences for conservation tillage fields decreased over time.

Seven of eight studies in Germany, Canada and the USA found that barrier fencing with culverts decreased amphibian road deaths during breeding migrations (Action 756). The importance of acoustic communication for amphibian breeding is demonstrated by studies showing that frogs only bred when recorded mating calls were played in captivity (Action 1881), and that clutch size increased when playing recorded mating calls (Action 1881). Additionally, providing appropriate calling sites promoted breeding behavior in captive frogs (Action 1876). While there is currently no evidence found in the action documents for the specific effects of reducing noise pollution by restricting development activities on wildlife populations (Action 1562), the critical role of acoustic communication in amphibian breeding suggests that traffic noise pollution could potentially interfere with breeding success.",

The documents primarily focus on conservation actions rather than identifying specific vulnerable species. However, several relevant findings emerge: One study mentioned in action 820 found that natterjack toad populations were better protected at sites with statutory habitat protection. Action 821 references a study showing that natterjack toad populations did not increase following common toad control, suggesting these species may face competitive pressures. Action 599 indicates that captive breeding can have deleterious effects on genetic fitness, with studies finding evidence for potentially deleterious physiological or genetic changes due to captive breeding, including reduced genetic diversity in captive populations compared to wild populations. Action 871 reports that 41% of release programmes of captive-bred or head-started amphibians showed evidence of breeding in the wild for multiple generations. Action 2475 notes that artificial insemination using preserved genetic material can increase genetic diversity and lower inbreeding in captive populations. However, the action documents do not specifically identify which amphibian species are most genetically vulnerable to climate change or provide comparative genetic vulnerability assessments across species.",
