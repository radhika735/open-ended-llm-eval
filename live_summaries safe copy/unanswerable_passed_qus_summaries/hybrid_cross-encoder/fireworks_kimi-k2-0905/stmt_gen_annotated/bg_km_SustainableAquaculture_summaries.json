Additionally, preventing biofouling through regular cleaning and maintenance of culture systems (Action 2162), and sourcing fish stock from disease-free hatcheries (Action 2159) are recommended practices. However, it should be noted that most of these interventions lack specific studies evaluating their effects on tilapia specifically, with many studies stating 'we found no studies' that directly evaluated the effectiveness of these interventions.",
