    "relevant_summary": "Based on available studies examining prescribed fire effects on bog vegetation composition, research shows that repeated burning has measurable effects on plant communities. In bogs, studies found that increased burning frequency results in higher moss cover (including Sphagnum species) while reducing heather cover. For herbaceous vegetation, results are mixed - one study found burning increased cottongrass cover after 8-18 years while another found no short-term effects (2-7 months). Burning reduces purple moor grass cover and shows variable effects on other grass-like plants and forbs. Studies also report that plant species richness and diversity may be reduced or limited by burning treatments. However, it's important to note that no studies specifically monitored vegetation changes for 30 years or longer - the longest reported monitoring periods were up to 20 years in one experimental set-up in UK bogs.",
