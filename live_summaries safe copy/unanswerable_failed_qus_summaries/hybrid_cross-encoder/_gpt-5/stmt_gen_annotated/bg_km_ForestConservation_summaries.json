    "relevant_summary": "Across studies, several forest management actions have been associated with increases in understory plant richness and/or diversity. Logging/removing trees increased understory plant density/cover in five of 10 studies and increased species richness/diversity in four of seven studies, with other studies reporting no or mixed effects (1273). Season of harvest showed no effect on plant species richness/diversity in one replicated study comparing summer vs winter logging (1216). Thinning trees increased understory density/cover in 17 of 25 studies and increased richness/diversity in 13 of 19 studies, though some studies reported no or mixed effects and one reported decreased herbaceous abundance (1211). Prescribed fire showed mixed outcomes: some studies found increases in cover, density, biomass and richness/diversity, while others found decreases or no effect (1221). Girdling to thin trees increased understory plant species richness, diversity and cover in one before-and-after trial (1226). Vegetation removal combined with mechanical soil disturbance increased understory cover and diversity in two studies and decreased shrub cover in one study; one study also found increased density of young trees (1274). Group-selection harvesting had mixed results, with some studies reporting increased understory cover/diversity and young tree density, and others reporting decreased richness/biomass or no effect (1224). Shelterwood harvesting increased understory abundance, species richness and diversity in six of seven studies, though one study found decreased richness/abundance and another found no effect on tree abundance (1223).",

One study in Saint Kitts\\u00a0found that attending an educational summer camp on turtle conservation had mixed effects on reported behaviours in relation to sea turtles of attendees and their parents/guardians, and mixed effects on whether they took part in conservation activities after the camp.
