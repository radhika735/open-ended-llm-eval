Evidence on reducing fertilizer inputs was mixed: some studies reported positive effects on invertebrates, while others found no or inconsistent effects, and two UK studies reported higher earthworm biomass or abundance where fertilizer inputs were not reduced; reducing two or more inputs (e.g., fertilizers with herbicides/pesticides) often showed positive effects on invertebrates and soil organisms, though negative or null effects were also recorded [139]. In permanent grasslands, stopping fertilizer inputs increased plant species richness and attracted higher abundance or species richness of some or all invertebrates in several studies; one review reported higher densities of some invertebrates in unfertilized plots than in nitrogen‑fertilized plots, whereas another review found no clear effect on soil‑dwelling invertebrate density, and one replicated UK study observed lower invertebrate abundance under reduced fertilizer inputs but differences were not significant [694].",

Implementing food labelling schemes relating to biodiversity-friendly farming (including organic or LEAF marque) has no captured evidence for effects on farmland wildlife or bird populations [71, 170]. Providing or retaining set‑aside areas in farmland shows multiple studies from Europe and North America where more species or higher densities used set‑aside than crops, with some studies finding fewer species or lower densities; productivity effects were mixed, and naturally regenerated set‑aside held more birds and species than sown set‑aside [175].",
