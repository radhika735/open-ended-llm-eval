    "relevant_summary": "The action documents database does not contain specific information about precision agriculture techniques such as variable rate fertilizer application and their effects on soil invertebrate communities. However, related research on fertilizer use and tillage practices provides some relevant insights on soil invertebrates. Studies on reducing fertilizer use generally found that areas treated with organic rather than mineral fertilizers supported increased earthworm abundance, diversity, biomass and density and increased abundance and/or species richness of some or all invertebrates investigated (action 134). Reducing fertilizer, pesticide or herbicide use generally found benefits to some invertebrates in 34 out of 38 studies, though some studies also found negative, mixed, minimal or no effects on some invertebrates (action 139). No-tillage cultivation found more earthworms in soils without tillage compared to soils with tillage, similar numbers of nematodes but different communities of nematodes, and different communities of mites but similar numbers of mites (action 2306). Reduced tillage systems found more microbial biomass in some comparisons, similar numbers of mites and nematodes but differences in mite and nematode communities, and more earthworms in fields with fewer passes of the plough in one of three comparisons (action 2307). Reducing tillage generally found positive effects including increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms and greater abundance of some invertebrates other than earthworms in 34 studies, though 26 studies found negative, no effect or no consistent effects on some invertebrates and earthworms (action 126).",

One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done.

    "relevant_summary": "Agricultural subsidy policies across Europe influence biodiversity-friendly farming practices primarily through agri-environment schemes and cross-compliance standards. Studies from multiple European countries demonstrate that paying farmers to cover conservation costs through agri-environment schemes produces mixed but generally positive biodiversity outcomes. For birds, 22 of 25 European studies found higher population densities or more positive population trends on agri-environment scheme sites compared to conventional sites, though 15 studies also found some species showed no difference or negative effects (Action ID: 172). For invertebrates, studies show variable results with six studies finding maintenance or little effect on diversity and abundance, while five studies found increases in abundance or species richness of some invertebrates (Action ID: 700). Three studies found population increases of specific bird species after introduction of specially-designed agri-environment schemes, including cirl buntings, corncrakes and Eurasian thick-knees (Action ID: 172). However, policy implementation faces challenges - a review found that while the amount of land entering agri-environment schemes was on target, some options were not being used at high enough rates to help many species (Action ID: 172). Additionally, one study found that many agri-environment scheme farms were sited in areas where they were unlikely to be effective (Action ID: 172). For wild bees specifically, four replicated trials in Europe showed enhanced diversity and abundance on land managed under various European agri-environment schemes, while four other trials found no enhancement (Action ID: 24). Training and advisory services show promise for uptake, with one UK study reporting 82% of landowners who received advice about agri-environment schemes submitted applications with a 90% success rate (Action ID: 3846). Cross-compliance standards linked to all subsidy payments have limited evidence - no studies were found comparing their effects with other agri-environmental measures or monitoring before and after implementation (Action ID: 173).",

Creating uncultivated margins around intensive arable or pasture fields, where studies found these margins support more invertebrates than conventionally managed field margins or other field margin options, with increased abundance or biomass of species in naturally regenerated margins (action 63). Leaving cultivated, uncropped margins or plots, which provide benefits including increased species richness and abundance of spiders, abundance of ground-dwelling invertebrates and ground beetles, and increased species richness of bumblebees (action 562). Undersowing spring cereals with clover, which benefited arthropod abundance and species richness, and increased bumblebee, butterfly, ground beetle, spider and springtail abundances (action 136). Converting to organic farming shows greater species richness and abundance of butterflies, burnet moths, and all moths than conventionally managed farms (action 3907), though this may involve higher conversion costs compared to the margin-based approaches.",
