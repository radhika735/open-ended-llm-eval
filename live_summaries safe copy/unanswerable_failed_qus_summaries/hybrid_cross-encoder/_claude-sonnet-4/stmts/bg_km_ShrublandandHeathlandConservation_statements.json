Action 1665 specifically states that no studies were found that evaluated the effects of planting vegetation to act as a buffer to exclude pollution on shrublands. Similarly, Action 1618 indicates that no studies were found that evaluated the effects of creating buffer zones beside roads and other transportation corridors on shrublands. The systematic searches conducted for these actions have not yet identified any studies that directly evaluated these interventions for shrubland ecosystems, meaning the effectiveness and potential impacts remain unknown.",
