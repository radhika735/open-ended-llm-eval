      "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents reviewed, several methods show effectiveness for restoring understory plant diversity after logging. Natural regeneration appears to be a cost-effective approach, with four studies in different countries showing that encouraging natural regeneration in former logged forests can restore species richness and diversity over time (Action 3876). Tree thinning shows strong evidence of effectiveness, with thirteen of 19 studies finding that thinning trees in forests increased species richness and diversity of understory plants, and seventeen of 25 studies showing increased density and cover (Action 1211). Prescribed fire also demonstrates effectiveness, with fourteen of 24 studies finding it increased species richness and diversity of understory plants (Action 1221). Group-selection harvesting showed mixed results, with four of eight studies finding it increased cover and diversity of understory plants (Action 1224). Simple methods like removing or disturbing leaf litter showed that this increased understory plant species richness in one study, though it decreased cover (Action 1246). The evidence suggests that both passive approaches like natural regeneration and active management techniques like tree thinning can be effective for understory restoration, though the documents do not provide specific cost comparisons between methods.",

      "relevant_summary": "Based on the available action documents, there is limited evidence specifically about education programmes and forest conservation in South America. For forest education programmes specifically, no evidence was found for their effect on forests (Action 1158). However, there is some relevant evidence from South America regarding education and conservation programmes more broadly. One study from Venezuela found no evidence for decreases in yellow-shouldered parrot poaching following an educational programme in local schools, though the authors argued that benefits would likely be seen later in the project (Action 274). In terms of community-based forest management approaches (which often include educational components), one replicated, site comparison study in Colombia found that deforestation rates in community-managed forests did not differ from deforestation rates in forests that were not managed by local communities, or in uninhabited national parks (Action 1152). Related evidence from community engagement in conservation activities shows some positive results - a site comparison study in Brazil found that areas where community-based management of fishing practices was implemented had higher abundance of river turtles than areas with no community-based management (Action 3681).",
