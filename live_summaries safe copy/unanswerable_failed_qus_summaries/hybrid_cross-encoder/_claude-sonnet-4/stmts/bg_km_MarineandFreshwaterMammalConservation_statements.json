      "relevant_summary": "Based on the available action documents, there is insufficient evidence to determine which approach is more effective for seal conservation. Action 2921 found no studies that evaluated the effects of creating artificial habitat for marine and freshwater mammals. Action 2922 similarly found no studies that evaluated leaving anthropogenic structures in place after decommissioning on marine and freshwater mammal populations. The only specific evidence for marine mammals was found in Action 2930, which showed that translocating Hawaiian monk seals resulted in 50-83% survival rates for at least one year, with more than a quarter of translocated seals reproducing, and survival rates similar to or greater than non-translocated pups. However, this action involved translocation rather than habitat creation or restoration. Action 367 provided evidence that restored or created coastal and intertidal wetlands were used by target bird species, with numbers and/or diversity at least as high as in natural wetlands in some cases. Action 2258 showed that artificial reefs can support marine invertebrate communities, though community composition differed from natural reefs and species richness was often lower. Action 2265 found that habitat restoration to offset lost habitat was colonized by over 198 invertebrate species. The evidence base specifically addressing seal habitat restoration versus artificial habitat creation is currently lacking.",
