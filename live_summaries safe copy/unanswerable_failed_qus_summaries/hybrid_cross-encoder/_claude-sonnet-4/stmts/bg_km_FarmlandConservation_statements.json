However, related research on fertilizer use and tillage practices provides some relevant insights on soil invertebrates. Studies on reducing fertilizer use generally found that areas treated with organic rather than mineral fertilizers supported increased earthworm abundance, diversity, biomass and density and increased abundance and/or species richness of some or all invertebrates investigated (action 134). Reducing fertilizer, pesticide or herbicide use generally found benefits to some invertebrates in 34 out of 38 studies, though some studies also found negative, mixed, minimal or no effects on some invertebrates (action 139). No-tillage cultivation found more earthworms in soils without tillage compared to soils with tillage, similar numbers of nematodes but different communities of nematodes, and different communities of mites but similar numbers of mites (action 2306). Reduced tillage systems found more microbial biomass in some comparisons, similar numbers of mites and nematodes but differences in mite and nematode communities, and more earthworms in fields with fewer passes of the plough in one of three comparisons (action 2307). Reducing tillage generally found positive effects including increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms and greater abundance of some invertebrates other than earthworms in 34 studies, though 26 studies found negative, no effect or no consistent effects on some invertebrates and earthworms (action 126).",

      "relevant_summary": "Agricultural subsidy policies across Europe influence biodiversity-friendly farming practices primarily through agri-environment schemes and cross-compliance standards. Studies from multiple European countries demonstrate that paying farmers to cover conservation costs through agri-environment schemes produces mixed but generally positive biodiversity outcomes. For birds, 22 of 25 European studies found higher population densities or more positive population trends on agri-environment scheme sites compared to conventional sites, though 15 studies also found some species showed no difference or negative effects (Action ID: 172). For invertebrates, studies show variable results with six studies finding maintenance or little effect on diversity and abundance, while five studies found increases in abundance or species richness of some invertebrates (Action ID: 700). Three studies found population increases of specific bird species after introduction of specially-designed agri-environment schemes, including cirl buntings, corncrakes and Eurasian thick-knees (Action ID: 172). However, policy implementation faces challenges - a review found that while the amount of land entering agri-environment schemes was on target, some options were not being used at high enough rates to help many species (Action ID: 172). Additionally, one study found that many agri-environment scheme farms were sited in areas where they were unlikely to be effective (Action ID: 172). For wild bees specifically, four replicated trials in Europe showed enhanced diversity and abundance on land managed under various European agri-environment schemes, while four other trials found no enhancement (Action ID: 24). Training and advisory services show promise for uptake, with one UK study reporting 82% of landowners who received advice about agri-environment schemes submitted applications with a 90% success rate (Action ID: 3846). Cross-compliance standards linked to all subsidy payments have limited evidence - no studies were found comparing their effects with other agri-environmental measures or monitoring before and after implementation (Action ID: 173).",

Creating uncultivated margins around intensive arable or pasture fields, where studies found these margins support more invertebrates than conventionally managed field margins or other field margin options, with increased abundance or biomass of species in naturally regenerated margins (action 63). Leaving cultivated, uncropped margins or plots, which provide benefits including increased species richness and abundance of spiders, abundance of ground-dwelling invertebrates and ground beetles, and increased species richness of bumblebees (action 562). Undersowing spring cereals with clover, which benefited arthropod abundance and species richness, and increased bumblebee, butterfly, ground beetle, spider and springtail abundances (action 136). Converting to organic farming shows greater species richness and abundance of butterflies, burnet moths, and all moths than conventionally managed farms (action 3907), though this may involve higher conversion costs compared to the margin-based approaches.",

Action 134 found that areas treated with organic rather than mineral fertilizers supported increased earthworm abundance, diversity, biomass and density, and increased abundance and/or species richness of some or all invertebrates investigated in fourteen studies. A literature review found organic fertilizers without pesticides produced highest earthworm biomass. Action 1366 found that one study showed fewer nematodes and fewer mites in plots with organic fertilizer compared to inorganic fertilizer, while another study found fewer bacteria in soils with organic fertilizer.
