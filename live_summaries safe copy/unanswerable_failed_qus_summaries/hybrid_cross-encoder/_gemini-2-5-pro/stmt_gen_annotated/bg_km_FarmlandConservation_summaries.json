    "relevant_summary": "Agri-environment schemes that pay farmers for conservation measures have shown varied effects on European wildlife. For birds, while twenty-four studies found increases in population sizes or densities on scheme sites (700), and twenty-two studies showed similar positive trends (172), other studies found negative or no effects (700, 172). However, specially-designed schemes have led to population increases for cirl buntings, corncrakes and Eurasian thick-knees (172). The impact on wild bees is also mixed, with some European trials showing enhanced diversity and abundance (24), while others, including landscape-scale studies in the UK, found no such enhancements (24).\n\nFor butterflies and moths, the evidence is more consistently positive. Twelve of fifteen studies in the UK, Switzerland, and Sweden reported higher species richness or diversity on lands in agri-environment schemes, and seventeen of nineteen studies found higher abundance (3915). However, some studies noted similar or lower abundance compared to conventionally managed or unmanaged lands (3915). Specific practices like undersowing spring cereals with legumes have shown higher butterfly richness in some contexts (3926) but not others (3926).\n\nEffects on other wildlife are also variable. Payments to farmers in Denmark and Sweden helped create amphibian breeding habitat and increase populations (818), and managed ditches in the Netherlands had higher amphibian species numbers (818). For mammals, agri-environment schemes were associated with increased brown hare density in one UK region but not another and had no effect on Irish hare numbers in Northern Ireland (2387). Small mammal abundance did increase in scheme-managed field margins in the UK (2387). Conversely, studies on bats in the UK found that agri-environment schemes did not lead to significant increases in bat activity, with one study even recording lower activity (962).",

Six studies from the Netherlands, Switzerland and the UK (including one review and four replicated studies of which one was also controlled and one a randomized and controlled before-and-after trial) found that stopping fertilizer inputs in permanent grassland resulted in an increase in plant species richness, reduced the rate of plant species loss and attracted a higher abundance or species richness of some or all invertebrates studied. One review from the Netherlands found that low fertilizer input grasslands favour common meadow bird species. One review found a study showing that densities of some invertebrates were higher in unfertilized plots compared with those receiving nitrogen inputs.\\nTwo replicated, controlled trials from the Czech Republic and the UK (one randomized) found that applying fertilizer to permanent grasslands reduced plant species richness or diversity and that the effects on plant communities were still apparent 16 years after the cessation of fertilizer application.\\nFour studies from Ireland, the Netherlands and the UK (including two replicated trials of which one randomized and one controlled and a review) found that reducing fertilizer inputs on grassland had no clear or rapid effect on plant species richness. A review found no clear effect of reducing fertilizer inputs on the density of soil-dwelling invertebrates. One replicated study found that fertilizer treatment only affected seed production of a small number of meadow plants. One replicated study from the UK found lower invertebrate abundance on plots with reduced fertilizer inputs but the differences were not significant.\"\n}"
