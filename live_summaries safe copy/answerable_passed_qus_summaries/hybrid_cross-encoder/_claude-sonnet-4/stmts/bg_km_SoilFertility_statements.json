      "relevant_summary": "Documented benefits of reduced tillage systems on European farms include several soil and environmental improvements. Multiple studies from European countries found increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage (action 906). Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA found higher soil organic carbon in soils under no-tillage or reduced tillage systems compared to conventionally tilled soil (action 906). Studies from Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Switzerland and the UK found positive effects on farmland wildlife, including increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms, greater abundance of some invertebrates, increased numbers of some weeds and/or weed species, higher Eurasian skylark nest density, and greater abundance of some birds including seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in late winter (action 126). Seven replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing (action 906). Studies from European countries found reduced tillage maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure, with higher nutrient retention (action 906).\n\nDocumented harms include increased soil compaction in some cases, with three replicated trials from Australia, Canada, and Europe finding higher compaction under reduced tillage (action 906). Some European studies found negative effects or no consistent effects on abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates and earthworms, number of different plant species found as seeds, and some bird species (action 126). Crop yield impacts varied by crop type: studies from Spain found lower cereal and legume yields in some comparisons with reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage, though other studies found higher or similar yields (action 1359). Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover (action 906). Three replicated trials from Europe and India found that conventional ploughing increased soil's ability to absorb water and soil water content compared to reduced tillage (action 906).",

      "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, growing cover crops between crop rows and growing them when fields are empty have different effects:\n\n**Cover crops between crop rows (intercropping/living mulches):**\nAction 897 found that cover crops between crop rows increased bacterial numbers and activity, reduced erosion, and increased soil organic matter in some cases. Action 124 showed that intercropping (such as cabbage with French beans or clover) increased ground beetle abundance. Action 1394 found that cover crops (living mulches) between broccoli plants resulted in fewer aphids in some comparisons, but also found fewer parasitized aphids compared to plots without cover crops. Action 1352 showed that ground cover between vine rows in orchards generally resulted in similar grape yields compared to bare soil, with mixed effects on grape quality.\n\n**Cover crops in empty fields (winter cover crops/fallows):**\nAction 1357 found that winter cover crops in arable fields typically reduced water content in soils and decreased water loss through drainage, runoff, or evaporation compared to bare fallows. Action 1351 showed mixed effects on cash crop yields - some studies found lower yields, some higher yields, and many found no differences between plots with or without winter cover crops. Action 1345 demonstrated that winter cover crops increased soil organic matter, nitrogen content, microbial biomass, and reduced soil erosion compared to fields without cover crops. Action 1394 found that winter cover crops reduced weed numbers in most comparisons and showed mixed effects on disease severity.\n\n**Key differences:**\nThe intercropping approach appears to focus more on immediate pest management and maintaining ongoing soil biological activity, while winter cover crops in empty fields provide stronger benefits for soil structure, nutrient retention, erosion control, and water management during non-growing seasons.",

For yield effects, one replicated trial from the USA found higher tomato yield from soils which had been under a ryegrass cover crop.\n\n**Soil Organic Carbon Effects:**\nBoth practices demonstrate positive effects on soil organic carbon. Cover crops showed increased carbon levels across multiple studies (Action 898), while green manures demonstrated higher soil organic carbon in controlled studies (Action 908). When fresh plant material or crop remains are incorporated into soil, six studies from China, Denmark and India found higher carbon levels when plant material was added (Action 910).\n\n**Crop Yield Effects:**\nGreen manures resulted in increased grain yields in studies from India and Pakistan (Action 908). Cover crops showed higher tomato yield in one USA trial (Action 898). Manures and agricultural composts, which share similarities with green manures, showed higher crop yields in four controlled, replicated studies from India, Spain and Turkey, with one study finding higher yields when manure was applied in combination with cover crops (Action 911).\n\nThe soil types covered for green manures included clay loam, while cover crops were tested across a broader range including clay, loam, sandy clay, sandy-loam, silty-clay, and silty-loam soils (Actions 908, 898).",

Reduced tillage and no-tillage practices generally demonstrate benefits for soil organic matter, with multiple studies finding higher soil organic carbon and organic matter content compared to conventional tillage (actions 906, 1369, 1371). Benefits for soil organisms include increased microbial biomass, earthworm abundance, and improved biodiversity of soil fauna under reduced and no-tillage systems (actions 906, 126, 1369, 1371, 2306, 2307). For nutrient retention, reduced tillage shows mixed but generally positive effects, with studies finding higher nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium levels in some comparisons, though results vary by location and conditions (actions 1369, 1371). Soil structure benefits include improved water-stability of aggregates and reduced soil erosion under reduced tillage systems (actions 906, 1369, 1371). However, drawbacks include potential soil compaction issues, with studies showing higher compaction under reduced tillage in some cases (action 906). For drought conditions, conventional ploughing showed better soil water absorption and content compared to reduced tillage (action 906). Some studies found lower crop yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage (action 906). Greenhouse gas emissions show mixed results, with some studies finding increased carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions under no-tillage systems (actions 1369, 1371). Timing modifications, such as delaying ploughing until spring on sandy loam soils, can reduce soil loss and nitrate leaching (action 712). The effectiveness of different tillage practices varies depending on specific soil conditions, climate, and management practices, with sandy loam soils covered in studies from multiple European countries showing these varied responses.",

Soil amendments are effective, including adding organic processing wastes or their composts which improve soil structure and reduce soil loss according to trials from Spain and the UK (Action 891). Fresh plant material or crop remains can be incorporated, with one study from India finding improved soil structure when straw was incorporated (Action 910). Manures and agricultural composts increase soil organic matter, create larger soil aggregations and have positive effects on soil physical properties according to studies from Denmark and Germany (Action 911). Mixed organic and inorganic amendments can be more effective than inorganic fertilizers alone, with one controlled trial from India finding mixed amendments more effective at reducing soil crack size in dry soil (Action 902). \n\nCover crops improve soil structure when fields are empty, with three randomized studies from Denmark, Turkey and the UK finding that growing cover crops improved soil structure, including higher soil porosity, interconnectivity and lower soil resistance (Action 898). Adding mulch to crops improves soil structure and increases soil organic matter according to trials from Canada, Poland and Spain (Action 887). Retaining crop residues increases soil organic carbon and nitrogen, with two randomized trials from Australia and China finding these benefits (Action 907).\n\nTillage modifications also improve soil structure. Changing tillage practices, specifically reducing tillage, increases soil organic carbon and organic matter with improved soil structure, as found in twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA (Action 906). Controlling traffic and timing reduces compaction and increases soil porosity, with five trials from Europe and Australia finding less compaction, reduced runoff and increased water filtration (Action 899).

Retaining crop residues provides benefits, with one replicated study from Mexico finding higher microbial biomass when crop residues were retained (action 907). Adding fresh plant material or crop remains also increases microbial biomass according to one randomized, replicated experiment from Belgium (action 910).

In terms of soil and fertilizer management, one replicated study from Denmark found that reducing the extent of grass pasture in leys reduced the undesirable uptake of nitrogen by grasses, therefore requiring lower rates of fertilizer for subsequent crops (Action ID 900). For pest management and biodiversity, a controlled study in Finland found that creating clover leys resulted in higher spider abundance and fewer pest insects than a barley control plot (Action ID 643). However, the duration of leys affects their ecological value, as a study in the UK found that one-year ley plots had significantly lower earthworm species richness and abundance than three-and-a-half-year leys (Action ID 643). In terms of plant diversity, a replicated study in the UK found that grass leys had fewer plant species than nine other conservation measures (Action ID 643). When arable land is converted to permanent grassland, several studies across Europe documented biodiversity benefits for butterflies and moths. Multiple studies in the UK, Finland, Switzerland and Taiwan found that restored grasslands developed butterfly communities increasingly similar to existing high-quality grasslands over time, with higher species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths compared to conventionally managed farmland (Action ID 3929). However, effects on birds are mixed, as all five studies looking at the effects of reverting arable land to grassland found no clear benefit to birds, with one controlled before-and-after study from the UK showing that grey partridge numbers fell significantly following the reversion of arable fields to grassland (Action ID 210). Grass buffer strips and margins around arable fields also provide biodiversity benefits, with multiple studies across Europe and the USA finding higher species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths in grass margins compared to cropped field edges, particularly when margins are wider or floristically enhanced (Action ID 3982).",

Flower planting demonstrated one study found smaller lettuces in fields planted with flowers in five out of six configurations (1360). Compost addition showed three studies found higher crop yields in some comparisons, two found inconsistent differences, three found similar yields, and one found similar yields with added compost regardless of additional fertilizer (1346). Organic farming conversion studies found one trial showed lower yields, while two trials found mixed effects on yield or higher quality fruit (895).",

      "relevant_summary": "Several actions can increase the biodiversity of soil organisms besides crop rotation. Reducing fertilizer, pesticide or herbicide use generally can result in higher diversity of soil invertebrates and microorganisms (action 904). Converting to organic farming has been shown to increase numbers, diversity, functional diversity or activity of soil organisms (action 895). Changing tillage practices, particularly adopting reduced tillage or no-tillage systems, can increase microbes, earthworm species, and microbe activity, with some studies finding more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage (action 906). No-tillage as a main cultivation method specifically increases microbial biomass in some studies and earthworm populations (action 2306). Adding mulch to crops using materials like shredded paper, municipal compost or straw increases soil animal and fungal numbers, diversity and activity (action 887). Amending soil with organic and inorganic amendments increases microbial biomass, activity and diversity (action 902). Adding manures and agricultural composts results in higher microbial biomass and microbial respiration (action 911). Amending soil with crops grown as green manures can increase soil organic carbon which supports soil organisms (action 908). Controlling traffic and traffic timing can result in higher numbers and bacterial activity in soil (action 899).",
