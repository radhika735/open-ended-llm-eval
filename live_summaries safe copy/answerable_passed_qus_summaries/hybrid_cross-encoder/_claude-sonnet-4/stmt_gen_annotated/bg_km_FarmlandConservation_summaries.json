For leaving uncut strips of rye grass: Two reviews and two replicated controlled trials from the UK found that leaving uncut strips of rye grass on silage fields resulted in benefits to birds including increased numbers (Action 132). Seed-eating birds preferred rye grass cut once only, while insect-eating birds showed more variable results with some preferring plots cut two or more times (Action 132). Two reviews and replicated controlled studies found that seed-eating birds were more abundant on uncut plots than on cut plots (Action 224). One study found higher ground beetle species diversity in uncut plots by the third year of the experiment (Action 132). For raising mowing height: A review from the UK found that raising mowing height may have increased productivity of Eurasian skylarks, but not sufficiently to maintain the local population (Action 222). A randomized, replicated and controlled study from the UK found that no more foraging birds were attracted to plots with raised mowing heights, compared to plots with shorter grass (Action 222). Studies found raised cutting heights were less damaging to amphibians and invertebrates, but had no effect on numbers of foraging birds or invertebrates in another trial (Action 138). One study found that northern lapwing and common starling chicks had greater foraging success in shorter grass (Action 138). The evidence suggests uncut strips provide clearer benefits for seed-eating birds, while raising mowing height shows mixed and less consistent results for wildlife benefits in UK grasslands.",

One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage.

One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done.

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from European studies, several management techniques are available to restore or create species-rich wet meadows in agricultural landscapes. From studies across France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Switzerland and the UK, successful restoration techniques include topsoil removal, introduction of target plant species, raising water levels, grazing, mowing, or combinations of topsoil removal with target plant species introduction plus livestock exclusion (Action 119). Water level management is particularly important, with raising water levels in ditches or grassland showing positive effects on bird numbers, plant species that favour wet conditions, and invertebrate numbers in agricultural landscapes, though some studies found net loss of plant species (Action 121). Active water level management, including controlled flooding and water fluctuation, can generate plant communities characteristic of wetter conditions and increase wetland-characteristic species abundance (Action 3038).\n\nTraditional water meadow maintenance involves specific management regimes including grazing and mowing. Mowing once per year in autumn or light grazing with cattle or horses produces similar butterfly species richness (Action 3971). Grazing management shows mixed impacts, with some studies finding benefits for certain species but reduced productivity for others. Studies indicate that cutting in June maintained relatively stable vegetation, while mowing effects on plant species richness were variable (Action 696). For general grassland restoration, effective techniques include grazing, introducing plant species, hay spreading and mowing, with positive restoration signs typically visible within 5-10 years (Action 133).\n\nManagement intensity reduction through several interventions shows benefits, with 22 studies finding positive effects on wildlife groups including plants, invertebrates and birds, though results can be variable depending on the specific interventions applied (Action 69). The timing and type of management is crucial, with species-rich grasslands showing different responses to mowing versus grazing regimes depending on the target species and local conditions (Action 3908).",

Four of these studies found that grasslands managed by cattle, sheep\\u00a0or livestock\\u00a0grazing had a higher abundance of butterflies generally, and individual species of butterflies\\u00a0and moth caterpillars, than grasslands managed by annual mowing, rotational burning\\u00a0or unmanaged grasslands. Three of these studies found that grasslands managed by haying had a higher abundance of individual butterfly species\\u00a0than grasslands managed by grazing\\u00a0or burning\\u00a0or unmanaged grasslands. Four of these studies found that specific butterfly species\\u00a0and all butterflies\\u00a0were less abundant in mown, grazed\\u00a0or rotationally burned\\u00a0grassland than in unmanaged, rotationally burned\\u00a0or grazed and burned grassland.\\u00a0The ninth study found that in some areas, the abundance of specialist and grassland butterflies was higher in prairies managed by two-year rotational haying or by grazing, but in all cases abundance was higher at sites longer after they were last managed. One of three replicated, site comparison studies in Germany\\u00a0and Switzerland\\u00a0found that traditional hay meadows mown once/year in June or July had a higher abundance of heath fritillary adults and caterpillars than old, abandoned meadows. One study found that summer-grazed or mown grasslands had a higher abundance of farmland butterflies and burnet moths, but a lower abundance of woodland butterflies and burnet moths, than abandoned grasslands. The third study found that mown grasslands had a lower abundance of moths than unmown grasslands, but grazed grasslands had a similar abundance of moths to ungrazed grasslands. Two replicated, site comparison studies in China\\u00a0and Switzerland\\u00a0found that semi-natural grasslands managed by grazing\\u00a0or cutting twice/year after mid-June\\u00a0had a lower abundance of marsh fritillary eggs and caterpillars\\u00a0and adult butterflies\\u00a0than ungrazed margins and intercrops\\u00a0or sown wildflower strips. One replicated, site comparison study in Hungary\\u00a0found that semi-natural grasslands managed by either light grazing or mowing once/year in May or June had a higher abundance of butterflies than conventional wheat fields.\\nSurvival (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in China\\u00a0found that marsh fritillary eggs had a similar survival rate in uncultivated, grazed meadows and cultivated, ungrazed field margins and intercrops, but the survival of caterpillars was higher in the grazed meadows.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (5 STUDIES)\\nUse (5 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies in Austria\\u00a0and Germany\\u00a0found that 14 species of moth\\u00a0preferred grazed pastures while 24 others avoided them, and three species of butterfly\\u00a0and ten nocturnal moths\\u00a0preferred mown meadows, while 19 nocturnal moth species avoided them. One replicated, site comparison study in Spain\\u00a0found that meadows managed by summer-grazing or hay-mowing were more likely to be occupied by grizzled skipper and painted lady than unmanaged meadows, but small pearl-bordered fritillary occurred less frequently in grazed meadows than in hay meadows or abandoned meadows. One replicated, site comparison study in Finland and Russia\\u00a0found that three of 37 butterfly species preferred meadows which were mown annually in July or August to cattle-grazed pasture, but the other 34 species showed no preference. One replicated, site comparison study in China\\u00a0found that uncultivated, grazed meadows were less likely to be occupied by marsh fritillary eggs and caterpillars than cultivated field margins and intercrops.\"\n}"

For set-aside areas, 34 studies found that 20 showed benefits to or higher use by all wildlife groups considered, while 12 found some species or groups used set-aside more than crops but others did not, and two studies found no effect (Action 156). A systematic review found significantly higher densities of farmland birds on fields removed from production and under set-aside designation than on conventionally farmed fields in both winter and summer (Action 156). Set-aside areas also showed higher species richness of bees nesting or foraging when annually mown and left to naturally regenerate for two years or more (Action 7). However, set-aside did not enhance small mammal numbers relative to cropland or brown hare numbers relative to farms without set-aside areas (Action 2377).\n\nFor converting arable land to permanent grassland, the evidence shows limited benefits for some wildlife groups but not others. All seven studies looking at the effects of reverting arable land to grassland found no clear benefit to wildlife, including UK birds in winter and summer, wading birds in Denmark, grey partridges, brown hares in the UK, and plants in the Czech Republic (Action 561). One controlled before-and-after study showed that grey partridge numbers fell significantly following the reversion of arable fields to grassland (Action 561, Action 210). However, for butterflies and moths, restored grasslands showed more positive outcomes, with created grasslands having greater species richness of butterflies, burnet moths and all moths than conventionally managed grassland or cultivated farms, and higher abundance of moths than conventional grassland (Action 3929).",

    "relevant_summary": "Several alternatives to direct predator control exist for improving the breeding success of ground-nesting birds on farmland. Leaving cultivated, uncropped margins or plots (including lapwing plots) provides benefits to target farmland bird species, with studies finding increased northern lapwing hatching success and Eurasian skylark nesting success (Action 562). Creating specific skylark plots has shown positive effects, with all studies finding increases in skylark population size, breeding density, duration or success relative to fields without plots (Action 540). Providing set-aside areas in farmland shows benefits, with studies finding higher nest survival or productivity on set-aside than control fields for skylarks (Action 156). Physical protection of individual nests through exclosures offers benefits, with protected nests having higher average daily survival rates than unprotected nests for common redshank and northern lapwing, and higher hatching rates for southern dunlin (Action 108). Protecting nests from livestock trampling through fencing around individual nests has been successful (Action 237). Reducing tillage practices benefits ground-nesting birds, with studies finding higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying dates and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields (Action 126). Providing supplementary food increases farmland bird abundance, breeding population size, body mass, hatching, nestling growth and fledging rates (Action 648). Planting cereals in wide-spaced rows offers benefits over conventional wheat for Eurasian skylarks, though one study found fewer skylark nests than in control fields (Action 216).",

However, some studies found that only certain species benefited - one study found that only Eurasian skylark and Eurasian linnet benefited out of 23 farmland bird species tested, while another found only grey partridge and tree sparrow showed positive population responses (Action 695). For spring sowing, a replicated controlled study from Sweden found more bird species on areas with spring sown cereals compared with winter cereals, and a UK study found several species bred in the study site for the first time after spring sowing began (Action 207). Three studies found population increases after spring sowing began or higher populations on sites with spring-sown cereals compared to sites with winter cereals (Action 207). Five studies found that planting crops in spring rather than autumn resulted in higher numbers of farmland birds (Action 137). However, a replicated study found that winter and spring sown crops were used for different broods by Eurasian skylarks, and hatching success was lower on spring-sown crops than autumn sown (Actions 137, 207). The evidence suggests both practices provide different types of benefits to farmland birds, with overwinter stubbles particularly benefiting seed-eating birds during winter, while spring sowing appears to support breeding bird communities.",

Eight studies from Finland, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and UK found nest boxes in agricultural habitats were occupied by various species including Eurasian kestrel, long-eared owl, starlings, tits, tree sparrow, stock dove, jackdaw, Eurasian wryneck and Eurasian hoopoe (Action 155). Swedish studies showed nest success was related to pasture availability and higher positioning (Action 155). For bumblebees, three UK trials since 1989 showed very low uptake rates of 0-2.5% for various designs, though earlier trials in USA/Canada showed 10-48% uptake (Action 48). Underground nest boxes buried 5-10cm with 30-80cm entrance pipes showed 6-58% occupancy in USA, Canada and UK trials (Action 48).

Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes. In one trial, these introduced species more commonly occupied the boxes than native bees.\\nA small trial tested three soil-filled nest boxes for the mining bee Andrena flavipes in the UK, but they were not occupied.\"\n}"

Two studies found restoration took more than 10 years, and six studies found limited or slow changes in plant communities following restoration (Action 133). \n\nMore specifically, prairies restored 5-10 years ago by seeding with native species, mowing, and weeding or applying herbicide had greater abundance of certain butterfly species than prairies restored 1-2 years ago, and similar abundance to remnant prairies (Action 3943). Grasslands restored from bare soil by seeding developed butterfly communities that were increasingly similar to existing high-quality grasslands over the first 10 years after establishment (Action 3929). Studies found that 4-5-year-old created grasslands had greater species richness of butterflies, burnet moths and all moths than conventionally managed grassland (Action 3929).\n\nHowever, some differences persist over longer periods - two studies found differences in vegetation between restored and existing species-rich grasslands nine or 60 years after restoration (Action 133). The species richness of butterflies on restored grasslands remained similar over time since restoration, showing stability once established (Action 3955).

For invertebrates, 6 out of 10 studies from three European countries showed agri-environment schemes maintained or had little or no effect on some invertebrates in terms of diversity, abundance, species richness or bee colony growth, while five studies found increases in abundance or species richness of some invertebrates (Action 700). Specifically for wild bees, four replicated trials in Europe showed enhanced diversity and/or abundance of foraging wild bees on land managed under various European agri-environment schemes, but four other replicated trials found that the number of bees and/or bee species was not enhanced (Action 24). For amphibians, one replicated study in the Netherlands found that ditches managed under agri-environment schemes had higher numbers of amphibian species and higher abundance than conventionally managed ditches (Action 818).

A literature review found organic fertilizers without pesticides produced highest earthworm biomass (Action 134).

Eleven studies found that undersowing spring cereals benefited some birds, plants, insects, spiders and earthworms (Action 136).

For butterflies specifically, spring barley undersown with a mix of grasses and legumes had higher species richness and abundance of butterflies than extensively or conventionally managed grassland (Action 3926). Studies found higher densities of some study species on undersown fields or margins compared with other fields, or that use of fields increased after they were undersown (Action 208). However, some studies showed mixed results, with five studies finding that undersowing spring cereals did not benefit invertebrates, plants, grey partridge population indicators, or nesting densities of two out of three farmland bird species (Action 136). Compared to conventional tillage practices, reduced tillage systems provide increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms, greater abundance of some invertebrates, increased numbers of some weeds, higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying date and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields (Action 126).",

Thirty-four studies (of which 21 were replicated and controlled and seven also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found some positive effects on earthworms, some invertebrates (other than earthworms), weeds or farmland birds, of reducing tillage compared to conventional management. Positive effects included increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms, greater abundance of some invertebrates other than earthworms, increased numbers of some weeds and/or weed species, higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying date and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields, and greater abundance of some birds - including Eurasian skylark, seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in late winter on non-inversion or conservation tillage. A review found tillage had negative effects on invertebrate numbers and no-till systems had more invertebrate bird food resources.\\nTwenty-six studies (of which 13 replicated and controlled and three also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found reducing tillage had either negative, no effect or no consistent effects on abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates (other than earthworms), earthworm abundance, biomass, or species richness, number of different plant species found as seeds, number of some weed species, mammal abundance, some bird species, and one study found bird preferences for conservation tillage fields decreased over time.

    "relevant_summary": "Several factors influence the occupancy and success rates of nest boxes for birds on farmland. Nest box design affects use, productivity and usurpation rates, with thirteen studies finding that these varied with different designs (action 498). The position and orientation of nest boxes is also important, with fourteen studies finding different occupation or success rates depending on positioning (action 498). Specifically, nest boxes positioned higher above the ground had higher occupancy, numbers of eggs and numbers of hatched young (action 155). The surrounding habitat influences success, with nest success in boxes being related to the amount of pasture available (action 155). Tree sparrows showed a preference for nest boxes in wetland habitat compared to those in farmland sites (action 155). Nest box maintenance affects occupancy, as five studies found that various songbirds preferentially nested in cleaned nest boxes compared to used ones, though some studies found birds showed preference for uncleaned boxes and there were no differences in success or parasitism levels between cleaned and uncleaned boxes (action 499). Predation is a significant factor, with predation rates being lower for relocated nest boxes compared to controls (action 420), and nest boxes or nesting 'tubs' showing lower predation or higher nesting success than natural nests (action 402). Predator deterrents such as metal cones with 7.6 cm overhang and increased distance between entrance hole and roof from 30 to 60 cm can prevent raccoons from entering nest boxes (action 402). Nest box density may also play a role, with one study finding more nesting attempts in areas with more nest boxes, though another study found no differences in behaviour or productivity between areas with high or low densities of nest boxes (action 498).",

A review found tillage had negative effects on invertebrate numbers and no-till systems had more invertebrate bird food resources.\\nTwenty-six studies (of which 13 replicated and controlled and three also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found reducing tillage had either negative, no effect or no consistent effects on abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates (other than earthworms), earthworm abundance, biomass, or species richness, number of different plant species found as seeds, number of some weed species, mammal abundance, some bird species, and one study found bird preferences for conservation tillage fields decreased over time.

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done.

    "relevant_summary": "Studies show that both supplementary feeding and wild bird seed mixtures provide benefits for farmland birds, but they have different effectiveness patterns. For supplementary feeding, nine studies from France, Sweden and the UK found that provision of supplementary food increased farmland bird abundance, breeding population size, density, body mass, hatching, nestling growth and fledging rates, and increased overwinter survival of a declining house sparrow population (Action 648). Four studies found that farmland songbirds used supplementary food when provided, including the majority of targeted species such as tree sparrow, yellowhammer and corn bunting (Action 648). However, five studies found that supplementary food had no clear effect on farmland bird breeding abundance, territory size or territory density, or overwinter survival of three stable house sparrow populations (Action 648).\n\nFor wild bird seed mixtures, fourteen studies from the UK found that fields sown with wild bird cover mix had higher abundance, density, species diversity and species richness of birds than other farmland habitats (Action 594). Six studies found that birds showed a preference for wild bird cover and used it significantly more than other habitats (Action 594). All seven studies that investigated species richness or diversity found that fields or farms with wild bird cover had higher bird diversity than those without (Action 187). Thirty-two out of 33 studies from the UK and North America found that bird densities, abundances, nesting densities or use of wild bird cover was higher than in other habitats or management regimes (Action 187). Six studies found that mixtures including kale or a mixture of kale and other species attracted the largest number of bird species or highest bird abundance (Action 594).",

    "relevant_summary": "Farm-level agri-environment scheme options show mixed evidence for scaling up to landscape-level biodiversity benefits. Five studies monitoring the Swiss Ecological Compensation Areas scheme at a landscape scale found mixed effects, with one study finding increases in numbers of birds of some species, two finding no effect on bird species numbers or population densities, and three studies finding mixed effects with some species or groups increasing and others decreasing (Action 145). For bees specifically, landscape-scale effects show some promise, with one large replicated controlled trial demonstrating that the average abundance of long-tongued bumblebees on field margins was positively correlated with the number of pollen and nectar agri-environment agreements in a 10 km grid square (Action 21). However, two replicated trials in the UK found that bumblebee populations were not enhanced on farmland managed under agri-environment schemes at the landscape scale (Action 24). For butterflies and moths, evidence suggests landscape benefits may occur, with studies showing that species richness of butterflies was higher in landscapes with a greater proportion of land managed under agri-environment schemes, and that abundance of butterflies was higher on farms or in landscapes with a higher proportion of land managed under agri-environment schemes (Action 3915). However, a UK study found that agri-environment scheme prescriptions had a local but not a landscape-scale effect on bee numbers (Action 700). The effectiveness appears to depend on proper siting, as one study from the Netherlands found that many agri-environment scheme farms were sited in areas where they were unlikely to be effective (Action 172).",

Eleven studies found restoration occurred within 10 years, and two studies found restoration took more than 10 years (Action 133). However, six studies found limited or slow changes in plant communities following restoration (Action 133). Some studies indicated that grasslands restored from bare soil by seeding developed butterfly communities that were increasingly similar to existing high-quality grasslands over the first 10 years after establishment (Action 3929). Additionally, studies monitoring wet meadow plant communities found some positive effects within five years, though restoration was not complete after five, nine or 20 years in some cases (Action 119). Two studies found differences in vegetation between restored and existing species-rich grasslands persisted nine or 60 years after restoration (Action 133).",

For managing wild deer numbers, no evidence was captured for effects on farmland wildlife (Action 111). Similarly, for controlling grey squirrels, no evidence was captured for effects on farmland wildlife (Action 106). \n\nFor mink control, there is some evidence from systematic reviews showing that trapping appears to be an effective method of reducing American mink populations, though firm conclusions could not be made due to limitations in experimental design. A large-scale trapping programme in the UK demonstrated that American mink have been successfully eradicated over a large area and this may have been associated with some localized water vole expansions (Action 107).\n\nThe most evidence exists for controlling predatory mammals and birds (foxes, crows, stoats and weasels). Nine individual studies from France and the UK found that three studies showed controlling predatory mammals or birds increased the abundance or population size of some birds. One UK study found numbers of nationally declining songbirds increased on a site where predators were controlled, but there was no overall difference in bird abundance, species richness or diversity between predator control and no-control sites. Five UK studies found some evidence for increased productivity, nest or reproductive success or survival of birds following bird or mammal predator control. A global systematic review including evidence from European farmland found that reproductive success of birds increased with predator removal (Action 699).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, both approaches show evidence for improving invertebrate biodiversity in UK grasslands, but with different patterns of effectiveness. For reducing management intensity, action 69 found that 16 studies showed benefits to some or all invertebrates, while action 3958 found that 6 of 10 studies demonstrated that less intensively managed grasslands had higher butterfly and moth species richness than conventionally managed grasslands, and 3 of 4 studies showed higher abundance of butterflies, micro-moths and declining macro-moths in low-input grasslands. Action 704 reported that 15 studies found benefits to invertebrates from reducing grazing intensity, with 6 studies showing increased invertebrate diversity and abundance from excluding or delaying summer grazing. For restoring species-rich semi-natural grassland, action 133 found that 20 studies showed restoration resulted in higher pollinating insect density and diversity than other grassland types, or that restored grasslands had similar abundance and species richness of insects to old traditionally managed sites. However, action 3955 presented mixed results for butterflies and moths, with some studies showing restored grasslands had lower species richness and abundance than continuously managed grasslands, while others found similar or higher abundance. Action 133 also noted that restoration effectiveness varied with time, with 6 studies showing positive signs within 5 years, 11 studies within 10 years, and some requiring more than 10 years. The evidence suggests both approaches can be effective, but reducing management intensity appears to show more consistent positive results for invertebrates, while restoration outcomes are more variable and may depend on specific implementation methods and timeframes.",

Six studies (including three replicated controlled trials of which two randomized) found that excluding or delaying summer grazing increased plant species diversity, invertebrate abundance and benefited breeding Eurasian skylark. A review found a study that showed that removing autumn grazing after a silage cut increased the winter abundance of seed-eating birds. A review and a replicated controlled study from the UK\\u00a0found that reduced grazing intensity or seasonal removal of livestock increased the number of invertebrates, plant seed heads and foraging skylark, and that some bird species preferred plots with seasonal removal of livestock.\\nThree studies (including one randomized, replicated, controlled trial) from the Netherlands and the UK found no benefit to plants or invertebrates from reduced grazing intensity. One randomized, replicated controlled trial excluded grazing in autumn/winter and another study excluded grazing in the summer. A further study found that reducing grazing intensity throughout the year did not increase plant diversity.\\nNine studies from France, Germany and the UK reported mixed results for some or all species or wildlife groups considered (including one randomized, replicated, controlled trial and two reviews and a systematic review). Of these, eight studies found that reduced grazing intensity throughout the year benefited some species but not others, one found that the impact depended on the type of vegetation grazed, and one found benefits to bee and wasp abundance but not species richness. One study found that the response of birds to removal of summer grazing varied between functional groups and depended on time of year. A UK review found that reduced grazing benefited invertebrates, plants, rodents and some but not all birds. \\nA systematic review of the effects of grazing intensity on meadow pasture concluded that intermediate levels of grazing are usually optimal for plants, invertebrates and birds but that trade-offs are likely to exist between the requirements of different taxa.\"\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "Based on studies from the Netherlands, several management strategies have proven effective for increasing wading bird populations on wet grasslands. Maintaining traditional water meadows resulted in increased population size or number of territories of northern lapwing, common redshank and black-tailed godwit (Action 696). Raising water levels in ditches or grassland was associated with increased bird numbers and breeding bird numbers, with studies showing this technique resulted in more rapid establishment of species typical of wet grassland (Action 121). \n\nImplementing 'mosaic management', a Dutch agri-environment option, showed that northern lapwing population trends changed from decreases to increases following introduction of this management approach, and black-tailed godwit had higher productivity under mosaic management due to higher nest survival with nests less likely to be trampled by livestock or destroyed by mowing (Action 130). Creating or restoring traditional water meadows through techniques including topsoil removal, introduction of target plant species, raising water levels, grazing, and mowing were successful in restoring wet meadow plant communities (Action 119).\n\nAdditional effective strategies include delaying mowing or first grazing dates, which resulted in increased breeding wading bird densities (Action 131). Creating scrapes and pools in wetlands and wet grasslands showed that northern lapwing chicks foraged in newly created wet features and chick condition was higher in sites with a large number of footdrains (Action 359). Providing short grass for waders was beneficial, as northern lapwings spent more time foraging on short swards compared to longer grass (Action 221). Direct payments per clutch for farmland birds showed slightly higher breeding densities of wading birds and higher hatching success of northern lapwing and black-tailed godwit on farms with payment schemes (Action 146). Finally, protecting individual nests through exclosures showed that protected nests had higher average daily survival rates than unprotected nests for both common redshank and northern lapwing (Action 108).",

For birds, benefits include increased stone curlew breeding population size, northern lapwing hatching success, and Eurasian skylark nesting success (Action 562). Skylark plots specifically showed positive effects in all four studies from the UK and Switzerland, with increases in skylark population size, breeding density, duration or success, and lower likelihood of territory abandonment (Action 540). Northern lapwing, Eurasian skylark, grey partridge and yellow wagtail have been documented breeding in lapwing plots (Action 562).\n\nFor invertebrates, uncropped plots provide increased species richness and abundance of spiders, abundance of ground-dwelling invertebrates and ground beetles, and increased species richness of bumblebees (Action 562). Five replicated trials in the UK showed that uncropped field margins sown with wild flowers support higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees than cropped field edges, grassy margins, or naturally regenerated uncropped margins (Action 19). Four replicated trials found more bumblebees foraging on uncropped field margins than on cropped margins (Action 20).\n\nFor plants, benefits include increased species richness of plants and the establishment, abundance or species richness of rare arable plant species (Action 562). Skylark plots showed benefits to plants and invertebrates in three UK studies (Action 540).\n\nHowever, documented limitations exist. Two studies found that leaving uncropped plots had no effect on 11 out of 12 farmland bird species or ground beetles (Action 562). Fewer seed-eating birds were found on fallow plots for ground-nesting birds in two out of three regions (Action 562). The proportion of young grey partridges in the population was lower in areas with a high proportion of uncropped cultivated margins and plots (Action 562). Pernicious weeds were more commonly found on uncropped cultivated margins than conservation or conventional headlands (Action 562). For naturally regenerated margins, the value for bees was based on thistle species considered pernicious weeds requiring control, and the value was not consistent from year to year (Action 20).",
