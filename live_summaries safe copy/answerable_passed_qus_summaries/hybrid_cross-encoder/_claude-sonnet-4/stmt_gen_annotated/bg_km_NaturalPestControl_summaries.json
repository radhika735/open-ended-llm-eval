Regarding pest impacts, one of two studies found more pest insects in late-cut plots while one found no effect. For grazing versus cutting management, action 885 reports that two studies found grazing instead of cutting had mixed effects on natural enemies, with some species and groups affected on some dates but not others, while one study found no effect on natural enemies. For pest control, one of five studies found more pests with grazing, two studies found effects varied between pest groups and sampling dates, and two studies found no effect on pests. Action 725 provides additional evidence that leaving part of pasture uncut can increase predatory insects or spiders, with three studies finding increased abundance in the crop field and four studies finding more predators in the unharvested area itself. The ratio of predators to pests was higher in partially cut plots according to two studies.",

    "relevant_summary": "Altering pesticide application strategies shows several effects on natural enemies and pest management systems. Threshold-based spraying regimes increased numbers of natural enemies in two of three years, though effects lasted for as little as three weeks (Action 750). Altering the timing of insecticide use resulted in more natural enemies when insecticides were sprayed earlier rather than later in the growing season (Action 723). Delaying herbicide use led to more natural enemies in two randomised, replicated, controlled trials, though some but not all natural enemy groups benefited and fewer groups benefitted early in the season (Action 774). Using chemicals to attract natural enemies showed mixed results, with five of 13 studies finding more natural enemies while eight found positive effects varied between enemy groups, sites or study dates (Action 754). Incorporating parasitism rates when setting thresholds for insecticide use resulted in acceptable levels of crop damage from pests, though effects on natural enemy populations were not monitored (Action 726). Converting to organic farming produced mixed effects, with eight of 12 studies finding more natural enemies under organic farming, though seven of these found effects varied over time or between natural enemy species or groups and/or crops or management practices (Action 717). Reducing fertilizer, pesticide or herbicide use generally showed positive effects, with eight studies finding greater species richness of butterflies and moths, and six studies finding higher abundance of these insects in areas with reduced chemical applications compared to conventional chemical applications (Action 3897). Threshold-based pesticide strategies also resulted in fewer pesticide applications being needed and lower production costs in multiple studies (Action 750).",

Three studies (including one replicated, randomised, controlled trial) found higher numbers of natural enemies in plots with plants that produce attractive chemicals, and all four studies found a decrease in either pest population or pest damage. One replicated, randomised, controlled study found an increase in crop yield. The crops studied were lettuce, orange, safflower and sorghum (Action 724).\n\nFor planting new hedges, the evidence is more mixed (Action 752). One randomised, replicated, controlled study from China found no effect on spiders in crops. Studies from France and China found mixed results, with one finding more natural enemies in hedges than adjacent crops while another found effects varied between crop types, hedge species and years. Two randomised, replicated, controlled studies from France and Kenya found natural enemy abundance in hedges was affected by the type of hedge shrub/tree planted. One study from Kenya found effects on nematodes varied between groups. The crops studied were barley, beans, maize and wheat (Action 752).\n\nAdditional evidence for hedgerows shows that one study from the USA found higher parasitization of pest eggs in tomato fields with hedgerows compared to fields with weedy edges, but only up to 100m into the crop, though pest damage to tomatoes was no different between hedgerow and weedy edge fields (Action 1401). Studies also found more natural enemies in fields with hedgerows compared to fields with weedy edges in some comparisons (Actions 1401, 2314).\n\nThe evidence suggests that plants producing chemicals that attract natural enemies show more consistent positive effects across studies, while hedge effectiveness varies significantly depending on hedge species, crop type, and other factors.",

    "relevant_summary": "Several non-herbicide methods can be used to control weeds on farmland. Growing competitive plants is effective, with nine studies from Australia, Slovakia, the UK and USA showing that planting species to compete with weeds reduced weed plant weight and ground cover, and five studies finding reduced weed reproduction and survival (Action 722). Cover crops in arable fields provide weed suppression, with four replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Israel and Italy finding fewer weeds in plots with cover crops compared to plots without them in some or all comparisons (Action 1394). Ground cover in orchards or vineyards also helps, with one study from Spain finding fewer weeds in plots with cover crops compared to bare soil (Action 1395). Allowing natural regeneration of ground cover beneath perennial crops can be beneficial for overall pest management including weeds (Action 720).\n\nTillage management offers another approach. Reducing tillage can affect weed populations, with 34 studies from nine European countries finding some positive effects including increased numbers of some weeds and/or weed species under reduced tillage compared to conventional management (Action 126). Different tillage practices can be strategically used for weed management (Action 906).\n\nPhysical and manual methods include mechanical or manual removal of weeds. Studies show this can be effective, with one replicated, controlled study in Hawaii finding that removal of invasive grass species increased understory plant biomass (Action 1228). Selective hand weeding is another option for managing vegetation (Action 3714). Adding mulch provides some weed control benefits, though one study found limited effectiveness in reducing grass cover (Action 1650).\n\nCrop diversification strategies help suppress weeds. Intercropping (planting more than one crop per field) can enhance beneficial insects that may help with pest management including weeds (Action 124). Crop rotation in potato farming systems reduces pest populations and diseases while potentially affecting weed dynamics (Action 719). Converting to organic farming systems eliminates herbicide use, though studies show mixed effects on weed abundance, with three randomized, replicated, controlled studies from the USA finding more weeds in organically farmed fields, but effects varied between crops and years (Action 717).",

Eight studies compared numbers of predatory invertebrates on beetle banks with other refuge habitats - two studies found more natural enemies on beetle banks (with one showing only seasonal effects), one review found similar or higher numbers of predators, and four studies found similar or lower numbers compared to other habitats. Action 729 also noted that six studies examined effects on predator numbers in adjacent crops, with a review finding that predators increased in adjacent crops, though one study found no effect and two studies found small or slow movements of predators from banks to crops. Action 651 reported that five reports from replicated studies found positive effects on invertebrate densities and higher ground beetle density and species diversity, while five other replicated studies found lower or no difference in invertebrate densities on beetle banks relative to other habitats.\n\nFor leaving crops unharvested, action 725 found that three studies (including one replicated, controlled trial) showed an increase in abundance of predatory insects or spiders in the crop field or pasture that was partly uncut, while four studies (including three replicated, controlled trials) found more predators in the unharvested or unmown area itself. Two studies found that the ratio of predators to pests was higher in partially cut plots and one study found the same result in the uncut area. One replicated, controlled study found an increase in predation and parasitism rates of pest eggs in unharvested strips.\n\nThe evidence shows mixed results for pest control effectiveness: action 729 found that beetle banks could make economic savings if they prevented pests from reaching spray thresholds, while action 725 found variable effects on pest numbers with some studies showing decreases and others showing increases in pest numbers in partially cut plots.",

Action 651 reported that five reports from replicated studies found positive effects on invertebrate densities and higher ground beetle density and species diversity, while five other replicated studies found lower or no difference in invertebrate densities on beetle banks relative to other habitats.\\n\\nFor leaving crops unharvested, action 725 found that three studies (including one replicated, controlled trial) showed an increase in abundance of predatory insects or spiders in the crop field or pasture that was partly uncut, while four studies (including three replicated, controlled trials) found more predators in the unharvested or unmown area itself. Two studies found that the ratio of predators to pests was higher in partially cut plots and one study found the same result in the uncut area. One replicated, controlled study found an increase in predation and parasitism rates of pest eggs in unharvested strips.\\n\\nThe evidence shows mixed results for pest control effectiveness: action 729 found that beetle banks could make economic savings if they prevented pests from reaching spray thresholds, while action 725 found variable effects on pest numbers with some studies showing decreases and others showing increases in pest numbers in partially cut plots.\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"729\",\n    \"725\",\n    \"651\"\n  ]\n}"

Excluding ants that protect pests can increase parasitism, with one of two replicated, controlled studies from Japan and the USA finding greater parasitism of pests by natural enemies when ants were excluded from trees, while the other study found greater parasitism at one site but no effect at another (Action 886). Push-pull cropping systems that combine trap and repellent crops have demonstrated effectiveness, with two randomised, replicated, controlled studies from Kenya finding that push-pull cropping systems increased parasitism of stem borer larvae, though one study found no effect on egg parasitism (Action 753). Mass-emergence devices to increase natural enemy populations showed mixed results, with one randomised, replicated, controlled study in Switzerland finding higher parasitism at one site but no effect at another site when mass-emergence devices were used in urban areas (Action 775). Incorporating parasitism rates when setting thresholds for insecticide use is a management approach that one controlled study from New Zealand found resulted in acceptable levels of crop damage from pests (Action 726). Natural ground cover regeneration beneath perennial crops can support natural enemies, though effects on parasitism specifically were not directly measured in the available studies (Action 720). Delaying herbicide use showed benefits for natural enemies, with two randomised, replicated, controlled trials from Australia and Denmark finding more natural enemies when herbicide treatments were delayed (Action 774). Flower strips and wildflower plantings support beneficial invertebrates generally, with 50 out of 65 individual studies reporting positive effects on invertebrates, though specific parasitism rate increases were not quantified (Action 442).",

One replicated, randomised, controlled UK study found no effect on spider and beetle diversity when delaying cutting (Action ID: 727).

Delayed cutting showed variable effects on natural enemies - with one study finding reduced predatory spider numbers but other studies finding no effects on insect predators or spider/beetle diversity. Grazing instead of cutting showed similarly mixed effects on natural enemy species and groups depending on timing.

However, other evidence from UK studies indicates that delaying mowing or grazing dates resulted in greater abundance of some spiders and ground beetles (Action ID: 131).\\n\\n**Grazing Instead of Cutting Effects:**\\nOne UK before-and-after study examining grazing instead of cutting found mixed effects on natural enemies, with some species and groups affected on some dates but not others (Action ID: 885).\\n\\n**Comparative Evidence:**\\nThe available UK evidence shows mixed and limited comparative data. Delayed cutting showed variable effects on natural enemies - with one study finding reduced predatory spider numbers but other studies finding no effects on insect predators or spider/beetle diversity. Grazing instead of cutting showed similarly mixed effects on natural enemy species and groups depending on timing. Both management approaches demonstrated inconsistent effects on natural enemy abundance across different species groups and sampling periods in UK studies.\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"727\",\n    \"885\",\n    \"131\"\n  ]\n}"

For alley cropping, effects on parasitism varied between study sites, sampling dates, pest life stages or crop alley width, with two studies finding no effect on parasitism (Action 718).

For newly planted hedges, both studies from France and the UK found higher abundance, species richness or diversity of beetles or spiders than crop fields or field margins (Action 538). Newly established hedges supported more ground beetles than older hedges, and areas with new hedges had lower pest outbreaks (Action 538). Effects on natural enemies in hedges varied between crop types, hedge species and years, with natural enemy abundance affected by the type of hedge shrub/tree planted (Action 752). For beetle banks, positive effects were found on invertebrate densities, ground beetle density and species diversity in spring and summer but not winter (Action 651). However, effects varied between invertebrate groups, with five studies finding lower or no difference in invertebrate densities compared to other habitats (Action 651). Beetle banks had higher densities of harvest mouse nests than field margins (Action 2393) and higher species richness of micro-moths than conventionally managed field margins (Action 3927).

Planting or maintaining ground cover in orchards or vineyards showed that four replicated, controlled studies found more natural enemies in plots with ground cover compared to plots without ground cover, in some or all comparisons (Action ID: 1395). Creating beetle banks provides habitat for natural enemies, with four studies finding more invertebrate predators on beetle banks than in surrounding crops (Action ID: 729). Leaving part of the crop or pasture unharvested or uncut resulted in four studies finding more predators in the unharvested or unmown area itself (Action ID: 725).\n\nTree canopy enhancement strategies include isolating colonies of beneficial ants, where one replicated, controlled study found predatory ants occupied more cashew trees when colonies were kept isolated (Action ID: 773). Conversely, excluding ants that protect pests showed that five studies found effects varied between natural enemy species and groups when ants were excluded from trees, with four randomised, replicated, controlled trials demonstrating this approach (Action ID: 886).\n\nAdditional strategies that can benefit both ground and canopy include diversifying ground vegetation and canopy structure in the habitat around woody crops (Action ID: 3526), growing non-crop plants that produce chemicals that attract natural enemies, where three studies found higher numbers of natural enemies in plots with plants that produce attractive chemicals (Action ID: 724), and using chemicals to attract natural enemies, where five of 13 studies found more natural enemies with this approach (Action ID: 754).",

For plant competition strategies, growing plants that compete with damaging weeds resulted in reduced weed plant weight or ground cover in all nine studies from Australia, Slovakia, the UK and the USA, although two studies found this effect only in some years or conditions (action 722). Additionally, five studies found that competition reduced weed reproduction, survival or both, with one study showing an effect only in one year (action 722). Mixed pasture systems showed effectiveness with two studies from the USA finding reduced weeds in mixed compared to monoculture pasture (action 721). Push-pull cropping systems demonstrated pest control benefits, with two studies finding fewer witchweeds and two of three studies finding fewer pests overall (action 753).\n\nFor chemical-based approaches using allelopathic plant remains, results were variable. Six studies from Asia, Europe and North America found three studies showing reduction in weed growth and three showing effects that varied between years, weed groups, or control methods when comparing amended soils with weeded controls (action 728). When comparing with unweeded controls, two of four studies found reduced weed growth, but one found that residues applied too far in advance had reverse effects (action 728). However, the weed control effects were temporary, with two studies finding the decrease in weeds did not last beyond a few days or weeks after residue incorporation (action 728). These chemical approaches also affected crop growth, with two of three studies finding crop growth was inhibited by allelopathic plant remains, though this could be minimized by changing application timing (action 728).",

For manufactured chemicals to attract natural enemies (Action 754), one review and two of five studies found that attractive chemicals increased parasitism, while two studies found greater parasitism for some but not all chemicals, crops, sites or years and one study found no effect. Five of 13 studies found more natural enemies while eight found positive effects varied between enemy groups, sites or study dates. Four of 13 studies found more natural enemies with some but not all test chemicals. Regarding pest control outcomes, three of nine studies found fewer pests, two studies found more pests and four found no effect. One study found higher wheat yields. For planting non-crop plants that produce attractive chemicals (Action 724), four studies from China, Germany, India and Kenya were conducted. Three studies found higher numbers of natural enemies in plots with plants that produce attractive chemicals, and one found that the attractive plant also attracted natural enemies in lab studies. One found no effect on parasitism but the plant used was found not to be attractive to natural enemies in lab studies. All four studies found a decrease in either pest population or pest damage in plots with plants that produce chemicals that attract natural enemies. One replicated, randomised, controlled study found an increase in crop yield in plots with plants that produce attractive chemicals. The manufactured chemical approach was tested across a broader range of crops including apple, banana, bean, broccoli, Chinese cabbage, cotton, cowpea, cranberry, grape, grapefruit, hop, maize, oilseed, orange, tomato, turnip and wheat, while the plant-based approach was tested on lettuce, orange, safflower and sorghum.",

    "relevant_summary": "From North America, several studies provide evidence for natural and ecological weed control methods. Six studies from Asia, Europe and North America examined allelopathic plant remains (incorporating plant materials that produce weed-controlling chemicals) and found three studies showed a reduction in weed growth, while three found effects varied between years, weed groups, or control method types (Action 728). Four additional studies from Asia and North America found that two studies showed reduced weed growth with allelopathic plant remains, though timing of application was important as residues applied too far in advance had reverse effects (Action 728).\n\nFor competitive planting strategies, studies from Australia, Slovakia, the UK and the USA found that growing plants to compete with weeds reduced weed plant weight or ground cover in all nine studies, with four replicated, randomised, controlled trials included (Action 722). Five studies also found that competition reduced weed reproduction, survival or both (Action 722).\n\nMixed pasture systems showed effectiveness, with two randomised, replicated trials from the USA finding reduced weeds in mixed compared to monoculture pasture (Action 721). Five studies from North America measured pest reduction in mixed pastures, with four being randomised, replicated, controlled tests (Action 721).\n\nCover crop studies from the USA showed mixed but generally positive results for weed control. Four replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Israel and Italy found fewer weeds in plots with cover crops compared to plots without them in some or all comparisons, while one study from the USA found more weeds with winter cover crops in some comparisons (Action 1394). Two studies from Italy and the USA found inconsistent effects, and one USA study found similar weed amounts with or without winter cover crops (Action 1394).\n\nFor orchard and vineyard ground cover, one study from a USA vineyard found more weeds in plots with cover crops compared to bare soil in one of nine comparisons (Action 1395). However, natural ground cover regeneration studies from Australia, Canada, China, France, and Spain found that two studies showed more natural enemies with natural ground cover, though effects were short-term for most groups in one study (Action 720).\n\nAdditional USA evidence includes studies showing reduced erosion under cover crops, with one randomized replicated study finding cover crops reduced soil loss (Action 897).",

    "relevant_summary": "Delaying herbicide use results in mixed effects on pest control systems. According to action 774, delaying herbicide treatments increased natural enemies in two studies from Australia and Denmark, though benefits varied by natural enemy group and were less pronounced early in the season. However, delaying herbicides led to increased weed pressure and had mixed effects on insect pests, with one study finding more insect pests for some groups while another found fewer pests in specific experiments and crop varieties. Crop damage was reduced in some but not all varieties and study years, while yields either decreased or showed no effect. In contrast, altering insecticide timing shows different patterns. Action 723 indicates that applying insecticides earlier rather than later in the growing season increased natural enemies in one UK study. Early insecticide application reduced pests or disease damage in two of four studies, though effects varied with insecticide type, while two studies found no effect on pests or damage. Yield effects were mixed when insecticides were applied early, with one study finding higher yields when applications were timed to periods of suspected crop susceptibility. One study found higher profits and similar costs when insecticides were applied only during times of suspected crop susceptibility. The evidence suggests that both timing alterations affect natural enemies, pest control, and yields differently, with herbicide delays generally showing more consistent benefits for natural enemies but potential negative impacts on weed control and yields, while insecticide timing changes show more variable effects depending on application timing relative to crop growth stages.",
