    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, cutting trees combined with rewetting peat appears more effective than cutting trees alone for peatland restoration. Action 1732 shows that cutting/removing forest plantations and rewetting peat increased the abundance of wetland-characteristic plants (2 studies), increased Sphagnum moss cover (2 paired studies in Sweden and Finland), increased cover of herbs including cottongrasses and sedges (7 studies), and increased plant species richness (2 controlled studies in rich fens in Sweden). In contrast, Action 1731 shows that cutting/removing forest plantations alone increased cover of some herb species including cottongrasses and sedges (3 studies), but had mixed effects on Sphagnum moss cover - one study reported Sphagnum cover decreased over three years following tree removal in a drained rich fen, though another study found Sphagnum cover increased in partly rewetted fens. Notably, Action 1731 indicates that tree removal had a much smaller effect on plant species richness in drained plots compared to rewetted plots. Action 1756 demonstrates that rewetting alone (without tree removal) typically reduced or had no effect on tree and shrub cover (10 studies), increased Sphagnum moss cover (12 studies), and increased cover of various herb groups including sedges, cottongrasses, and reeds/rushes. The combination approach (Action 1732) changed overall plant community composition to become less like sites that remained drained and forested, while tree removal alone (Action 1731) showed more limited effects on overall plant community composition.",

Three of these studies\\u00a0reported mixed responses by species. Two additional replicated studies, in bogs in Latvia\\u00a0and forested fens in Finland, reported that rewetting had no effect on Sphagnum\\u00a0cover. Five studies (one paired, controlled, before-and-after) in Finland, Sweden\\u00a0and Canada\\u00a0reported that rewetting bogs or fens had no effect on cover of non-Sphagnum mosses (or mosses/lichens). However, two controlled studies in bogs in Ireland\\u00a0and the UK\\u00a0reported that rewetting reduced cover of non-Sphagnum mosses\\u00a0or bryophytes. One site comparison study in Finland\\u00a0reported that a rewetted peatland had similar moss cover (Sphagnum and total) to a natural peatland, but another site comparison study in Canada\\u00a0reported that a rewetted bog had lower moss cover (Sphagnum and other) than nearby target peatlands.\\nHerb cover (25 studies): Twenty-one studies (including four replicated, paired, controlled) reported that rewetting (sometimes\\u00a0along with other interventions) increased cover of at least one group of herbs. These studies were in bogs, fens or other peatlands in the UK, Finland, Ireland, the Czech Republic, the USA, the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, China, Latvia, Poland, Canada\\u00a0and Spain. Specifically, rewetting increased other/total sedge cover in 13 of 15 studies, increased cottongrass cover in eight of nine studies, and increased reed/rush cover in five of seven studies.

One replicated site comparison study in forested fens in Finland\\u00a0reported that rewetting had no effect on total herb cover.

Two before-and-after studies in fens in Sweden\\u00a0and Germany\\u00a0reported that rewetting increased tree/shrub cover. One before-and-after study in a bog in the UK\\u00a0reported mixed effects of rewetting on different tree/shrub species.\\nOverall vegetation cover (4 studies): Of four before-and-after studies (three also controlled) that examined the effect of rewetting on overall vegetation cover, two in bogs in Ireland\\u00a0and Sweden\\u00a0reported that rewetting increased it.

However, five studies found no effect: in bogs in the Czech Republic\\u00a0and Latvia, fens in Sweden\\u00a0and Germany, and forested fens in Finland. One study in fen meadows in the Netherlands\\u00a0found scale-dependent effects.

The documented management approaches include: restricting pedestrian access to peatlands (Action 1751), installing boardwalks/paths to prevent trampling (Action 1753), adopting ecotourism principles/creating an ecotourism site (Action 1755), wearing snowshoes to prevent trampling (Action 1754), and limiting, ceasing or prohibiting access for recreational purposes (Action 2152). Additional broader recreational management approaches include creating designated areas or access points for recreational activities (Action 2842) and restricting recreational activities to particular areas (Action 3850). However, for all of these peatland-specific management options, no studies were found that evaluated their effects on peatland vegetation (Actions 1751, 1753, 1754, 1755). Similarly, no studies were found evaluating the effectiveness of limiting recreational access for marine and freshwater environments (Action 2152) or for butterfly and moth conservation (Action 3850). One study from forests in Spain found that reducing visitor group size resulted in more birds being observed, with the effect largely due to decreases in collared dove and serin abundance as visitor numbers increased (Action 312).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on 36 studies evaluating rewetting effects on peatland vegetation, rewetting typically causes significant changes in plant community composition, with drier grassland communities being replaced by more wetland- or peatland-characteristic communities (Action 1756). Rewetting increases the abundance of wetland- or peatland-characteristic plants (Action 1756). For moss cover, 12 studies reported that rewetting increased Sphagnum moss cover or abundance in bogs, fens or other peatlands, though three studies reported mixed responses by species (Action 1756). Rewetting typically increases herb cover, with 21 studies reporting increased cover of at least one group of herbs - specifically increasing sedge cover in 13 of 15 studies, cottongrass cover in 8 of 9 studies, and reed/rush cover in 5 of 7 studies (Action 1756). For trees and shrubs, 10 studies found that rewetting typically reduced or had no effect on tree and/or shrub cover (Action 1756). Three of four studies examining overall vegetation cover reported that rewetting increased it (Action 1756). Regarding plant diversity, 6 studies reported that rewetting increased total plant species richness or diversity, though 5 studies found no effect and 1 study found rewetting reduced plant diversity (Action 1756). Studies using multiple restoration interventions including rewetting also found increases in moss cover, herb cover including cottongrass and other grass-like plants, and overall vegetation cover (Action 1803). Irrigation studies similarly showed that wetland- and fen-characteristic herbs colonized irrigated areas while dryland grasses decreased (Action 1859).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available studies, there are different effects between completely excluding livestock versus reducing grazing intensity on degraded peatlands. For complete livestock exclusion (Action 1734), ten studies evaluated effects on peatland vegetation, with seven studies in bogs, two in fens and one in unspecified peatland. Complete exclusion typically had no effect on key herb groups, with five of five studies finding no effect on cottongrass cover and two of two studies reporting no effect on sedge cover. Five replicated, paired, controlled studies found that excluding livestock typically had no effect on Sphagnum moss cover, though responses sometimes varied between species and sites. Results for shrub cover were mixed - four studies found no effect on shrub cover, while three studies found that excluding livestock increased shrub cover. One study found that excluding sheep increased total vegetation, shrub and bryophyte biomass but had no effect on biomass of grass-like herbs. In contrast, for reducing grazing intensity (Action 1735), one study in UK bogs found that total vegetation and shrub cover were greater where grazing intensity was lower, cottongrass cover was greater where grazing intensity was lower for one species, and vegetation biomass was higher where grazing intensity was lower. The evidence suggests that reducing grazing intensity may produce more consistent positive effects on vegetation cover and biomass compared to complete exclusion, which showed more variable results across different vegetation types.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence, several disturbance-based management interventions can be used as alternatives to mowing for maintaining fen and fen meadow habitats:\n\n**Grazing** is documented as an effective disturbance management technique. Action 1762 reports that grazing can increase cover of some herb groups including cottongrasses, sedges, and grass-like plants in fens, and can reduce shrub cover, helping prevent succession.\n\n**Cutting trees and shrubs** provides another management approach. Action 1761 shows that removing shrubs in fens can cause plant community composition to become more like target fen meadow communities and increase the abundance of fen meadow plant species.\n\n**Prescribed fire** can be used in some wetland contexts, though evidence is limited for fens specifically. Action 3056 demonstrates that prescribed burning in freshwater swamps can maintain vegetation structure and increase grass cover.\n\n**Physical plant removal** techniques are documented. Action 1768 shows that physically removing problematic plants, particularly moss carpets, can increase cover of fen-characteristic plants and plant species richness in some conditions.\n\n**Litter removal** represents another intervention option. Action 3062 indicates that removing plant litter from freshwater marshes can create plant communities characteristic of wetter conditions and increase wetland plant cover.\n\n**Turf stripping** is available as a more intensive intervention. Action 1647 demonstrates that cutting and removing turf can increase the number of heathland plants and control grass species.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence from fen and fen meadow studies, cutting/mowing and grazing show different effects for maintaining disturbance. For butterfly species richness, fens managed by mowing had greater species richness than fens managed by cattle grazing (Action 3950). Direct comparisons in fen meadows found that grazed fen meadows contained fewer fen-characteristic plant species and fewer plant species overall than mown meadows (Action 1762). However, grazed and mown fen meadows had similar vegetation structure and differed in overall plant community composition (Actions 1759, 1762). For vegetation effects specifically, mowing in fens and fen meadows typically increased plant species richness, altered overall plant community composition, increased cover of fen-characteristic plants, increased moss/bryophyte cover, and reduced herb cover including bindweed, reeds, sedges, and purple moor grass (Action 1759). Grazing showed more variable effects: it increased cover of some herb groups like cottongrasses and sedges, had mixed effects on shrub cover, and showed inconsistent effects on plant species richness (Action 1762). Both management approaches affected plant community composition compared to no management, but the specific outcomes differed between cutting and grazing regimes in fen ecosystems.",

Additionally, multiple restoration interventions combining various approaches have proven effective, with studies showing increased overall vegetation cover, moss cover, and herbaceous plant cover (Action 1803).\n\nPhysical surface interventions include organic mulch applications, which show mixed but generally positive effects. Covering bare peat with straw mulch increased the number of fen characteristic plants present, though it did not affect their cover (Action 1813). When organic mulch is applied after planting, six studies found that mulching increased vegetation cover including total vegetation, mosses/bryophytes, Sphagnum mosses, and vascular plants after 1-3 growing seasons (Action 1828). However, some studies found no effect on vegetation cover in certain contexts.\n\nAlternative physical covers beyond mulch show promise, with studies reporting that covering planted areas with plastic mesh or shading materials can increase moss cover and plant survival (Action 1829). However, one study found that surface stabilization using coconut fiber rolls pegged onto almost-bare peat did not affect the development of vegetation cover for total vegetation, mosses, shrubs, or cottongrasses (Action 1815).",

Covering peatland with organic mulch increased the number of fen characteristic plants present (Action 1813). Adding mixed vegetation to peatland surfaces resulted in Sphagnum moss being present in sown plots with cover ranging from <1 to 73%, with six controlled studies finding higher Sphagnum cover in sown than unsown plots (Action 1822). Adding inorganic fertilizer typically increased growth of planted mosses, herbs or trees, increased survival of two planted tree species, and increased total vegetation, vascular plant and bryophyte cover (Action 1826). However, potential harms were also documented: fertilization cancelled out the beneficial effect of fine peat amendment for one species (Action 1837), fertilizer reduced survival of one planted tree species (Action 1826), and Sphagnum cover was very low (<1%) unless plots were mulched after spreading fragments (Action 1822). Some amendments showed no beneficial effects: covering bare peat with straw mulch did not affect cover of fen-characteristic plants or Sphagnum moss cover (Action 1813), and pegging coconut fibre rolls onto peat did not affect vegetation cover development (Action 1815). No studies were found evaluating the effects of burying the upper layer of peat or soil before planting (Action 1836).",

Six controlled studies found that Sphagnum cover was higher in sown than unsown plots, but one study reported that Sphagnum only survived in one of three sites and only when plots were mulched (Action 1821).

    "relevant_summary": "Several interventions are available to restore peatland vegetation on sites previously used for commercial forest plantations:\n\n**Removing Forest Plantations**: Cutting/removing/thinning forest plantations can increase cover of characteristic peatland herbs including cottongrasses and sedges, and reduce cover of forest-characteristic mosses (Action 1731). This intervention can also increase total plant species richness, particularly in rich fens (Action 1731).\n\n**Combined Tree Removal and Rewetting**: The most comprehensive approach involves cutting/removing trees combined with rewetting peat, which has been evaluated in eleven studies across bogs and fens (Action 1732). This intervention increases abundance of wetland-characteristic plants, can increase Sphagnum moss cover, and increases cover of herbs including cottongrasses and sedges (Action 1732). Two replicated studies reported this intervention increased plant species richness in rich fens (Action 1732).\n\n**Rewetting Alone**: Rewetting peatland by raising the water table has been evaluated in thirty-six studies and typically replaces drier grassland communities with more wetland- or peatland-characteristic communities (Action 1756). Twelve studies reported that rewetting increased Sphagnum moss cover or abundance, and twenty-one studies reported increased cover of characteristic herbs including sedges, cottongrasses, and reeds/rushes (Action 1756).\n\n**Active Vegetation Establishment**: Direct planting of peatland trees/shrubs shows successful survival in most cases, with eight studies reporting majority survival over periods between 10 weeks and 13 years (Action 1820). Directly planting peatland mosses shows good survival and growth, with planted mosses establishing and spreading beyond introduction sites (Action 1818). Adding moss fragments to peatland surfaces results in Sphagnum presence after 1-4 growing seasons with cover ranging from negligible to >90%, with six controlled studies showing higher Sphagnum cover in sown versus unsown plots (Action 1821). Adding mixed vegetation fragments containing Sphagnum to bog surfaces results in Sphagnum presence after 1-6 growing seasons, though five studies reported low cover unless plots were mulched after spreading (Action 1822).",

Adding mixed vegetation fragments containing Sphagnum to bog surfaces results in Sphagnum presence after 1-6 growing seasons, though five studies reported low cover unless plots were mulched after spreading (Action 1822).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"1731\",\n    \"1732\",\n    \"1756\",\n    \"1820\",\n    \"1818\",\n    \"1821\",\n    \"1822\"\n  ]\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, traditional management practices of mowing and grazing in fen meadows show several documented benefits and trade-offs for biodiversity:\n\n**Benefits of Mowing:**\nAction 1759 found that mowing in fens and fen meadows increased plant species richness compared to no mowing, before mowing or grazing in eight studies across the UK, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Czech Republic and Poland. Mowing increased cover of fen- or wet meadow-characteristic plants in four studies in Switzerland, Germany, Czech Republic and Poland. Action 1759 also documented that mowing increased total moss or bryophyte cover in four studies in Belgium, Switzerland and Czech Republic. Mowing reduced cover or abundance of at least one group of herbs including bindweed, reeds, sedges, purple moor grass and grass-like plants in six studies. Action 3950 found that fens managed by mowing had greater species richness of butterflies than fens managed by cattle grazing in Switzerland.\n\n**Benefits of Grazing:**\nAction 3971 found that wet meadows managed by light grazing with cattle or horses had similar species richness and abundance of butterflies to those managed by mowing once per year in autumn in Germany. Action 696 documented that maintaining traditional water meadows resulted in increased population size or number of territories of northern lapwing, common redshank and black-tailed godwit and increased plant species richness. Action 1762 reported that grazing increased cover of some herb groups including cottongrasses, sedges or all grass-like plants in two studies in UK fens.\n\n**Trade-offs and Negative Effects:**\nAction 3950 found that recently cut fens had fewer large copper eggs than uncut fens in the Netherlands, and that large copper caterpillar survival was lower in recently cut fens and fens cut in autumn or winter than in uncut fens. Action 3971 documented that after cattle grazing began on wet grassland, the number of bog fritillaries which emerged and their use of grazed areas was lower than before grazing started in Belgium. Action 696 found that common snipe declined on all sites under management to maintain traditional water meadows. Action 1762 found that grazed fen meadows contained fewer fen-characteristic plant species and fewer overall plant species than mown meadows in Germany.\n\n**Timing Effects:**\nAction 1771 found that plant species richness increased more over two years in summer-mown plots than spring- or autumn-mown plots in UK fen meadows. Action 3070 reported that the effect of cutting on plant species richness and vegetation abundance depended on the month of mowing between June and November in Belgian wet grasslands.",

Three replicated, paired, controlled studies in reedbeds in the UK\\u00a0and wet meadows in Germany\\u00a0and Estonia\\u00a0reported that cutting typically had no clear or significant effect on plant species richness, after 3\\u20135 months\\u00a0or over 5\\u201320 years. The two studies in the UK and Estonia\\u00a0found the same result for diversity.\\nCharacteristic plant richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in a temporary marsh in France\\u00a0reported that two years of annual autumn cutting increased the number of habitat-characteristic plant species present.\\n\\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\\n\\nOverall abundance (3 studies): Two replicated, controlled studies (one also randomized, paired, before-and-after) in freshwater marshes in the USA\\u00a0found that cutting had no significant effect on overall vegetation cover over 72 days\\u00a0or three years. One replicated, paired, controlled study in wet grasslands in Belgium\\u00a0reported that plots mown annually for two years contained less above-ground biomass, just before mowing, than unmown plots.\\nHerb abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in wet grasslands in Germany\\u00a0reported that mowing increased sedge cover over 20 years, but had no clear effect on cover of rushes, forbs, ferns, grasses and legumes.\\nTree/shrub abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in a wet prairie in the USA\\u00a0found that cutting had no significant effect on woody plant cover: there were similar increases, over three years, in cut and uncut plots.\\nBryophyte abundance (1 study): One replicated study in a freshwater marsh in Belgium\\u00a0reported that total moss cover increased over five years after resuming annual mowing.\\nIndividual species abundance (15 studies): Fifteen studies\\u00a0quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. For example, five studies (including one replicated, randomized, paired, controlled) in freshwater marshes in Belgium, the UK\\u00a0and the Czech Republic\\u00a0reported that common reed Phragmites australis was more abundant in cut than uncut areas. Two studies (one site comparison, one before-and-after) in fresh/brackish marshes in Belgium\\u00a0and Denmark\\u00a0reported that cutting reduced common reed cover\\u00a0or density. The two studies in Belgium\\u00a0reported that cutting had no clear effect on common reed frequency. Four studies (including one replicated, randomized, paired, before-and-after) in freshwater marshes in the Netherlands, Switzerland, Japan\\u00a0and Italy\\u00a0found that the effect of cutting on common reed abundance depended on factors such as the year, plant community type, cutting season, cutting intensity\\u00a0and time since mowing.\\n\\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE\\n\\nOverall structure (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in wet meadows in Switzerland\\u00a0reported that mown plots experienced a shift in vegetation cover towards lower vegetation layers, over 3\\u20134 years, compared to a shift to upper layers in unmown plots.\\nVisual obstruction (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in a freshwater marsh in Belgium\\u00a0reported that summer-cut plots had lower horizontal vegetation cover than uncut plots (or winter-cut plots) over six years after resuming annual mowing.\\nHeight (6 studies): Three replicated, controlled studies (one also randomized and paired) in freshwater marshes in Belgium, the UK\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0reported that cut marshes had shorter vegetation than uncut marshes. This was true for vegetation overall, vegetation other than common reed Phragmites australis, and for common reed cut in winter\\u00a0or spring\\u00a0(but not summer). Two replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after studies in a marsh in Mexico\\u00a0and wet grasslands in Germany\\u00a0reported that cutting/mowing had no significant or clear effect on vegetation height, after 12 months or over 20 years. One site comparison study in the Czech Republic\\u00a0found that common reed was taller, when measured in the summer, in a winter-mown reedbed than in an unmown reedbed.\\nDiameter/perimeter/area (5 studies): Two studies (one site comparison, one before-and-after) in fresh/brackish marshes in Belgium\\u00a0and Denmark\\u00a0reported that cutting, or time since last cutting, had no significant or clear effect on the stem diameter of common reed Phragmites australis. Two studies (including one replicated, randomized, paired, controlled) of reedbeds in the UK\\u00a0and the Czech Republic\\u00a0found that cut areas contained thicker reed stems than uncut areas, after one growing season. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in wet meadows in Switzerland\\u00a0found that the effect of cutting on common reed shoot diameter depended on the plant community type and season of mowing.\\nBasal area (1 study): One site comparison study in a fresh/brackish marsh in Denmark\\u00a0found that the basal area of common reed Phragmites australis stems was smaller in a reedbed cut two years previously than in a reedbed cut seven years previously. Only \\u201ctall\\u201d stems were sampled.\\n\\nOTHER\\n\\nSurvival (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a wet prairie in the USA\\u00a0found that mowing had no significant effect on woody plant survival over the following year.\"\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "The documented effects of physical interventions for managing unwanted vegetation in fens show varied outcomes depending on the specific method used:\n\n**Cutting/Mowing Herbaceous Plants:**\nIn fens, mowing/cutting to control problematic herbaceous plants typically had no significant effect on overall plant community composition according to studies in Swedish rich fens (Action 1770). However, mown plots contained more fen-characteristic plant species than unmown plots, and mowing typically increased Sphagnum moss cover while reducing purple moor grass cover (Action 1770). For maintaining/restoring disturbance in fens, cutting/mowing altered overall plant community composition and increased cover of fen- or wet meadow-characteristic plants (Action 1759). Six studies found that mowing reduced cover or abundance of at least one group of herbs including bindweed, reeds, sedges, purple moor grass and grass-like plants overall (Action 1759). Most studies showed that mowing/cutting increased plant species richness in fens and fen meadows compared to no mowing (Action 1759).\n\n**Cutting Large Trees/Shrubs:**\nStudies in fens found that cutting and removing trees/shrubs to maintain/restore disturbance resulted in plant community composition becoming more like target fen meadows and increased abundance of fen meadow plant species (Action 1761). Cutting and removing trees increased herb cover and biomass in forested fens (Action 1761). For controlling problematic large trees/shrubs, studies reported that plant community composition changed to become more like undegraded, open fen, with increased species richness and cover of fen-characteristic plants, and increased moss and vascular plant cover and species richness (Action 1772).\n\n**Complete Physical Removal:**\nPhysical removal of problematic plants in fens showed that removing mossy vegetation increased cover of fen-characteristic plants (Action 1768). However, moss removal had mixed effects on herb cover after 2-5 years, with results varying between species and sites (Action 1768). Removing moss carpet reduced total bryophyte and Sphagnum moss cover for three years, and moss removal increased plant species richness but only in drained areas (Action 1768).\n\n**Seasonal Timing Effects:**\nStudies found that plant species richness increased more over two years in summer-mown plots than spring- or autumn-mown plots in fen meadows (Action 1771).\n\n**Litter Removal:**\nRemoving plant litter in fens and fen meadows generally did not affect plant community composition or bryophyte cover, though one study found it increased plant species richness and diversity (Action 1760).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, several alternatives to completely removing livestock from degraded agricultural peatlands have been identified, though research on their effects varies in scope and availability. \n\nThe primary alternative with documented effects is reducing intensity of livestock grazing (Action 1735). One study in bogs found that total vegetation and shrub cover were greater where grazing intensity was lower, cottongrass cover was greater where grazing intensity was lower for one species, and vegetation biomass was higher where grazing intensity was lower.\n\nIn comparison, complete exclusion or removal of livestock from degraded peatlands (Action 1734) showed mixed results across ten studies. Seven studies found that excluding or removing livestock typically had no effect on cover of key herb groups, with five studies showing no effect on cottongrass cover and two showing no effect on sedge cover. Five studies found that excluding livestock typically had no effect on Sphagnum moss cover, and four studies found no effect on shrub cover specifically for heather or heathland communities. However, one study found that excluding sheep increased total vegetation, shrub and bryophyte biomass.\n\nOther potential alternatives lack research evidence. No studies were found evaluating the effects of limiting livestock density on farmland near peatlands (Action 1786), using barriers to keep livestock off ungrazed peatlands (Action 1733), or changing the season/timing of livestock grazing (Action 1737). Additionally, using grazing to maintain or restore disturbance (Action 1762) was evaluated in four studies in fens, with mixed results including increased cover of some herb groups and reduced shrub cover in some cases, but no studies specifically addressed this approach for degraded agricultural peatlands.",

    "relevant_summary": "Several vegetation introduction techniques have been evaluated for establishing Sphagnum moss cover in bog restoration after peat extraction. The moss layer transfer technique showed promising results, with restored areas developing greater moss or bryophyte cover (including Sphagnum) than unrestored areas after 4-8 years, and vegetation becoming more similar to local natural bogs (Action 1804). Adding mosses directly to peatland surfaces demonstrated variable success, with Sphagnum cover ranging from negligible to greater than 90% after 1-4 growing seasons across multiple sites in the UK, Canada, Finland, and Germany, with six controlled studies finding higher Sphagnum cover in sown than unsown plots (Action 1821). Direct planting of mosses showed survival rates of 47 out of 50 Sphagnum-dominated sods after one year in Lithuania, with studies reporting increased moss cover and growth after planting in the Netherlands, Germany, Ireland, Estonia, and Australia (Action 1818). Adding mixed vegetation to peatland surfaces resulted in Sphagnum presence in plots across 17 studies in Canada, the USA, and Estonia, with cover ranging from less than 1% to 73% after 1-6 growing seasons, though five studies reported that Sphagnum cover was very low (less than 1%) unless plots were mulched after spreading fragments (Action 1822). Replacing blocks of vegetation after peat extraction showed mixed results, with one UK study reporting declining Sphagnum moss cover in translocated blocks, while a Canadian study found that replaced vegetation blocks retained similar Sphagnum cover to an undisturbed fen (Action 1738). Multiple restoration interventions increased Sphagnum moss cover in studies from the Czech Republic and Estonia, though one UK study reported no change in Sphagnum cover following intervention (Action 1803).",
