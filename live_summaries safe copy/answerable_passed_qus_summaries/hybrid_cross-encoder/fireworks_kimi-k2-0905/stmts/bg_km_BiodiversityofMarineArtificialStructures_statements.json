Creating swimthrough habitats has shown beneficial effects: large swimthroughs (>100 mm) on subtidal structures increased overall fish abundance and species richness, while small swimthroughs (≤100 mm) supported higher juvenile fish species richness in some locations but not others. Managing or restricting harvesting on subtidal artificial structures was found to support different fish communities and higher fish species richness around structures with harvesting restrictions. Creating long flexible habitats (>50 mm) on subtidal structures supported fish species that were absent from structures without flexible habitats and had mixed effects on fish abundance. Creating groove habitats (1–50 mm) on subtidal structures altered fish community composition and supported fish species that were absent from structures without added habitat features. Ceasing or altering maintenance activities, such as reducing cleaning frequency, can increase abundance of certain fish species like seahorses on subtidal structures. Other potential habitat modifications for fish enhancement include creating large protrusions (>50 mm), large ridges or ledges (>50 mm), small protrusions (1–50 mm), and natural rocky reef topography, though limited direct evidence is available for their effects on fish communities specifically.",

Transplanting or seeding algae onto subtidal artificial structures has shown positive results, with studies in Italy and Croatia finding that the cover of canopy algae transplanted onto subtidal artificial structures increased when transplanted under cages (Action ID: 3471). Creating textured surfaces (≤1 mm) on subtidal artificial structures has demonstrated mixed effects on macroalgal abundance depending on the species group and site (Action ID: 3449). Similarly, creating small protrusions (1–50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures has shown mixed effects on macroalgal abundance depending on the species studied in Japan (Action ID: 3453). Creating groove habitats (1–50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures also had mixed effects on macroalgal abundances depending on the species group according to studies in Japan and Israel (Action ID: 3448). Using environmentally-sensitive materials on both intertidal and subtidal artificial structures has shown mixed effects on macroalgal abundance depending on the material type, species group, wave-exposure and site (Action IDs: 3469, 3470). Creating rock pools on intertidal artificial structures has demonstrated mixed effects on macroalgal abundances depending on the pool depth, shore level, species group and site (Action ID: 3476). Creating long flexible habitats (>50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures supported higher combined macroalgae and invertebrate biomass compared to structure surfaces without flexible habitats, with deeper flexible habitats supporting higher biomass than shallower ones (Action ID: 3451). Transplanting organisms onto intertidal artificial structures has shown benefits for macroalgae survival, with macroalgae transplanted onto intertidal artificial structures in Singapore being more likely to survive at mid- and highshore than at lowshore (Action ID: 3472). Creating natural rocky reef topography on subtidal artificial structures did not increase the abundance of juvenile canopy macroalgae that settled onto structure surfaces regardless of the topography depth according to a study in Italy (Action ID: 3446).",

All three studies found that creating hole habitats altered the combined macroalgae and invertebrate or mobile invertebrate and fish community composition on structures, supporting species that were absent from surfaces without habitat features. Two of three studies found increased macroalgae and invertebrate species richness and/or diversity, while one found no increase in combined mobile invertebrate and fish richness. Population responses were mixed - one study reported increased brown crab abundance but not other mobile invertebrates, while macroalgae and invertebrate abundance effects varied by species group.\n\nIntertidal zones (Australia and Europe): Five studies examined intertidal large hole habitats - three in estuaries in southeast Australia and the UK, one on an open coastline in the Netherlands, and one in a marina in northern Israel. All three community response studies found that hole habitats (usually combined with other features) supported macroalgae and/or invertebrate species absent from surfaces without habitat features and increased species diversity and/or richness. Population responses were generally neutral - one study found no increase in macroalgae abundance, and two studies showed no increase in invertebrate abundance overall, though limpet abundance showed mixed effects depending on shore level and site.\n\nKey differences: Subtidal studies showed more consistent positive effects on community composition and species richness/diversity (2 of 3 studies positive) compared with intertidal studies, though all intertidal studies showed positive effects on species diversity/richness. Subtidal environments appeared to show more variable population-level responses, particularly for invertebrate abundance, while intertidal environments generally showed neutral abundance effects but consistently supported species that otherwise wouldn't colonize artificial structures.",

Studies found mixed effects depending on these factors - for example, pit habitats showed variable effects on mobile invertebrate abundance based on their size and arrangement (Action ID: 3475).\n\nHabitat type: Different habitat modifications produce different results for invertebrate abundance. Creating small swimthrough habitats increased mobile invertebrate abundance (Action ID: 3468), while small ledges supported lower mobile invertebrate abundance than grooves (Action ID: 3464). Large ridges or ledges increased mussel and limpet abundance but not barnacles (Action ID: 3465).\n\nShore level: The vertical position on the intertidal zone influences outcomes. Studies found that habitat modifications had different effects on invertebrate abundance depending on shore level (Action ID: 3475, 3476).\n\nSite-specific factors: Local environmental conditions affect whether modifications increase invertebrate abundance. Multiple studies reported that the same habitat modifications had different effects depending on the site location (Action ID: 3459, 3464, 3469).\n\nSurface material: The construction material influences invertebrate colonization. Using environmentally-sensitive materials like hemp-concrete showed mixed effects on barnacle and mobile invertebrate abundances depending on the site (Action ID: 3469).\n\nWater retention capacity: Features that retain water show particular promise. Creating rock pools and hole habitats that retain water during low tide can support invertebrate species absent from standard artificial surfaces (Action ID: 3476, 3467).\n\nPresence of existing organisms: Transplanting or seeding organisms onto structures can influence subsequent invertebrate colonization, with effects varying depending on the presence of grooves and small ridges on surfaces (Action ID: 3472).",

(2) Transplanting or seeding organisms onto both subtidal and intertidal artificial structures consistently altered community composition - studies showed transplanted oysters on intertidal structures supported macroalgae, mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate and fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without transplanted oysters, and one subtidal study found transplanted oysters altered the combined invertebrate and fish community composition (Actions 3471, 3472). (3) Creating flexible habitats on structures showed consistent effects - long flexible habitats (>50 mm) on intertidal structures altered the combined macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate community composition and supported species absent from surfaces without flexible habitats, while short flexible habitats also altered community composition (Actions 3460, 3459, 3450). (4) Using environmentally-sensitive materials, particularly ECOncrete™ combined with habitat features, consistently altered community composition compared with standard concrete (Actions 3469, 3470). (5) Creating groove habitats sometimes altered community composition, though effects were more variable and often site-dependent (Actions 3473, 3452).

Three studies found that oysters transplanted onto intertidal artificial structures supported macroalgae, mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate, and fish species that were absent from structures without transplanted oysters. However, the effectiveness depends on specific design features: survival in grooves versus on ledges varied by site, and the presence and size of grooves and small ridges on structure surfaces influenced species richness and abundance outcomes. Using environmentally-sensitive materials can also impact success, with some studies showing that alternative concrete compositions can alter community composition and species richness.

Long flexible habitats (Action ID: 3451) supported macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate or fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without flexible habitats, with higher combined macroalgae and invertebrate biomass compared to structure surfaces without flexible habitats. Deeper flexible habitats supported higher biomass than shallower ones. However, long flexible habitats had mixed effects on fish species richness, mobile and non-mobile invertebrate abundance, and fish abundance depending on factors such as species group, survey timing, flexible habitat length and density. Short flexible habitats (Action ID: 3450) had mixed effects on invertebrate community composition depending on density, length, and site, with no increase in invertebrate species richness observed. Invertebrate abundance showed mixed effects depending on survey week, species group, habitat length, or site, and seahorse abundance also varied by survey week. Both habitat types were used by seahorses, though this was only documented for long flexible habitats.",

Creating groove habitats (1-50 mm) shows mixed results, with some studies finding increased species richness while others show no effect (action ID 3473). Creating rock pools on intertidal artificial structures consistently supports higher species diversity, with nine of twelve studies showing increased combined macroalgae, invertebrate and fish species diversity (action ID 3476). Transplanting or seeding organisms onto intertidal artificial structures can increase richness, particularly mobile invertebrate species richness (action ID 3472). Using environmentally-sensitive materials shows variable results, with some materials like ECOncreteTM increasing species richness and diversity while others show no effect (action ID 3469). Creating small ridges or ledges generally supports lower species richness than grooves created between them (action ID 3464), while reducing structure slope combined with creating rock pools has shown positive effects on species richness (action ID 3461). Creating short flexible habitats appears to decrease overall species richness (action ID 3459). Managing harvesting restrictions shows limited evidence for directly increasing species richness (action ID 3458), while controlling non-native species lacks evidence (action ID 3439).",
