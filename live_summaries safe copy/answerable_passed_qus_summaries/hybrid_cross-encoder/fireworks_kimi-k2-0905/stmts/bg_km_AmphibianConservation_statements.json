Installing culverts or tunnels as road crossings is widely used, with 15 of 24 studies showing they were used by amphibians (by 15-85% of amphibians or 3-15 species), though effectiveness varies by design features like diameter, length, lighting, and substrate. Closing roads during seasonal amphibian migrations protects large numbers from death during breeding migrations. Human-assisted crossings involve volunteers moving amphibians across roads, with patrols moving thousands to half a million toads annually across Germany, UK, and Italy, though 64-70% of populations still declined over 6-10 years despite these efforts. Warning signage for motorists has been implemented, but is ineffective alone as over 500 toads were still killed on some roads despite signs. Modifying infrastructure like moving gully pots 10 cm away from kerbs decreased great crested newt falls by 80%.",

Specifically, shelterwood harvesting showed mixed results with some studies finding higher salamander abundance compared to clearcutting, while others found similar or initially higher then similar abundance. Thinning demonstrated better outcomes than clearcutting, with two studies finding higher amphibian abundance or less negative overall response in thinned forests compared to clearcut areas. However, harvesting trees in small groups did not result in higher salamander abundance compared to clearcutting when examined individually. While all harvesting methods, including partial harvesting, generally decreased salamander abundance compared to unharvested forests, the meta-analysis clearly indicates that partial harvesting methods have less severe impacts on salamander populations than clearcutting.",

Benefits include increased amphibian abundance, recruitment, survival and population growth. Four studies found that removing fish by catching significantly increased abundance of salamanders or frogs and improved recruitment, survival and population growth rate of cascades frogs. Eliminating fish using rotenone increased numbers of amphibian species, abundance and recruitment or newt populations in three studies. Fish exclusion using barriers increased weight gain of axolotls in one study, and pond drying to eliminate fish increased numbers of amphibian species and breeding success of frogs and newts.\n\nHowever, several harms and limitations were documented. One study found fish control had no significant effect on great crested newt populations and fish remained or returned within a few years. Fish control did not increase green toad breeding success in one study and fish were soon reintroduced. Most significantly, when rotenone was applied, many frogs died and a small number of newts showed symptoms of negative effects in two replicated studies. These findings demonstrate that while fish control can benefit some amphibian populations, the methods used can also directly harm amphibians and may not provide long-term solutions if fish reinvade.",

Head-starting programs for amphibians showed mixed success, with six of ten studies finding that released head-started animals established breeding populations or increased populations, while two studies found mixed results and two found no establishment of breeding populations.\n\nHowever, captive-bred green and golden bell frog releases showed poor outcomes, with studies finding that captive-bred frogs released mainly as tadpoles did not establish breeding populations, or only established stable breeding populations following one of four release programmes. Overall, while some amphibian translocations achieve success, the establishment of new populations through either translocation or release of captive-bred individuals appears to be challenging, with success rates varying significantly between species and programs.",

In contrast, green and golden bell frog reintroductions in Australia showed limited success, with one review and two before-and-after studies finding that captive-bred frogs released mainly as tadpoles did not establish breeding populations, or only established stable breeding populations following one of four release programmes. However, one Australian study did find that a small proportion of captive-bred green and golden bell frogs released as tadpoles survived at least 13 months after release. The Mallorcan midwife toad captive breeding programs achieved 85% survival to metamorphosis, though toads bred in captivity for nine or more generations showed slower tadpole development, reduction in one predator defence trait, and decreased genetic diversity.",

Hormone treatments to induce sperm and egg release have demonstrated success in stimulating reproduction, with studies showing male hormone treatment can stimulate or increase sperm production and result in successful breeding in captivity (Action ID 883, 3767). However, hormone treatments show variable results for females, with 30-71% producing viable eggs depending on the combination, amount, or number of doses of hormones (Action ID 883). Some studies found that hormone treatment did not stimulate egg production in certain cases. Artificial fertilization has also shown limited success, with one Australian study finding 55% of eggs were fertilized artificially but soon died (Action ID 834). The key challenge identified is that the success of artificial fertilization depends on the type and number of hormone doses used to stimulate egg production beforehand (Action ID 834). Both techniques require careful optimization of hormone protocols, and neither approach guarantees consistent breeding success across different frog species in Australian captive programs.",

Harvesting trees in small groups did not result in higher amphibian or salamander abundance compared to clearcutting, though the meta-analysis again showed smaller reductions than clearcutting. Selective harvesting showed mixed effects on different species, with some being more abundant and others less abundant compared to both control stands and other management types. Patch retention harvesting had limited evidence regarding amphibians, with one study finding that red-legged frogs did not show significant movement towards retained tree patches, though large patches were selected more than small ones.

Creating refuges through adding coarse woody debris to forest floors had mixed effects, with two replicated controlled studies in the USA and Indonesia finding no effect on amphibian species numbers or overall abundance, but one before-and-after study in Australia found that restoration including reintroducing coarse woody debris increased frog species (Action 772). Artificial refugia were found to be used by translocated Hamilton's frogs and hellbenders in two studies (Action 772). Creating ponds specifically for amphibians has been extensively studied, with 28 studies finding that amphibians used some or all created ponds, and creation of ponds maintained and increased amphibian populations in several European and North American studies (Action 869). Adding woody debris to ponds, encouraging aquatic plant growth as refuge against fish predation, and creating refuge areas in aquatic habitats are potential actions, though no studies were found that directly tested their effects on amphibian populations (Actions 814, 796, 813). Providing specific enclosure furniture such as rotting logs and hollow bamboo pipes promoted egg laying in frogs in one replicated study in Fiji (Action 1876).

Positive effects include establishment of translocated populations, with one study finding successful establishment of one of three translocated natterjack toad populations following limestone addition to ponds. Additionally, limestone addition has been shown to temporarily increase breeding by natterjack toads, increase larval and/or egg survival, and result in successful metamorphosis at two of three sites.\n\nHowever, negative side effects have also been documented. Studies found that adding limestone to ponds resulted in high tadpole mortality and pond abandonment by natterjack toads. Furthermore, higher numbers of abnormal common frog eggs were observed following limestone treatment.\n\nThe evidence suggests that while lime addition can provide short-term benefits for natterjack toad breeding and survival, it may also cause significant mortality and habitat abandonment issues, making it a management technique that requires careful consideration of potential drawbacks.",

Antifungal treatment, particularly itraconazole, was effective at curing amphibians of chytridiomycosis in 12 of 16 studies, including six of eight studies specifically testing itraconazole (Action ID: 882). However, six studies found that specific fungicides caused death or other negative side effects in amphibians. Temperature treatment showed high effectiveness, with four of five studies finding that increasing enclosure or water temperature to 30-37°C for over 16 hours cured frogs and toads of chytridiomycosis (Action ID: 770).\n\nThe least beneficial treatment strategies are antifungal skin bacteria or peptides and antibacterial treatments. Three of four studies found that adding antifungal bacteria to the skin of salamanders or frogs exposed to chytrid fungus did not reduce infection rate or death, and treatment with antimicrobial skin peptides did not significantly increase survival of common toads (Action ID: 764). Antibacterial treatments showed mixed results, with trimethoprim-sulfadiazine increasing survival time but not curing blue-and-yellow poison dart frogs of chytridiomycosis (Action ID: 763).",

However, one study found that genetic diversity was reduced in reintroduced captive-bred populations, although predator defenses were maintained.\n\nMore broadly, two of three studies on captive-bred toads found successful population establishment in Denmark, Sweden and the USA, with one case showing 70% success rate at sites. However, one study found no population establishment from captive-bred and head-started toads. For Puerto Rican crested toads, survival was notably low with 25% being predated within two days of release.\n\nIn terms of captive breeding success, Mallorcan midwife toads achieved 85% survival to metamorphosis, though toads bred for nine or more generations showed slower tadpole development and decreased genetic diversity. Ten replicated studies found that various toad species successfully produced eggs in captivity, with eight finding successful rearing to tadpoles, toadlets or adults, while two studies documented high mortality after hatching or metamorphosis.",

Diameter is important, with three of six studies finding that wider culverts are used more by amphibians. Length matters too, with one of two studies showing long culverts are avoided by amphibians. Lighting affects usage patterns, with all three studies showing mixed effects of lighting conditions. Substrate type influences success, with three of six studies finding that natural substrates are used more than artificial ones. The presence of water has mixed effects according to two of three studies. Entrance location affects usage, as does tunnel climate. Importantly, the majority of successful culverts/tunnels had barrier fencing installed to guide amphibians to entrances. Certain designs should be avoided: one-way tunnels with vertical entry chutes caused high mortality in common toads, and condensation from steel culverts created toxic metal concentrations. Even with well-designed passages, thousands of amphibians may still be killed on roads, indicating that tunnels and culverts alone may not eliminate road mortality.",
