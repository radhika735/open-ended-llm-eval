Two reviews and two replicated controlled trials found that uncut rye grass strips resulted in increased bird numbers, with seed-eating birds showing strong preference for rye grass cut only once compared to plots cut multiple times (Action IDs: 132, 224). In contrast, evidence for raising mowing height shows limited benefits - a UK review found that while raised mowing height may have increased Eurasian skylark productivity, it was insufficient to maintain local populations, and a randomized replicated controlled study found no increase in foraging bird numbers on plots with raised mowing heights compared to shorter grass (Action ID: 222). For non-seed eating birds, responses to uncut rye grass were more variable, with some species avoiding uncut areas (Action ID: 224). One study found that ground beetle diversity was higher in uncut silage field headlands, but only after three years of treatment (Action ID: 132).",

Water level management is a key technique, with raising water levels in ditches or grassland showing positive effects on wetland plants, invertebrates, and breeding birds (Action 121). Traditional water meadow maintenance involves managing water flow through irrigation systems, with studies from Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and UK showing increased bird populations and plant species richness (Actions 696, 3971, 119).\n\nVegetation management techniques include cutting or mowing, with 20 studies showing that cutting herbaceous plants can increase plant species richness and maintain stable vegetation communities. Summer cutting (June) was found to be particularly effective for maintaining vegetation stability. The timing of cutting is important, with different seasons producing varying effects on plant communities (Actions 3044, 3070, 1759).\n\nGrazing management is another important technique, with studies showing that light to moderate cattle grazing can maintain plant species richness similar to mowing regimes. Grazing intensity affects results, with intermediate cattle grazing showing higher abundance of marsh fritillary caterpillars compared to high or low intensity grazing (Actions 3050, 3112, 3971).\n\nFor restoration of degraded sites, topsoil removal has proven effective, with 6 studies showing increased plant species richness and improved establishment of target species when combined with seeding or planting. Introduction of target plant species through hay spreading, seed transfer, or planting seedlings is commonly used alongside other techniques (Actions 3415, 3221, 3426, 1711).\n\nCombined approaches are often most successful, with studies finding that removing topsoil and introducing target plant species together, plus managing water levels and using appropriate grazing or mowing regimes, provides the best results for restoring species-rich wet meadow communities.",

Set-aside areas provide important nesting habitat, with systematic reviews showing significantly higher densities of farmland birds on set-aside fields compared to conventionally farmed fields. Other non-lethal alternatives include reducing tillage practices which can increase Eurasian skylark nest density, creating raised nesting areas to protect from weather extremes, and implementing nest marking during harvest operations to prevent accidental destruction by farming activities.

However, effects were species-specific with only certain bird species showing positive associations, and some studies found inconsistent or no effects on farmland bird numbers. Stubble management affected use by birds, with species showing preferences for different stubble heights and management types.\n\nFor spring sowing, nine studies found that planting crops in spring rather than autumn resulted in higher numbers of farmland birds, with population increases after the start of spring sowing or higher populations on sites with spring-sown cereals compared to winter cereals. Benefits included more bird species and population increases, with several species breeding for the first time after spring sowing began.

Bird species including northern lapwing, Eurasian skylark, stone curlew, grey partridge and yellow wagtail successfully bred in lapwing plots (Actions 562, 213). Three studies found that farms with uncropped cultivated margins showed similar or higher butterfly species richness and abundance compared to conventional farms (Action 3923). Two studies found that nesting success of birds was higher in lapwing plots compared to crops (Action 213).\n\nHowever, two UK studies found that leaving these plots had no effect on 11 out of 12 farmland bird species or ground beetles (Action 562). One review found evidence that pernicious weeds were more commonly found on uncropped cultivated margins than conservation or conventional headlands (Action 562). Studies found concerning effects on grey partridge populations - the proportion of young partridges in the population was lower in areas with high proportions of uncropped cultivated margins, and grey partridge productivity was not related to the amount of lapwing plots on a site (Actions 562, 213). A few studies noted that the value of naturally regenerated margins was based on thistle species considered to be pernicious weeds requiring control, and that the value for wildlife was not consistent from year to year (Action 20).",

Design factors significantly affect occupancy - thirteen studies found that use, productivity, or usurpation varied with nest box design, including entrance hole size and overall dimensions. Position and orientation are critical - fourteen studies found different occupation or success rates depending on position and orientation, with nest boxes positioned higher above ground showing higher occupancy rates, more eggs, and more hatched young. Habitat context matters significantly, with studies finding that nest success within boxes was related to the amount of pasture available in the surrounding landscape. Predation risk is a major factor, with studies showing that hidden nest sites have higher success rates than easily visible ones, and relocating nest boxes can reduce predation rates. Management practices also influence success - cleaning nest boxes can affect occupancy preferences, though effects vary by species. Competition between species for nest boxes is documented, but providing additional boxes doesn't necessarily reduce competitive interactions. Environmental factors like proximity to water versus land positioning affect wildfowl nest success, and some species show strong preferences for specific habitat types like wetland versus farmland locations.",
