Seven studies found that glyphosate reduced C. helmsii, with one study showing 98% reduction when combined with diquat, and another achieving 80% reduction when covering with carpet before glyphosate treatment. Three out of four studies found that diquat or diquat alginate reduced or eradicated submerged C. helmsii, while one study found no effect. Treatment with dichlobenil and terbutryne showed partial reductions in biomass in controlled trials, but one field study found no effect from dichlobenil. Hydrogen peroxide was found to be ineffective according to one controlled study.\n\nPhysical methods show different effectiveness results. Lightproof barriers (black sheeting or carpet strips) were effective in five before-and-after studies, eradicating or severely reducing C. helmsii cover, although progressive recolonization occurred at two sites. Salt water was highly effective, with two replicated controlled container trials and two field trials finding that seawater eradicated C. helmsii. There is currently no evidence available for the effects of manual or mechanical control methods.\n\nThe combination of physical and chemical methods shows promise, with one study finding that covering C. helmsii with carpet followed by glyphosate treatment killed 80% of the plant.",

Double fyke nets have been shown to be effective for catching bullfrog tadpoles in small shallow ponds. Adult bullfrogs can be captured using traps floating on the water surface overnight. A study in France found that shooting metamorphosed individuals before reproduction as part of a combination treatment resulted in a significant reduction in the number of recorded adults and juveniles. For biocide application, a replicated controlled study found that chemical treatments including caffeine (10% solution), chloroxylenol (5% solution), and a combined treatment of Permethrin (4.6% solution) and Rotenone (1% solution) were effective in killing American bullfrogs.

    "provider": "fireworks/fp8",
    "relevant_summary": "Several alternative methods to chemical control have shown effectiveness for managing invasive Asian clam populations in industrial water systems. Mechanical removal has proven highly effective, with suction dredging reducing Asian clam densities by 96% within sediment over two weeks, with the reduction persisting for a year (action 1120). Various dredge types have also shown effectiveness, achieving biomass reductions of 74-95% and density reductions of 65-95% (action 1120). For industrial water systems, mechanical removal combined with regular cleaning of industrial pipes and the addition of sand filters has been found to be effective methods for permanently removing or reducing Asian clam numbers (action 1119).

For water primrose (Ludwigia grandiflora), studies found that hand pulling and raking failed to reduce abundance in some cases, whereas hand-pulling from pond margins successfully eradicated a smaller population (Action ID: 1138). A combination approach using glyphosate herbicide followed by mechanical removal achieved a 75% kill rate (Action ID: 1140). For skunk cabbage (Lysichiton americanus), annual physical removal over five years successfully removed an entire stock of recently established plants (Action ID: 1101), while manual removal was effective for small outbreaks of small-growing plants. However, twice-yearly full removal over four years still required large numbers of plants to be removed annually (Action ID: 1101). For floating pennywort (Hydrocotyle ranunculoides), a two-week physical removal program resulted in growth exceeding removal rates, and while mechanical digger removal plus monthly hand picking greatly reduced coverage, it did not achieve complete eradication (Action ID: 1126). These findings suggest that population size, plant age, frequency of removal, and use of combination treatments are key factors influencing success.",

The combination of 2,4-D with MCPA completely eliminated parrot's feather plants in field studies (action ID 1606), while endothall treatment resulted in temporary cover reduction that later returned to pre-treatment levels (action ID 1681). For water primrose, glyphosate mixed with surfactants achieved 97-100% mortality rates in field studies (action ID 1139), with triclopyr TEA at 0.25% concentration killing 100% of young plants in laboratory settings (action ID 1139). Combination treatments using glyphosate with surface active agents like Cygnet-Plus followed by mechanical removal achieved 75% kill rates (action ID 1140). For skunk cabbage, glyphosate effectiveness varied between studies - one UK study found it killed all plants (action ID 1102), while another found it was unsuccessful with only limited growth reduction, whereas 2,4-D amine consistently achieved successful eradication at 9 litres/ha (action ID 1102).",

For netting, a replicated study in Belgium (1999-2000) found that double fyke nets could significantly reduce brown bullhead populations over 8cm in shallow interconnected ponds. All other potential control methods - including electrofishing, combined netting and electrofishing, biological control using native predators, draining waterbodies, habitat manipulation, trapping with sound or pheromonal lures, changing pH or salinity, UV radiation, and public education - have no documented evidence of effectiveness.

Direct removal methods show mixed effectiveness: double fyke nets have been found effective for catching bullfrog tadpoles in small shallow ponds (action 1046), but adult capture success using fyke nets is very low (action 1045). However, adult bullfrogs can be captured overnight using floating traps, though populations rapidly rebound after intensive adult removal (action 1045). A combination treatment including shooting metamorphosed individuals before reproduction showed significant reduction in adult and juvenile numbers (action 1045). Biocide application using chemicals like caffeine (10% solution), chloroxylenol (5% solution), and combined Permethrin (4.6% solution) plus Rotenone (1% solution) has proven effective (action 1048). However, no evidence was found for the effectiveness of pond draining (action 1042), habitat modification (action 1041), or egg collection (action 1047), as these methods lack quantitative testing.

However, adult bullfrogs can be captured overnight using floating traps, though populations rapidly rebound after intensive adult removal (action 1045). A combination treatment including shooting metamorphosed individuals before reproduction showed significant reduction in adult and juvenile numbers (action 1045). Biocide application using chemicals like caffeine (10% solution), chloroxylenol (5% solution), and combined Permethrin (4.6% solution) plus Rotenone (1% solution) has proven effective (action 1048).

However, several findings emerge: Double fyke nets were found to be effective for catching bullfrog tadpoles (juveniles) in small shallow ponds in Belgium, while catchability of adult bullfrogs using the same method was found to be very low. For adults, one small study found they can be successfully captured overnight using a single trap floating on the water surface. A replicated, controlled study in the USA found that adult bullfrog populations rapidly rebounded following intensive removal of adults, suggesting this approach may have limited long-term effectiveness. A before-and-after study in France found significant reduction in both adults and juveniles following removal of juveniles by trapping when carried out as part of a combination treatment. The evidence suggests that while adults are harder to catch with standard netting methods, juvenile removal through trapping can be effective when combined with other control measures, and adult populations tend to rebound quickly even after intensive removal efforts.",

The most effective approach appears to be combining trapping with predator introduction, as demonstrated by a before-and-after study in Switzerland and a replicated controlled study in Italy, which found this combination significantly reduced crayfish populations more effectively than predation alone (Action ID: 1031). Trapping with food bait (tinned meat) was found to be more effective than pheromone baits, catching over half of all trapped crayfish in a controlled study in Italy (Action ID: 1029). Natural predation using eels and pike has shown effectiveness in reducing crayfish populations in replicated controlled studies in Italy and France (Action ID: 1030). Chemical control using the natural pyrethrum Pyblast at 0.05 mg/l concentration was effective at killing crayfish in water, though application to drained burrows was not effective, as shown in a replicated controlled study in Italy (Action ID: 1036). Barriers made of concrete dams with anti-crawling features successfully contained crayfish spread upstream in a before-and-after study in Spain conducted between 2007-2010 (Action ID: 1037). Male sterilization through X-ray exposure reduced offspring production by 43% in a replicated laboratory study in Italy (Action ID: 1032). However, several methods including draining waterways, electrofishing, and removal of food sources currently lack evidence of effectiveness (Action IDs: 1034, 1035, 1033).",

For water primrose (Ludwigia species), a controlled field study in China found that a flea beetle caused heavy feeding destruction on prostrate water primrose seedlings and showed host specificity to the target plant and Indian toothcup, while a replicated field study in the USA found that flea beetle introduction significantly reduced large-flower primrose-willow abundance. The evidence suggests that host specificity and proper agent selection are important factors, as demonstrated by the success of host-specific flea beetles for water primrose control. However, no studies were found evaluating general factors that influence the success or failure of non-native herbivore biological control programs for aquatic plants, indicating a significant knowledge gap in understanding what makes these programs effective.",

Laboratory studies indicate that biocides chlorine, potassium and copper are effective at killing Asian clams, with higher concentrations of chlorine and bromine delivered at higher temperatures shortening the time required for mortality. Temperature manipulation is another effective approach, with laboratory studies showing that temperatures of 36°C or higher killed Asian clams within or after four days. Mechanical removal methods have also proven successful, with suction dredging reducing Asian clam densities by 96% over two weeks in North American studies, and various dredge types in Ireland achieving biomass reductions ranging from 74% to >95% and density reductions from 65% to 95%.
