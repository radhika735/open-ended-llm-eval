However, transplanting oysters had mixed effects on combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness, depending on the site and presence of grooves and small ridges on surfaces. Oyster transplantation increased mobile invertebrate species richness but did not consistently increase fish species richness or abundance. Survival of transplanted organisms varied depending on species, site conditions, and structural features - oyster survival was higher in grooves compared with ridges, though survival rates varied by site. Studies found that transplanting oysters did not increase combined macroalgae and invertebrate abundance overall, though effects varied with surface features like grooves and ridges.

These studies were conducted across various locations in the UK and Singapore. Pit habitats also supported species that were absent from structure surfaces without pits.\n\n**Groove habitats (1-50 mm)** showed mixed but generally positive results, with 3 out of 6 replicated controlled studies demonstrating increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness and/or diversity. Seven studies found that grooves supported species absent from surfaces without grooves.\n\n**Rock pools** demonstrated strong effectiveness, with 9 out of 12 replicated controlled studies showing higher combined macroalgae, invertebrate and/or fish species diversity and/or richness compared to structure surfaces without pools. Rock pools supported species that were absent from surfaces without pools and provided habitat for various taxa including macroalgae, invertebrates, and fishes.\n\n**Combined groove and ridge/ledge habitats** showed positive results in 6 out of 11 replicated controlled studies, increasing combined macroalgae and invertebrate species diversity and/or richness. However, results were mixed depending on factors such as size, arrangement, shore level, and site.\n\n**Hole habitats (>50 mm)** were effective in all 3 replicated controlled studies, increasing combined macroalgae and invertebrate species diversity and/or richness, and supporting species absent from surfaces without holes.\n\nIn contrast, **short flexible habitats** decreased species richness, while **small ridges/ledges alone** generally supported lower species richness than grooves. **Natural rocky reef topography** and **small swimthrough habitats** showed limited effectiveness in increasing species richness.",

    "relevant_summary": "In European marine environments, creating textured surfaces on intertidal artificial structures shows varied outcomes. Based on multiple studies conducted in the UK and Netherlands, textured surfaces (≤1 mm) on intertidal structures demonstrated mixed effects on species richness, with results depending on the type of texture created and the specific site. Macroalgal abundance was not significantly increased by textured surfaces in two studies from the Netherlands, while invertebrate abundance showed variable responses. One UK study found that creating textured surfaces along with environmentally-sensitive material increased barnacle abundance regardless of texture type, but different textures supported different abundances. The effectiveness of surface texturing appears to be context-dependent, varying by location and species group, with some studies showing no significant increase in overall species richness or abundance. Natural rocky reef topography created on intertidal structures in UK sites also showed mixed effects on invertebrate abundance and did not consistently increase species richness. Additionally, groove habitats (1-50 mm) created alongside ridges and ledges demonstrated site-dependent effects on biodiversity, with some European locations showing increased species richness while others showed no significant changes.",

Creating swimthrough habitats has shown beneficial effects: large swimthroughs (>100 mm) on subtidal structures increased overall fish abundance and species richness, while small swimthroughs (≤100 mm) supported higher juvenile fish species richness in some locations but not others. Managing or restricting harvesting on subtidal artificial structures was found to support different fish communities and higher fish species richness around structures with harvesting restrictions. Creating long flexible habitats (>50 mm) on subtidal structures supported fish species that were absent from structures without flexible habitats and had mixed effects on fish abundance. Creating groove habitats (1–50 mm) on subtidal structures altered fish community composition and supported fish species that were absent from structures without added habitat features. Ceasing or altering maintenance activities, such as reducing cleaning frequency, can increase abundance of certain fish species like seahorses on subtidal structures. Other potential habitat modifications for fish enhancement include creating large protrusions (>50 mm), large ridges or ledges (>50 mm), small protrusions (1–50 mm), and natural rocky reef topography, though limited direct evidence is available for their effects on fish communities specifically.",

Pit habitats showed more variable results with 8 of 12 studies finding increased species richness/diversity, while others found no effect or mixed effects depending on site conditions.\n\nRegarding abundance effects, hole habitats showed no significant increases in macroalgal abundance (1 study) and had mixed effects on invertebrate abundance (2 studies). Pit habitats demonstrated more complex patterns with studies showing increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate abundance in some cases, but no effect or decreased abundance in others. Fish abundance and richness were only measured for pit habitats, with one study finding increases when pits were combined with grooves.\n\nBoth habitat types were used by various organisms including sea slugs, urchins, and octopuses, with pit habitats also supporting periwinkles, macroalgae, and providing feeding opportunities for fish.",

Transplanting or seeding algae onto subtidal artificial structures has shown positive results, with studies in Italy and Croatia finding that the cover of canopy algae transplanted onto subtidal artificial structures increased when transplanted under cages (Action ID: 3471). Creating textured surfaces (≤1 mm) on subtidal artificial structures has demonstrated mixed effects on macroalgal abundance depending on the species group and site (Action ID: 3449). Similarly, creating small protrusions (1–50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures has shown mixed effects on macroalgal abundance depending on the species studied in Japan (Action ID: 3453). Creating groove habitats (1–50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures also had mixed effects on macroalgal abundances depending on the species group according to studies in Japan and Israel (Action ID: 3448). Using environmentally-sensitive materials on both intertidal and subtidal artificial structures has shown mixed effects on macroalgal abundance depending on the material type, species group, wave-exposure and site (Action IDs: 3469, 3470). Creating rock pools on intertidal artificial structures has demonstrated mixed effects on macroalgal abundances depending on the pool depth, shore level, species group and site (Action ID: 3476). Creating long flexible habitats (>50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures supported higher combined macroalgae and invertebrate biomass compared to structure surfaces without flexible habitats, with deeper flexible habitats supporting higher biomass than shallower ones (Action ID: 3451). Transplanting organisms onto intertidal artificial structures has shown benefits for macroalgae survival, with macroalgae transplanted onto intertidal artificial structures in Singapore being more likely to survive at mid- and highshore than at lowshore (Action ID: 3472). Creating natural rocky reef topography on subtidal artificial structures did not increase the abundance of juvenile canopy macroalgae that settled onto structure surfaces regardless of the topography depth according to a study in Italy (Action ID: 3446).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence, creating large hole habitats (>50mm) on artificial structures shows varying biodiversity outcomes between subtidal zones in Israel and Sweden compared to intertidal zones in Australia and Europe.\n\nSubtidal zones (Israel and Sweden): Three studies examined subtidal large hole habitats - one on an open coastline in northern Israel, one in a marina in northern Israel, and one off the west coast of Sweden. All three studies found that creating hole habitats altered the combined macroalgae and invertebrate or mobile invertebrate and fish community composition on structures, supporting species that were absent from surfaces without habitat features. Two of three studies found increased macroalgae and invertebrate species richness and/or diversity, while one found no increase in combined mobile invertebrate and fish richness. Population responses were mixed - one study reported increased brown crab abundance but not other mobile invertebrates, while macroalgae and invertebrate abundance effects varied by species group.\n\nIntertidal zones (Australia and Europe): Five studies examined intertidal large hole habitats - three in estuaries in southeast Australia and the UK, one on an open coastline in the Netherlands, and one in a marina in northern Israel. All three community response studies found that hole habitats (usually combined with other features) supported macroalgae and/or invertebrate species absent from surfaces without habitat features and increased species diversity and/or richness. Population responses were generally neutral - one study found no increase in macroalgae abundance, and two studies showed no increase in invertebrate abundance overall, though limpet abundance showed mixed effects depending on shore level and site.\n\nKey differences: Subtidal studies showed more consistent positive effects on community composition and species richness/diversity (2 of 3 studies positive) compared with intertidal studies, though all intertidal studies showed positive effects on species diversity/richness. Subtidal environments appeared to show more variable population-level responses, particularly for invertebrate abundance, while intertidal environments generally showed neutral abundance effects but consistently supported species that otherwise wouldn't colonize artificial structures.",

Sixteen studies examined intertidal applications across multiple global locations. Community composition effects were mixed - some studies found alterations in macroalgae and invertebrate communities with species present that were absent from smooth surfaces, while others found no significant effects or mixed results depending on site-specific factors, water-retaining covers, and size/arrangement of features. Species diversity and richness showed similar patterns, with approximately half of studies reporting increases in combined macroalgae and invertebrate diversity/richness, while others found mixed effects depending on groove/ridge dimensions, shore level, and environmental factors. For specific groups, macroalgal and invertebrate richness showed mixed results depending on location and feature dimensions, while fish species richness generally showed no increase. Abundance patterns were equally variable - some studies reported increased macroalgae and invertebrate abundance, while others found no effect or mixed results. Three subtidal studies showed comparable trends, with some evidence for altered community composition and increased richness, but effects varied by surface orientation and other factors. When combined with larger ledges (>50 mm), some studies reported increased abundance and diversity of certain groups like mussels and rockweed, but effects remained species-specific and context-dependent.",

    "relevant_summary": "When modifying intertidal artificial structures, several factors influence whether invertebrate abundance increases:\n\nHabitat size and arrangement: The size and spatial arrangement of created habitats significantly affects invertebrate abundance. Studies found mixed effects depending on these factors - for example, pit habitats showed variable effects on mobile invertebrate abundance based on their size and arrangement (Action ID: 3475).\n\nHabitat type: Different habitat modifications produce different results for invertebrate abundance. Creating small swimthrough habitats increased mobile invertebrate abundance (Action ID: 3468), while small ledges supported lower mobile invertebrate abundance than grooves (Action ID: 3464). Large ridges or ledges increased mussel and limpet abundance but not barnacles (Action ID: 3465).\n\nShore level: The vertical position on the intertidal zone influences outcomes. Studies found that habitat modifications had different effects on invertebrate abundance depending on shore level (Action ID: 3475, 3476).\n\nSite-specific factors: Local environmental conditions affect whether modifications increase invertebrate abundance. Multiple studies reported that the same habitat modifications had different effects depending on the site location (Action ID: 3459, 3464, 3469).\n\nSurface material: The construction material influences invertebrate colonization. Using environmentally-sensitive materials like hemp-concrete showed mixed effects on barnacle and mobile invertebrate abundances depending on the site (Action ID: 3469).\n\nWater retention capacity: Features that retain water show particular promise. Creating rock pools and hole habitats that retain water during low tide can support invertebrate species absent from standard artificial surfaces (Action ID: 3476, 3467).\n\nPresence of existing organisms: Transplanting or seeding organisms onto structures can influence subsequent invertebrate colonization, with effects varying depending on the presence of grooves and small ridges on surfaces (Action ID: 3472).",

    "relevant_summary": "The outcomes of creating natural rocky reef topography on artificial structures differ significantly between intertidal studies in the UK and subtidal studies in Italy. In the UK intertidal studies (action 3435), creating natural rocky reef topography on artificial structures had no significant effect on combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness, but showed mixed effects on barnacle and mobile invertebrate abundances depending on the site. The natural topography was colonized by macroalgae and limpets, with limpets actively using shaded grooves and water-retaining depressions created by the topography. In contrast, the Italian subtidal study (action 3446) found that creating natural rocky reef topography on subtidal artificial structures did not increase the abundance of juvenile canopy macroalgae that settled onto structure surfaces, regardless of the topography depth. The intertidal UK studies demonstrated more complex outcomes with species utilizing the created habitats behaviorally, while the subtidal Italian study showed limited effects on algal settlement, with no reported community-level responses or behavioral outcomes.",

On intertidal structures, using hemp-concrete in place of standard-concrete increased mobile invertebrate species richness (Action 3469), and hemp-concrete or shell-concrete increased combined macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate abundance. However, using sandstone instead of basalt or reducing concrete pH did not increase the abundance of tubeworms, oysters, limpets, barnacles, or combined invertebrates (Action 3469). On subtidal structures, three of six replicated controlled studies found that using quarried rock instead of concrete or using ECOncreteTM with added habitats had mixed effects on non-mobile and mobile invertebrate abundance, depending on rock type, species group, and site (Action 3470). Two studies found quarried rock did not increase sponge, bryozoan, ascidian, mussel, barnacle, or Serpulid tubeworm abundance, while one found shell-concrete increased bivalve abundance (Action 3470). Three studies found ECOncreteTM with added habitats supported mobile and non-mobile invertebrate species absent from standard-concrete surfaces (Action 3470). For artificial reefs, five controlled studies found no differences in overall invertebrate abundances between different reef materials, though one found breakwaters made of oyster shell bags recruited more oysters and ribbed mussels than ReefBall breakwaters (Action 2259).",

On subtidal structures, three of six replicated controlled studies found that using quarried rock instead of concrete or using ECOncreteTM with added habitats had mixed effects on non-mobile and mobile invertebrate abundance, depending on rock type, species group, and site (Action 3470). Two studies found quarried rock did not increase sponge, bryozoan, ascidian, mussel, barnacle, or Serpulid tubeworm abundance, while one found shell-concrete increased bivalve abundance (Action 3470). Three studies found ECOncreteTM with added habitats supported mobile and non-mobile invertebrate species absent from standard-concrete surfaces (Action 3470). For artificial reefs, five controlled studies found no differences in overall invertebrate abundances between different reef materials, though one found breakwaters made of oyster shell bags recruited more oysters and ribbed mussels than ReefBall breakwaters (Action 2259).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"3469\",\n    \"3470\",\n    \"2259\"\n  ]\n}"

In contrast, interventions showing inconsistent or no effects on invertebrate abundance include creating textured surfaces (≤1 mm), hole habitats (>50 mm), small ridges or ledges (1-50 mm), and using environmentally-sensitive materials, with most studies finding no consistent increases in invertebrate abundance.",

Small protrusions, ridges, and ledges had mixed effects on community composition - some studies found no changes while others reported effects varying by site and habitat arrangement (Action ID: 3462, 3464, 3474). Large features showed more consistent positive outcomes, with large ledges increasing species diversity and abundance of macroalgae, microalgae, and invertebrates (Action ID: 3465). However, large protrusions and ridges did not consistently increase species richness compared to small features (Action ID: 3463, 3465).\n\nFor specific organism groups, small ledges supported lower mobile invertebrate richness than adjacent grooves but had similar fish richness (Action ID: 3464). Large ledges increased mussel and limpet abundances but not barnacles, and enhanced juvenile salmon feeding activity (Action ID: 3465). The effectiveness depended on feature arrangement - combining grooves with small ridges/ledges often produced better outcomes than individual features alone (Action ID: 3474).\n\nWhen both small and large features were tested together, results were mixed, with effectiveness varying by site, habitat height/depth, and species groups (Action ID: 3465, 3474).",

(2) Transplanting or seeding organisms onto both subtidal and intertidal artificial structures consistently altered community composition - studies showed transplanted oysters on intertidal structures supported macroalgae, mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate and fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without transplanted oysters, and one subtidal study found transplanted oysters altered the combined invertebrate and fish community composition (Actions 3471, 3472). (3) Creating flexible habitats on structures showed consistent effects - long flexible habitats (>50 mm) on intertidal structures altered the combined macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate community composition and supported species absent from surfaces without flexible habitats, while short flexible habitats also altered community composition (Actions 3460, 3459, 3450). (4) Using environmentally-sensitive materials, particularly ECOncrete™ combined with habitat features, consistently altered community composition compared with standard concrete (Actions 3469, 3470). (5) Creating groove habitats sometimes altered community composition, though effects were more variable and often site-dependent (Actions 3473, 3452). The evidence indicates interventions that create novel habitat features (pools, flexible structures) or introduce living organisms are most reliably effective at modifying community composition.",

However, when combined with other microhabitats (Action 3474), creating grooves and small ridges had mixed effects on community composition depending on the site and habitat arrangement, and increased species richness in some cases.\n\nFor pit habitats (Action 3475): Studies in Singapore found that pits altered macroalgae and invertebrate community composition, increased species richness and diversity in most cases, and supported species that were absent from surfaces without pits. When combined with grooves (Action 3473), these features also altered fish community composition and increased both fish species richness and abundance.\n\nFor groove habitats alone (Action 3473): Studies showed that grooves increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate abundance, increased fish species richness and abundance, and altered fish community composition and behavior (increased fish bites on surfaces).\n\nFor environmentally-sensitive materials (Action 3469): Studies in Singapore found that using alternative materials (like ECOncreTE) altered community composition, increased species richness and diversity, and supported species absent from standard concrete surfaces. However, material effects were mixed - limestone-cement had site-dependent effects on richness.\n\nFor organism transplantation (Action 3472): Studies in Singapore found that macroalgae transplanted onto structures had variable survival depending on shore level (higher survival at mid- and highshore), while corals and sponges showed species-dependent growth patterns.

Textured surfaces (≤1 mm) in two of three studies altered the combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition (Action ID: 3449). Using environmentally-sensitive materials like ECOncreteTM or shell-concrete in six of eleven studies altered the combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition and supported species absent from standard concrete surfaces (Action ID: 3470). Long flexible habitats (>50 mm) created on subtidal structures supported macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate species absent from surfaces without flexible habitats (Action ID: 3451). Finally, transplanting or seeding organisms onto subtidal artificial structures altered the combined invertebrate and fish community composition and increased species richness (Action ID: 3471).",

    "relevant_summary": "Multiple factors influence the effectiveness of oyster transplantation onto intertidal artificial structures in Australian estuaries for biodiversity enhancement. Site location is critical, with oyster survival varying between sites and being higher when transplanted into grooves compared with on ridges. The design of artificial structures significantly affects outcomes - creating pit habitats (1-50 mm) and grooves can enhance both oyster survival and broader biodiversity. Three studies found that oysters transplanted onto intertidal artificial structures supported macroalgae, mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate, and fish species that were absent from structures without transplanted oysters. However, the effectiveness depends on specific design features: survival in grooves versus on ledges varied by site, and the presence and size of grooves and small ridges on structure surfaces influenced species richness and abundance outcomes. Using environmentally-sensitive materials can also impact success, with some studies showing that alternative concrete compositions can alter community composition and species richness. The biodiversity benefits include increased mobile invertebrate species richness, though effects on fish abundance and species richness were generally not significant across multiple studies. Mixed effects on overall community composition and abundance were common, depending on the specific combination of structural modifications, materials used, and site characteristics.",

Creating pit habitats (1-50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures increases combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness in multiple studies (action ID 3475). Creating groove habitats (1-50 mm) shows mixed results, with some studies finding increased species richness while others show no effect (action ID 3473). Creating rock pools on intertidal artificial structures consistently supports higher species diversity, with nine of twelve studies showing increased combined macroalgae, invertebrate and fish species diversity (action ID 3476). Transplanting or seeding organisms onto intertidal artificial structures can increase richness, particularly mobile invertebrate species richness (action ID 3472). Using environmentally-sensitive materials shows variable results, with some materials like ECOncreteTM increasing species richness and diversity while others show no effect (action ID 3469). Creating small ridges or ledges generally supports lower species richness than grooves created between them (action ID 3464), while reducing structure slope combined with creating rock pools has shown positive effects on species richness (action ID 3461). Creating short flexible habitats appears to decrease overall species richness (action ID 3459). Managing harvesting restrictions shows limited evidence for directly increasing species richness (action ID 3458), while controlling non-native species lacks evidence (action ID 3439).",

Managing harvesting restrictions shows limited evidence for directly increasing species richness (action ID 3458), while controlling non-native species lacks evidence (action ID 3439).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"3475\",\n    \"3473\",\n    \"3476\",\n    \"3472\",\n    \"3469\",\n    \"3464\",\n    \"3461\",\n    \"3459\",\n    \"3458\",\n    \"3439\",\n    \"3435\"\n  ]\n}"

However, when grooves were combined with small protrusions/ridges/ledges, five of seven replicated studies found mixed effects on mobile invertebrate abundance depending on factors like depth/height of grooves and ridges, presence of large ledges, shore level, and site location (action 3474). Two studies found this combination increased mobile invertebrate abundance (action 3474). For large ridges/ledges (>50 mm) on intertidal structures, two replicated studies found they increased mussel and limpet abundance but not barnacles when combined with grooves and small protrusions (action 3465). Large protrusions (>50 mm) on intertidal structures increased limpet abundance but not barnacles when combined with large ridges (action 3463).
