Clearing or opening patches in forests generally increases butterfly species richness and abundance but can decrease moth species richness (Action ID 3938). Studies found higher butterfly abundance and species richness in cleared patches compared to unmanaged forest, with 19 out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern benefiting from small forest clearings. However, wider woodland rides had lower moth abundance than standard width rides or mature forest.\n\nCoppicing woodland typically increases butterfly abundance and species richness while potentially reducing macro-moth abundance compared to mature forest (Action ID 3939). Coppiced woodlands supported higher abundance of butterflies generally and heath fritillary specifically, as well as eastern eggar moth caterpillars. Different aged coppice supported different butterfly and moth communities, though macro-moth species richness did not change with coppice age.\n\nThinning trees within forests increases both butterfly species richness and abundance (Action ID 3940). Coniferous woodlands that had been thinned, sometimes with prescribed burning or mulching, showed greater butterfly species richness and abundance compared to unmanaged woodland. One study found that partially-cleared forest plots had higher butterfly species richness but lower moth species richness than closed-canopy forest.\n\nUsing thinning instead of clearcutting generally maintains moth species richness better than other harvesting methods (Action ID 3868). A controlled study found macro-moth species richness was higher after thinning than after patch-cutting or clearcutting, with richness similar to unharvested forest.",

The sixth study found that for three fritillary species rotational burning in prairies did not affect abundance, but for three others, in at least one region surveyed, abundance was lower in prairies managed by rotational burning, sometimes in combination with haying, grazing and/or mowing, than in prairies managed with only haying or grazing, or in unmanaged prairies. One replicated, site comparison study in the USA\\u00a0reported that Karner blue butterfly abundance was similar in rotationally burned and unmanaged oak savannas and prairies.

One replicated, site comparison study in the USA\\u00a0found that the abundance of regal fritillary was higher in rotationally burned prairies four years after the last burn than one or eight years after the last burn. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the USA\\u00a0found that, in June, the abundance of regal fritillaries in prairies burned on rotation that spring was lower than in prairies burned 1\\u20132 years ago, but in July the abundance was higher in recently burned prairies.\\nSurvival (1 study): One replicated study in South Africa\\u00a0found that populations of Karkloof blue persisted for at least a year following rotational burning.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\"\n}"

Evidence from multiple studies supports the use of shielded \"full cut-off\" lights, which reduced the number of individual moths and moth species attracted to lights in a study in Slovenia (Action ID: 3904). Using low intensity lighting was also effective, with a study in Germany finding that fewer moths were attracted to low intensity lights that emitted yellow light with little UV compared to higher intensity lights with broader spectra (Action ID: 3902). \n\nThe use of 'warmer' lighting colors (red/yellow) rather than other colors has the strongest evidence base, with five studies across Germany, the Netherlands, Slovenia, and UK finding that fewer individual moths and moth species were attracted to yellow, green, white, or red lights compared to UV, actinic, blue, or conventional metal halide lights (Action ID: 3906). \n\nOther available actions include restricting the use of polarized light (Action ID: 3903), minimizing road lighting to reduce insect attraction (Action ID: 3852), restricting timing of lighting to conserve natural light regimes (Action ID: 3901), using glazing treatments to reduce light spill from buildings (Action ID: 3905), using barriers or vegetation to block artificial light (Action ID: 3618), and limiting or prohibiting industrial and urban lighting at night (Action ID: 2208).

Planting parks, gardens and road verges with appropriate native species has been shown to increase species richness of butterflies and moths, with studies in Germany and the USA finding greater richness in areas with native plants compared to mixed or non-native plantings. Practising wildlife gardening by avoiding insecticides and herbicides has demonstrated higher butterfly abundance in urban gardens. Altering mowing regimes on greenspaces and road verges to be less frequent or unmown increases both species richness and abundance of butterflies compared to regularly mown areas, as shown in studies from Germany, the UK, and Canada. Protecting existing greenfield sites or undeveloped land within urban areas maintains higher butterfly species richness than developed urban parks. Establishing green infrastructure such as green roofs can provide habitat, with older green roofs containing more nectar plant species supporting higher butterfly abundance. Stopping herbicide use on pavements and road verges creates habitat corridors, particularly when restored roadside prairies replace non-native weed-dominated verges, leading to greater butterfly abundance and species richness while reducing butterfly mortality risk.",

One controlled, before-and-after study found that macro-moth species richness was higher after shelterwood harvesting than after patch-cutting or clearcutting, with richness similar to thinned and unharvested forests (Action ID: 3871). Another replicated, controlled study found that moth species richness recovered faster after shelterwood harvesting than after group selection harvesting or clearcutting (Action ID: 3871). \n\nFor selective logging, the results are more mixed. A replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that forests harvested by single tree selection had similar moth species richness to clearcut forests, but lower richness than unharvested forests (Action ID: 3867). Another study found that forests managed by shelterwood harvesting had similar moth species richness to single tree harvesting and clearcutting, but lower than unharvested forest (Action ID: 3871).\n\nThinning also showed positive results, with one study finding higher macro-moth species richness after thinning compared to patch-cutting or clearcutting, with richness similar to unharvested forest (Action ID: 3868). Group selection harvesting showed similar moth species richness to clearcutting but lower than unharvested forest (Action ID: 3868).\n\nOverall, the evidence suggests that shelterwood harvesting and thinning maintain better moth diversity than clearcutting, while selective logging results are more variable and often similar to clearcutting in terms of moth species richness.",

Rotational mowing practices, such as mowing strips in alternate years or leaving rotational areas uncut, show greater species richness and abundance of butterflies compared to complete annual mowing. Stopping herbicide use on road verges results in greater butterfly species richness and abundance compared to areas with unrestricted herbicide application, with reduced butterfly mortality risk on herbicide-restricted verges. Less frequently mown or unmown road verges have higher butterfly species richness, abundance, and diversity than frequently mown areas, with late summer mowing showing benefits over mid-summer mowing. Restoration and maintenance of species-rich grassland along verges with native wildflowers and larval food plants increases butterfly and moth species richness and abundance compared to non-native vegetation, while wider road verges support higher species richness and abundance than narrow verges.",

For vertebrate herbivore exclusion, ten studies across multiple countries found that fencing to exclude deer, elk, pigs, sheep and large herbivores generally increased butterfly and moth abundance, with five of eight studies showing higher abundance of butterflies, moths, caterpillars, and rare macro-moths in fenced areas, though two studies found mixed effects depending on fire intensity and year, and one found similar abundance between fenced and unfenced areas. Three studies found increased species richness in fenced forest plots for butterflies and macro-moths, while two studies found mixed effects on species richness. A global systematic review found that reducing or removing grazing increased abundance but did not affect species richness of butterflies and moths. For livestock management, changing livestock type showed that cattle or horse grazing increased species richness compared to sheep grazing in two studies, while reducing grazing intensity by lowering stocking density generally increased butterfly and moth abundance in eight of eleven studies, with five of eight studies showing greater species richness at lower stocking densities. Seasonal livestock removal showed mixed results, with three studies finding higher abundance when cattle or sheep were removed during summer or winter, but three studies finding similar abundance between seasonally grazed and continuously grazed areas.",

Two replicated, site comparison studies in Germany\\u00a0and Hungary\\u00a0found that old meadows mown in July\\u00a0and lightly grazed or annually mown meadows\\u00a0had a higher species richness of adult butterflies\\u00a0and caterpillars\\u00a0than recently established set-aside\\u00a0or cereal crops. One replicated, site comparison study in Switzerland\\u00a0found that meadows mown at least twice/year after mid-June had a similar species richness of butterflies to sown wildflower strips.\\n\\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (16 STUDIES)\\n\\nAbundance (16 studies): Five of ten site comparison studies (including nine replicated studies) in Germany, the USA, Russia and Finland, Italy, Spain\\u00a0and the Czech Republic\\u00a0found that semi-natural grasslands had a similar abundance of butterflies generally, and individual species of butterflies\\u00a0and moth caterpillars, when managed by extensive sheep, sheep and goat, cattle\\u00a0or livestock\\u00a0grazing compared to annual\\u00a0or occasional\\u00a0mowing, or rotational mowing or burning. Four of these studies found that grasslands managed by cattle, sheep\\u00a0or livestock\\u00a0grazing had a higher abundance of butterflies generally, and individual species of butterflies\\u00a0and moth caterpillars, than grasslands managed by annual mowing, rotational burning\\u00a0or unmanaged grasslands. Three of these studies found that grasslands managed by haying had a higher abundance of individual butterfly species\\u00a0than grasslands managed by grazing\\u00a0or burning\\u00a0or unmanaged grasslands. Four of these studies found that specific butterfly species\\u00a0and all butterflies\\u00a0were less abundant in mown, grazed\\u00a0or rotationally burned\\u00a0grassland than in unmanaged, rotationally burned\\u00a0or grazed and burned grassland.\\u00a0The ninth study found that in some areas, the abundance of specialist and grassland butterflies was higher in prairies managed by two-year rotational haying or by grazing, but in all cases abundance was higher at sites longer after they were last managed. One of three replicated, site comparison studies in Germany\\u00a0and Switzerland\\u00a0found that traditional hay meadows mown once/year in June or July had a higher abundance of heath fritillary adults and caterpillars than old, abandoned meadows. One study found that summer-grazed or mown grasslands had a higher abundance of farmland butterflies and burnet moths, but a lower abundance of woodland butterflies and burnet moths, than abandoned grasslands. The third study found that mown grasslands had a lower abundance of moths than unmown grasslands, but grazed grasslands had a similar abundance of moths to ungrazed grasslands. Two replicated, site comparison studies in China\\u00a0and Switzerland\\u00a0found that semi-natural grasslands managed by grazing\\u00a0or cutting twice/year after mid-June\\u00a0had a lower abundance of marsh fritillary eggs and caterpillars\\u00a0and adult butterflies\\u00a0than ungrazed margins and intercrops\\u00a0or sown wildflower strips. One replicated, site comparison study in Hungary\\u00a0found that semi-natural grasslands managed by either light grazing or mowing once/year in May or June had a higher abundance of butterflies than conventional wheat fields.\\nSurvival (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in China\\u00a0found that marsh fritillary eggs had a similar survival rate in uncultivated, grazed meadows and cultivated, ungrazed field margins and intercrops, but the survival of caterpillars was higher in the grazed meadows.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (5 STUDIES)\\nUse (5 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies in Austria\\u00a0and Germany\\u00a0found that 14 species of moth\\u00a0preferred grazed pastures while 24 others avoided them, and three species of butterfly\\u00a0and ten nocturnal moths\\u00a0preferred mown meadows, while 19 nocturnal moth species avoided them. One replicated, site comparison study in Spain\\u00a0found that meadows managed by summer-grazing or hay-mowing were more likely to be occupied by grizzled skipper and painted lady than unmanaged meadows, but small pearl-bordered fritillary occurred less frequently in grazed meadows than in hay meadows or abandoned meadows. One replicated, site comparison study in Finland and Russia\\u00a0found that three of 37 butterfly species preferred meadows which were mown annually in July or August to cattle-grazed pasture, but the other 34 species showed no preference. One replicated, site comparison study in China\\u00a0found that uncultivated, grazed meadows were less likely to be occupied by marsh fritillary eggs and caterpillars than cultivated field margins and intercrops.\"\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "Studies show that prescribed burning in forests can increase butterfly species richness and abundance. Three of four studies found that coniferous forests restored by burning (often in combination with thinning) had higher species richness of butterflies than unburned forests. Similarly, two studies found pine forests restored by burning had higher butterfly abundance than unburned forests. These benefits appear to be most pronounced 1-2 years after burning, with some studies showing increased abundance of specific species like Fender's blue caterpillars and eggs. However, there are also documented negative impacts. The primary negative impact is direct mortality during the fire event. One study in Australia reported fewer Eltham copper caterpillars in the spring after selective burning of eucalyptus forest compared to before burning. Additionally, research on Fender's blue butterfly found that caterpillar survival was lower in prairie plots burned one year before compared to unburned plots, indicating that recently burned areas may have reduced survival rates for early life stages. The timing of burning is also critical - one study found that early season burning increased caterpillar abundance, while late season burning did not have this benefit. Management considerations include leaving some areas unburned during prescribed burning operations, which can help mitigate negative impacts. Studies show that Karner blue butterflies increased in abundance over 2-3 years in areas where unburned patches were left, and six out of nine specialist butterfly species were more abundant when unburned areas were retained.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on studies from European farmland, there are clear differences in effectiveness between different field margin types for butterfly communities. Sown wildflower strips consistently demonstrate superior performance for butterfly conservation, with eight of thirteen studies finding higher species richness and diversity compared to conventional field margins, unsown margins, or cropped fields (Action 3932). Similarly, ten of seventeen studies found higher butterfly abundance in sown wildflower strips compared to conventional margins or cropped areas (Action 3932).\n\nIn contrast, uncultivated margins show mixed results. While some studies found uncultivated margins had higher species richness than cropped field edges (Action 3981), multiple studies demonstrated lower species richness and abundance compared to sown wildflower strips or grass and forb margins (Action 3981). Specifically, five studies showed uncultivated margins had lower species richness than sown margins, and six of seven studies found lower butterfly abundance in uncultivated margins compared to sown grass or wildflower margins (Action 3981).\n\nGrass buffer strips show intermediate results, with three of four studies finding higher butterfly abundance than cropped field edges, but floristically enhanced grass buffers consistently performing better than standard grass margins (Action 3982). The evidence strongly supports sown wildflower strips as the most effective approach for enhancing butterfly communities in European farmland systems.",

For ceasing mowing specifically, 14 studies found mixed abundance responses - 4 studies showed lower abundance compared to managed grasslands while 4 showed higher abundance, with effects varying by species type. Woodland and hedgerow butterflies increased but grassland/farmland species decreased after abandonment (action 3957). For ceasing grazing, 24 studies showed similar variability - 6 studies found higher abundance of butterflies and moths on abandoned grasslands, while 4 found lower abundance compared to grazed areas. Several studies reported that specialist species like large blue and silver-studded butterflies went extinct in some abandoned meadows (action 3956). Community composition studies indicated that abandoned grasslands became dominated by generalist butterfly species with fewer generations per year compared to managed grasslands (actions 3957, 3956). For species richness, results were equally mixed - about half of studies found similar richness between abandoned and managed grasslands, while others found either higher richness (especially for grasslands abandoned for 2-10 years) or lower richness (particularly for longer abandonment periods >10-20 years) compared to managed areas.",

The evidence suggests that moderate reduction in grazing intensity through methods like reduced stocking density, seasonal livestock removal, and rotational grazing are most consistently beneficial for butterfly populations.",

Light sheep grazing specifically showed higher micro-moth abundance compared to moderate/heavy grazing or no grazing. Behavior studies indicated that brown argus and Alcon large blue butterflies were more likely to occupy areas managed by cattle or pony grazing compared to unmanaged land.\n\nPrescribed fire studies: Evidence from 13 studies showed that prescribed burning in grasslands and open habitats also produced variable results. Community composition was generally similar between burned and unburned areas, though one study found lower species richness in patch-burned pastures compared to rotationally grazed ones. Population responses showed that some species (heath fritillary adults, marsh fritillary caterpillars, Fender's blue caterpillars and eggs) had higher abundance after burning, while others (Brenton blue butterfly, rosy marsh moth caterpillars, regal fritillary adults) had lower abundance on burned land. Some prairie specialists were less abundant in burned areas compared to hayed or grazed prairies, while generalist and migrant species showed higher abundance in burned areas. Leaving unburned patches during prescribed burning was beneficial, increasing abundance for 6 out of 9 specialist butterfly species.\n\nBoth management approaches showed species-specific responses, with the effectiveness depending on factors such as grazing intensity, burning frequency, and the presence of refugia (unburned patches in fire management).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from action documents, species-rich, semi-natural grasslands provide superior butterfly conservation benefits compared to set-aside areas in European agricultural landscapes. \n\nSpecies-rich, semi-natural grasslands maintained through traditional management (light grazing or annual mowing) consistently showed higher butterfly species richness and abundance compared to set-aside areas. One replicated study from Hungary found that semi-natural grasslands managed by either light grazing or mowing once/year in May or June had a higher abundance of butterflies than conventional wheat fields (action 3908). Multiple European studies demonstrated that old meadows managed through traditional practices had higher species richness of adult butterflies and caterpillars than recently established set-aside areas (action 3908).\n\nSet-aside areas, while showing some benefits over intensive arable farming, had mixed results for butterfly conservation. Studies found that set-aside fields had similar abundance of butterfly and moth adults and caterpillars to uncultivated field boundaries and extensively farmed land (action 3980), but did not consistently outperform semi-natural grasslands. While some set-aside areas sown with less competitive grasses showed higher butterfly abundance than cereal fields, they did not match the conservation value of established species-rich grasslands (action 3980).\n\nThe research demonstrates that restored grasslands from arable land can achieve similar or higher abundance of moths compared to conventional grasslands, but the time since restoration and seed mix composition significantly affects outcomes (action 3929). In contrast, long-established species-rich, semi-natural grasslands maintained through traditional management practices consistently provided more reliable and superior habitat for butterfly communities across multiple European studies.",

Sixty-four individual studies show some benefits to one or more wildlife groups.\\n\\n\\nSixty-five individual studies reported the effects of flower strips on invertebrates. Of these, fifty reported positive effects. Forty-one studies from eight European countries (including five reviews and twenty-three replicated controlled studies, of which one randomized and two site comparisons) found evidence that flower strips had a positive influence on invertebrate numbers with increased abundance, species richness/diversity, or both. Ten studies (nine replicated of which two controlled) found invertebrates visited or foraged on flower strips but did not specify increases/decreases in numbers. Two studies found effects on ground beetles other than changes in numbers. One replicated controlled study showed that ground beetles were more active or had enhanced feeding/reproductive conditions in flower strips. A review found flower strips supported ground beetle species that were rarely found in crops. Fifteen studies reported mixed or negative effects of flower strips on invertebrates. Six studies found no significant effects.\\n\\n\\nTwenty-one studies looked at the effects of flower strips on plants. Sixteen studies from seven European countries (including ten replicated controlled studies of which one randomized) found evidence that flower strips had higher plant cover, number of flowers, diversity, and species richness. One review found flower strips benefited plants but did not specify how. Four studies found negative or no effects of flower strips on the number or diversity of plant species.\\u00a0Five studies described the effects of different margin establishment or management techniques on plants.\\n\\n\\nSeven studies investigated birds and wildflower strips. Four replicated, controlled studies from Switzerland and the UK (two of which were randomized) and one review of European studies found evidence that plots sown with a wildflower or legume seed mix had a positive influence on birds. Flower strips attracted more birds or bird species and the number of birds using flower strips increased over time. Eurasian skylarks preferentially foraged in, and nested in or near, sown weed patches and were less likely to abandon their territories when they included sown weed patches. However one replicated trial in Switzerland found barn owls avoided sown wildflower areas. Two winter recording periods of the same replicated, controlled study in the UK found there were not more bird species or individuals on wildflower plots compared to control margins.\\n\\n\\nAll five studies investigating the effects of wildflower strips on small mammals (four replicated studies from Switzerland and one review of studies from north-western Europe) found evidence that small mammals benefit from strips sown with wildflowers or flowers rich in pollen and nectar, with increases in abundance, density and species richness.

Rearing conditions significantly affect outcomes, with lower densities showing higher survival rates for various species, and temperature playing a crucial role with 20°C being optimal compared to 25°C. For ant-associated species, survival varies depending on ant nest characteristics and species. Host plant quality is critical - monarch caterpillars showed different survival on different milkweed species, and some species require specific plant combinations for survival. Long-term captivity can affect butterfly condition, with populations becoming heavier but developing smaller wings over generations. Release success rates are variable, with only 25% of programs surviving >3 years and 8% surviving >10 years, often requiring continued supplementation. Captive-bred individuals frequently show lower survival than wild or translocated counterparts.",

The sixth study\\u00a0found that mountain Alcon blue caterpillars had a similar survival rate in ant nests with or without queens present. Two of these studies, and one replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the USA, found that the survival of large blue, mountain Alcon blue\\u00a0and monarch\\u00a0caterpillars differed when reared in ant nests of different species\\u00a0or on different species of milkweed. Two site comparison studies in the UK\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0found that large copper\\u00a0and Puget blue\\u00a0eggs had a similar survival rate to the caterpillar\\u00a0and adult\\u00a0stage whether they were laid in captivity or collected from the wild and reared in captivity. One of these studies also found that Puget blue caterpillars kept in refrigerators while overwintering had a lower survival than caterpillars kept in environmental chambers or outside. Three of four studies in South Africa\\u00a0and the UK\\u00a0reported that some wild-collected Brenton blue butterfly, Karkloof blue butterfly\\u00a0and Fishers\\u2019 estuarine\\u00a0moth eggs hatched, survived as caterpillars for three months\\u00a0or to adulthood, bred in captivity\\u00a0and the resulting captive population survived for at least eight generations. The other study reported that wild-collected Brenton blue butterfly eggs hatched in captivity and those caterpillars reared with only Pyllanthus incurvatus leaves died whereas all caterpillars also given Indigofera erecta leaves survived to the fourth instar of development. One study in South Africa\\u00a0reported that wild-caught final instar Cape Peninsula butterfly caterpillars reared in an artificial pugnacious ant nest successfully pupated and became adults, but captive-hatched first instar Cape Peninsula and Riley\\u2019s skolly butterfly caterpillars placed next to a nest did not survive to pupation.\\nCondition (5 studies): Two studies (including one controlled study) in the UK\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0found that adult large white from a population kept in captivity for &gt;25 years were heavier, and had smaller wings, than individuals from a population in its third generation in captivity, and captive-reared Puget blue adults were smaller than wild-caught butterflies. One of these studies also found that Puget blue caterpillars raised in environmental chambers or outdoor enclosures reached a similar size as adults. One replicated, controlled study in Spain\\u00a0found that mountain Alcon blue caterpillars reared in ant colonies with winged females were lighter than caterpillars reared in colonies without winged females. One replicated, controlled study in Israel\\u00a0found that spring webworm caterpillars fed vegetation from cattle-grazed pasture had a similar growth rate to caterpillars fed vegetation from an ungrazed paddock. One study in South Africa\\u00a0reported that Brenton blue butterfly caterpillars reared on Indigofera erecta leaves with no ants became dwarf adults, but those reared on whole Indigofera plants with an ant colony became full-sized adults.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\"\n}"

However, three studies found similar species richness between set-aside and arable/pasture fields, and one study found similar abundance to native prairies in the first year but lower abundance thereafter (3980).\n\nBeetle banks show more mixed results. Four UK studies found beetle banks had similar abundance of caterpillars to field margins and crop fields (3927), but lower abundance of adult butterflies compared to hedgerows (3927). However, one study found beetle banks managed under agri-environment schemes had higher species richness and abundance of micro-moths compared to conventionally managed margins (3927).\n\nUncropped cultivated margins also show varied effects. Four studies found these margins can increase butterfly abundance in some years, with farms under agri-environment schemes (including uncropped margins) having higher abundance of butterflies and micro-moths compared to conventional farms (3923). However, three studies found similar species richness between farms with and without these management options (3923).\n\nWildflower strips and floristically enhanced margins consistently show positive effects, with 10 of 17 studies finding higher abundance of butterflies and moths compared to conventional margins or cropped fields (3932, 3982).

Negative consequences include: extinction of specialist species like large blue and silver-studded blue butterflies in some abandoned meadows (Action ID: 3956); lower abundance of grassland and farmland butterfly species; reduced species richness in long-abandoned (>10-20 years) grasslands; dominance of generalist species in abandoned sites with fewer generations per year; and lower abundance of some species like spring webworm caterpillars.

Clearing patches in forests was found to increase butterfly species richness and abundance compared to unmanaged patches or closed canopy forest, as evidenced by studies showing higher general butterfly abundance and specific species increases (e.g., chequered blue, woodland brown, high brown fritillary, small pearl-bordered fritillary). However, cleared patches showed lower moth species richness than coppiced woodland or mature forest. One UK study found that larger cleared patches supported higher butterfly species richness and abundance than undisturbed forest, while another found both wider and standard width rides had similar macro-moth species richness to mature forest. Woodland coppicing also created habitat for butterflies, with studies showing higher butterfly species richness in coppiced woodland compared to unmanaged woodland, and higher abundance of butterflies generally and heath fritillary specifically. Coppiced woodlands supported different communities of moths and butterflies depending on coppice age, with recent coppice (2-4 years) generally supporting higher abundances than older coppice (>15 years). Both management techniques created habitat heterogeneity important for different species groups.",

A review of UK and Irish translocations found only 25% survived over three years and only 8% survived over 10 years. Translocation outside known native range showed similar patterns: two of three studies reported successful establishment lasting 8-28 years, while one population died out within a year.\n\nThirteen studies on captive breeding programs also showed mixed outcomes. Six studies reported captive-bred populations persisted 2-28 years and increased in abundance, while two studies documented population die-outs within 1-12 years. One review found the same survival statistics as translocations: 25% survival over three years and 8% over 10 years. Genetic studies showed translocated populations maintained genetic diversity similar to source populations 19-69 years after release.

Floristically enhanced grass buffer strips with wildflowers also proved effective, showing higher butterfly abundance and species richness than standard grass margins (Action ID 3982). Creating uncultivated margins around intensive arable fields increased butterfly species richness, especially when these margins were not cut in summer and were longer/wider rather than shorter/narrower, though butterfly abundance was sometimes lower than in sown margins (Action ID 3981). Leaving headlands unsprayed (conservation headlands) had positive effects on butterfly species richness and abundance compared to sprayed headlands (Action ID 3898). Wider grass margins (up to 6m) generally supported greater butterfly species richness and abundance than conventional-width margins (Action ID 3982). The key factors for success include: 1) Sowing wildflower or nectar mixtures rather than leaving natural regeneration, 2) Avoiding summer cutting to maintain flowering resources, 3) Creating wider margins where possible, and 4) Reducing pesticide use on headlands and margins.",

One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK\\u00a0found that farms with wildflower strips (along with other enhanced agri-environment scheme options) had a higher abundance of some butterflies, but a lower abundance of other butterflies, than farms with simpler agri-environment scheme management such as grass-only margins. One of two replicated, paired, controlled studies (including one randomized study) in the USA\\u00a0and the UK\\u00a0found that plots sown with one of three wildflower mixes had a higher abundance of moths than plots sown with two other mixes or a single flower species. The other study found that plots sown with either complex or simple flower mixes had a similar abundance of butterflies. One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK\\u00a0found that wildflower plots sown with lucerne\\u00a0had a higher abundance of butterflies than plots sown with borage, chicory or sainfoin.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)\\n\\nUse (2 studies): Two studies (including one replicated study) in the UK\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0reported that sown nectar flower plots\\u00a0and tropical milkweed plots\\u00a0were used by six species of butterflies and moths\\u00a0and monarch butterflies and caterpillars.\"\n}"
