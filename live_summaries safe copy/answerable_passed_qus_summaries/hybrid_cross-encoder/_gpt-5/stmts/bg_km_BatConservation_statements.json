Gate design influenced behavior: bats circled more and entered less after gating in one study; funnel designs were used more than round bar or angle iron designs; reducing bar spacing reduced passes; and significantly fewer bats emerged from a gated cave compared to a fenced cave in a paired comparison [999]. For fencing, evidence was limited but indicated no difference in population growth rates or occupancy between fenced/gated and unfenced caves in a replicated site comparison, and replacing a steel gate with a fence led to significantly more emerging southeastern myotis and gray myotis bats [1991]. Overall, studies directly comparing structures reported reduced emergence with gates relative to fences, while broader comparisons showed neutral to positive abundance responses with well-designed gates and neutral population metrics with fencing [999, 1991].",

Automatically reducing blade rotation when bat activity is predicted to be high reduced bat fatalities in two replicated studies (Germany and USA), for all bats combined and for five species [971].

One study in Spain found the distributions of 10 of 11 bat species overlapped with designated protected areas more than expected by chance [2045]. Legally protecting bats during development: Four UK studies evaluated licensing during development [1935]. No studies measured community or population responses [1935]. Two reviews reported behavioural/compliance outcomes: development licences for bats more than doubled over three years in Scotland, and 81% of licensees did not carry out post-development monitoring [1935]. Three studies reported roost impacts: one review found licensed development activities had a negative impact with 68% of roosts destroyed; a replicated before-and-after study found 5/28 compensation roosts were used, with two used by similar or greater numbers of bats after development; another review found 31–67% of compensation roosts provided under licence were used [1935].",
