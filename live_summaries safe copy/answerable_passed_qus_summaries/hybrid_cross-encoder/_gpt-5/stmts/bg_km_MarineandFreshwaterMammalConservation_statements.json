Two controlled studies (one replicated) reported that installing wire grids or steel bars on trap-nets or bag-nets, along with strengthened netting or other access-preventing modifications, reduced damage to salmon catches by seals (2822). One controlled study showed that securing crab pot doors with a bungee cord (one of two methods) reduced common bottlenose dolphin interactions (2822).

On vessels, bottlenose dolphins avoided boats more when devices were active; killer whales were farther from vessels during hauls with a device but distances decreased after first exposure; humpback and snubfin dolphins showed reduced surfacing, echolocation, and time spent foraging or socializing; and devices did not reduce Risso’s dolphin predation on squid catches (2815). On moorings, devices reduced numbers or activity of grey and harbour seals, harbour porpoises, and some dolphins; had no significant effect on several migration metrics of humpback whales; reduced harbour porpoise echolocation while the probability of approaching within 125 m increased over 10–11 days; and reduced seal numbers upstream of devices without reducing overall numbers (2816). At aquaculture sites, devices reduced seal/sea lion predation or approaches in some studies, while other studies found no reduction in seal predation or dolphin presence/behaviour near farms (2775). On fishing gear, devices often reduced approaches/interactions and lowered entanglements for several species, but some studies found benefits for some species or areas and not others, and others found no significant behavioural effects; devices reduced gear/catch damage in many but not all cases (2808).
