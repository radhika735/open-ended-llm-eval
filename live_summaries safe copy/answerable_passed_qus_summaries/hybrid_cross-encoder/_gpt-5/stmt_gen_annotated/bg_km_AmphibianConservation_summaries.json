Using humans to assist migrating amphibians moved large numbers across roads, but studies reported 64–70% population declines over 6–10 years and over 500 toads still killed at 7% of sites [784]. Installing barrier fencing along roads, especially with culverts, decreased road deaths in seven of eight studies; at least 0.6 m height was required to prevent some frog species climbing over, though some species still climbed fences [756]. Modifying gully pots and kerbs by moving gully pots 10 cm from the kerb reduced great crested newts falling in by 80% [782].",

Removing American bullfrogs significantly increased a population of California red‑legged frogs, eradication increased the range of leopard frogs, and red‑legged frogs were observed out in the open twice as frequently after removal (825). Predator control targeting mammals showed no significant effect on Hochstetter’s frog when rats were controlled, but survival of Maud Island frogs was significantly higher in a predator‑proof enclosure, and 58% of translocated Hamilton’s frogs survived their first year in a predator‑proof enclosure (839). Removing fish by catching increased abundance of salamanders or frogs and improved recruitment, survival and population growth rate of cascades frog in multiple studies, but had no significant effect on great crested newts in one UK case and did not increase green toad breeding success in Sweden, with fish persisting or being reintroduced (827). There is currently no direct evidence on the effects of removing or controlling non‑native crayfish on amphibians (797).

    "relevant_summary": "Evidence-based species augmentation techniques for amphibians include: translocating amphibians (eggs, juveniles or adults), which established breeding populations or substantial recruitment in 35 of 54 assessed cases globally (65%), with higher success reported when >1,000 animals were moved and no clear effect of source, life-stage, continent or reason for translocation [854]; frog translocations that established breeding at 79–100% of sites in most studies, though some efforts failed, with varied survival and notable post-release movements reported [861]; toad translocations that established breeding in some cases and, in one case alongside habitat management, increased population numbers, with reported reproduction and multi-year survival of some translocated adults or metamorphs [855]; salamander/newt translocations that established breeding populations in multiple studies, with reproduction and survival comparable to donor ponds in some cases [860]. Releasing captive-bred amphibians is another approach: one review found 41% of programmes showed breeding in the wild for multiple generations, 29% showed some breeding and 12% showed survival following release [871]; captive-bred frogs released as tadpoles, juveniles or adults established populations or stable breeding populations at 88–100% of sites in several studies (with some failures), and sometimes colonized new sites [870]; captive-bred salamanders/newts released at various life-stages established stable breeding populations in one study [874]. Head-starting (rearing eggs/larvae to later stages before release) has established breeding populations or increased populations in several cases, though results are mixed; many studies report successful metamorphosis, seasonal survival and breeding after release [881]. Captive breeding capacity exists to supply individuals for augmentation, with numerous studies reporting successful egg production and rearing of frogs and salamanders/newts in captivity, though outcomes vary by species and husbandry conditions [835, 838].",

Two studies reported low survival of released captive-bred Puerto Rican crested toads, with 25% predated within two days of release [875]. In head-start programs, two studies found that releases did not prevent a frog population decline or establish a breeding toad population; one study reported adult survival of only 1–17% over four years and another found limited breeding after adult releases; one study found young head-started leopard frogs were smaller than wild conspecifics [881].
