    "relevant_summary": "Across multiple replicated European trials, uncropped field margins sown with agricultural nectar- and pollen-rich mixes dominated by legumes supported significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated, grassy, or cropped margins, though their value declined after a few years and required re-sowing [18]. Uncropped margins sown with native wildflower seed mixes (with mowing) increased bumblebee abundance—and in several trials species richness—over cropped, grassy, or naturally regenerated margins; inclusion of perennial leguminous herbs was an important forage resource, particularly for long‑tongued species, and some long‑tongued bumblebees preferred perennial wildflower mixes over annual forage mixes [19]. Leaving margins to naturally regenerate sometimes supported more bumblebees than cropped margins, but outcomes were inconsistent between years and often depended on thistles, which may require control; in some trials naturally regenerated margins did not exceed cropped margins for bumblebee abundance or diversity [20]. Sown grassy field margins showed mixed results, with some trials finding higher bumblebee abundance (and sometimes diversity) and others finding no improvement over cropped margins [14]. At a broader scale, farms implementing agri‑environment scheme options (including field margin measures) sometimes showed enhanced foraging wild bee abundance or diversity compared to conventional management, but other trials found no enhancement, and population‑level benefits for bumblebees were not consistently detected [24]. Evidence from wider wildlife studies also indicates that leaving cultivated, uncropped margins or plots can benefit bumblebees among other taxa [562].",

In longer-term artificial rearing, B. terrestris queens decreased in weight over four years [50]. Husbandry factors influenced success: fresher, higher‑protein pollen improved reproductive output and queen quality; an 8L:16D light regime reduced time to first egg laying; hibernation at 4–5°C for ~45 days enhanced egg‑laying and colony formation but yielded smaller colonies than non‑hibernated queens; survival after hibernation was better for queens >0.6 g and with ≤4 months hibernation [50]. Field reintroductions of lab‑reared colonies showed variable queen production: some trials produced few or no new queens, while others produced good numbers [52]. Social parasitism by cuckoo bumblebees was sometimes high (25–66% and 79%), and was reduced when colonies were placed in intermediate‑resource landscapes and later in the season; other trials reported no parasitism [52]. Supplementary feeding in the field improved reproductive success in one trial but not productivity in another and did not reduce parasite load; released B. terrestris colonies foraged mostly >100 m from nests [52]. Overall, outcomes ranged from successful rearing and reproduction to larval mortality and reduced queen condition, with key challenges including diet quality, rearing regime, hibernation parameters, variable field productivity, and parasitism risk [50, 52].",

One trial found that over four years of artificial rearing, Bombus terrestris queens gradually decreased in weight.\\nThree trials have tried to rear North American bumblebees now declining or thought to be declining. Two induced spring queens of the half-black bumblebee B. vagans to rear adults in captivity, one trial induced queen yellow-banded bumblebees B. terricola (attempted in all three trials) and red-belted bumblebees B. rufocinctus (only attempted in one trial) to rear adults in captivity. All three trials tried to rear the yellow bumblebee B. fervidus and in all cases the queens laid eggs but the larvae died before becoming adults. One trial found the same pattern for the rusty-patched bumblebee and the American bumblebee B. pensylvanicus. One study reports rearing the large garden bumblebee B. ruderatus, a Biodiversity Action Plan species in the UK.\\nTwo trials have reported laboratory rearing of a pocket-making bumblebee, the Neotropical B. atratus.\\nThree replicated trials demonstrated that the pollen diet of captively reared bumblebees influences reproductive success. In one trial, buff-tailed bumblebee B. terrestris colonies fed on freshly frozen pollen produced larger queens that survived better and produced larger colonies themselves than colonies fed on dried, frozen pollen. Two replicated trials demonstrated that B. terrestris workers can produce more offspring when fed types of pollen with a higher protein content.\\nTwo replicated experiments showed that an artificial light regime of eight hours light, 16 hours darkness, can reduce the time taken for artificially reared queen B. terrestris to lay eggs, relative to rearing in constant darkness.\\nWe have captured two replicated trials examining the effect of different artificial hibernation regimes in B. terrestris. One showed that hibernation of queens at 4-5\\u00b0C for 45 days enhanced egg-laying and colony formation rates, but hibernated queens produced smaller colonies than non-hibernated queens. The second showed that queens should weigh more than 0.6 g (wet weight) and be hibernated for four months or less to have a good chance of surviving.\"\n}"

In four of the trials (three in the UK, one in Canada) colonies were left to develop until new queens were produced or the founding queen died. In two of these (both in the UK), the numbers of queens/colony were very low or zero. In two trials, good numbers of new queens were produced.\\nRates of social parasitism by cuckoo bees Bombus [Psithyrus] spp. in colonies released to the wild are variable. Two replicated trials in Canada and the UK found high rates (25-66% and 79% respectively). The UK trial showed that parasitism was reduced by placing colonies in landscapes with intermediate rather than very high nectar and pollen availability, late, rather than early in the season. Five other replicated trials reported no social parasites. We have not found evidence to compare rates of parasitism in artificial nest boxes with the rate in natural nests.\\nTwo replicated trials examined the effects of supplementary feeding for bumblebee colonies placed in the field. One, in Canada, found supplementary feeding improved the reproductive success of captive-reared colonies, but did not reduce their parasite load. The other trial, in the USA, found supplementary feeding did not increase colony productivity.\\nOne small scale trial in Norway showed that colonies of the buff-tailed bumblebee B. terrestris prefer to forage more than 100 m from their nest sites.\"\n}"

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes. In one trial, these introduced species more commonly occupied the boxes than native bees.\\nA small trial tested three soil-filled nest boxes for the mining bee Andrena flavipes in the UK, but they were not occupied.\"\n}"

However, two replicated trials in the UK found that, at a wider landscape scale, bumblebee populations were not enhanced on farmland managed under agri‑environment schemes; one compared reproductive success of Bombus terrestris colonies and the other queen numbers in spring (24). Local patch scale: Across 14 trials in Europe and North America, substantial numbers of wild bees foraged on perennial or annual sown flowering plant patches on farmland; in 10 trials (eight replicated) phacelia‑rich patches generally attracted substantial numbers of wild bees (species richness 8–35 in six trials), though one replicated trial in Greece found phacelia was not very attractive (17). A replicated controlled UK trial showed planted perennial leguminous herbs were more attractive to bumblebees in more arable landscapes (17). Four replicated trials measuring wider responses found: bigleaf lupine patches in Nova Scotia orchards significantly enhanced reproductive success of Osmia lignaria (one trial); bee numbers and species richness were not higher 50–1,500 m from planted patches in Dutch farmland (one trial); and two German trials found no or relatively few solitary bee species nesting on set‑aside fields sown with phacelia or clover (17). Field margins sown with agricultural nectar/pollen mixes consistently attracted more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated, grassy or cropped margins in replicated trials, with legume‑based mixes usually outperforming perennial wildflower mixes in the first year, though margins degraded in value and required re‑sowing every few years; no evidence was captured on solitary bees (18).",

The sixth study found that in some areas, the species richness of specialist and grassland butterflies was higher in prairies managed by two-year rotational haying, and in other areas it was higher in prairies managed by grazing, but in all cases richness was higher at sites longer after they were last managed. Two replicated, site comparison studies in Germany\\u00a0found that species-rich grasslands managed by summer-grazing, grazing\\u00a0or mowing\\u00a0had a similar species richness of butterflies and burnet moths\\u00a0and nocturnal moths\\u00a0to unmanaged grassland. However, one of these studies also found that grasslands managed by mowing had a lower species richness of nocturnal moths than unmown grassland. Two replicated, site comparison studies in Germany\\u00a0and Hungary\\u00a0found that old meadows mown in July\\u00a0and lightly grazed or annually mown meadows\\u00a0had a higher species richness of adult butterflies\\u00a0and caterpillars\\u00a0than recently established set-aside\\u00a0or cereal crops. One replicated, site comparison study in Switzerland\\u00a0found that meadows mown at least twice/year after mid-June had a similar species richness of butterflies to sown wildflower strips.\\n\\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (16 STUDIES)\\n\\nAbundance (16 studies): Five of ten site comparison studies (including nine replicated studies) in Germany, the USA, Russia and Finland, Italy, Spain\\u00a0and the Czech Republic\\u00a0found that semi-natural grasslands had a similar abundance of butterflies generally, and individual species of butterflies\\u00a0and moth caterpillars, when managed by extensive sheep, sheep and goat, cattle\\u00a0or livestock\\u00a0grazing compared to annual\\u00a0or occasional\\u00a0mowing, or rotational mowing or burning. Four of these studies found that grasslands managed by cattle, sheep\\u00a0or livestock\\u00a0grazing had a higher abundance of butterflies generally, and individual species of butterflies\\u00a0and moth caterpillars, than grasslands managed by annual mowing, rotational burning\\u00a0or unmanaged grasslands. Three of these studies found that grasslands managed by haying had a higher abundance of individual butterfly species\\u00a0than grasslands managed by grazing\\u00a0or burning\\u00a0or unmanaged grasslands. Four of these studies found that specific butterfly species\\u00a0and all butterflies\\u00a0were less abundant in mown, grazed\\u00a0or rotationally burned\\u00a0grassland than in unmanaged, rotationally burned\\u00a0or grazed and burned grassland.\\u00a0The ninth study found that in some areas, the abundance of specialist and grassland butterflies was higher in prairies managed by two-year rotational haying or by grazing, but in all cases abundance was higher at sites longer after they were last managed. One of three replicated, site comparison studies in Germany\\u00a0and Switzerland\\u00a0found that traditional hay meadows mown once/year in June or July had a higher abundance of heath fritillary adults and caterpillars than old, abandoned meadows. One study found that summer-grazed or mown grasslands had a higher abundance of farmland butterflies and burnet moths, but a lower abundance of woodland butterflies and burnet moths, than abandoned grasslands. The third study found that mown grasslands had a lower abundance of moths than unmown grasslands, but grazed grasslands had a similar abundance of moths to ungrazed grasslands. Two replicated, site comparison studies in China\\u00a0and Switzerland\\u00a0found that semi-natural grasslands managed by grazing\\u00a0or cutting twice/year after mid-June\\u00a0had a lower abundance of marsh fritillary eggs and caterpillars\\u00a0and adult butterflies\\u00a0than ungrazed margins and intercrops\\u00a0or sown wildflower strips. One replicated, site comparison study in Hungary\\u00a0found that semi-natural grasslands managed by either light grazing or mowing once/year in May or June had a higher abundance of butterflies than conventional wheat fields.\\nSurvival (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in China\\u00a0found that marsh fritillary eggs had a similar survival rate in uncultivated, grazed meadows and cultivated, ungrazed field margins and intercrops, but the survival of caterpillars was higher in the grazed meadows.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (5 STUDIES)\\nUse (5 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies in Austria\\u00a0and Germany\\u00a0found that 14 species of moth\\u00a0preferred grazed pastures while 24 others avoided them, and three species of butterfly\\u00a0and ten nocturnal moths\\u00a0preferred mown meadows, while 19 nocturnal moth species avoided them. One replicated, site comparison study in Spain\\u00a0found that meadows managed by summer-grazing or hay-mowing were more likely to be occupied by grizzled skipper and painted lady than unmanaged meadows, but small pearl-bordered fritillary occurred less frequently in grazed meadows than in hay meadows or abandoned meadows. One replicated, site comparison study in Finland and Russia\\u00a0found that three of 37 butterfly species preferred meadows which were mown annually in July or August to cattle-grazed pasture, but the other 34 species showed no preference. One replicated, site comparison study in China\\u00a0found that uncultivated, grazed meadows were less likely to be occupied by marsh fritillary eggs and caterpillars than cultivated field margins and intercrops.\"\n}"

Nest design and materials influence productivity: reed stems and wooden grooved-board designs produced more bees per nest than several alternatives, whereas plastic-lined holes and plastic or paper tubes were less productive due to parasitism or mould; for Centris analis, cardboard straws in drilled wooden holes were more productive than grooved boards [47][80]. Repeated provision over multiple years increased use, with occupied nests approximately doubling over three years at given sites, and increases in foraging Osmia or local emergence where boxes were provided [47][80]. Parasites and predators reduce productivity, with measured brood losses from parasitism and other mortality in multiple studies; introduced earwigs and non-native bees sometimes occupied boxes [47]. Excluding ants from nest sites increased offspring production in a replicated controlled trial [46]. Under management, populations nesting in drilled blocks or stacked boards can increase markedly when conditions are good and plentiful floral resources are provided, indicating resource availability strongly affects productivity [54]. Species-specific suitability of designs matters: some species or designs (e.g., soil-filled boxes for a mining bee) were not occupied [47].",

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes. In one trial, these introduced species more commonly occupied the boxes than native bees.\\nA small trial tested three soil-filled nest boxes for the mining bee Andrena flavipes in the UK, but they were not occupied.\"\n}"

Regarding planted floral resources, four replicated trials quantified wider responses: in the Netherlands, bee numbers and species richness were not higher 50–1,500 m away from planted flower patches, while in Nova Scotia orchards, patches of Lupinus polyphyllus significantly enhanced the reproductive success of Osmia lignaria [17]. A replicated controlled trial also found planted perennial leguminous herbs were more attractive to bumblebees in landscapes with a greater proportion of arable farming [17].

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes.

In four of the trials (three in the UK, one in Canada) colonies were left to develop until new queens were produced or the founding queen died. In two of these (both in the UK), the numbers of queens/colony were very low or zero. In two trials, good numbers of new queens were produced.\\nRates of social parasitism by cuckoo bees Bombus [Psithyrus] spp. in colonies released to the wild are variable. Two replicated trials in Canada and the UK found high rates (25-66% and 79% respectively). The UK trial showed that parasitism was reduced by placing colonies in landscapes with intermediate rather than very high nectar and pollen availability, late, rather than early in the season. Five other replicated trials reported no social parasites. We have not found evidence to compare rates of parasitism in artificial nest boxes with the rate in natural nests.\\nTwo replicated trials examined the effects of supplementary feeding for bumblebee colonies placed in the field. One, in Canada, found supplementary feeding improved the reproductive success of captive-reared colonies, but did not reduce their parasite load. The other trial, in the USA, found supplementary feeding did not increase colony productivity.\\nOne small scale trial in Norway showed that colonies of the buff-tailed bumblebee B. terrestris prefer to forage more than 100 m from their nest sites.\"\n}"

One trial found that over four years of artificial rearing, Bombus terrestris queens gradually decreased in weight.\\nThree trials have tried to rear North American bumblebees now declining or thought to be declining.

All three trials tried to rear the yellow bumblebee B. fervidus and in all cases the queens laid eggs but the larvae died before becoming adults. One trial found the same pattern for the rusty-patched bumblebee and the American bumblebee B. pensylvanicus. One study reports rearing the large garden bumblebee B. ruderatus, a Biodiversity Action Plan species in the UK.\\nTwo trials have reported laboratory rearing of a pocket-making bumblebee, the Neotropical B. atratus.\\nThree replicated trials demonstrated that the pollen diet of captively reared bumblebees influences reproductive success. In one trial, buff-tailed bumblebee B. terrestris colonies fed on freshly frozen pollen produced larger queens that survived better and produced larger colonies themselves than colonies fed on dried, frozen pollen. Two replicated trials demonstrated that B. terrestris workers can produce more offspring when fed types of pollen with a higher protein content.\\nTwo replicated experiments showed that an artificial light regime of eight hours light, 16 hours darkness, can reduce the time taken for artificially reared queen B. terrestris to lay eggs, relative to rearing in constant darkness.\\nWe have captured two replicated trials examining the effect of different artificial hibernation regimes in B. terrestris.
