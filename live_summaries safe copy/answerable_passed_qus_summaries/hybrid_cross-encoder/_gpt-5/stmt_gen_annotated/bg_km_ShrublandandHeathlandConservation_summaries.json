Spraying herbicide followed by sowing seeds of shrubland species increased shrub seedling numbers and increased the number of native plant species; effects on non‑native grass cover were mixed across studies [1644]. Planting individual plants did not increase native plant cover compared to seeding or a seed+planting combination in one US study, but in South Africa increased plant cover (not species richness), and one US study reported most planted individuals survived after one year [1697]. Combining sowing seeds with planting individuals did not increase native plant cover beyond either seeding or planting alone in one study [1700]. Adding topsoil alongside planting/seeding increased grass biomass but reduced forb biomass compared to adding topsoil alone [1857].",

    "relevant_summary": "Adding mulch and fertilizer did not increase seedling abundance of seven shrub species and did not change grass cover in one randomized, controlled study in the USA (ID 1694). Applying manures or agricultural composts increased microbial biomass and respiration in several controlled, replicated studies; reduced soil loss and water runoff when combined with other treatments; often reduced nutrient loss and raised nitrogen, though one study found higher nitrate leaching; increased soil carbon; had mixed effects on soil organic matter; improved soil physical properties and aggregation in one study; and increased crop yields in multiple studies (ID 911). Adding manure increased soil organic matter in several studies but showed mixed results in others; increased nitrogen and potassium in some comparisons with mixed effects on phosphorus; had mixed effects on soil pH; reduced erosion and increased soil stability in some studies; and increased carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions in individual studies (ID 1363). Mixing organic and inorganic amendments (e.g., manure with inorganic fertilizers) increased soil microbial biomass and activity, increased soil organic carbon and nutrient levels, improved dry-soil crack reduction relative to inorganic-only or no fertilizer, and increased maize yield in trials; manure alone also increased microbial biomass and organic carbon (ID 902). Green manures increased soil organic carbon and raised grain yields in controlled, randomized, replicated studies (ID 908). Incorporating fresh plant material or crop remains increased microbial biomass, improved soil structure in one study, reduced soil loss in one study with mixed erosion results elsewhere, increased soil nitrogen and sometimes reduced nitrate leaching when straw was incorporated, increased soil organic carbon and aggregation across multiple studies, and increased yields in individual trials (ID 910). Incorporating allelopathic plant residues sometimes reduced weeds but effects varied by timing, species and residue type; weed suppression often lasted only days to weeks; crop growth could be inhibited depending on timing; and yield responses ranged from positive to negative or mixed across studies (ID 728).",

Cutting reduced bracken cover/biomass in studies in Norway and the UK and increased heather cover or biomass in some trials, but other UK studies found no increase in heather cover or seedling abundance (1653). Cutting followed by herbicide reduced bracken cover/biomass and increased heather cover in Norway, but a UK study found no change in heather biomass; one UK study reported no significant effect on cover of several plant species (1654). Cutting then rotovating did not increase total plant biomass or heather biomass in a UK study (1656). Using herbicide with leaf litter removal did not increase total plant biomass after eight years, but in three of six years heather biomass was higher than with herbicide alone (1660).

Combining cutting with prescribed burning to control grass reduced common heather but did not reduce purple moor grass (1724). Prescribed burning to control trees did not change cover of two of three grass species; it reduced common heather, increased purple moor grass, and had mixed effects on tree basal area (1721). Applying herbicide to trees increased plant diversity and the abundance of common heather seedlings but did not increase shrub cover (1629).
