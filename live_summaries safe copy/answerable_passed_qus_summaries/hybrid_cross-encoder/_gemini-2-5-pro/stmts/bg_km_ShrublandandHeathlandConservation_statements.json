In the UK, two replicated, controlled, randomized studies and one controlled before-and-after trial found that fencing increased shrub cover or abundance (1545). Furthermore, two replicated, controlled, randomized studies in Germany and the UK indicated that fencing increased shrub biomass or the biomass and height of individual heather plants (1545). In Denmark and the UK, two controlled studies, one of which was a before-and-after study, revealed that heather presence or cover was higher in fenced areas (1545).\n\nHowever, not all studies have shown positive outcomes. A site comparison study in the USA found that using fences led to a decrease in the cover of woody plants (1545). Additionally, three replicated, controlled studies, one of which was a before-and-after study, in the USA and the UK, reported that fencing either had a mixed effect on shrub cover or did not alter it at all (1545).\n\nRegarding other vegetation, a randomized, replicated, controlled, paired study in the UK discovered that fencing did not change the number of plant species but did lead to an increase in vegetation height and biomass (1545). Conversely, a controlled, before-and-after study in the UK found that fenced areas had lower species richness than unfenced areas (1545). The impact on grass cover also varied, with one trial in the UK and a study in the USA showing a decline, while four controlled studies in the USA, UK, and Finland found no change (1545). In contrast, one site comparison study in the USA and one replicated, controlled study in the UK recorded an increase in grass cover (1545). For other plant types, a controlled study in Finland found no change in herb species abundance, and a site comparison in the USA showed no difference in forb cover between fenced and unfenced areas (1545). Finally, one controlled study in the USA that focused on excluding deer with fences found an increase in the height of shrubs but not in shrub cover (1662).",
