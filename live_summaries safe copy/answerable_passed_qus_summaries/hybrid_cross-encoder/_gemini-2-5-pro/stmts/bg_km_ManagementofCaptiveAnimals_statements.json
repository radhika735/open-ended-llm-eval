In one study, providing live insect prey to captive loris led to a reduction in inactivity and an increase in foraging to levels comparable to their wild counterparts (1333). For carnivores, the provision of live vertebrate prey was observed to increase hunting behavior and decrease sleeping time in a fishing cat (1925). However, in a separate study, providing live fish to tigers did not result in any change in the occurrence of stereotypical behaviors (1925). The introduction of live invertebrate prey for fennec foxes was found to increase their explorative behaviors when compared to other forms of enrichment (1926). In a study focused on preparing captive mammals for release, black-footed ferrets that were fed live prairie dogs demonstrated a longer time to dispersal but greater subsequent movements after being released (2518). Additionally, a rehabilitated Iberian lynx and orphaned cheetahs and leopards that had been provided with live natural prey in captivity were found to have survived for a minimum of three to nineteen months after their release (2518).",

One review and nine of 10 replicated studies in several countries, including Australia, found that hormone treatment of male amphibians stimulated or increased sperm production or resulted in successful breeding in captivity (883). For female amphibians, hormone treatment has had mixed results, with some studies showing that it stimulated egg production or successful breeding, while others found it did not (883). In addition to hormone treatment, environmental manipulations have also been found to be effective. The reproductive success of frogs in captivity has been found to depend on temperature or a simulated wet and dry season (835). Furthermore, providing a variety of substrates, such as rotting logs and hollow bamboo pipes, has been shown to promote egg-laying in frogs (1874). One Australian study also found success by temporarily flooding enclosures, manipulating sex ratios, and playing recorded mating calls (1874).",
