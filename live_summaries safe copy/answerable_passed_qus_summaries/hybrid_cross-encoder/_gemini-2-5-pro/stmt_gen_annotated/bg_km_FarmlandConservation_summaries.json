    "relevant_summary": "Leaving uncut strips of rye grass on silage fields in the UK has been found to benefit birds by increasing their numbers (132). While seed-eating birds were found to prefer rye grass cut only once, insect-eating birds showed more variable results, with some preferring plots cut two or more times (132). In the first two years of one study, there was no difference in ground beetle abundance and diversity between cut and uncut silage field headlands, but the uncut plots had a higher species diversity in the third year (132). There were no studies found that looked at the effects on mammals of leaving uncut areas of ryegrass in silage fields (2400).\n\nRaising the mowing height on grasslands in the UK has been found to provide benefits to Eurasian skylarks, including increased productivity (138). One review also found that raised cutting heights were less damaging to amphibians and invertebrates (138). However, another study in the UK found that raising the mowing height on grasslands had no effect on the numbers of foraging birds or invertebrates, and a separate study found no difference in invertebrate abundance (138). Foraging success of northern lapwing and common starling chicks was found to be greater in shorter grass (138). For butterflies and moths, one UK study on intensively managed grassland found that plots cut to 10 cm had a similar species richness and abundance of butterflies and caterpillars to plots cut to 5 cm (3968). A UK review noted that while raising the mowing height may have increased the productivity of Eurasian skylarks, it was not enough to maintain the local population (222).",

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes. In one trial, these introduced species more commonly occupied the boxes than native bees.\\nA small trial tested three soil-filled nest boxes for the mining bee Andrena flavipes in the UK, but they were not occupied.\"\n}"

The restoration of species-rich grassland has been shown to lead to a higher abundance of ground beetles, farmland birds, pollinating insects, and earthworms, as well as increased plant species richness when compared to other types of grassland [133]. Restored grasslands have also been found to have similar communities of flower-visiting insects to ancient species-rich grasslands [8]. On the other hand, some studies have found no discernible impact on the species richness or abundance of plants and beetles, or the abundance of butterflies and moths [133]. Additionally, a study on semi-natural grasslands restored through scrub clearance and the reintroduction of grazing or mowing revealed that the butterfly communities were different from those in existing species-rich grasslands and did not become more similar over time [3955].",

A lower number of seed-eating birds were found on fallow plots in two out of three regions in one study (562), and another study found fewer birds using plots than cropland in two out of three regions (213). For butterflies and moths, some studies found a similar species richness on farms with uncropped cultivated margins compared to conventional farms (3923), while another found a lower abundance of some butterfly species (3923). Additionally, pernicious weeds were found to be more common on uncropped cultivated margins than on other headlands (562), and a lower proportion of young grey partridges was found in areas with a high proportion of these margins (562, 213).",

Fifteen studies from Europe, including a systematic review, found that some or all species were not found at higher densities, had similar or lower population levels, showed similar population trends on sites with agri-environment schemes, compared with non-agri-environment scheme sites, or showed negative population trends. A study from the Netherlands found that many agri-environment scheme farms were sited in areas where they were unlikely to be effective.\\nOne small study from the UK found no differences between winter densities of seed-eating birds on UK Higher Levels Stewardship sites, compared with those under Entry Level Stewardship. \\nA replicated study from the UK found that grey partridge survival was higher on agri-environment scheme sites than non-scheme sites. This difference was not significant every year.\\nTwo of three studies investigating reproductive productivity, including one replicated study, found that productivity was higher on farms under agri-environment schemes. One replicated study from the UK found no effect of agri-environment schemes on productivity.\\nA review (Vickery et al. 2010) found that the amount of land entering an agri-environment scheme was on target, but that some options were not being used at high enough rates to help many species.\"\n}"
