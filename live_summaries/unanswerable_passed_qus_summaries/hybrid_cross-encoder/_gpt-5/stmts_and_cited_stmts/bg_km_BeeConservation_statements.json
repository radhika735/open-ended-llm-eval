      "relevant_summary": "Fourteen trials recorded substantial numbers of wild bees foraging on sown flowering plants on farmland; phacelia patches attracted substantial numbers of wild bees in most trials (with 8–35 foraging species recorded), though one replicated trial in Greece found phacelia not attractive; planted perennial leguminous herbs were more attractive to bumblebees in more arable landscapes; planted lupine patches in Nova Scotia apple orchards enhanced reproductive success of Osmia lignaria; one Dutch trial found no increase in bee numbers or species richness 50–1,500 m from planted patches; two German trials found few solitary bees nesting on set-aside fields sown with phacelia or clover [17]. Uncropped grassy field margins (6 m) showed mixed outcomes: one replicated controlled UK trial found higher wild bee abundance but not diversity at field boundaries, another found higher abundance and diversity of bumblebees within margins, and a third smaller trial found no increases [14]. Evidence for organic arable farming is equivocal: three replicated trials reported higher wild bee abundance (and one higher diversity in organically farmed wheat and adjacent mown fallows), while three trials found no significant differences in bee numbers, species, or visitation between organic and conventional farms [25]. Increasing clover leys has no captured evidence of enhancing wild bee populations; one replicated German trial found white clover–grass did not attract solitary bees to nest preferentially, and a Swiss trial showed avoiding a mower processor during clover flowering reduces bee injuries and mortality [16]. Introducing nest boxes stocked with solitary bees has no captured evidence for effects on farmland wildlife [81]. Rearing/managing solitary bees can increase local megachilid populations up to six-fold in one year under management when floral resources are plentiful, though parasites/pathogens are issues and artificial diet trials had mixed survival outcomes [54]. Wild bird cover mixtures often benefited invertebrates: seven UK studies reported higher abundance or species richness of butterflies and/or bees than other farmland habitats, though four studies reported mixed/negative effects and species showed plant preferences [594].",
