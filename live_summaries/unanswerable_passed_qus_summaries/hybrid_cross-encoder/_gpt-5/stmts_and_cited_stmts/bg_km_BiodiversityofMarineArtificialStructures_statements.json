Creating rock pools often supported species absent from flat surfaces and frequently increased combined macroalgae, invertebrate and/or fish richness or diversity compared to surfaces without pools, though effects varied with context (e.g., pool angle, shore level, site) [3476]. Creating hole habitats, typically alongside other features (e.g., grooves, environmentally-sensitive materials), increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate richness/diversity on structure surfaces in three studies [3467]. Using environmentally-sensitive materials showed mixed outcomes: some configurations (e.g., ECOncrete with added microhabitats) increased species richness and diversity, while others (e.g., hemp- or shell-concrete, reduced-pH concrete) did not; community composition and abundance responses varied by material and site [3469]. Reducing structure slope, implemented alongside rock pools in one study, was associated with increased combined macroalgae, invertebrate and fish species richness, while separate tests found no increases in macroalgal, oyster or mobile invertebrate abundances on surfaces [3461]. Transplanting or seeding organisms (often oysters) produced mixed effects on species richness and abundance, with some cases increasing mobile invertebrate richness and non-mobile invertebrate or oyster recruitment, and others showing no increases; survival varied by species, site and microhabitat features [3472]. Creating short flexible habitats altered community composition but decreased combined species richness during low tide in one study [3459]. Managing or restricting harvesting altered limpet size and sex ratios but did not increase limpet abundance, and legal access restrictions did not prevent harvesting [3458]. No studies directly evaluating control/removal of non-native or nuisance species on these structures were found [3439].",
