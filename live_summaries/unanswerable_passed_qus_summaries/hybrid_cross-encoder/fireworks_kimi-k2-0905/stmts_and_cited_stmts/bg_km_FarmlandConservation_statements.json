      "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence reviewed, both supplementary feeding and wild bird seed mixtures have demonstrated effectiveness in increasing farmland bird populations, but the studies do not provide direct cost-effectiveness comparisons between these two methods. \n\nSupplementary feeding (Action 648) showed positive effects in 9 out of 18 studies, including increased bird abundance, breeding population size, density, body mass, hatching and nestling growth rates, and overwinter survival. However, 5 studies found no clear effects on various bird population parameters.\n\nWild bird seed mixtures (Actions 594, 3930, 187) showed more consistently positive results, with 21 out of 30 studies finding positive effects on birds. These included higher abundance, density, species diversity and species richness compared to other farmland habitats. Multiple studies found that birds showed preference for wild bird cover and used it significantly more than other habitats.\n\nThe systematic review and multiple controlled trials consistently supported wild bird seed mixtures as beneficial for farmland birds, with some studies specifically noting increased grey partridge populations when conservation measures including cover crops were implemented. However, none of the reviewed studies provided specific cost data or economic analysis comparing the two approaches directly.",

Action document 729 reports that six studies from Canada, the UK and USA (including soybean crops) found that predators increased in adjacent crops, but effects varied with time and one study found no effect. Two studies found small or slow movements of predators from banks to crops. Four studies found more invertebrate predators on beetle banks than in surrounding crops, though effects varied with time. Action document 651 indicates that five reports from two replicated studies found positive effects on invertebrate densities/numbers and higher ground beetle density in spring and summer, but six reports from three studies found that invertebrate numbers varied between grass species sown on beetle banks, and five studies found lower or no difference in invertebrate densities compared to other habitats. Economic benefits were demonstrated if beetle banks prevented pests from reaching spray thresholds or causing 5% yield loss. Design considerations were important, with certain grass species supporting higher numbers of predatory invertebrates than others.",
