This laboratory study examined maize genetically modified to express the Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki (Btk) toxin against European corn borer. The controlled study found that pollen from this genetically modified maize did not reduce the survival or growth of eastern tiger swallowtail or spicebush swallowtail caterpillars more than pollen from non-genetically modified maize. No studies were found evaluating the community response to this pest control method.",
