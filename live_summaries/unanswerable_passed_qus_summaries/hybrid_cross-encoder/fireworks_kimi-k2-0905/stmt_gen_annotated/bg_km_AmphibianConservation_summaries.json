Creating new ponds (Action 869) has proven highly successful, with studies showing that amphibians naturally colonized 64-100% of created ponds and reproduced in 64-68% of them, with some ponds supporting up to 15 species naturally. Pond restoration (Action 878) was also effective, increasing amphibian species numbers, maintaining or increasing populations, and achieving breeding success in 35-65% of restored ponds. Engaging landowners and volunteers to manage land for amphibians (Action 777) represents a particularly cost-effective approach, with studies showing that between 8 and 41,000 volunteers participated in habitat restoration programs that restored up to 1,023 ponds or over 11,500 kmÂ² of habitat. Payment schemes for farmers (Action 818) to cover conservation costs have also proven effective in creating breeding habitat and increasing amphibian populations. Simple management actions like deepening, de-silting or re-profiling existing ponds (Action 817) resulted in breeding population establishment for various species including great crested newts and tree frogs.",

Thirty-four studies (of which 21 were replicated and controlled and seven also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found some positive effects on earthworms, some invertebrates (other than earthworms), weeds or farmland birds, of reducing tillage compared to conventional management. Positive effects included increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms, greater abundance of some invertebrates other than earthworms, increased numbers of some weeds and/or weed species, higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying date and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields, and greater abundance of some birds - including Eurasian skylark, seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in late winter on non-inversion or conservation tillage. A review found tillage had negative effects on invertebrate numbers and no-till systems had more invertebrate bird food resources.\\nTwenty-six studies (of which 13 replicated and controlled and three also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found reducing tillage had either negative, no effect or no consistent effects on abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates (other than earthworms), earthworm abundance, biomass, or species richness, number of different plant species found as seeds, number of some weed species, mammal abundance, some bird species, and one study found bird preferences for conservation tillage fields decreased over time.
