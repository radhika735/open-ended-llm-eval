Creating new ponds (Action 869) has proven highly successful, with studies showing that amphibians naturally colonized 64-100% of created ponds and reproduced in 64-68% of them, with some ponds supporting up to 15 species naturally. Pond restoration (Action 878) was also effective, increasing amphibian species numbers, maintaining or increasing populations, and achieving breeding success in 35-65% of restored ponds. Engaging landowners and volunteers to manage land for amphibians (Action 777) represents a particularly cost-effective approach, with studies showing that between 8 and 41,000 volunteers participated in habitat restoration programs that restored up to 1,023 ponds or over 11,500 kmÂ² of habitat. Payment schemes for farmers (Action 818) to cover conservation costs have also proven effective in creating breeding habitat and increasing amphibian populations. Simple management actions like deepening, de-silting or re-profiling existing ponds (Action 817) resulted in breeding population establishment for various species including great crested newts and tree frogs.",
