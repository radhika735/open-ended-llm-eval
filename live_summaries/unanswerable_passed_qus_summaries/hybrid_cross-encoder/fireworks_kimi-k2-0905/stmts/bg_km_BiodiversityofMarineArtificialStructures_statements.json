Sixteen studies found that this technique increased species richness and diversity, supported species absent from smooth surfaces, and altered community composition. While some studies showed mixed results depending on factors like depth, shore level, and site conditions, the majority found positive effects on biodiversity. Another cost-effective option is creating small protrusions alone (1-50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures (Action ID: 3462), which studies in Singapore found increased species richness. Reducing the slope of intertidal artificial structures (Action ID: 3461) was also examined, with one study finding increased species richness when combined with rock pools, though individual species abundances were not consistently enhanced. These surface modification techniques are likely more cost-effective than complex engineering solutions as they involve relatively simple alterations during construction or retrofitting of existing structures.",
