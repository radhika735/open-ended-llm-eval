    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence, several cost-effective dietary enrichment methods for captive primates have been studied. Scattering food throughout the enclosure increased feeding and exploratory behaviors in rhesus macaques, reduced abnormal behaviors in chimpanzees and aggression in lemurs, increased foraging and activity levels in gorillas (Action 1315). Presenting food items whole instead of processed increased the amount consumed and time spent feeding in macaques (Action 1323). Using puzzle feeders increased time spent feeding and decreased inactive time, while also increasing foraging behavior and tool use, though it also increased aggression (Action 1318). Hiding food in containers such as boxes, baskets or tubes with added browse increased activity levels and foraging behaviors in lemurs and gibbons (Action 1316). Providing cut branches for browse allowed captive gorillas to use the same processing skills as wild gorillas when foraging on stinging nettles (Action 1332). Feeding individuals in social groups resulted in enrichment tasks being completed in less time compared to feeding alone, and monkeys ate more unfamiliar foods during first encounters when groupmates were present (Action 1343). Providing live vegetation in planters increased foraging time in chimpanzees compared to browse and grass simply added to the enclosure (Action 1327).",
