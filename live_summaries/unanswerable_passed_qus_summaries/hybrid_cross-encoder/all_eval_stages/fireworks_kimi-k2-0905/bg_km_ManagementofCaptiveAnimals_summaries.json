    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence found, several cost-effective dietary enrichment methods for captive primates have been studied. Providing cut branches (browse) to captive gorillas was found to elicit the same processing skills used by wild gorillas for foraging, suggesting this is an effective natural enrichment method. Hide food in containers (including boxes and bags) was found to increase activity levels and foraging behaviours in lemurs and gibbons when browse was added to the food containers. Presenting food items whole instead of processed led to increased consumption and time spent feeding in macaques, which requires minimal additional cost while maximizing feeding duration. Feeding individuals in social groups rather than alone was found to make enrichment tasks take less time to complete, and monkeys ate more unfamiliar foods when with their groupmates. Presenting food in puzzle feeders increased time spent feeding and reduced inactive time, though it also increased aggression between individuals. Providing live vegetation in planters for foraging led to increased foraging time compared to normal browse feeding methods.",
