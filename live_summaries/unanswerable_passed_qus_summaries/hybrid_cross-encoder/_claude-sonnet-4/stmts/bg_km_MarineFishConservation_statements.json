For minimum landing sizes, one global review found that only one of five swordfish fisheries showed an increase in recruitment after setting recommended minimum landing sizes and catch limits, with recruitment in other fisheries either highly variable or unable to be assessed (Action 2735). Additionally, one replicated study in the Ionian Sea found that despite established minimum sizes, most fish landed in commercial catches were immature and had never spawned (Action 2735). This suggests that minimum landing sizes may have limited effectiveness in improving reproductive success. In contrast, no studies were found that evaluated the effects of setting a maximum landing size for commercially fished species on marine fish populations (Action 2736). Similarly, no studies were found that evaluated the effects of specifying a size range of capture for commercially fished species (Action 2737).
