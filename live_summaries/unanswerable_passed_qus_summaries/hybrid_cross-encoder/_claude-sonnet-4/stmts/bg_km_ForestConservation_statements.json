A before-and-after study in the USA found that following wolf reintroduction, adult elk numbers approximately halved and elk calf:cow ratios approximately halved (Action 2431). This reduction in herbivore pressure can indirectly benefit tree regeneration.\n\nThe relationship between herbivore control and forest vegetation is supported by evidence from livestock grazing studies. A replicated study in the UK found that reducing grazing intensity increased the number of tree saplings (Action 1207). A site comparison study in Israel found that preventing cattle grazing increased the density of oak seedlings and saplings (Action 1206). Studies examining the exclusion of vertebrate herbivores found that forest plots fenced to exclude or reduce the density of deer and elk had effects on vegetation, with some studies showing mixed effects depending on fire intensity and year (Action 3891).\n\nAdditionally, four of five studies in Australia, Canada, Finland and the USA found that using fences to exclude grazing increased the survival, size and cover of planted trees (Action 1254), demonstrating the negative impact of herbivore browsing on tree establishment and growth.\n\nHowever, the action documents note that no studies were found that specifically evaluated the effects of reintroducing overharvested animals on vegetation (Action 3018), indicating a research gap in directly measuring the effects of predator reintroduction on forest regeneration.",

For prescribed fire specifically targeting invasive species removal, no evidence was found for its effectiveness (Action 1196). However, for mechanical/manual removal of invasive plants, one study in Hawaii found that removal of invasive grass species increased understory plant biomass, while another study in the USA found no effect of invasive shrub removal on understory plant diversity (Action 1228). A study in Ghana found that removal of invasive weed species increased tree seedling height, but a Hawaiian study found no effect of invasive plant removal on growth rate of native species (Action 1228). General prescribed fire studies show mixed results on understory vegetation: eight of 22 studies found prescribed fire increased cover, density and biomass of understory plants, while six found it decreased plant cover, and eight found no effect or mixed effects (Action 1221). For invasive plant control broadly, studies show mixed effectiveness depending on the specific method and target species (Action 3697, Action 823).",
