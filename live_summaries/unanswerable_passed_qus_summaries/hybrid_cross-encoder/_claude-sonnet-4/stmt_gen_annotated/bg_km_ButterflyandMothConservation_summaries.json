    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from multiple studies, several conservation actions show effectiveness for increasing butterfly populations on farmland. Paying farmers to cover costs of conservation measures through agri-environment schemes shows consistent benefits, with 17 of 19 studies finding higher butterfly abundance and 12 of 15 studies finding greater species richness on farmland managed under these schemes compared to conventional fields (Action 3915). Leaving headlands in fields unsprayed is supported by 4 of 5 studies showing greater butterfly abundance and 2 studies showing greater species richness in unsprayed versus sprayed headlands (Action 3898). Planting grass buffer strips around fields shows positive effects, with 3 of 4 controlled studies finding higher butterfly abundance in grass margins compared to cropped field edges, and wider margins (up to 6m) showing greater species richness (Action 3982). Planting nectar flower mixture/wildflower strips demonstrates benefits with 8 of 13 studies finding higher species richness and 10 studies finding higher butterfly abundance compared to conventional margins or cropped fields (Action 3932). Converting to organic farming shows benefits in 7 of 11 studies for both species richness and abundance, though effectiveness may vary with landscape context and time since conversion (Action 3907). Creating uncultivated margins shows mixed results, with some studies finding lower effectiveness compared to sown wildflower margins (Action 3981). The evidence suggests that agri-environment schemes that pay farmers for conservation measures may be among the most cost-effective approaches as they can incorporate multiple beneficial practices simultaneously.",

A controlled, replicated field study in China found that a flea beetle caused heavy feeding destruction when added to field cages containing prostrate water primrose seedlings and was specific to the prostrate water primrose and Indian toothcup (Action 1135). A replicated, before-and-after field study in the USA found that introduction of flea beetles to a pond significantly reduced the abundance of large-flower primrose-willow (Action 1135). One field study in South Africa reported reduced growth of parrot's feather following the release of a South American leaf-feeding Lysathia (Action 1599). However, no evidence was found for biological control using herbivores for several invasive species including Crassula helmsii (Action 1277), native herbivores for water primrose control (Action 1136), native herbivores for floating pennywort control (Action 1124), and co-evolved herbivores for skunk cabbage control (Action 1098). In contrast, general removal or control of non-native or problematic plants has shown positive effects for butterflies, with nine studies showing that sites where invasive plants were removed had greater species richness and abundance of butterflies compared to untreated sites (Action 3890).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents examined, no specific action is explicitly identified as the most cost-effective for butterfly and moth conservation. However, several actions show evidence of effectiveness with varying resource implications:\n\nPaying farmers to cover conservation costs through agri-environment schemes (Action 3915) has the most substantial evidence base with 32 studies evaluating its effects. Seventeen of 19 studies found higher abundance of butterflies and moths on farms managed under agri-environment schemes compared to conventional farms, and twelve of 15 studies found higher species richness or diversity. This action involves direct financial costs but demonstrates consistent positive outcomes.\n\nReducing fertilizer, pesticide or herbicide use generally (Action 3897) showed effectiveness in 11 studies, with eight studies finding greater species richness in areas with reduced chemical inputs compared to conventional applications. Six studies found higher abundance of butterflies and moths with reduced chemical use. This action may offer cost savings through reduced input purchases while providing conservation benefits.\n\nProviding training for land managers, farmers and farm advisers (Action 3846) showed promising results in one UK study where 82% of landowners receiving advice submitted agri-environment scheme applications with 90% success rate, resulting in management of over 3,000 hectares for marsh fritillary conservation.\n\nSeveral other actions had limited evidence, with studies finding no evaluations for increasing consideration in conservation plans (Action 3848) or legal protection (Action 3863). Habitat management actions like managing woodland edges (Action 3942) and restoring grassland (Action 3955) showed positive effects but with limited study numbers to assess cost-effectiveness.",

This action specifically shows benefits for monarch butterflies through studies demonstrating that when taller native milkweed species were planted, they had a higher abundance of monarch butterfly eggs and caterpillars than shorter milkweed species. Additionally, monarch butterfly adults used common milkweed planted in gardens more than milkweed planted in meadows, and the survival of monarch butterfly caterpillars was similar on common milkweed planted in gardens and meadows. The growth of monarch butterfly caterpillars was also similar on eight different native milkweed species (Action 3842). Other relevant actions include replanting native vegetation, which showed that common milkweed planted in meadows supported monarch butterfly eggs and had similar survival rates for monarch butterfly eggs and caterpillars in meadows or private gardens (Action 3933). Captive rearing has also been successful for monarch butterflies, with one study reporting that monarch butterfly populations were successfully reared in captivity for multiple generations, and monarch caterpillars showed different survival rates when reared on different species of milkweed (Action 3916).",
