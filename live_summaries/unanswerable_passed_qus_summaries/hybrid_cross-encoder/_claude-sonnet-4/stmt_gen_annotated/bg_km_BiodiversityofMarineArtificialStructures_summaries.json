    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence, creating pit habitats (1-50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures appears to be the most well-studied and effective method for enhancing biodiversity. Twenty-two studies examined this intervention, showing that creating pit habitats increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness and/or diversity on structure surfaces in eight of 12 studies (Action ID 3475). The pit habitats supported macroalgae, invertebrate and fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without added habitats. Creating small protrusions (1-50 mm) also showed promise, with two studies in Singapore finding increased species richness when combined with grooves, small ridges and pits (Action ID 3462). Creating large ridges or ledges (>50 mm) demonstrated effectiveness in three studies, with one study reporting increased species diversity when combined with grooves and small protrusions (Action ID 3465). Reducing the slope of intertidal artificial structures showed mixed results, with one study finding increased combined macroalgae, invertebrate and fish species richness when combined with creating rock pools (Action ID 3461). Using environmentally-sensitive materials had varied effects across eight studies, with some materials like ECOncreteâ„¢ showing benefits when combined with creating grooves, small ledges and holes, while other materials showed mixed or no effects (Action ID 3469). Creating flexible habitats showed limited effectiveness, with short flexible habitats (1-50 mm) decreasing species richness in one study (Action ID 3459), though long flexible habitats (>50 mm) did alter community composition in one study (Action ID 3460).",

Fourteen studies examined this approach (action 3470). Six of 11 studies found that using shell-concrete or quarried rock in place of standard-concrete on subtidal artificial structures, or using ECOncreteâ„¢ in place of standard-concrete or fibreglass, along with creating texture, grooves, holes, pits and/or small ledges, altered the combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition on structure surfaces. Three studies found that ECOncreteâ„¢ surfaces with added habitats supported mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate and/or fish species that were absent from standard-concrete or fibreglass structure surfaces. Three studies found that using ECOncreteâ„¢, along with creating texture, grooves, holes, pits and/or small ledges, did increase the species diversity and/or richness on and around structures. Additionally, managing or restricting harvesting showed some benefits with one study finding higher fish species richness around a subtidal artificial structure with harvesting restrictions compared with unrestricted structures (action 3457). Creating short flexible habitats (1â€“50 mm) had mixed effects on invertebrate communities depending on density, length and site (action 3450). Several other potential methods showed no evidence or mixed results, including reducing slopes (action 3442), creating large protrusions (action 3443), and creating natural rocky reef topography (action 3446).",

For hole habitats (>50 mm), studies in Australia, the UK, Israel and the Netherlands found that holes, when combined with other features like grooves and small ridges, altered macroalgae and invertebrate community composition, supported species absent from surfaces without habitat features, and increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species diversity and richness on structure surfaces, though effects on individual invertebrate abundance were mixed (Action 3467). For groove habitats (1-50 mm), studies across multiple locations found mixed results: some studies showed that grooves supported macroalgae, mobile and non-mobile invertebrate species absent from surfaces without grooves, and in some cases increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness and diversity, though effects varied by site and groove configuration (Action 3473).",

Action 3476 describes the creation of rock pools on intertidal artificial structures and notes that eighteen studies examined the effects of creating rock pools, but these studies focused primarily on biodiversity outcomes rather than structural integrity impacts. The document indicates that rock pools created on intertidal artificial structures supported various species including macroalgae, mobile invertebrates, non-mobile invertebrates, and fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without pools. One study mentioned that wave-sheltered pools filled with sediment within two years (Action 3476). Action 3469 discusses the use of environmentally-sensitive materials on intertidal artificial structures, including various concrete compositions and alternative materials like sandstone and limestone, but does not specifically address structural integrity concerns related to habitat modifications. The documents do not contain specific information about how the creation of rock pools affects material durability, erosion rates, structural stability, or other engineering performance parameters of seawalls over time.",
