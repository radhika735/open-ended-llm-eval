Sowing uncropped arable field margins with native wild flower seed mixes supports higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees compared to cropped field edges, grassy margins, or naturally regenerated uncropped margins (Action 19). Perennial leguminous herbs in seed mixtures are particularly important forage sources for bumblebees, especially long-tongued species (Action 19). Agricultural nectar and pollen mixes sown on field margins also attract significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated, grassy, or cropped field margins (Action 18). However, margins sown with agricultural legume plants degrade in value to bumblebees and would need re-sowing every few years (Action 18). Leaving arable field margins uncropped with natural regeneration provides benefits, though the value is not consistent year to year and is often based on thistle species considered weeds (Action 20). Planting dedicated floral resources on farmland, particularly phacelia, supports substantial numbers of wild bees with 8 to 35 species recorded foraging (Action 17). Reducing the intensity of farmland meadow management through delayed first cuts and reduced agrochemical use enhances numbers and diversity of wild bees (Action 22). At a landscape scale, the abundance of long-tongued bumblebees on field margins is positively correlated with the number of pollen and nectar agri-environment agreements in the area (Action 362).",

However, studies on reintroducing laboratory-reared bumblebee colonies provide relevant context. Seven replicated trials monitored the success of laboratory-reared colonies introduced to the environment, with four trials allowing colonies to develop until new queens were produced or the founding queen died. In two of these trials (both in the UK), the numbers of queens per colony were very low or zero, while two trials produced good numbers of new queens (Action 52). High rates of social parasitism by cuckoo bees were observed in released colonies, with rates of 25-66% in Canada and 79% in the UK, though parasitism was reduced by placing colonies in landscapes with intermediate nectar and pollen availability and releasing them late in the season rather than early (Action 52). For captive rearing programs, studies show that declining North American species like B. vagans and B. terricola can successfully rear adults in captivity, though B. fervidus queens consistently laid eggs but larvae died before becoming adults across all trials (Action 50).",

      "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from multiple trials, planting dedicated floral resources on farmland appears to be one of the most effective methods for supporting wild bee populations. Fourteen trials in Europe and North America have recorded substantial numbers of wild bees foraging on perennial or annual sown flowering plants in agricultural environments (Action ID: 17). Ten trials monitoring phacelia patches found substantial numbers of foraging wild bees, particularly bumblebees, with foraging bee species ranging from eight to 35 (Action ID: 17). Wild bird seed or cover mixtures also show promise, with seven UK studies finding positive effects on bee abundance or species richness (Action ID: 594). Agri-environment schemes demonstrate mixed results, with four replicated trials in Europe showing enhanced diversity and/or abundance of foraging wild bees under various schemes including Swiss Ecological Compensation Areas and German organic farming options (Action ID: 24). Reducing intensity of farmland meadow management shows some benefit, with two replicated trials finding enhanced numbers and diversity of wild bees on meadows with delayed first cut and little agrochemical use (Action ID: 22). Converting to organic farming produces equivocal results, with three replicated trials showing higher abundance of wild bees under organic arable farming compared to conventional farming (Action ID: 25). Grass strips at field margins have mixed evidence, with three UK trials showing some enhancement of bee abundance but inconsistent effects on diversity (Action ID: 14). There is no evidence captured for increasing clover leys enhancing wild bee populations (Action ID: 16) or for introducing nest boxes stocked with solitary bees (Action ID: 81).",

Action 442 (\"Plant nectar flower mixture/wildflower strips\") found that 80 individual studies investigated the effects of flowering strips on biodiversity, with 64 studies showing some benefits to one or more wildlife groups. Specifically, 65 studies reported effects on invertebrates, with 50 reporting positive effects and 41 studies finding evidence that flower strips had a positive influence on invertebrate numbers with increased abundance, species richness/diversity, or both.\n\nAction 3932 (\"Plant nectar flower mixture/wildflower strips\") found that 23 studies evaluated the effects of planting nectar flower mixtures on butterflies and moths, with multiple studies finding that sown wildflower strips had higher species richness and diversity of butterflies and moths than conventional field margins, unsown margins, cropped fields or conventional grassland.",
