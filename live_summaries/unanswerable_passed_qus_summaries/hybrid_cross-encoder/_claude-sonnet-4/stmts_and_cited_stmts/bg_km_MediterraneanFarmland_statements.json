      "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence from Mediterranean studies, both cover crops and compost addition improve soil fertility, but the research does not provide direct cost comparisons between these methods.\n\nCover crops in Mediterranean arable fields show several soil fertility benefits: One meta-analysis of studies from Mediterranean-type climates and ten replicated, controlled studies from Italy, Spain, and the USA found more organic matter in soils with winter cover crops (Action 1345). Ten replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Italy, Spain, and the USA found more nitrogen in soils with winter cover crops in some comparisons (Action 1345). Studies from Italy, Spain, and the USA found more microbial biomass in soils with cover crops in some or all comparisons (Action 1345). Five studies from Italy, Spain, and the USA found more nitrogen in soils that were cover cropped with legumes, compared to non-legumes (Action 1345). One study from Spain found higher soil quality in plots with long-term cover crops, compared to short-term (Action 1345).\n\nCompost addition also demonstrates soil fertility improvements: Twelve replicated, controlled studies from Italy, Spain, Syria, Turkey, and the USA found more organic matter in soils with added compost compared to soils without added compost in some or all comparisons (Action 1362). Six replicated, controlled studies from Italy, Portugal, Spain, and Syria found more nutrients in soils with added compost compared to soils without added compost in some or all comparisons (Action 1362). Six replicated, controlled studies from Italy, Spain, and the USA found more microbial biomass in soils with added compost compared to soils without added compost in some or all comparisons (Action 1362). Three replicated, controlled studies from Italy, Spain, and the USA found higher crop yields in plots with added compost compared to plots without added compost in some comparisons or all comparisons (Action 1346).\n\nFor manures and agricultural composts specifically, four controlled, replicated studies from Canada, Spain, the UK and the USA found higher crop yields when manures or compost were applied (Action 911). Three randomized, replicated studies found reduced nutrient loss and higher nitrogen levels when farmyard or poultry manure was applied (Action 911).\n\nHowever, none of the reviewed studies provide direct economic comparisons or cost-effectiveness analyses between cover crops and compost addition for Mediterranean arable fields.",
