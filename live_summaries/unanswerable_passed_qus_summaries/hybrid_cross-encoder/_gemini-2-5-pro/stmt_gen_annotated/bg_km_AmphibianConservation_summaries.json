In Germany and the UK, three before-and-after studies, two of which were replicated, found that great crested newts, whether naturally colonizing, captive-bred, or translocated, established breeding populations in 57–75% of the created ponds or sites (863). Additionally, three replicated before-and-after studies in the UK showed that up to 88% of created ponds were colonized by translocated or small numbers of naturally colonizing great crested newts (863). For head-started great crested newts, one replicated before-and-after study in the UK found that they reproduced in 38% of the created ponds (863). However, a systematic review in the UK found no conclusive evidence that mitigation efforts, which often include pond creation, lead to self-sustaining populations (863). When considering salamanders and newts more broadly, three before-and-after studies in France, Germany, and the USA, two of which were replicated, found that naturally colonizing alpine newts, captive-bred smooth newts, or translocated spotted salamanders established stable breeding populations in 20–100% of created ponds (867). In terms of specific reproductive success, two replicated, before-and-after studies in France and China found that alpine newts or Chinhai salamanders reproduced in 60–100% of created ponds (867). A small, replicated, before-and-after study in the USA found that translocated spotted salamanders reproduced in created ponds, but tiger salamanders did not (867). As a related management technique, one before-and-after study in the USA found that draining ponds to eliminate fish increased the number of amphibian species (826). Furthermore, a replicated, before-and-after study in Estonia showed that pond restoration, which sometimes included drying to eliminate fish, and pond creation led to an increase in the numbers of species and breeding populations of common spadefoot toads and great crested newts when compared to no management (826). Finally, three studies in the UK and USA, one of which was a review, found that drying ponds to eliminate fish, sometimes in conjunction with other management activities, increased the breeding success of frog or newt species (826).",
