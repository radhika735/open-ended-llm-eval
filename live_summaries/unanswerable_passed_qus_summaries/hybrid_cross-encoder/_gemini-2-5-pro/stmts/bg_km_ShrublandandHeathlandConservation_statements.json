Cutting bracken was found to increase the cover of wavy hair-grass and sheep's fescue in one UK study, but another UK study found it did not increase the abundance of gorse or common cow-wheat (1653). The effect of cutting on bracken cover or biomass was also mixed, with some studies in Norway and the UK showing a reduction, one UK study showing mixed effects, and another UK study showing no decrease in abundance (1---).",
