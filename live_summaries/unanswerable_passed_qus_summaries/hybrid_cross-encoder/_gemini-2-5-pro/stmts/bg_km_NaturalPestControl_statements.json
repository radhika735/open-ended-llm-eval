In a study from the USA and an unspecified Mediterranean country, adding compost to the soil was found to reduce crop disease in some comparisons, though another study showed no difference (1392). The same study noted fewer dead tomato plants in soil with added compost in some cases (1392). Planting flower strips was found in three US and Italian studies to increase pest reduction and the proportion of parasitized pests (1400). However, an Italian study reported more damage by caterpillars in tomatoes near flower strips (1400). Delaying herbicide use, as studied in Australia and Denmark, led to an increase in natural enemies but also more weeds (774). The effects on insect pests and crop damage were inconsistent, with one study finding lower yields while another found no effect (774). No information was found regarding the cost-effectiveness of any of these methods in arid or desert environments (775, 1392, 1400, 774). Additionally, no studies were found on the effects of managing natural water bodies to prevent desiccation on bat populations (2027) or on butterflies and moths (3858).",
