Providing cut branches (browse) such as stinging nettles led captive gorillas to use processing skills similar to those of wild gorillas when foraging [1332]. Presenting food in puzzle feeders decreased food sharing, increased foraging behaviour and tool use, increased time spent feeding, reduced inactivity, and also increased aggression in some cases [1318]. No evidence was captured on the effects of providing nectar (including artificial nectar) to primates [1331]. No evidence was captured on the effects of using automated feeders for primates [1341].",
