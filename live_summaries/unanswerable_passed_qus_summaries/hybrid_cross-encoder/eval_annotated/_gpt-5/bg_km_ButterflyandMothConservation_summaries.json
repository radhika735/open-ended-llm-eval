Paying farmers to implement conservation measures (agri-environment schemes) was associated with higher butterfly and moth abundance in most of 19 studies and higher richness in most of 15 studies across the UK, Switzerland, and Sweden, with some mixed results depending on context (3915). Increasing or maintaining the proportion of natural or semi-natural habitat in the farmed landscape was associated with higher butterfly and moth abundance in most of six replicated studies and higher richness in most of 11 studies across Europe and elsewhere (3910). Planting grass buffer strips or margins, especially when wider or floristically enhanced, often increased butterfly abundance in multiple replicated studies and increased species richness in several studies, though some results were context-dependent (3982). Converting to organic farming was associated with higher butterfly and moth abundance and richness in several replicated, site-comparison studies, though effects varied with landscape context and time since conversion (3907).",
