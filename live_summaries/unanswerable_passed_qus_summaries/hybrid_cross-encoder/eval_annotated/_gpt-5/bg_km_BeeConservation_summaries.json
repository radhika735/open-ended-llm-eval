Uncropped grassy field margins (6 m) showed mixed outcomes: one replicated controlled UK trial found higher wild bee abundance but not diversity at field boundaries, another found higher abundance and diversity of bumblebees within margins, and a third smaller trial found no increases [14]. Evidence for organic arable farming is equivocal: three replicated trials reported higher wild bee abundance (and one higher diversity in organically farmed wheat and adjacent mown fallows), while three trials found no significant differences in bee numbers, species, or visitation between organic and conventional farms [25]. Increasing clover leys has no captured evidence of enhancing wild bee populations; one replicated German trial found white clover–grass did not attract solitary bees to nest preferentially, and a Swiss trial showed avoiding a mower processor during clover flowering reduces bee injuries and mortality [16]. Introducing nest boxes stocked with solitary bees has no captured evidence for effects on farmland wildlife [81]. Rearing/managing solitary bees can increase local megachilid populations up to six-fold in one year under management when floral resources are plentiful, though parasites/pathogens are issues and artificial diet trials had mixed survival outcomes [54]. Wild bird cover mixtures often benefited invertebrates: seven UK studies reported higher abundance or species richness of butterflies and/or bees than other farmland habitats, though four studies reported mixed/negative effects and species showed plant preferences [594].",

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes.

One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the UK\\u00a0found that the species richness of butterflies and moths was similar on farms managed under agri-environment schemes, including with sown wildflower strips, and on conventionally managed farms.
