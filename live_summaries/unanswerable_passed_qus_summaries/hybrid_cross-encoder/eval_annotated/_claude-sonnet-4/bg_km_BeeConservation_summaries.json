    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from farmland bee conservation studies, several cost-effective methods for creating bee-friendly habitats on farmland have been documented. Sowing uncropped arable field margins with native wild flower seed mixes supports higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees compared to cropped field edges, grassy margins, or naturally regenerated uncropped margins (Action 19). Perennial leguminous herbs in seed mixtures are particularly important forage sources for bumblebees, especially long-tongued species (Action 19). Agricultural nectar and pollen mixes sown on field margins also attract significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated, grassy, or cropped field margins (Action 18). However, margins sown with agricultural legume plants degrade in value to bumblebees and would need re-sowing every few years (Action 18). Leaving arable field margins uncropped with natural regeneration provides benefits, though the value is not consistent year to year and is often based on thistle species considered weeds (Action 20). Planting dedicated floral resources on farmland, particularly phacelia, supports substantial numbers of wild bees with 8 to 35 species recorded foraging (Action 17). Reducing the intensity of farmland meadow management through delayed first cuts and reduced agrochemical use enhances numbers and diversity of wild bees (Action 22). At a landscape scale, the abundance of long-tongued bumblebees on field margins is positively correlated with the number of pollen and nectar agri-environment agreements in the area (Action 362).",

One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould.

High rates of social parasitism by cuckoo bees were observed in released colonies, with rates of 25-66% in Canada and 79% in the UK, though parasitism was reduced by placing colonies in landscapes with intermediate nectar and pollen availability and releasing them late in the season rather than early (Action 52).

One trial found that over four years of artificial rearing, Bombus terrestris queens gradually decreased in weight.\\nThree trials have tried to rear North American bumblebees now declining or thought to be declining. Two induced spring queens of the half-black bumblebee B. vagans to rear adults in captivity, one trial induced queen yellow-banded bumblebees B. terricola (attempted in all three trials) and red-belted bumblebees B. rufocinctus (only attempted in one trial) to rear adults in captivity. All three trials tried to rear the yellow bumblebee B. fervidus and in all cases the queens laid eggs but the larvae died before becoming adults. One trial found the same pattern for the rusty-patched bumblebee and the American bumblebee B. pensylvanicus. One study reports rearing the large garden bumblebee B. ruderatus, a Biodiversity Action Plan species in the UK.\\nTwo trials have reported laboratory rearing of a pocket-making bumblebee, the Neotropical B. atratus.\\nThree replicated trials demonstrated that the pollen diet of captively reared bumblebees influences reproductive success. In one trial, buff-tailed bumblebee B. terrestris colonies fed on freshly frozen pollen produced larger queens that survived better and produced larger colonies themselves than colonies fed on dried, frozen pollen. Two replicated trials demonstrated that B. terrestris workers can produce more offspring when fed types of pollen with a higher protein content.\\nTwo replicated experiments showed that an artificial light regime of eight hours light, 16 hours darkness, can reduce the time taken for artificially reared queen B. terrestris to lay eggs, relative to rearing in constant darkness.\\nWe have captured two replicated trials examining the effect of different artificial hibernation regimes in B. terrestris. One showed that hibernation of queens at 4-5\\u00b0C for 45 days enhanced egg-laying and colony formation rates, but hibernated queens produced smaller colonies than non-hibernated queens. The second showed that queens should weigh more than 0.6 g (wet weight) and be hibernated for four months or less to have a good chance of surviving.\"\n}"

Fourteen trials in Europe and North America have recorded substantial numbers of wild bees foraging on perennial or annual sown flowering plants in agricultural environments (Action ID: 17). Ten trials monitoring phacelia patches found substantial numbers of foraging wild bees, particularly bumblebees, with foraging bee species ranging from eight to 35 (Action ID: 17). Wild bird seed or cover mixtures also show promise, with seven UK studies finding positive effects on bee abundance or species richness (Action ID: 594). Agri-environment schemes demonstrate mixed results, with four replicated trials in Europe showing enhanced diversity and/or abundance of foraging wild bees under various schemes including Swiss Ecological Compensation Areas and German organic farming options (Action ID: 24). Reducing intensity of farmland meadow management shows some benefit, with two replicated trials finding enhanced numbers and diversity of wild bees on meadows with delayed first cut and little agrochemical use (Action ID: 22). Converting to organic farming produces equivocal results, with three replicated trials showing higher abundance of wild bees under organic arable farming compared to conventional farming (Action ID: 25). Grass strips at field margins have mixed evidence, with three UK trials showing some enhancement of bee abundance but inconsistent effects on diversity (Action ID: 14). There is no evidence captured for increasing clover leys enhancing wild bee populations (Action ID: 16) or for introducing nest boxes stocked with solitary bees (Action ID: 81).",

Similarly, action 6 (\"Increase the proportion of natural or semi-natural habitat in the farmed landscape\") found no evidence demonstrating the effects of restoring natural or semi-natural habitat on bee diversity or abundance in neighbouring farms. Action 5 (\"Protect existing natural or semi-natural habitat to prevent conversion to agriculture\") also captured no evidence for the effects of protecting areas of natural or semi-natural habitat on bee populations or communities.\n\nHowever, there is substantial evidence for the effectiveness of creating new flowering habitat. Action 19 (\"Sow uncropped arable field margins with a native wild flower seed mix\") found that five replicated trials in the UK showed that uncropped field margins sown with wild flowers support a higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees than cropped field edges, grassy margins or naturally regenerated uncropped margins. Action 442 (\"Plant nectar flower mixture/wildflower strips\") found that 80 individual studies investigated the effects of flowering strips on biodiversity, with 64 studies showing some benefits to one or more wildlife groups.

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes.
