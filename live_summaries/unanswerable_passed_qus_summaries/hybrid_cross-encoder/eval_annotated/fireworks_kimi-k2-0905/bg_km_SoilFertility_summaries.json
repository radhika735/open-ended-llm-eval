The documents primarily focus on the agronomic and environmental benefits of crop rotation rather than social barriers to adoption. Studies from Canada (action IDs 719, 857, 1368, 1354, 1383) demonstrate that crop rotation can provide benefits including increased crop yields in some years, higher crop quality (more protein in wheat), reduced pest populations, improved soil organic matter and carbon, enhanced microbial diversity, and increased profit. However, these studies do not address the social, cultural, or knowledge-related barriers that may prevent adoption. While some documents mention education programs and knowledge exchange in other agricultural contexts, none specifically examine the social factors limiting Canadian farmers' adoption of crop rotation practices.",
