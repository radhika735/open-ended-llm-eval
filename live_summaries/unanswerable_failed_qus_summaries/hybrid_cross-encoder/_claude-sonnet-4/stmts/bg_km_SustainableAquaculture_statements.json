Action 738 found that corkwing and goldskinny cleaner wrasse were as effective at controlling lice infestation as chemical treatments, though rockcook cleaner wrasse were ineffective at preventing lice outbreaks. Action 741 reported that salmon kept in low intensity artificial light or natural lighting had lower numbers of lice compared to those under more intense artificial light. Action 1026 recorded lower lice numbers on Atlantic salmon in cages using a fallowing system. However, the studies did not directly compare the cost-effectiveness of these different methods, and no specific economic analysis or cost data was provided in the action documents to determine which method is most cost-effective.",
