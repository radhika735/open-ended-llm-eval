Additionally, no evidence was found for the effects of adding gum solutions to drilled hollow feeders for primates (Action 1326) or for providing gum (including artificial gum) to primates (Action 1330). According to the action documents, 'no evidence' means no studies have been found that directly and quantitatively tested these actions during systematic journal and report searches, therefore it has been unable to assess whether or not these actions are effective or have any harmful impacts.",
