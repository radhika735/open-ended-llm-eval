      "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents reviewed, there is limited evidence specifically about cost-effective methods for reducing human-primate conflict in agricultural areas. Many primate-specific deterrent strategies including unpalatable buffer crops (action 1438), mechanical barriers like fences and ditches (action 1436), paying farmers to cover costs of non-harmful deterrent strategies (action 1429), planting crops favoured by primates away from primate areas (action 1440), and compensating farmers for produce loss (action 1428) have no evidence from systematic studies evaluating their effectiveness. However, some general mammal deterrent methods that could apply to primates show evidence: using chili-based deterrents showed mixed results, with five of seven studies finding that chili-spray, chili smoke, chili fences and chili extract repelled elephants at least initially, while two studies found chili smoke and chili fences did not reduce crop raiding (action 2492). Using loud noises showed variable effectiveness, with five of six studies finding that loud noises activated when animals were in vicinity reduced crop damage by deer and elephants, while regularly sounding loud noises did not repel rabbits or deer (action 2460). Fire deterrents showed some effectiveness, with studies finding fire reduced crop damage by elephants and that large fires combined with people and drums repelled elephants faster than other combinations (action 2499). Drones showed promise with one study finding they repelled elephants from crops within one minute (action 2481).",

      "relevant_summary": "Based on studies across different continents, primate reintroduction success rates show considerable variation by region. In Africa, chimpanzee reintroduction programs demonstrated mixed results: in Guinea and the Republic of Congo, the majority of chimpanzees survived for 1-5 years (1591), while in The Gambia, a population increased by 38% over 25 years (1597) and in another case increased 25 years after reintroduction (1567). Western gorilla programs in Gabon and the Republic of Congo showed that the majority survived for at least 9 months to 4 years (1567, 1595). In Asia, Indonesian studies found that all Sumatran orangutans survived for at least 3 months (1567, 1590), while Malaysian orangutan populations showed 98% survival after release in one study (1589) but a population decline of 33% over 33 years in another (1591, 1597). In South America, Brazilian studies showed mixed outcomes: golden lion tamarin programs reported that most reintroduced individuals did not survive over 7 years (1594, 1597), while other studies found populations declined after reintroduction (1567, 1589). In Madagascar, studies found that primate populations persisted 4-55 years after reintroduction (1567), though most black-and-white ruffed lemurs with limited free-ranging experience died over 5 years (1595). In Central America, Belize recorded population increases 5 years after reintroduction (1567, 1591), while Thailand showed population declines post-reintroduction (1567, 1590). African studies generally showed higher long-term survival rates for great apes, while Asian orangutan programs showed variable results, and South American programs had more mixed outcomes.",

The search revealed several related actions including removal of debris from freshwater marshes (action 3161), freshwater swamps (action 3163), and brackish/saline swamps (action 3164), but all indicate that no studies have been found that evaluated these debris removal effects on vegetation. Actions related to limiting discharge of solid waste overboard from vessels (actions 2893, 2202) also showed no studies evaluating effects on marine and freshwater mammal populations or benthic invertebrate populations. Additionally, removing and cleaning up shoreline waste disposal sites (action 2909) showed no studies evaluating effects on marine and freshwater mammal populations. While there are actions related to primate management such as installing primate-proof garbage bins (action 1505), no evidence was found for effects on primate populations. The available action documents indicate this specific intersection of plastic pollution in waterways and impacts on riverine primate populations has not been systematically studied according to the database searches.",
