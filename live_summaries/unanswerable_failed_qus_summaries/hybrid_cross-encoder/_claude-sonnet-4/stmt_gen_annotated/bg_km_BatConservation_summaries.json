    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence, the most cost-effective methods to increase bat populations in agricultural landscapes with proven effectiveness include reducing pesticide, herbicide and fertilizer use and implementing organic farming practices. Action 2013 found that farms using few or no chemicals had higher overall bat activity than those using high chemical inputs, with one study in Germany recording more bat species over grassland with moderate or no fertilizer applications than grassland with high fertilizer applications. Additionally, farms or grasslands with few or no chemical inputs had higher overall bat activity than those using high chemical inputs. Action 961 showed that organic farming can be beneficial, with four of nine studies finding higher overall bat activity, bat feeding activity, and activity of various bat species on organic farms compared to non-organic farms. Two studies found higher activity of Myotis species over water and rivers on organic farms, and one study found higher activity for two of three bat species over organic fields compared to conventionally managed fields.\n\nProviding bat boxes (Action 1024) shows promise as a cost-effective intervention, with 41 of 43 studies finding that bats used bat boxes in various habitats including farmland and pasture, and nine studies showing that bat box use increased by 2-10 times up to 10 years after installation. However, occupancy rates varied widely, with 22 studies finding less than half of boxes occupied and nine studies finding more than half occupied.\n\nAgri-environment schemes (Action 962) showed mixed results, with two of three studies in the UK finding no significant difference in bat activity between farms under agri-environment schemes and conventional farms, while one study found lower overall bat activity on scheme farms. Many other potential interventions such as planting hedges, increasing semi-natural habitat, managing ditches, retaining forest fragments, and providing set-aside areas currently lack direct scientific evidence for their effectiveness on bat populations.",

One study in the UK\\u00a0found higher occupancy rates in concrete than wooden bat boxes. One study in the USA\\u00a0found that Indiana bats used rocket boxes more than wooden bat boxes or bark-mimic roosts. One study in Spain\\u00a0found that more bats occupied bat boxes that had two compartments than one compartment in the breeding season. One study in Lithuania\\u00a0found that bat breeding colonies occupied standard and four/five chamber bat boxes and individuals occupied flat bat boxes. Four studies in the USA, UK, Spain\\u00a0and Australia\\u00a0found bats selecting four of nine, three of five, three of four and one of five bat box designs. One study in the UK\\u00a0found that different bat box designs were used by different species.

For comparison, studies of other taxa show varying success rates for captive-bred reintroductions: one review found that 41% of release programmes of captive-bred or head-started amphibians showed evidence of breeding in the wild for multiple generations (action 871), while studies of captive-bred marine mammals found limited success with only 2 of 3 Antillean manatees and 2 of 14 Florida manatees surviving for at least one year post-release (action 2933).",

Twenty of twenty-one studies (including two replicated and one before-and-after study) and a review in Nepal, France,\\u00a0Italy, Portugal,\\u00a0Ukraine, Slovakia and Poland, Canada, USA, Brazil, Uganda, South Africa, Zimbabwe\\u00a0and Botswana\\u00a0found that following translocation, populations of or individual mammals survived between two months and at least 25 years. The other two studies found that two of 10 translocated white rhinoceroses\\u00a0died within three days of release and an American marten\\u00a0population did not persist. A review in Australia\\u00a0found that over half of translocations, for which the outcome could be determined, were classified as successful. Two of three studies (one replicated) and one review in Sweden, the UK, the Netherlands\\u00a0and the USA and Mexico\\u00a0found that following release of wild-caught translocated and captive-bred animals, European otters\\u00a0and common dormice\\u00a0survived three months to seven years. The review found that most black-footed ferret\\u00a0releases were unsuccessful at maintaining a population. A replicated study in the USA\\u00a0found that following translocation of bighorn sheep, 48\\u201398% of their offspring survived into their first winter.\\nCondition (3 studies): Three studies (including one replicated, controlled study) in the USA\\u00a0and Italy\\u00a0found that following translocation, populations of elk\\u00a0had similar levels of genetic diversity to non-translocated populations, descendants of translocated swift fox\\u00a0had genetic diversity at least as high as that of the translocated animals and brown bear\\u00a0genetic diversity declined over time.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (9 STUDIES)\\n\\nUse (7 studies): A study in Italy\\u00a0found that following translocation, Alpine ibex used similar habitats to resident animals. Two of four studies (including one randomized, controlled study) in the USA, Netherlands\\u00a0and Botswana\\u00a0found that following translocation (and in one case release of some captive-bred animals), most Eurasian otters\\u00a0settled and all three female grizzly bears\\u00a0established ranges at their release site. The other two studies found that most nine-banded armadillos\\u00a0and some white rhinoceroses (when released into areas already occupied by released animals)\\u00a0dispersed from their release site. Two studies (one replicated) in Spain\\u00a0found that following translocation, Iberian ibex\\u00a0expanded their range and roe deer\\u00a0increased their distribution six-fold.\\nBehaviour change (2 studies): A replicated controlled study in Chile\\u00a0found that following translocation, long-haired field mice\\u00a0travelled two- to four-times further than non-translocated mice. A controlled study in Italy\\u00a0found that wild-caught translocated Apennine chamois\\u00a0moved further from the release site than released captive-bred animals.\"\n}"

The action documents reveal that there is a significant research gap in this area, with most bat education actions having no evaluated studies. Specifically, there are no studies that have evaluated the effects of educating the public to improve perception of bats (Action 1000), no studies evaluating public information campaigns specifically about reducing cave disturbance to bats (Action 1003), and no studies on training conservationists and land managers on bat ecology to reduce roost disturbance (Action 997). The only documented effectiveness evidence comes from Africa, specifically Ghana, where two before-and-after studies found that educational interventions about bat hunting reduced hunters' intentions to hunt bats in the future - one study focused on the ecological roles of bats (Action 1973) and another on disease risks from bat consumption (Action 1974). A review from North America (USA and Canada) suggests that education alone was not sufficient to change behavior but was necessary as a catalytic factor for economic incentives and law enforcement (Action 162).

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence, bat boxes appear to be the most studied and potentially cost-effective method for creating artificial bat roosts. According to action 1024, forty-four studies evaluated providing bat boxes for roosting bats, with forty-one of 43 studies finding that bats used bat boxes installed in various habitats including forest, woodland, farmland, urban areas, and buildings. A review of 109 studies found that 72 bat species used bat boxes, with 18 species commonly using them and 31 species using them as maternity roosts. \n\nRegarding cost-effectiveness factors, action 1024 indicates that different materials affect usage patterns: bats used black bat boxes more than grey, white or wooden boxes (studies in Germany, Portugal and Australia), bats used both resin and wood cylindrical bat boxes but resin boxes became occupied more quickly than wood boxes (USA studies), and concrete bat boxes had higher occupancy rates than wooden ones (UK study). One study found that larger bat boxes had higher occupancy rates. \n\nFor artificial tree hollows, action 2047 found that eight of 16 artificial hollows cut into trees were used by roosting long-eared bats in Australia. For artificial caves or hibernacula, action 2049 showed that these structures were used by up to four bat species, with one study finding increasing bat usage over nine years after construction.\n\nHowever, studies on managing microclimate in artificial roosts (action 2052) found mixed results with heated bat boxes, suggesting that simple, non-heated designs may be more cost-effective. The evidence indicates that while various artificial roost types can be successful, standard bat boxes appear to offer the best combination of proven effectiveness and likely cost-efficiency based on the extensive research showing their widespread use across multiple species and habitats.",

The other two studies\\u00a0found that bats used purpose-built roosts in lower numbers than the original roost.
