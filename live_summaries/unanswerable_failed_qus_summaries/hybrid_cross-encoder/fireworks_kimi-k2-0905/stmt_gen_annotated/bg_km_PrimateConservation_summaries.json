A controlled, replicated, before-and-after study in Indonesia found that using nets to keep primates out of fruit trees reduced crop-raiding by orangutans (Action 1442). Other proposed methods include installing mechanical barriers (Action 1436), using unpalatable buffer crops (Action 1438), changing to less palatable crops (Action 1439), compensating farmers for losses (Action 1428), paying farmers for deterrent costs (Action 1429), and providing sacrificial crop rows (Action 1427). However, all other interventions lack quantitative evidence for their effectiveness or cost-effectiveness, with systematic searches finding no studies that directly tested these actions.",
