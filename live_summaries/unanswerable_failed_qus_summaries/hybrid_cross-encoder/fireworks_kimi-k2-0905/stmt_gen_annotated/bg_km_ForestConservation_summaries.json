Thinning trees within forests appears to be highly effective, with 17 of 25 studies showing increased density and cover of understory plants, and 13 of 19 studies demonstrating increased species richness and diversity of understory plants (Action ID 1211). Prescribed fire also shows promise, with 8 of 22 studies indicating increased cover, density and biomass of understory plants, and 14 of 24 studies showing increased species richness and diversity of understory plants (Action ID 1221). Clearcutting has mixed results but can increase understory diversity in some cases, with 8 of 12 studies showing increased cover and species richness of understory plants (Action ID 1222). For cost-effectiveness, natural regeneration approaches may be most economical - encouraging natural regeneration in former logged forests has been shown to support butterfly and moth communities with similar or greater species richness compared to plantations (Action ID 3876). Allowing forest to regenerate naturally following logging has also demonstrated positive effects on mammal populations (Action ID 2634). While direct cost comparisons are not provided in the documents, natural regeneration methods typically require minimal intervention compared to active replanting or mechanical treatments.",
