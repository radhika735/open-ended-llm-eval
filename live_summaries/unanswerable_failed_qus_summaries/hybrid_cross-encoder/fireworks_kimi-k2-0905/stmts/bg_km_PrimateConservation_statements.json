Other proposed methods include installing mechanical barriers (Action 1436), using unpalatable buffer crops (Action 1438), changing to less palatable crops (Action 1439), compensating farmers for losses (Action 1428), paying farmers for deterrent costs (Action 1429), and providing sacrificial crop rows (Action 1427).
