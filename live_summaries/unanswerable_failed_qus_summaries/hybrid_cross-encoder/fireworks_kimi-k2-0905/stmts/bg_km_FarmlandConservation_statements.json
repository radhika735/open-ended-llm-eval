Multiple studies (23 replicated studies from Action 139) found benefits to invertebrates when fertilizer use was reduced or stopped, including increased earthworm abundance and higher invertebrate species richness. However, two UK studies found that plots without reduced fertilizer inputs had higher earthworm biomass or abundance. When comparing organic versus mineral fertilizers (Action 134), seven replicated controlled studies from Austria, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland and the UK found that organic fertilizers increased earthworm abundance, diversity, biomass and density, and increased invertebrate species richness. The application of farmyard manure specifically showed no long-term effect on invertebrates in one Irish study. In grassland management (Action 694), four studies from the Netherlands, Switzerland and UK found that stopping fertilizer inputs increased invertebrate abundance or species richness, while one UK study found lower invertebrate abundance on plots with reduced fertilizer inputs, though differences were not significant. No specific studies were found directly examining variable rate fertilizer application techniques used in precision agriculture.",

Payment schemes create financial incentives for implementing conservation measures, with 26 studies demonstrating positive effects on farmland birds across four European countries, including population increases and higher densities on AES farms compared to conventional management. Similar positive impacts were found for invertebrates, with 6 of 10 studies showing maintained or increased abundance and species richness, and for butterflies/moths, where 17 of 19 studies demonstrated higher abundance on scheme-managed land. However, effectiveness varies by scheme design and implementation, with some studies finding no effects for bats and mixed results across different species groups. Cross-compliance standards, which link subsidy payments to environmental requirements, show limited evidence of direct impact on biodiversity outcomes. The Swiss Ecological Compensation Areas scheme and other targeted programs demonstrated that scheme-specific prescriptions can be effective, particularly when tailored to local ecological conditions. Implementation challenges include scheme adoption rates, as one review found that while land entry targets were met, some conservation options were not used at sufficient rates to benefit many species.",
