Two of two before-and-after studies in the Gulf of Maine\\u00a0and Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found that after the introduction of size-sorting escape grids to trawl nets in fisheries for shrimp, the capture of non-target and unwanted fish was reduced compared to before grids were used. Eleven of 20 replicated studies (including one controlled and 19 paired and controlled) in the Tasman Sea, Coral Sea, Gulf of Carpentaria, North Sea, Indian Ocean, Bay of Biscay, Skagerrak and Kattegat, Pacific Ocean, South Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of St Vincent\\u00a0and Persian Gulf\\u00a0found that prawn/shrimp trawls with size-sorting escape grids, of various types and configurations, had lower catches of all or all but one undersized\\u00a0or otherwise unwanted fish\\u00a0and shark/ray\\u00a0species monitored, and unwanted total catch (fish and invertebrates), compared to trawl nets without escape grids. Two\\u00a0found that escape grids reduced non-target catches of most sizes of whiting and\\u00a0plaice\\u00a0and larger sizes of total fish, but increased the retention of small cod and haddock. Three\\u00a0studies found a variable effect of fitting escape grids to shrimp/prawn trawl nets on unwanted fish catch\\u00a0compared to nets with no grids, and the effect varied with year, site\\u00a0and grid type. Three\\u00a0found that grids had no effect on the reduction of unwanted fish and catches were similar for all\\u00a0or most\\u00a0of the unwanted non-commercial and commercial fish species/groups and for the total unwanted catch (fish and invertebrates). The other study\\u00a0found that fewer unwanted fish of 10 of 11 species/groups were retained in a shrimp/prawn trawl net with an escape grid used in combination with a diamond mesh codend with the mesh orientation turned by 90\\u00b0, compared to a conventional diamond mesh net with no grid.
