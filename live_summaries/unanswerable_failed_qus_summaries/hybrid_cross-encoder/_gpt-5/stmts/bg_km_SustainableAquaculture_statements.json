In Scotland, a study recorded lower lice numbers on salmon in cages using a fallowing system; an Australian study on Amoebic Gill Disease mortality found no difference with fallowing (ID: 1026). In Norway, a replicated, controlled study reported lower lice numbers on salmon kept under low-intensity artificial light or natural lighting, with higher artificial light intensity associated with higher lice numbers (ID: 741).",
