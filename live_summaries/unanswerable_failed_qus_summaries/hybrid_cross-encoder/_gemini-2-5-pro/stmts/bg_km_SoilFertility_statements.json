The soil types covered were coarse loamy and sandy loam [890]. Two other controlled, replicated trials from Spain and the United Kingdom measured the effect of adding organic processing wastes or their composts to soil [891]. One trial found that applying high rates of cotton gin compost and poultry manure improved soil structure and reduced soil loss, but increased nutrient loss [891]. The other trial found improved nutrient retention and increased barley Hordeum vulgare yield when molasses were added [891]. The soil types covered were sandy-clay, sandy loam, and silty-clay [891].",
