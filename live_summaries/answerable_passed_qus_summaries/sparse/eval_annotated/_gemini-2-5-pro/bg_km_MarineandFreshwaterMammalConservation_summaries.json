One study revealed that the use of acoustic devices did not lead to a reduction in the predation of squid catches by Risso\u2019s dolphins [2815]. In terms of behavior change, one controlled study observed that common bottlenose dolphins were more likely to avoid a boat when acoustic devices were active [2815]. Another study found that killer whales were initially recorded at a greater distance from a fishing vessel when an acoustic device was in use, but these distances diminished after the first exposure [2815]. Two before-and-after studies indicated that an acoustic device on a vessel led to reduced surfacing and echolocation rates, as well as decreased time spent foraging or socializing for Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins and Australian snubfin dolphins.
