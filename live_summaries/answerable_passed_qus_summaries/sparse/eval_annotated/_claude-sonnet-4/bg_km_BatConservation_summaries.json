For probiotic treatment, two studies evaluated treating bats with probiotic bacteria: one study in Canada found increased survival when treatment occurred at the time of infection but not when given 21 days prior, while a study in the USA found increased survival for free-flying bats but not caged bats within a mine (Action 2008). However, probiotic treatment showed variable effects on disease symptoms, with reduced symptoms when applied at infection time but worse symptoms when applied 21 days prior in the Canadian study (Action 2008). No studies were found evaluating the effectiveness of culling infected bats (Action 1012), vaccinating bats against the pathogen (Action 1011), or restricting human access to caves to reduce pathogen spread (Action 1010). While cave management strategies exist, such as installing cave gates and imposing restrictions on cave visits, these have been studied for general bat conservation but not specifically for white-nose syndrome prevention (Actions 999, 1002).",

    "relevant_summary": "Several types of crossing structures can be installed to help bats cross roads and railways safely:\n\nGreen bridges are effective crossing structures, with one UK study finding that a green bridge was used by 97% of bats crossing a road (979).\n\nUnderpasses and culverts are widely used crossing structures, with eight studies across Germany, Ireland, the UK, Australia and France finding that bats used underpasses and culverts below roads in varying proportions (976). Research in Australia found that bat species adapted to cluttered habitats used small culverts and underpasses more than bat species adapted to open or edge habitats (976). A French study found that the use of underpasses by five bat species was influenced by underpass type and height, road width, and the amount of forest and hedgerows in the surrounding landscape (976).\n\nOverpasses can serve as crossing structures, with studies in Ireland and France finding that two or three bat species/species groups used overpasses, though up to three-quarters of bats crossed the road below at traffic height or crossed at other nearby locations (977). A UK study found that an overpass with planters was used by two-thirds of crossing bats, while an unvegetated overpass with a paved road over it was not used by crossing bats (977).\n\nBat gantries or bat bridges have shown mixed results, with UK studies finding that fewer bats used bat gantries than crossed the road below at traffic height, and one bat gantry was not used at all (978). A French study found that a temporary bat gantry was used by three bat species/species groups, but almost half of crossing bats flew over the road at other locations (978).\n\nDiversion structures using plantings or fencing can guide bats to safe crossing points, with a Swiss study finding that up to one fifth of lesser horseshoe bats within a colony flew along an artificial hedgerow to commute (981).",

Eleven studies evaluated cave gates, showing mixed results: three of four before-and-after studies found more or similar numbers of bats in caves after gates were installed, while one study found fewer bats (Action 999). Cave gates can impact bat behavior, as one study found that bats at cave entrances circled more and entered caves less after gates were installed (Action 999). Gate design matters, with bats flying through gates with funnel design more frequently than gates with round bar or angle iron design (Action 999). For mines specifically, nine studies found that gates generally resulted in fewer bats entering mines, with bats showing increased circling behavior and reduced entry after gate installation (Action 1963). In contrast, only two studies evaluated fencing around cave entrances, with limited evidence showing no difference in population growth rates between caves with and without fencing (Action 1991). Critically, one controlled study directly compared the two methods and found that significantly more bats emerged from a cave after a steel gate was replaced with a fence, suggesting fences may be less restrictive to bat movement than gates (Actions 999, 1991). However, one study also found that significantly fewer bats emerged from a cave with a gate compared to a cave with a fence (Action 999).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, several non-lethal alternatives to culling can be used to manage human-bat conflicts. For preventing bats from accessing fruit in orchards, effective methods include using an organic deterrent spray, hanging plastic flags in trees, covering individual tree branches with nylon net bags, and ringing bells in lychee trees, which studies in Madagascar and Mauritius found reduced damage to lychees caused by Madagascan flying foxes or Mauritius fruit bats (action 1953). For wind turbine conflicts, ultrasonic deterrents can be used to deter bats, with studies in the USA showing mixed but generally positive results, including 21-51% fewer bat fatalities at turbines with ultrasonic deterrents fitted in one study year (action 968). When managing conflicts during development or maintenance work, alternative roost creation can be implemented, where purpose-built roosts are provided within developments, though success rates vary with some colonies using purpose-built roosts in similar or higher numbers after original roosts were destroyed (action 949). For bridge and culvert maintenance, alternative bat roosts can be provided during maintenance work, though one review found bat houses were used by fewer bats than original roosts (action 2942). The documents also identify potential approaches like replacing culling with non-lethal methods for preventing vampire bats from spreading rabies to humans and livestock, and carrying out surveillance to prevent disease spread, though no studies have yet evaluated these specific interventions (actions 1979, 1950, 2005).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence, there is very limited research specifically evaluating public education and engagement strategies for bat conservation. No studies have directly assessed the effectiveness of educating the public to improve perceptions of bats (Action 1000). However, one study in the UK found that engaging farmers and landowners to manage land for bats resulted in 77 bat-related management agreements covering approximately 6,536 hectares of land, and the overall population of greater horseshoe bats at four maternity roosts increased during the five-year engagement project (Action 1936).\n\nWhile bat-specific education research is limited, studies on education and engagement strategies for other wildlife conservation provide relevant insights. Multimedia campaigns using theatre, film, print media, and discussions have shown positive results for primate conservation, with increased populations and improved attitudes and knowledge about target species (Action 1571). Education programs and local engagement to reduce persecution or exploitation of species showed mixed results across different taxa - five out of six studies found increases in bird populations or decreases in mortality following education programs, and one study found significant shifts in local peoples' attitudes to conservation (Action 274).\n\nCommunity engagement in conservation activities has demonstrated measurable outcomes for reptile conservation, including increased abundance, improved reproductive success, and reduced killing of target species (Action 3681). Education and awareness campaigns for reptiles showed positive results including increased populations, decreased poaching, and reduced human-caused mortality, though effects on human behavior change were mixed (Action 3682). General awareness campaigns have shown variable effectiveness, with some studies finding increases in knowledge and population numbers when combined with other interventions, while others found limited behavioral change (Actions 831, 162). One review suggests that education alone is not sufficient to change behavior but is necessary as a catalytic factor for economic incentives and law enforcement (Action 162).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, several alternative lighting strategies can minimize disturbance to bats instead of avoiding illumination entirely. Low intensity lighting is effective, with studies showing that activity of lesser horseshoe bats was higher along hedges with medium or low intensity lighting than with high intensity lighting, and myotis bat activity was higher along roads with streetlights dimmed to 25% intensity compared to 50% or undimmed lights (Action 1018). Red lighting is another alternative, as studies found that red lighting resulted in higher bat activity for some species compared to white or green lighting, and more soprano pipistrelles emerged from roosts when lit with red light than with white light (Action 2021). For cave environments, using low intensity white lights or red lights resulted in fewer bat flights than full white lighting (Action 1994). Timing restrictions can also be implemented, with one study finding that turning off streetlights for part of the night resulted in mixed effects on bat activity depending on species, compared to leaving lights on all night (Action 1019). Light shielding strategies include using shielded \"full cut-off\" lights to remove outwards lighting, which reduced moth attraction when combined with filters to remove shorter wavelengths (Action 3904), and general light shielding which reduced bird groundings from artificial lights (Action 469). Additionally, warmer (red/yellow) lighting rather than other colors showed reduced attraction for moths and other insects in multiple studies, with fewer individuals and species attracted to yellow, green, white or red lights compared to UV, blue or conventional metal halide lights (Action 3906).",

Retaining access points for bats following mine closures is identified as a potential action, though no studies have evaluated its effectiveness (action 1962). Additional approaches include excluding bats from roosts prior to mine reclamation (action 1961), providing artificial subterranean bat roosts to replace roosts in reclaimed mines (action 974), reopening entrances to closed mines and making them suitable for roosting bats (action 1965), and relocating bats from reclaimed mines to alternative subterranean roost sites (action 975), though these latter actions lack scientific evaluation studies.

Installing and maintaining gates at mine entrances to restrict public access is one documented approach, with nine studies evaluating this method (action 1963). However, gate installation showed mixed results - while bats continued to use 43 of 47 mines 12 years after gates were installed, bats abandoned four mines with 'ladder' design gates, and up to 7% of bats at mine entrances collided with mine gates (action 1963). Maintaining microclimate in closed/abandoned mines is another option, with one study finding that modifying the microclimate of an abandoned mine by closing a man-made entrance resulted in a greater number of bats hibernating within the mine (action 1964).
