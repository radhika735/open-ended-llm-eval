Road closures during seasonal amphibian migration have been shown to protect large numbers of amphibians from death during breeding migrations (Action 842). Human-assisted crossings involve people helping migrating amphibians across roads, with studies showing large numbers moved ranging from 7,532 toads to half a million annually, though populations still declined 64-70% over 6-10 years despite assistance and 7% of sites still had over 500 toads killed on roads (Action 784).

Barrier fencing along roads, when combined with culverts, decreased amphibian road deaths in seven of eight studies, with barriers needing to be at least 0.6 m high to prevent climbing, though some species like treefrogs and 10% of common toads can still climb over barriers during breeding migrations (Action 756). Restoring habitat connectivity has shown success, with one study finding that raising a road on a viaduct to restore connectivity between wetlands significantly decreased deaths of migrating amphibians (Action 840). Installing barriers and crossing structures along roads/railways showed mixed results for reptiles, with some studies finding reduced road mortalities while others found no reduction or even increased percentages of mortalities (Action 3507).",

A meta-analysis of 24 studies in North America found that partial harvest, which included thinning, shelterwood harvesting, and harvesting groups of trees, resulted in smaller reductions in salamander populations than clearcutting (Action 852, 851, 844). \n\nFor thinning, studies found mixed effects on salamander abundance compared to clearcutting, with some showing higher abundance in thinned forests while others found mixed results depending on species, life stage and time since harvest. Specifically, emigrating salamanders used thinned forest significantly more than clearcuts, though thinning decreased the body condition of ensatina salamanders 10 years after harvest (Action 852).\n\nShelterwood harvesting compared to clearcutting resulted in higher, similar or initially higher and then similar salamander abundance in three USA studies (Action 851). However, harvesting trees in small groups did not result in higher amphibian or salamander abundance compared to clearcutting in three USA studies (Action 844).\n\nLeave-tree harvesting, where a low density of trees is left during harvest, did not result in higher salamander abundance compared to clearcutting in two USA studies (Action 846). All partial harvesting methods studied (thinning, shelterwood, group harvesting, and leave-tree harvesting) decreased salamander abundance compared to unharvested forest areas and affected reproductive parameters such as the proportion of female salamanders carrying eggs and juveniles (Actions 852, 851, 844, 846).",

One review found that fish control, which included using rotenone, increased breeding success for four amphibian species (Action 828). Four studies found that removing fish by catching them significantly increased abundance of salamanders or frogs or increased recruitment, survival and population growth rate of cascades frog (Action 827). One study found that draining ponds to eliminate fish increased numbers of amphibian species (Action 826). Three studies found that pond drying to eliminate fish, along with other management activities in some cases, increased breeding success of frog or newt species (Action 826). One study found that pond restoration, which sometimes included drying to eliminate fish, and pond creation increased numbers of species and breeding populations of common spadefoot toads and great crested newts compared to no management (Action 826).\n\nPotential harms and limitations documented include: Two replicated studies found when rotenone was applied, many frogs died and a small number of newts showed symptoms of negative effects (Action 828). One before-and-after study found that fish control had no significant effect on great crested newt populations and fish remained or returned within a few years (Action 827). One study found that fish control did not increase green toad breeding success and fish were soon reintroduced (Action 827).",

Another replicated, randomized, controlled study in Australia found that ungrazed areas had similar overall reptile and amphibian abundance compared to areas that were grazed, burned or grazed and burned to remove invasive para grass (action 3512). \n\nFor positive impacts of grazing management: Five studies including four replicated studies in Denmark, Estonia and the UK found that habitat management that included reintroduction of grazing increased green toad populations, maintained or increased natterjack toad populations and maintained common toad populations (action 780). However, one replicated, controlled study in the UK found that grazed plots did not have higher abundance of natterjack toads than ungrazed plots and had lower abundance of common toads (action 780).\n\nRegarding grazing cessation impacts: One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that ungrazed sites had fewer bog turtles than grazed sites, while another study found that juvenile box turtles were present less frequently in ungrazed sites compared to grazed sites (action 3512). One before-and-after study in the USA found that the decline in amphibian species was similar under traditional season-long or intensive-early cattle stocking (action 780).\n\nThe evidence shows context-dependent effects where grazing management can benefit some amphibian species while having neutral or negative effects on others, with outcomes varying by species, habitat type, and grazing intensity.",

Restored wetlands showed more consistent positive outcomes, with ten site comparison studies in Canada and the USA finding that eight studies showed similar amphibian abundance, numbers of species, and species composition between restored and natural wetlands, while only two found lower numbers or abundance in restored wetlands (Action 879). Both approaches demonstrated colonization success, with created wetlands being colonized by four to 15 amphibian species (Action 880) and restored wetlands being colonized by three to eight amphibian species (Action 879). A global review found that restored and created wetlands had similar or higher amphibian abundance or numbers of species to natural wetlands in 89% of cases (Action 879), while another global review found that created and restored wetlands combined had higher or similar numbers compared to natural wetlands, with 54% showing higher numbers and 35% showing similar numbers (Action 880). Seven of nine studies found that wetland restoration increased numbers of amphibian species with breeding populations establishing in some cases (Action 879). Both approaches were affected by factors including wetland design, vegetation, water levels, surrounding habitat, fish presence, wetland size, proximity to source ponds, and seasonality (Actions 879, 880).",
