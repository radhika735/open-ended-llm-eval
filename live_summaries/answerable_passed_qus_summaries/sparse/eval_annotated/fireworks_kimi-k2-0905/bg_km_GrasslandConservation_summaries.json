Soil disturbance before seeding showed increased plant emergence in 4 out of 5 studies, increased grass and forb species richness when using rotovation compared to lighter disturbance, and increased forb species cover. Topsoil removal before seeding demonstrated more consistent benefits for species richness - one French study found it increased plant species richness and community similarity to intact steppe, while a UK study found it increased sown plant species richness. Two USA studies found topsoil removal increased seedling and plant survival. However, effects on vegetation cover were mixed with topsoil removal. A direct comparative study found that removing turf before sowing increased both grass and forb species richness in most cases compared to simply disturbing soil before sowing.",

One trial found increased microbial diversity.\\nErosion: One controlled, replicated trial from India found that mixed amendments were more effective at reducing the size of cracks in dry soil than inorganic fertilizers alone or no fertilizer.\\nSOC loss: Four controlled, randomized, replicated trials and one controlled trial from China and India found more organic carbon in soils with mixed fertilizers. Manure alone also increased organic carbon. One trial also found more carbon in soil amended with inorganic fertilizers and lime.\\nSOM loss: Two controlled, randomized, replicated trials from China and India found more nutrients in soils with manure and inorganic fertilizers. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial from China found inconsistent effects of using mixed manure and inorganic fertilizers.\\nYield: Two controlled, randomized, replicated trials from China found increased maize Zea mays yield in soils with mixed manure and inorganic fertilizer amendments.\\nSOIL TYPES COVERED: clay, clay loam, sandy-loam, silt clay loam, silty-loam.\"\n}"
