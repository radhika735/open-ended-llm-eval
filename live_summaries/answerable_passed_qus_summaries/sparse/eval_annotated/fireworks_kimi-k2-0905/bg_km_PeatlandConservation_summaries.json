In contrast, cutting trees combined with rewetting peat shows clearer benefits for peatland restoration, particularly by increasing Sphagnum moss cover and promoting wetland-characteristic plant abundance. The combination treatment typically increases herb cover including cottongrasses and sedges, reduces non-Sphagnum forest mosses, and can change plant community composition to become more similar to natural peatlands rather than remaining like drained forest sites.

Six studies were in general or unspecified peatlands.

Three of these studies\\u00a0reported mixed responses by species. Two additional replicated studies, in bogs in Latvia\\u00a0and forested fens in Finland, reported that rewetting had no effect on Sphagnum\\u00a0cover. Five studies (one paired, controlled, before-and-after) in Finland, Sweden\\u00a0and Canada\\u00a0reported that rewetting bogs or fens had no effect on cover of non-Sphagnum mosses (or mosses/lichens). However, two controlled studies in bogs in Ireland\\u00a0and the UK\\u00a0reported that rewetting reduced cover of non-Sphagnum mosses\\u00a0or bryophytes. One site comparison study in Finland\\u00a0reported that a rewetted peatland had similar moss cover (Sphagnum and total) to a natural peatland, but another site comparison study in Canada\\u00a0reported that a rewetted bog had lower moss cover (Sphagnum and other) than nearby target peatlands.\\nHerb cover (25 studies): Twenty-one studies (including four replicated, paired, controlled) reported that rewetting (sometimes\\u00a0along with other interventions) increased cover of at least one group of herbs. These studies were in bogs, fens or other peatlands in the UK, Finland, Ireland, the Czech Republic, the USA, the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, China, Latvia, Poland, Canada\\u00a0and Spain. Specifically, rewetting increased other/total sedge cover in 13 of 15 studies, increased cottongrass cover in eight of nine studies, and increased reed/rush cover in five of seven studies. Three\\u00a0of four before-and-after studies in peatlands in the UK and Sweden reported that rewetting reduced purple moor grass cover; the other study\\u00a0reported no effect. One replicated site comparison study in forested fens in Finland\\u00a0reported that rewetting had no effect on total herb cover.

Two before-and-after studies in fens in Sweden\\u00a0and Germany\\u00a0reported that rewetting increased tree/shrub cover. One before-and-after study in a bog in the UK\\u00a0reported mixed effects of rewetting on different tree/shrub species.\\nOverall vegetation cover (4 studies): Of four before-and-after studies (three also controlled) that examined the effect of rewetting on overall vegetation cover, two in bogs in Ireland\\u00a0and Sweden\\u00a0reported that rewetting increased it.

However, five studies found no effect: in bogs in the Czech Republic\\u00a0and Latvia, fens in Sweden\\u00a0and Germany, and forested fens in Finland. One study in fen meadows in the Netherlands\\u00a0found scale-dependent effects. One paired, controlled, before-and-after study in a peatland in Finland\\u00a0reported that rewetting reduced plant diversity.
