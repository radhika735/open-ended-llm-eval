A review found that legislation reducing trade in two frog species resulted in recovery of over\u2011exploited populations, and a study in South Africa recorded an increase in permits for scientific and educational use of amphibians from 1987 to 1990 (785). Financial incentives for land managers produced mixed outcomes: payments created amphibian breeding habitat or increased frog or toad populations in Denmark, Sweden and Taiwan, but another Taiwan study found payments did not maintain green tree frog habitat; in the Netherlands, ditches managed under agri\u2011environment schemes had higher amphibian species richness and abundance than conventionally managed ditches (818). Habitat protection under statutory frameworks showed varied results: natterjack toad populations were better protected at sites with statutory habitat protection than outside protected areas, and after a pond was protected during development at one UK site, common frog numbers increased while common toad numbers decreased (820).",

Factors associated with outcomes included wetland size, proximity to source ponds and seasonality for restored wetlands (not age) [879], and wetland design, vegetation, water levels, surrounding habitat, fish presence and distance to source wetlands for created wetlands [880]. A global review reported that in 89% of cases, restored and created wetlands had similar or higher amphibian abundance or numbers of species than natural wetlands [879], and another review plus USA site comparisons that combined created and restored wetlands found higher or similar, or higher in 54% of studies and similar in 35% compared to natural wetlands [880].

Three studies found that overall bird densities or abundances of red-cockaded woodpeckers were higher in open pine forests with prescribed burning, tree thinning and mid- or understorey control, compared with control areas or those thinned but not burned. One found differences were more marked in spring. A study found that a red-cockaded woodpecker population increased following the start of intensive management consisting of prescribed burning and other interventions. \\nTen studies found that total bird densities or those of some species was the same or lower in sites with prescribed burning compared to control sites, or those with other management. Five studies investigated several interventions at once. Generally, closed-forest species and ground nesters appeared to be adversely affected by burning.\\nThree studies found higher productivities or survival of species in burned or burned and thinned areas, compared to control areas or those burned less recently. Seven studies found no differences in productivity, behaviour or survival (including of artificial nests) in burned areas or burned and thinned areas, compared to controls. One study found that northern bobwhite chicks had lower foraging success in burned areas, compared to other management regimes, whilst another found that different predators were dominant under different management.\\nThe three studies that investigated it found that burning season did not appear to affect the effects of burning.\"\n}"
