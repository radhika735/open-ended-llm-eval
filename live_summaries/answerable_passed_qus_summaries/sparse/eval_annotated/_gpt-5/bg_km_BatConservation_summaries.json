Two randomized, controlled studies tested a probiotic bacterium treatment: a laboratory study in Canada found that treating little brown bats at the time of infection increased survival within cages and reduced disease symptoms, whereas treating 21 days prior did not increase survival and was associated with worse symptoms (2008); a study in the USA found increased survival for free-flying bats treated within a mine but not for caged bats, and caged bats had similar disease severity to untreated bats (2008). No studies were found that evaluated the effects of culling infected bats (1012), vaccinating bats (1011), restricting human access to bat caves (1010), breeding bats in captivity to supplement wild populations (2009), treating hibernacula environments to reduce the pathogen reservoir (2007), or decontaminating clothing and equipment after entering caves (2006).",

    "relevant_summary": "Evidence from action documents identifies several non-lethal approaches. In fruit orchards, an organic deterrent spray, hanging plastic flags in trees, covering branches with nylon net bags, and ringing bells deterred bats and reduced fruit damage in replicated, controlled studies in Madagascar and Mauritius [1953]. Replacing culling with non-lethal methods to prevent vampire bats from spreading rabies to humans or livestock has no studies evaluating effects [1979, 1950]. Preventing culling around fruit orchards has no studies evaluating effects [1952]. Carrying out surveillance of bats to prevent spread of disease/viruses to humans has no studies evaluating effects [2005]. Providing alternative roosts during bridge maintenance saw bat houses used less than the original roost at one site and not used at three sites in the USA [2942]. Excluding bats from roosts during building work did not change roost switching frequency, core foraging areas, or foraging preferences of soprano pipistrelle colonies in a replicated, before-and-after study in the UK [1930]. Excluding bats from roosts prior to mine reclamation has no studies evaluating effects [1961]. Managing the microclimate of artificial roosts showed increased bat numbers after reducing internal temperatures in two artificial roosts in Spain, while heated bat boxes in UK sites showed limited or no use, including by displaced Natterer\u2019s bats [2052].",
