Nitrogen in soil was frequently higher under cover crops in some comparisons, but results were sometimes inconsistent across studies and nitrogen forms; phosphorus was often similar, and potassium sometimes increased under cover crops [1345]. Microbial biomass, bacteria and fungi were commonly higher with cover crops in some comparisons, and nematode communities could be more diverse [1345, 898, 897]. Erosion and soil loss were reduced and water-stable aggregates increased under cover crops in some or all comparisons [1345, 897]. Regarding water, cover crops sometimes reduced runoff, drainage, and evaporation and reduced nitrate and herbicide leaching, though soil water content and water use showed mixed results across studies from Spain and elsewhere [1357]. Additional studies found improved soil structure, higher porosity, and reduced nitrate leaching under cover crops, with increased soil carbon, including when legumes were used [898]. For crop production, yield effects were mixed: some studies from Spain and elsewhere found lower yields with winter cover crops in some comparisons, some found higher yields, many found no difference, and several reported inconsistent results; cash crop quality was often unchanged; yields were often higher when legumes were used as winter cover crops or when mixtures included grasses [1351].",
