    "relevant_summary": "Several methods are available to control disease and sea lice in Atlantic salmon farms according to the action documents. For sea lice control, fallowing systems have been shown to reduce lice numbers on Atlantic salmon in cages in Scotland (action 1026). Natural control agents such as cleaner wrasse have mixed effectiveness - corkwing and goldskinny cleaner wrasse were as effective at controlling lice infestation as chemical treatments in one study in Ireland, while rockcook cleaner wrasse were ineffective at preventing lice outbreaks in another Irish study (action 738). Lighting management can also help, as lower numbers of lice were found on salmon kept in low intensity artificial light or natural lighting compared to more intense artificial light in Norway (action 741). Nutritional approaches show promise, with salmon fed a diet composed of fish meal and plant-based protein showing 28% reduction in lice infection, and adding beta-glucans to the diet providing an additional 28% reduction compared with controls in Norway (action 732). For disease prevention, vaccinations are effective against multiple bacterial diseases, with higher survival rates reported in vaccinated salmon compared to unvaccinated controls against Aeromonas salmonicida, Yersinia ruckeri, marine flexibacteriosis, bacterial kidney disease, and infectious salmon anaemia across studies in Iceland, Norway, Australia and Canada (action 733). Probiotics and immunostimulants also show benefits, with increased survival in salmon fed probiotics before exposure to disease-causing bacteria in Scotland (action 732). Freshwater bathing provides mixed results for amoebic gill disease control in Australian studies (action 739). Selective breeding for disease resistance traits has shown increased survival levels in salmon exposed to infectious pancreatic necrosis when families were bred for high resistance to the disease in Norway (action 735).",
