    "relevant_summary": "When restoring wetlands for amphibian conservation, ten site comparison studies in Canada and the USA found that amphibian abundance and the number and composition of species were similar between restored and natural wetlands in eight of the studies [879]. However, two of the studies found that restored wetlands had lower numbers of species or abundance [879]. Seven of nine studies found that wetland restoration increased the number of amphibian species, with some establishing breeding populations [879]. For created wetlands, five site comparison studies in the USA showed that created wetlands had similar numbers of amphibian species and abundance to natural wetlands, while two studies showed that created wetlands had fewer amphibian species and lower abundance [880]. Some amphibian species were found only in either created or natural wetlands [880]. The number of species in restored wetlands is affected by the size of the wetland, its proximity to other ponds, and seasonality [879]. Similarly, the numbers of amphibian species and their abundance in created wetlands are influenced by the wetland's design, vegetation, water levels, surrounding habitat, the presence of fish, and the distance to other wetlands [880]. Restored wetlands were colonized by three to eight species of amphibians [879], while created wetlands were colonized by four to fifteen amphibian species [880]. A global review that combined created and restored wetlands found that when compared to natural wetlands, amphibian abundance or the number of species was similar or higher in 89% of cases [879]. Another review that combined created and restored wetlands found that the numbers were similar or higher in 54% of studies and similar in 35% of studies when compared to natural wetlands [880]. One study on restored wetlands found that three target species did not recolonize the area [879], and a study on created wetlands showed that a captive-bred population did not establish a self-sustaining population [880].",
