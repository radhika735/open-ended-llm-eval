    "relevant_summary": "Studies in Mediterranean climates have found that growing cover crops in arable fields, orchards, and vineyards can have a range of effects on soil health. \n\nIn terms of soil composition, the use of cover crops has been shown to increase soil organic matter (1345, 1367), and in some cases, nitrogen (1345, 1367) and potassium (1345). However, the effects on phosphorus levels were inconsistent (1345, 1367). The presence of cover crops was also found to increase the abundance of soil organisms, including microbial biomass (1345, 1367), nematodes (1345, 1367), earthworms (1345), bacteria (1345, 1367), and beneficial fungi (1345). In terms of soil structure, cover crops were found to reduce soil erosion (1345, 1367) and increase the number of water-stable soil aggregates (1345, 1367). \n\nSome studies also examined the impact on greenhouse gas emissions, with mixed results. While some studies reported an increase in carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions in soils with cover crops (1345, 1367), others found similar levels to soils without cover crops (1345, 1367). One study, however, did find that cover crops led to greater carbon accumulation in the soil (1345). \n\nDifferent types of cover crops can also have different effects. For instance, planting legumes as cover crops was found to increase nitrogen in the soil (1345, 1367), and long-term or permanent cover crops were associated with higher soil quality and more organic matter (1345, 1367).",
