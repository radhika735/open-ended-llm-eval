    "relevant_summary": "In studies of coniferous woodland, thinning trees was found to increase the species richness of butterflies, or butterflies, diurnal moths, and bumblebees combined, when compared to unmanaged woodland (3940). Partially-cleared forest plots were recorded as having a higher butterfly species richness, but lower moth species richness, than plots of closed-canopy forest (3940). Cleared patches in forests were also found to have a greater species richness of butterflies, but a lower species richness of moths, than unmanaged patches (3938). The abundance of butterflies, or specialist butterflies, was higher in thinned coniferous woodland than in unmanaged woodland (3940), and cleared patches in forests also had a higher abundance of butterflies generally (3938). A review across Europe reported that 19 of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern benefitted from the clearing of small patches in forests (3938). In the UK, more unique species of macro-moth were found in wider woodland rides and coppiced woodland than in standard width rides or mature forest (3938). However, a study in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire found that rarer species of fruit-feeding butterfly were less frequently caught in a thinned forest than in an unmanaged, naturally regenerating forest (3940). Another study in the UK found that wider rides had a lower abundance of macro-moths than standard width rides or mature forest (3938). Orange sulphur butterflies were observed to fly into areas with selective clearance of pines more often than other areas in a study in the USA (3938). In the UK, the number of breeding sites for pearl-bordered fritillary and Duke of Burgundy butterflies increased in cleared patches in forests that were also managed with cutting, grazing and ride widening (3938).",
