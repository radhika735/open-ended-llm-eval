Temporary fishery closures demonstrated limited effects on fish abundance, with studies finding no increase in cod biomass or spawning stock biomass over nine years compared to fished areas (Actions 2664, 2938). Both closure types showed behavioral impacts, with long-term closures making fish more vulnerable to capture and temporary closures providing spawning period protection. Periodic fishing showed more positive results, with short-period fished areas having greater biomass than openly fished areas and similar biomass to permanently closed areas after 18 months to six years (Action 2679).",

According to action 2682, which synthesized 79 studies, 14 of 20 site comparison studies found that MPAs prohibiting all fishing for 1-25+ years had higher fish species richness compared to fished areas. For fish abundance, 30 of 54 studies found higher abundances (density and/or biomass) of total fish, fishery-targeted species, non-targeted species, and individual fish groups in no-fishing MPAs compared to fished areas. The evidence shows that MPAs with complete fishing prohibitions result in larger fish overall, with multiple studies (action 2682) documenting larger individuals across most fish species and groups compared to fished areas after 1-22 years of protection. Action 2224 found similar benefits for invertebrates, with higher overall abundance and biomass, particularly for crustaceans like lobsters which showed increased abundance, size, and reproductive potential. However, the effects can vary by species and circumstances. Some studies found similar species richness or abundance between protected and fished areas, and responses varied between individual fish families, commercial versus non-target species, and based on factors like depth and habitat type. Action 2681 noted that one study found lower total fish species richness in MPAs with limited fishing exceptions compared to unprotected areas.",

Eleven of 15 site comparison studies (including replicated, randomized, paired, before-and-after) in the North Atlantic Ocean, the Bristol Channel and the Irish Sea, the Firth of Clyde, the Mediterranean Sea, the North Pacific Ocean, the Florida Keys, the South Pacific Ocean, the Tasman Sea, and the Coral Sea\\u00a0found that inside marine protected areas prohibiting all fishing, the abundances and/or biomasses of lobsters\\u00a0and mud crabs\\u00a0were higher compared to areas where seasonal or unrestricted fishing was allowed, after four to 33 years depending on the study. Four found that they had mixed effects on the abundances of lobster, and crab species, after one to seven years depending on the study. Two found that they had similar abundance of lobsters compared to fished areas after either five to seven years\\u00a0or after approximately 30 years.\\u00a0\\nCrustacean reproductive success (4 studies): Two site comparison studies (one replicated, randomized) in the Florida Keys\\u00a0and the Firth of Clyde\\u00a0found that marine protected areas prohibiting all fishing and harvesting had similar population sex ratios of lobsters compared to where seasonal fishing\\u00a0or all fishing\\u00a0was allowed, after four to seven years depending on the study. Two replicated, site comparison studies (one randomized) in the Tasman Sea\\u00a0and the Mediterranean Sea\\u00a0found that marine protected areas prohibiting all fishing had greater lobster egg production potential compared to commercial fishing exclusion zones\\u00a0and fully fished areas, after either 15 years\\u00a0or 21 to 25 years. One site comparison study in the Firth of Clyde\\u00a0found that marine protected areas prohibiting all fishing had more female lobsters with eggs than fished areas, after four to seven years.\\nCrustacean condition (8 studies): One review of studies in New Zealand, and five of seven site comparison studies (four replicated, one replicated and randomized) in the North Atlantic Ocean, the Bristol Channel and the Irish Sea, the Firth of Clyde, the Florida Keys, the South Pacific Ocean, the Coral Sea, and the Tasman Sea, found that marine protected areas prohibiting all fishing had bigger lobsters\\u00a0and crabs\\u00a0compared to seasonally fished or fully fished areas, after four to seven years depending on the study. Three found mixed effects on lobsters\\u00a0and crabs\\u00a0depending on species, sex, and locations, after one to seven years depending on the study.\\nCrustacean population structure (2 studies): Two replicated site comparison studies (one randomized) in the Tasman Sea\\u00a0and the Mediterranean Sea\\u00a0found that marine protected areas prohibiting all fishing had different population size structures of lobsters compared to commercial fishing exclusion zones (only for females)\\u00a0and compared to fished areas, after either 15 years\\u00a0or 21 to 25 years.\\nEchinoderm abundance (3 studies): Two of three site comparison studies (two replicated, one paired) in the North Pacific Ocean, the South Pacific Ocean, and the North Pacific Ocean, found that marine protected areas prohibiting all fishing had similar abundance of Kina sea urchins after more than 10 years, and sea cucumbers after eight years\\u00a0to fished areas, and a third found higher abundance of red sea urchins after approximately 30 years. One also found that the effects on abundance of red sea urchins depended on the age of the protected area and the size of the urchins.\\nEchinoderm condition (1 study): One paired, site comparison study in the South Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found that marine protected areas that had been prohibiting all fishing for over 10 years had heavier Kina sea urchins compared to fished areas.\\nMollusc abundance (10 studies): Four of 10 site comparison studies (including replicated before-and-after, and site comparison) in the North Atlantic Ocean, the North Pacific Ocean\\u00a0the South Pacific Ocean, the Tasman Sea, and the Foveaux Straight\\u00a0found that inside a marine reserve prohibiting all fishing, abundances/biomass of giant clams, adult queen conch, Cook\\u2019s turban snails, rock scallops\\u00a0and green abalone\\u00a0were higher compared to a fished area, after eight to 36 years depending on the study. Six found similar abundances of scallop species, pink abalone, juvenile queen conch, and top shell species, after five to 36 years depending on the study. Three found lower abundances of star limpets after 23 to 25 years\\u00a0and blacklip abalone after 15 to 16 years. One found that the effects of marine protected areas prohibiting all fishing on the abundance of mussel species compared to a commercial fishing exclusion zone varied with the age and location of the protected areas.\\nMollusc reproductive success (1 study): One site comparison study in the North Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that inside a marine protected area that had been prohibiting all fishing for 33 to 36 years, abundance of queen conch larvae was higher compared to an unprotected fished area.\\nMollusc condition (1 study): One site comparison study in the North Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found that in marine protected areas that had been prohibiting all fishing pink abalone were bigger five to 23 years after their designation, compared to fished site.\"\n}"

Six studies\\u00a0found similar fish species/richness between one and 20 years after all fishing was banned in protected areas, compared to fished areas. One systematic review in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans\\u00a0found no difference in species richness between unfished protected areas and fished areas. One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that the effects of prohibiting all fishing on fish species richness/diversity after 15 years varied with the sampling method used.\\n\\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (66 STUDIES)\\n\\nAbundance (64 studies): Thirty of 54 site comparison studies (18 replicated, eight replicated and paired, two before-and-after, one paired and before-and-after, and one replicated and before-and-after) in the Indian Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, Pacific Ocean, Tasman Sea, Coral Sea, Philippine Sea, Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and the Sulu Sea, found that marine protected areas that had been prohibiting all fishing for up to 25 years or more, had higher abundances (density and/or biomass) of all fish (total fish biomass, total fish density), fishery targeted fish species, non-fishery targeted fish species\\u00a0and all or most of the individual fish species/groups monitored, except fish densities (all or most)\\u00a0and non-fishery targeted species, compared to unprotected fished areas and/or partly-fished protected areas. The studies also found that in some cases where the total fish biomass or densities were higher in no-fished areas, the effect varied between individual groups of fish based on species family\\u00a0and/or position in the food chain, commercial target and non-target species, fish sizes, depth\\u00a0and habitat types. Eight studies found that inside protected areas prohibiting all fishing there were similar abundances of all fish, and all or most of the individual fish species/groups monitored, compared to fished areas between one and 20 years after implementation. The other sixteen studies\\u00a0found that the effect of prohibiting fishing in protected areas for three to 20 years on fish abundance varied between fish species or groups and on their fished status (fishery target or non-target)\\u00a0and/or position in the food chain. One also found that the effect varied with size or age of the protected areas. Five of six reviews (three systematic) across the world, in the Pacific and/or Atlantic Oceans\\u00a0and in unreported regions\\u00a0found that non-fished marine reserves with one to 27 years of protection had higher abundances of all fish, all fish and invertebrates combined\\u00a0and blue cod\\u00a0compared to fished areas, but there were differences between species/groups and fishing intensity outside reserves. The other review\\u00a0found that fish abundance varied between species in no-take marine reserves between one and 25 years old, and was affected by food chain position, level of exploitation and duration of protection. One replicated study in the Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found a long-term decline in the abundance/presence of eight of 12 shark and ray species inside an established (&gt;15 years) no-fishing protected area, however enforcement was poor. One before-and after, site comparison study in the Pacific Ocean, found no differences in overall fish abundance between a marine reserve closed permanently to fishing for five years and a closed area that was harvested for two years during the same period. One site comparison study in the Coral Sea\\u00a0found that in a no-take zone of an area protected for at least 10 years, fish abundance of four of six fish groups were similar to no-entry and fished zones, but two had lower abundance than the no-entry zone. One replicated, paired, site comparison study in the Tasman Sea\\u00a0found that in a non-fished marine park zone abundance of commercially targeted fish was higher than partly fished zones but lower than unprotected areas after four to eight years.\\nReproductive success (1 study): One site comparison study in the Mediterranean Sea\\u00a0found more eggs of four commercially targeted fish species inside a non-fished marine reserve enforced for three years than in fished areas outside the reserve.\\nSurvival (1 study): One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that prohibiting all fishing in a marine protected area for three years resulted in similar survival of red hind grouper, compared to fished areas.\\nCondition (20 studies): Two global review studies\\u00a0(one systematic) and two systematic reviews in the Pacific Ocean\\u00a0and the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans\\u00a0found that prohibiting all fishing in marine protected areas for one to 27 years resulted in larger fish overall\\u00a0and larger blue cod\\u00a0compared to fished areas, but there were differences between individual fish families or species. Eight of 11 site comparison studies (four replicated, one before-and-after, one paired, and one replicated and paired) in the Tasman Sea, Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, Atlantic Ocean, Java Sea\\u00a0and the Philippine Sea, found that non-fished protected areas had larger fish overall\\u00a0and larger individuals of all or most of the fish species/groups monitored, compared to fished areas, after one to 22 years. The other three studies\\u00a0found similar fish sizes of all or all but one species, compared to fished areas one to 16 years after all fishing was prohibited. Three site comparison studies (one replicated) in the Coral Sea, Caribbean Sea\\u00a0and the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that fish size in protected areas that had not been fished for six to more than 20 years, varied between fish species or food chain groups. One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that red hind grouper were larger, but had similar growth, in an area protected from fishing for three years compared to fished areas.

One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that in non-fished areas protected for one and 24 years, fish grazing rates were higher compared to fished areas.\\n\\n\\u00a0OTHER (15 STUDIES)\\n\\nUse (7 studies): Four of six site comparison studies in the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0and the Tasman Sea\\u00a0found that marine protected areas where all fishing had been prohibited for at least five to 15 years, were used for a large proportion of time by shark and ray species\\u00a0and commercially important reef fish species, compared to fished areas, thus were provided protection from fishing. Two other studies\\u00a0found that time spent inside areas closed to all fishing for 20 years\\u00a0and over 30 years, varied between species and with size for three shark species\\u00a0and with size for giant trevally. One replicated study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that most individuals of five fish species remained inside a marine reserve zone closed to fishing over a nine-year period.\\n\\n\\nCatch abundance (2 studies): One of two site comparison studies in the Mediterranean Sea\\u00a0and Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found that commercial fish catch rates in small-scale traditional fisheries were highest closest to a marine reserve closed to all fishing for 22 years, and decreased with increasing distance from the reserve. The other study\\u00a0found that there was no increase in fish catch rates in commercially landed catch in the five years after a no-fishing zone was implemented in a co-managed protected area.\\nStock biomass (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that the stock biomass (the harvested portion of the population) of reef fish species was highest in enforced protected areas closed to all fishing, compared to various other area management regimes.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\nFishing mortality (2 studies): Two site comparison studies in the North Sea\\u00a0and Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found that prohibiting fishing in protected areas resulted in reduced commercial fishing mortality of corkwing wrasse tagged inside non-fished marine reserves compared to fished areas, and that the overall fishing mortality of grey reef sharks tagged inside protected areas was low.\"\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "Besides changing hook type, several other gear modifications can reduce unwanted catches of sharks and rays in fisheries. Electropositive deterrents attached to fishing gear have shown mixed results, with some studies finding they reduce catches of spiny dogfish, longnose skate, and other sharks and rays, while other studies found no significant reduction. Visual deterrents like shark-shaped objects attached to gillnets have been shown to reduce catches of green turtles and potentially other bycatch. For trawl fisheries, raising parts of bottom trawls off the seabed during fishing has been shown to reduce unwanted shark and elasmobranch catches. Using topless (coverless) trawls can reduce discards of commercial fish species but their effectiveness specifically for sharks and rays varies. Fitting trawl nets with size-sorting escape grids and large supported escape openings has been shown to reduce catches of sharks and rays in some cases. Modifying tickler chains/chain mats in bottom trawls, such as removing the tickler chain entirely, can reduce catches of non-commercial target skates/rays and sharks. Using different bait types in longline fisheries has shown mixed results for shark and ray bycatch reduction, with some studies finding no effect on unwanted shark and ray catches. For trap fisheries, fitting mesh escape panels/windows may provide escape opportunities, though specific evidence for shark and ray reduction is lacking.",

Topless (coverless) trawls can reduce unwanted catches of larger Atlantic cod and larger haddock, though effectiveness varies by fish size, as demonstrated in studies from the North Sea and other European waters. Separator trawls have been found to separate unwanted cod from target species, allowing smaller cod to escape through larger mesh sizes in the lower codend, according to a replicated study in the North Sea. Electric (pulse) trawls have been shown to reduce catches of non-target and undersized commercial fish including cod and haddock in multiple studies conducted in the North Sea. Mesh escape panels/windows fitted to trawl nets can reduce unwanted catches and improve size selectivity for cod and haddock, with 30 out of 36 studies showing reductions in unwanted catch, though effectiveness varies with panel design, position, and other factors.",

Studies showed that position and mesh size modifications could improve size-selectivity for certain species like haddock and whiting, though results varied by species and configuration.\n\nSize-sorting escape grids (rigid or flexible) demonstrated consistent effectiveness across multiple studies (Action 2720, 2725). Eighteen studies showed grids reduced unwanted catches of small mackerel, monkfish, whiting, haddock, hake, spiny dogfish, herring, halibut, cod, and other non-target species. Three studies found improved size-selectivity for haddock, though results were mixed for other species like cod and saithe.\n\nLarge supported escape openings (Fisheyes, Bigeyes, radial escape sections) were effective in reducing unwanted catch in six of seven studies (Action 2723, 2726). These devices successfully reduced overall unwanted fish catches, immature red snapper, total unwanted catch, and showed species-specific effectiveness for Chinook salmon and widow rockfish.\n\nCombined configurations showed enhanced effectiveness.

A study in the Coral Sea found that areas closed to non-towed (static) fishing gear had higher overall shark abundance when sampled with longlines compared to areas where commercial gillnets were permitted. In contrast, a study in the Indian Ocean found that prohibiting offshore line fishing along with all other boat-based fishing resulted in higher abundances of four out of four fish species that were over-exploited by line fishing, compared to zones where boat-based line and spear fishing was permitted. Additionally, the line fishing prohibition led to larger size of these four over-exploited species, indicating improved population structure. While both approaches demonstrate conservation benefits, the evidence suggests that prohibiting line fishing may have more consistent positive effects on fish abundance across multiple species, whereas the effects of prohibiting static gear appear to vary more depending on the species and sampling methods used.",

Four studies on fish condition found that controlling human activity with zonation systems resulted in larger average fish lengths in protected zones compared to fished areas, with sizes being largest in no-take zones. One study found higher fish species richness in no-fishing/no access zones compared to partially fished zones and unprotected areas. Two studies tracking fish behavior found that most tagged reef fish remained in zones where all or nearly all fishing was prohibited, indicating increased protection from fishing pressure.\\n\\nThe evidence indicates that while zonation systems with partial fishing allowances can provide some benefits, the effects vary significantly by species, zone type, and protection level. No-take zones consistently showed the strongest positive outcomes for fish populations, while partially fished zones showed intermediate results between fully protected and unprotected areas.\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"2674\",\n    \"2230\",\n    \"2680\"\n  ]\n}"

In the North Atlantic region, studies found mixed effectiveness: one study found higher numbers of larger and older cod after 15 years of protection (action 2654), while another found no improvement in haddock recruitment or survival after seven years of bottom trawling closure (action 2673). In the Mediterranean Sea, the evidence suggests more positive outcomes from gear prohibitions. Studies found increased biomass of adult red mullet after 14 years of closure, improved recruitment of young red mullet, and larger sizes of adult red mullet compared to before closure (action 2673). In the Indian Ocean, studies showed positive effects on fisheries, with higher overall fish catch rates and variable catch rates of individual fish groups after prohibiting beach and other seine nets for 3-6 years (action 2673). The North Sea showed some positive results with higher total fish biomass after 15 years of protection (action 2673), while studies in the Bering Sea and other regions showed mixed results with some benefits for invertebrate diversity and abundance but no consistent effects on biomass (action 2099).",

Topless trawls demonstrated more consistent results across four studies, with reductions in unwanted Atlantic cod catch and discards of commercial fish species compared to conventional trawls. However, one study found topless trawls only reduced unwanted catches of larger haddock and larger Atlantic cod in specific cases, not smaller individuals.

    "relevant_summary": "Documented effects of modifying fishing trap or pot configurations on marine fish include both positive outcomes for fish populations and selective improvements in fishing efficiency. According to 23 studies examining these modifications, the primary benefits are reductions in unwanted catch and improved size-selectivity. Specifically, 16 of 20 replicated studies found that various trap modifications (including different trap types, increased mesh sizes, and escape devices) significantly reduced unwanted catches of multiple fish species including brown trout, black sea bass, herring, cod, whitefish, American eel, winter flounder, and various shark/ray species. These modifications also lowered the number of unwanted species caught overall. Three of four studies demonstrated that traps or pots modified with square mesh escape windows or larger mesh sizes improved size-selectivity for species like Atlantic cod, black sea bass, and most fish species, allowing smaller fish to escape capture. However, not all modifications were universally effective - three studies found no effect on unwanted catches of certain species like white croaker, non-commercial fish, or undersized Atlantic cod, and one study actually reported increased non-target haddock catches. Importantly, one study found that survival rates of small herring that escaped through size-sorting grids were similar to trap-caught herring that did not pass through grids, indicating that escape mechanisms do not necessarily harm fish survival.",

For species richness, 14 of 20 site comparison studies across multiple ocean regions (Indian Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, Philippine Sea, Tasman Sea, Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, Coral Sea, and Pacific Ocean) found that marine protected areas prohibiting all fishing for 1-25+ years had higher fish species richness compared to fished areas.

Six studies\\u00a0found similar fish species/richness between one and 20 years after all fishing was banned in protected areas, compared to fished areas. One systematic review in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans\\u00a0found no difference in species richness between unfished protected areas and fished areas. One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that the effects of prohibiting all fishing on fish species richness/diversity after 15 years varied with the sampling method used.\\n\\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (66 STUDIES)\\n\\nAbundance (64 studies): Thirty of 54 site comparison studies (18 replicated, eight replicated and paired, two before-and-after, one paired and before-and-after, and one replicated and before-and-after) in the Indian Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, Pacific Ocean, Tasman Sea, Coral Sea, Philippine Sea, Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and the Sulu Sea, found that marine protected areas that had been prohibiting all fishing for up to 25 years or more, had higher abundances (density and/or biomass) of all fish (total fish biomass, total fish density), fishery targeted fish species, non-fishery targeted fish species\\u00a0and all or most of the individual fish species/groups monitored, except fish densities (all or most)\\u00a0and non-fishery targeted species, compared to unprotected fished areas and/or partly-fished protected areas. The studies also found that in some cases where the total fish biomass or densities were higher in no-fished areas, the effect varied between individual groups of fish based on species family\\u00a0and/or position in the food chain, commercial target and non-target species, fish sizes, depth\\u00a0and habitat types. Eight studies found that inside protected areas prohibiting all fishing there were similar abundances of all fish, and all or most of the individual fish species/groups monitored, compared to fished areas between one and 20 years after implementation. The other sixteen studies\\u00a0found that the effect of prohibiting fishing in protected areas for three to 20 years on fish abundance varied between fish species or groups and on their fished status (fishery target or non-target)\\u00a0and/or position in the food chain. One also found that the effect varied with size or age of the protected areas. Five of six reviews (three systematic) across the world, in the Pacific and/or Atlantic Oceans\\u00a0and in unreported regions\\u00a0found that non-fished marine reserves with one to 27 years of protection had higher abundances of all fish, all fish and invertebrates combined\\u00a0and blue cod\\u00a0compared to fished areas, but there were differences between species/groups and fishing intensity outside reserves. The other review\\u00a0found that fish abundance varied between species in no-take marine reserves between one and 25 years old, and was affected by food chain position, level of exploitation and duration of protection. One replicated study in the Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found a long-term decline in the abundance/presence of eight of 12 shark and ray species inside an established (&gt;15 years) no-fishing protected area, however enforcement was poor. One before-and after, site comparison study in the Pacific Ocean, found no differences in overall fish abundance between a marine reserve closed permanently to fishing for five years and a closed area that was harvested for two years during the same period. One site comparison study in the Coral Sea\\u00a0found that in a no-take zone of an area protected for at least 10 years, fish abundance of four of six fish groups were similar to no-entry and fished zones, but two had lower abundance than the no-entry zone. One replicated, paired, site comparison study in the Tasman Sea\\u00a0found that in a non-fished marine park zone abundance of commercially targeted fish was higher than partly fished zones but lower than unprotected areas after four to eight years.\\nReproductive success (1 study): One site comparison study in the Mediterranean Sea\\u00a0found more eggs of four commercially targeted fish species inside a non-fished marine reserve enforced for three years than in fished areas outside the reserve.\\nSurvival (1 study): One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that prohibiting all fishing in a marine protected area for three years resulted in similar survival of red hind grouper, compared to fished areas.\\nCondition (20 studies): Two global review studies\\u00a0(one systematic) and two systematic reviews in the Pacific Ocean\\u00a0and the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans\\u00a0found that prohibiting all fishing in marine protected areas for one to 27 years resulted in larger fish overall\\u00a0and larger blue cod\\u00a0compared to fished areas, but there were differences between individual fish families or species. Eight of 11 site comparison studies (four replicated, one before-and-after, one paired, and one replicated and paired) in the Tasman Sea, Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, Atlantic Ocean, Java Sea\\u00a0and the Philippine Sea, found that non-fished protected areas had larger fish overall\\u00a0and larger individuals of all or most of the fish species/groups monitored, compared to fished areas, after one to 22 years. The other three studies\\u00a0found similar fish sizes of all or all but one species, compared to fished areas one to 16 years after all fishing was prohibited. Three site comparison studies (one replicated) in the Coral Sea, Caribbean Sea\\u00a0and the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that fish size in protected areas that had not been fished for six to more than 20 years, varied between fish species or food chain groups. One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that red hind grouper were larger, but had similar growth, in an area protected from fishing for three years compared to fished areas. One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that young lemon sharks in areas protected from fishing for 20 years had similar growth rates, but lower condition, than sharks in unprotected fished areas.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)\\u00a0\\n\\nBehaviour change (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in the Pacific and Indian Oceans\\u00a0found that surgeonfish and parrotfish inside established protected areas where fishing was prohibited, showed a similar avoidance response to fishing gears as in fished areas, and this increased with increasing fishing intensity outside the protected areas. One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that in non-fished areas protected for one and 24 years, fish grazing rates were higher compared to fished areas.\\n\\n\\u00a0OTHER (15 STUDIES)\\n\\nUse (7 studies): Four of six site comparison studies in the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0and the Tasman Sea\\u00a0found that marine protected areas where all fishing had been prohibited for at least five to 15 years, were used for a large proportion of time by shark and ray species\\u00a0and commercially important reef fish species, compared to fished areas, thus were provided protection from fishing. Two other studies\\u00a0found that time spent inside areas closed to all fishing for 20 years\\u00a0and over 30 years, varied between species and with size for three shark species\\u00a0and with size for giant trevally. One replicated study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that most individuals of five fish species remained inside a marine reserve zone closed to fishing over a nine-year period.\\n\\n\\nCatch abundance (2 studies): One of two site comparison studies in the Mediterranean Sea\\u00a0and Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found that commercial fish catch rates in small-scale traditional fisheries were highest closest to a marine reserve closed to all fishing for 22 years, and decreased with increasing distance from the reserve. The other study\\u00a0found that there was no increase in fish catch rates in commercially landed catch in the five years after a no-fishing zone was implemented in a co-managed protected area.\\nStock biomass (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that the stock biomass (the harvested portion of the population) of reef fish species was highest in enforced protected areas closed to all fishing, compared to various other area management regimes.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\nFishing mortality (2 studies): Two site comparison studies in the North Sea\\u00a0and Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found that prohibiting fishing in protected areas resulted in reduced commercial fishing mortality of corkwing wrasse tagged inside non-fished marine reserves compared to fished areas, and that the overall fishing mortality of grey reef sharks tagged inside protected areas was low.\"\n}"

According to action ID 2682, seven site comparison studies across the Mediterranean Sea, Indian Ocean, Philippine Sea, and Atlantic Ocean found that protected areas where all fishing had been prohibited for 3-16 years had different fish community composition compared to fished areas.
