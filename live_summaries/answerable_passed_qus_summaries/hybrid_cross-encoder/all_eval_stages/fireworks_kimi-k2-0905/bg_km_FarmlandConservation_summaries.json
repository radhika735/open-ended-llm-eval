Soil nutrient benefits included increased nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium levels in many cases (action ID: 1371). However, studies also documented potential drawbacks including increased soil compaction under reduced tillage (action ID: 906), mixed effects on crop yields with some studies finding lower yields particularly for legumes (action ID: 1359), higher greenhouse gas emissions in some cases (more carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide in soils) (action ID: 1371), and variable effects on farmland wildlife with some studies showing negative or no consistent effects on invertebrates, weeds, and birds (action ID: 126).

One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil.

Eighteen studies found that overwinter stubbles provide benefits including higher densities of farmland birds in winter, increased grey partridge productivity, and increased cirl bunting population size and territory density, though benefits were inconsistent for some species with only certain birds like Eurasian skylark and Eurasian linnet showing positive responses out of 23 and 12 species tested respectively (action 695). For spring sowing, nine studies from Denmark, Sweden and the UK found that spring-sown crops resulted in higher numbers of farmland birds compared to autumn-sown crops, with more bird species found on spring-sown cereals and population increases observed after spring sowing began (actions 137, 207). However, one study found hatching success was lower on spring-sown crops than autumn-sown crops for northern lapwings (action 207). The evidence suggests spring sowing may provide better overall bird diversity and abundance, while overwinter stubbles offer specific winter food and habitat benefits, particularly for certain seed-eating species.",

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes. In one trial, these introduced species more commonly occupied the boxes than native bees.\\nA small trial tested three soil-filled nest boxes for the mining bee Andrena flavipes in the UK, but they were not occupied.\"\n}"

Fifteen studies from the UK, Austria, Denmark, Finland and Switzerland found that undersowing spring cereals benefited birds, plants, insects, spiders and earthworms. Specific benefits included increases in barnacle goose abundance, densities of singing Eurasian skylark and nesting dunnock, arthropod abundance and species richness, and bumblebee, butterfly, earthworm, ground beetle, spider or springtail abundances. Two studies specifically on butterflies and moths found that undersown spring cereals had higher species richness and abundance of butterflies compared to extensively or conventionally managed grassland. Three studies found higher densities of some bird species on undersown fields, though not all species showed this preference. While five studies found that undersowing did not benefit certain species including grey partridge, invertebrates, or some farmland birds, the overall evidence demonstrates that undersowing spring cereals as an alternative to conventional ploughing provides substantial benefits to a wide range of farmland wildlife including birds, pollinators, and soil organisms.",

The same study found that heather moorland subject to a single controlled burn had more plant species eight years after management than control unburned plots (Action 152). This indicates that while swiping can increase plant diversity compared to no management, controlled burning may be more effective at promoting plant species richness than swiping in UK heather moorland management.\n\nEvidence also suggests that cutting to control bracken can increase the species richness of heathland plant species (Action 1653), though the effects may vary depending on the specific vegetation being managed. Overall, the available evidence suggests that controlled burning appears to be more effective than swiping for maximizing plant diversity in heather moorland management in the UK.",

Treatments tested included reducing grazing intensity and grouse moor management (burning and predator control).\\nFour studies (including one controlled site comparison and two reviews) found that reducing the intensity of livestock grazing reduced the abundance of soil organisms including invertebrates, bacteria or fungi. A randomized, replicated before-and-after study found that heather cover declined over nine years on a moorland site managed under the Environmentally Sensitive Areas scheme in which grazing intensity had increased.\"\n}"

However, two studies from Germany and the UK found that differences in vegetation between restored and existing species-rich grasslands persisted even nine or 60 years after restoration. For wet grassland restoration, studies found some positive effects within five years, but restoration was often incomplete even after extended periods. Three replicated studies from the Netherlands and Germany found restoration was not complete five, nine, or 20 years later, indicating that wet grassland restoration can be a particularly slow process.\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"133\",\n    \"3955\",\n    \"3929\",\n    \"119\",\n    \"3971\"\n  ]\n}"

Benefits include increased earthworm biomass and diversity (Action 126), higher species richness for some birds including Eurasian skylarks, earlier nesting and shorter foraging distances (Actions 126, 211), increased soil organic carbon and improved soil structure (Action 906), maintained or increased soil organic matter (Action 906), higher nutrient retention (Action 906), and reduced soil erosion and runoff (Action 906). Some studies found higher crop yields under reduced tillage for cereals, fruits, and vegetables (Action 1359).\n\nDrawbacks include inconsistent effects on invertebrate abundance and diversity with some groups declining (Action 126), variable weed management outcomes (Action 126), potential for increased soil compaction (Action 906), possible crop yield reductions in some comparisons (Actions 1355, 1358, 1359), lower straw yields in some cases (Action 1359), and reduced crop quality including lower protein content (Actions 1355, 1359). Several studies found no clear effects or mixed results on various wildlife groups, soil properties, and crop yields, indicating that outcomes are highly context-dependent and vary by specific conditions, crop types, and implementation methods.",

Six studies found birds showed preference for wild bird cover and used it significantly more than other habitats. One study specifically found higher small mammal activity in wild bird cover than in crops during winter, suggesting food resource availability.\n\nThe evidence indicates both interventions can be effective, with wild bird seed mixtures showing more consistent positive results across bird communities, while supplementary food effectiveness may be more species-specific and dependent on factors like population stability and habitat context.",

    "relevant_summary": "The evidence for the effectiveness of managing or planting new hedgerows to benefit wildlife on farmland shows mixed results across different taxa. For hedge management, ten studies from Switzerland and the UK found positive effects including increased berry yields, species diversity or richness of plants and invertebrates, and diversity or abundance of farmland birds (116). However, five studies from the UK found that hedge management did not affect plant species richness, numbers of bumblebee queens or farmland birds (116). Studies on butterflies and moths showed that hedgerows cut once every 2-3 years or cut to allow incremental growth had higher abundance of adult butterflies and moths compared to hedgerows cut annually (3975). Hedgerows with trees or more complex structure generally had higher species richness or diversity of butterflies and macro-moths than simpler hedgerows without trees (3975). For birds specifically, seven studies found that some species increased or were more likely to be found in managed hedges, while four studies found that some species declined or showed no response to wildlife-friendly management of hedges (177). For bats, one study found hedges trimmed \u22653 years prior had more bat species and higher activity of some species than recently trimmed hedges (1943). For small mammals, evidence from the UK showed that establishing hedgerows alongside arable land increased small mammal abundance (2383). However, there are significant gaps in evidence, with no studies found evaluating the effects on mammals of managing hedgerows to benefit wildlife on farmland (2382) and no studies found evaluating the effects of planting new hedges on bat populations (1942). Overall, the evidence suggests that hedgerow management can benefit wildlife but effects vary by species and management approach, with more complex, less frequently managed hedgerows generally providing greater benefits.",

For hedge management, ten studies from Switzerland and the UK found positive effects including increased berry yields, species diversity or richness of plants and invertebrates, and diversity or abundance of farmland birds (116). However, five studies from the UK found that hedge management did not affect plant species richness, numbers of bumblebee queens or farmland birds (116). Studies on butterflies and moths showed that hedgerows cut once every 2-3 years or cut to allow incremental growth had higher abundance of adult butterflies and moths compared to hedgerows cut annually (3975). Hedgerows with trees or more complex structure generally had higher species richness or diversity of butterflies and macro-moths than simpler hedgerows without trees (3975). For birds specifically, seven studies found that some species increased or were more likely to be found in managed hedges, while four studies found that some species declined or showed no response to wildlife-friendly management of hedges (177). For bats, one study found hedges trimmed \u22653 years prior had more bat species and higher activity of some species than recently trimmed hedges (1943). For small mammals, evidence from the UK showed that establishing hedgerows alongside arable land increased small mammal abundance (2383). However, there are significant gaps in evidence, with no studies found evaluating the effects on mammals of managing hedgerows to benefit wildlife on farmland (2382) and no studies found evaluating the effects of planting new hedges on bat populations (1942). Overall, the evidence suggests that hedgerow management can benefit wildlife but effects vary by species and management approach, with more complex, less frequently managed hedgerows generally providing greater benefits.\", \"action_ids\": [\"116\", \"3975\", \"2383\", \"177\", \"1943\", \"2382\", \"1942\", \"3519\"], \"query\": \"What is the extent of the evidence for the effectiveness of managing or planting new hedgerows to benefit wildlife on farmland?\"}",
