Rainfall simulation through wet/dry seasonal cycles stimulated breeding and egg deposition in studies from Germany and Austria, though survival rates varied (Action ID: 1872). Sound recordings of breeding calls proved effective, with Australian studies showing frogs only bred when recorded mating calls were played, and clutch sizes increased when combined with sex separation and mate choice (Action ID: 1881). However, no evidence was found for simulating rainfall using sound recordings of rain/thunderstorms (Action ID: 1867) or varying enclosure humidity through humidifiers/misters (Action ID: 1863). Overall, research demonstrates that temperature manipulation, artificial rainfall cycles, and breeding call recordings can successfully stimulate amphibian breeding in captivity when properly implemented.",

Taurine supplementation to animal-protein diets successfully increased plasma taurine levels in maned wolves, addressing this nutritional concern.

Cheetahs fed whole rabbits showed lower blood protein urea, zinc, and vitamin A levels compared to when they were fed supplemented beef, along with reduced inflammatory bowel indicators. Both maned wolves and cheetahs fed commercial diets showed mixed nutritional outcomes - maned wolves had similar dry matter intake despite lower protein content, and cheetahs had plasma a-tocopherol, retinol and taurine concentrations within recommended ranges for domestic cats, though they showed higher creatine levels compared to those fed horse meat.",

When a fishing cat was provided with live fish, hunting behavior increased and sleeping decreased (Action ID: 1925). However, the same study found no change in stereotypical behaviors in tigers when provided with live fish. For primates, a UK study found that when lorises were provided with live insect prey, inactivity reduced and foraging increased to levels seen in wild lorises (Action ID: 1333). In carnivores, a study found that provision of live prey increased explorative behaviors in fennec foxes compared to other types of enrichment (Action ID: 1926). Live prey provision as part of pre-release training showed that captive-bred black-footed ferrets fed on live prairie dogs took longer to disperse after release but showed greater subsequent movements than those not fed with live prey (Action ID: 2518). The provision of live natural prey also contributed to post-release survival, with rehabilitated Iberian lynx and captive-reared orphaned cheetahs and leopards surviving for periods ranging from three months to 19 months after release (Action ID: 2518).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, several effective interventions have been identified for stimulating breeding in Australian frog captive breeding programs. Hormone treatment has proven successful, with one review and nine of 10 replicated studies finding that hormone treatment of male amphibians stimulated or increased sperm production and resulted in successful breeding in captivity. For female amphibians, hormone treatment had mixed results with 30-71% of females producing viable eggs following treatment in various studies. Environmental simulation methods have also been effective, including playing recordings of breeding calls to simulate breeding season in the wild, which was found to both induce breeding and increase clutch size in Australian frogs. Providing natural substrates for species which do not breed in water has also promoted egg laying, along with adding enclosure furniture like rotting logs and hollow bamboo pipes. Additionally, simulated wet and dry seasons were found to be crucial for reproductive success, with one study showing captive frogs started breeding when housed in enclosures with simulated seasonal changes along with appropriate calling, perching and laying sites. Temperature control was identified as another important factor affecting reproductive success in captive frogs.",

Whole food presentation instead of processed foods increased feeding time and food consumption in macaques. Removing domestic fruits and formulating diets to match wild nutritional composition led to decreased regurgitation and reingestion in gorillas and reduced aggression and self-directed behaviors in lemurs. Fresh produce instead of pellet feed resulted in increased feeding time and reduced inactivity in rhesus macaques. Providing browse (cut branches) allowed captive gorillas to demonstrate the same food processing skills used by wild gorillas when handling stinging nettles. These modifications demonstrate that wild-type dietary changes can improve both behavioral patterns and species-typical feeding behaviors in captive primates.",

The provision of bones, hides or partial carcasses decreased stereotypic behaviors in lions and tigers, and increased activity and manipulation time in felids. Hiding food around the enclosure increased exploring and foraging behaviors while decreasing stereotypical pacing in leopard cats. Devices that simulate live prey, including sounds, lures, pulleys and bungees, increased activity levels and behavioral diversity in felids and decreased pacing behavior in cougars. Changing the location of food around the enclosure decreased pacing behaviors in cheetahs. While allocating fast days (feeding once every three days) was studied, it actually increased pacing frequency in large felids on non-feeding days.",

Temperature variation has shown some success, with one study finding breeding occurred after a temperature drop from 20-24\u00b0C to 17\u00b0C and filling of egg laying ponds (Action 1864). Another Australian study increased breeding success by providing a pre-breeding cooling period combined with weight gain for females, sex separation during non-breeding periods, mate choice, and recorded mating calls (Action 1864). Artificial rainfall simulation is particularly effective, with two replicated studies in Germany and Austria finding that simulating wet and dry seasons successfully stimulated breeding and egg deposition (Action 1872). Enclosure modifications also play a role, as an Austrian study found captive frogs began breeding when housed in enclosures with more calling, perching and laying sites along with simulated wet and dry seasons (Action 1876), while a Fiji study showed that adding rotting logs, hollow bamboo pipes and substrate variety promoted egg laying (Action 1876). Lighting variation is another option, though one UK study found UV boosts resulted in greater fungal loads without improving clutch size (Action 1865). Other potential actions include varying enclosure humidity using humidifiers, foggers or misters (Action 1863), allowing dormancy periods for species from highly seasonal environments (Action 1869), and permitting temperate amphibians to hibernate (Action 1868), though these lack current evidence for effectiveness.",

To address taurine deficiency, supplementing meat-based diets with amino acids like taurine effectively increased plasma taurine levels in maned wolves (Action ID: 1908). Commercially prepared diets were found to provide adequate nutrition with lower protein content while maintaining similar dry matter intake and digestibility (Action ID: 1900).\n\nFor food presentation, scattering food around the enclosure was particularly effective, increasing locomotion behavior and encouraging wolves to spend more time in areas with scattered food compared to food presented on trays (Action ID: 1921). Hiding food around the enclosure also proved beneficial, increasing exploring and foraging behaviors while reducing stereotypical pacing (Action ID: 1915). These food presentation methods simulate natural foraging behaviors and appear to significantly improve behavioral welfare indicators in captive maned wolves.",
