Timing of burns appears to have minimal effect on outcomes, with one study finding burn season did not affect the impacts of prescribed burning (action 318), though another found northern brown bandicoot survival declined less in forests burned early versus late in the dry season (action 2416).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"3877\",\n    \"877\",\n    \"318\",\n    \"317\",\n    \"2416\"\n  ]\n}"

Mechanical removal of understory vegetation (action ID 1256) showed mixed results - five studies found no effect on seedling emergence, survival, growth or frost damage, though one study found it increased seedling biomass, and another showed improved growth of black spruce when competing shrubs were removed. Ground cover methods include using plastic mats (action ID 1239), which one Canadian study found decreased cover of herbaceous plants and grasses, and alternative mulching techniques (action ID 1240), which one US study found increased total plant cover. Cutting or mowing vegetation (action ID 3713) has been studied primarily for reptile populations rather than tree establishment effects. Livestock grazing (action ID 3711) has shown some positive effects, with one study finding bog turtle reproductive success improved after grazing management. Mechanical removal of invasive plants (action ID 1228) showed varying results - one Hawaiian study found increased understory biomass after invasive grass removal, one Ghanaian study found increased tree seedling height after invasive weed removal, while other studies found no effects on native species growth or understory diversity.",

A review of programs in the USA and Canada (Action ID: 162) found that education alone was not sufficient to change behavior, although it served as a necessary catalytic factor for economic incentives and law enforcement. However, other studies showed more positive outcomes: awareness campaigns combined with other interventions increased amphibian pond creation in Estonia and the UK (Action ID: 831), and multimedia campaigns using theatre, film, print media, and discussions demonstrated effectiveness in multiple countries, with black howler monkey numbers increasing by 61-138% over 3-13 years in Belize (Action ID: 1571). Education programs targeting ranchers in South Africa successfully increased leopard density and reduced mortalities (Action ID: 2423). While specific evidence for forest conservation campaigns was notably absent from the documents searched, several studies found that awareness campaigns reached over 50,000 members of the public annually or trained over 1,000 people at conservation events, and one UK study reported increased purchase of peat-free compost following awareness-raising activities about peatlands (Action ID: 1844). However, multiple actions (IDs: 1718, 3864, 1717, 3847, 3389) specifically noted the absence of evaluation studies, indicating a significant gap in evidence for the effectiveness of education and awareness programs for various conservation contexts.",

Planting trees after wildfire is a common intervention, though no direct evidence was found for its effectiveness. Alternatively, sowing tree seeds after wildfire has shown limited success, with three USA studies finding it decreased native species and tree seedling density while having no effect on total plant cover. Removing burnt trees and branches after wildfire showed no significant effect on mammal populations compared to leaving branches in place. Prescribed fire can potentially aid restoration, with some studies showing increased butterfly species richness and abundance in restored coniferous forests. However, prescribed fire effects vary by species and context, with eight of 14 studies finding no effect on amphibian populations, while others showed mixed or positive effects depending on the species and timing.",

Organic matter amendments demonstrate several benefits including increased microbial biomass and activity (902), higher soil organic carbon levels (902), and increased soil nutrients (902). However, in wetland environments, high amounts of compost can negatively impact plant community composition by favoring species characteristic of drier conditions and reducing plant species richness and diversity (3310), though it can increase individual tree size (3310). Manure applications show mixed effects on tree survival and growth depending on species and dose (3311).\n\nLime applications reveal predominantly negative or neutral effects. Studies found lime application decreased pine seedling survival (1259), typically reduced survival of planted fen herbs (1825), and reduced growth rates for most peat swamp tree seedlings (1825). However, some studies found lime increased survival of planted fen mosses (1825) and vegetation cover in one study (1249).\n\nFertilizer applications show variable results.

For understory plants, five of ten studies found that logging increased density and cover, while four studies found no effect or mixed effects. Similarly, four of seven studies found logging increased species richness and diversity of understory plants, while three studies found no effect. However, logging negatively affects non-vascular plants, with two of three studies finding it decreased epiphytic plant abundance and fern fertility. For mature trees, three of seven studies found logging decreased tree density and cover, while two found it increased tree density. Three of six studies found logging increased tree size, while two found it decreased tree size. Two of four studies found logging decreased tree species richness and diversity. Logging also increased tree mortality rate according to one study. For young trees, one study found logging increased their density, while another found mixed effects. Studies on selective or reduced impact logging compared to conventional logging found it can help maintain butterfly and moth communities, with some studies showing similar species richness to primary forests and higher abundance of certain species.",

Excluding livestock from forest areas using wire fences has been shown to increase biomass, species richness, density, and cover of understory plants in four of eight studies, while three of four studies found increased size and density of regenerating trees and number of regenerating trees. Reducing grazing intensity in forests specifically increased the number of tree saplings and understory biomass according to studies in the UK and Greece. Ceasing livestock grazing in forest, open woodland, and savanna habitats showed mixed effects on reptile populations, with two of five studies finding higher abundance of reptiles and lizards in ungrazed areas, while other studies found similar abundances between grazed and ungrazed areas. Seasonal removal of livestock (shortening grazing periods) demonstrated benefits for butterflies and moths, with three controlled studies finding higher abundance of butterflies and caterpillars in grasslands where cattle or sheep were removed seasonally compared to year-round grazing. Reducing grazing intensity by lowering stocking density showed positive effects, with eight of eleven studies finding greater abundance of butterflies, moths, and their caterpillars at lower stocking densities. When livestock were excluded from semi-natural habitats including woodland, four of eight studies found higher abundances of mammals such as mule deer, small mammals, and European rabbits.",

Prescribed burning in forests showed varied effects on amphibians - most studies found no effect on abundance or species numbers, while some found mixed effects depending on species and timing, with a few showing increases or decreases. Mechanical vegetation removal increased amphibian species richness but not abundance, and improved butterfly diversity in cork oak woodlands. Thinning followed by prescribed fire had mixed effects on plant cover and tree density. Prescribed burning in deciduous forests showed little impact on bird species richness. However, several key interventions including thinning vegetation to prevent wildfires, building fire breaks, using fire prevention signs, adopting zero burning policies near peatlands, planting trees after wildfire, and raising water levels to prevent fires all lack evidence from direct evaluation studies.",

For legal protection, two site comparison studies found that legally protected forests had increased tree species richness, diversity, and density of young trees in Nigeria and Iran (Action ID: 1233). However, one study found no effect on seed density and diversity in Mexico. Community-based forest management showed positive outcomes, with two studies from Ethiopia and Nepal finding that forest cover increased more in community-managed forests compared to non-community managed forests (Action ID: 1152), though one study in Colombia found no difference in deforestation rates. Financial incentives for community forest management demonstrated varied results: a study in Belize showed a 138% increase in black howler monkey populations over 13 years when communities received monetary benefits (Action ID: 1509), while a study across Rwanda, Uganda, and Democratic Republic of Congo found a 28% decline in mountain gorillas over 41 years despite community development projects. Public engagement through awareness campaigns showed some positive impacts, including increased amphibian pond creation in Estonia and the UK, and successfully reached 50,000+ people annually in some programs (Action ID: 831), though one study found no effect on a green tree frog project in Taiwan. Community engagement in conservation activities demonstrated positive outcomes for reptile populations, including reduced poaching of turtle eggs in Mozambique and Costa Rica, and fewer crocodile killings in the Philippines (Action ID: 3681). However, several actions lacked sufficient evidence, including legal protection from development (Action ID: 1169) and forest certification programs (Action ID: 1500).",
