    "relevant_summary": "Based on European farm studies, reduced tillage systems show several documented benefits and harms. Benefits include: increased soil organic matter and organic carbon content, enhanced microbial biomass and earthworm populations, improved soil aggregation and water stability, reduced soil erosion and runoff, and increased nutrient retention (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium). Some studies found higher crop yields for cereals and legumes under reduced tillage. Positive biodiversity effects included increased farmland bird populations like Eurasian skylarks, and greater weed species diversity.\n\nHowever, harms and challenges were also documented: higher soil compaction was found in some studies, potential yield reductions for certain crops (particularly fruits and vegetables), inconsistent effects on earthworm abundance over time, and variable results for different invertebrate groups. Some studies found reduced soil water content and decreased soil crack size, while others showed mixed effects on greenhouse gas emissions (both increased and decreased carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide levels). The effectiveness varied depending on soil type, climate conditions, and specific implementation methods.",

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done. One randomized, replicated study from Portugal found no effect of tillage treatment on yield.\\n\\u00a0\\nSOIL TYPES COVERED: anthrosol, calcareous silt loam, chalky, clay, clay loam, fine sandy loam, loam, loamy-clay, loam - sandy loam, loam \\u2013 silt-loam, loamy sand, loamy silt, non-chalky clay, sandy, sandy clay loam, sandy loam, sandy silt-loam, silt loam, silty, silty-clay, silty clay loam, silty loam.\"\n}"

Thirty-four studies (of which 21 were replicated and controlled and seven also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found some positive effects on earthworms, some invertebrates (other than earthworms), weeds or farmland birds, of reducing tillage compared to conventional management. Positive effects included increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms, greater abundance of some invertebrates other than earthworms, increased numbers of some weeds and/or weed species, higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying date and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields, and greater abundance of some birds - including Eurasian skylark, seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in late winter on non-inversion or conservation tillage. A review found tillage had negative effects on invertebrate numbers and no-till systems had more invertebrate bird food resources.\\nTwenty-six studies (of which 13 replicated and controlled and three also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found reducing tillage had either negative, no effect or no consistent effects on abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates (other than earthworms), earthworm abundance, biomass, or species richness, number of different plant species found as seeds, number of some weed species, mammal abundance, some bird species, and one study found bird preferences for conservation tillage fields decreased over time. Two studies found that crop type affected the number of weeds under different tillage regimes.\\nOne small replicated trial in the UK compared bird numbers under two different forms of reduced tillage, and found more birds from species that make up the \\u2018Farmland Bird Index\\u2019 on broadcast than non-inversion tillage fields.\\nTwo studies looked at the long-term effects of reduced tillage on earthworms (after ten years). One study found higher earthworm biomass under reduced tillage, the other study found earthworm abundance was the same between conventional and reduced tillage plots.\\nThree of the studies mentioned above did not distinguish between the effects of reducing tillage and reduced pesticide and/or fertilizer inputs.\"\n}"

One study from Germany found no effect on soil organic matter levels.\n\nFor cover crops in empty fields/arable fields (Actions 1357, 1394, 1351): Water-related effects were mixed - some studies found cover crops used more water than bare fallows while others found no difference. Most studies found reduced water loss through drainage, runoff, or evaporation, but some found increased water loss. Pest regulation showed fewer weeds in most studies, though results were inconsistent. Crop yields were highly variable with some studies showing lower yields, some higher yields, and many showing inconsistent differences. Crop damage results were mixed with some studies showing less disease and others showing no difference.\n\nThe key difference appears to be that cover crops between rows may have less competition effects with the main crop since they are grown simultaneously, while cover crops in empty fields are primarily used during fallow periods and their effects on subsequent crops are more variable.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on evidence from European studies, different tillage practices on sandy loam soils show varying benefits and drawbacks. Reduced tillage systems consistently demonstrate benefits including increased soil organic carbon and organic matter content compared to conventionally tilled soils (action 906, 1371). Multiple replicated studies across Europe found that reduced tillage led to higher microbial biomass, improved soil structure, and enhanced water infiltration rates in some comparisons (action 1371, 1386). The soil aggregation was improved with higher water-stability under reduced tillage in certain conditions (action 1371). Water management benefits include improved water-use efficiency and higher soil water content in some European studies, though results were mixed with some studies finding similar or lower water content compared to conventional tillage (action 1386).\n\nHowever, reduced tillage also presents drawbacks. Several European studies found higher soil compaction under reduced tillage systems (action 906). Crop yields showed mixed results - while some studies found higher yields with reduced tillage for certain crops like cereals and oilseeds, others found lower yields, particularly for legumes (action 1359, 1355). Some studies reported reduced soil crack size and improved water absorption with conventional ploughing compared to reduced tillage, particularly during drought conditions (action 906). Greenhouse gas emissions showed inconsistent patterns, with some studies finding increased carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions under reduced tillage while others found decreases or no differences (action 1371).\n\nThe evidence indicates that fine sandy loam soils respond differently to tillage practices depending on specific management conditions, climate, and crop types. While reduced tillage generally improves soil biological activity and organic matter retention, conventional tillage may provide benefits for water management and compaction reduction in certain European conditions.",

Additionally, general evidence on crop rotations (Action 1368) indicates mixed effects on soil nitrogen, with some studies finding more nitrogen in rotated soils compared to continuous crops, while others found less nitrogen or similar amounts. However, this broader rotation evidence does not specifically focus on grass or pasture incorporation. No specific evidence was found regarding effects on phosphorus, potassium, or other soil nutrients from incorporating grass or pasture into arable systems.",

A replicated study from Denmark showed that reducing the extent of grass pasture in leys reduced undesirable nitrogen uptake by grasses, requiring lower fertilizer rates for subsequent crops (action 900). Creating rotational grass or clover leys resulted in higher spider abundance and fewer pest insects compared to barley control plots in Finland, while UK studies found that one-year leys had lower earthworm species richness than longer three-and-a-half-year leys (action 643). Restoring arable land to permanent grassland showed positive effects on butterflies and moths, with multiple European studies demonstrating increased species richness and abundance compared to cultivated fields or conventional grasslands (action 3929). Planting grass buffer strips around arable fields also enhanced biodiversity, with studies showing increased species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths compared to cropped field edges (action 3982). However, reverting arable land to grassland showed no clear benefit to birds, with UK and Danish studies finding grey partridge and wading bird numbers did not improve (action 210).",

Research demonstrates that nitrification inhibitors can reduce nitrate losses and nitrous oxide emissions from UK soils (action 909). Timing of manure application is critical, with a controlled, randomized, replicated site comparison study from the UK finding that delaying manure application from autumn to December or January resulted in less nitrate loss from sandy-loam soils (action 893). Studies comparing organic versus mineral fertilizers show mixed results, with some UK research indicating that organic fertilizers support higher plant diversity and earthworm populations without necessarily affecting weed species abundance (action 134). When manure is applied, the type and timing matter significantly - UK studies found that farmyard manure applied in winter rather than autumn resulted in lower nutrient loss (action 911). Additionally, incorporating straw into UK soils has been shown to reduce nitrate leaching while increasing soil nitrogen levels (action 910). The evidence consistently shows that management decisions around soil amendments, particularly timing and type of application, are crucial for minimizing nutrient loss from UK agricultural soils.",

Studies comparing organic versus mineral fertilizers show mixed results, with some UK research indicating that organic fertilizers support higher plant diversity and earthworm populations without necessarily affecting weed species abundance (action 134). When manure is applied, the type and timing matter significantly - UK studies found that farmyard manure applied in winter rather than autumn resulted in lower nutrient loss (action 911).

Two additional meta-analyses of studies from Mediterranean climates also found more organic matter in plots with ground cover in orchards/vineyards (action 1367). For living mulches between crop rows, two controlled trials from India and South Africa (one also randomized and replicated) found that soil organic matter increased under cover crops, while one trial from Germany found no effect on soil organic matter levels (action 897).

Additionally, crop rotation can increase crop yields in some years or with certain rotation crops, with three out of five Canadian studies showing yield increases (Action 719), and can increase profit according to one study (Action 719). Crop rotation also resulted in fewer insecticide treatments being needed (Action 719). However, there are some documented drawbacks: pest populations can increase in some cases depending on rotation crops used (Action 719), yields can decrease depending on rotation crops used (Action 719), and some studies found lower soil organic matter levels when longer crop rotations were used (Action 857).

One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage.

One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate.

Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done. One randomized, replicated study from Portugal found no effect of tillage treatment on yield.\\n\\u00a0\\nSOIL TYPES COVERED: anthrosol, calcareous silt loam, chalky, clay, clay loam, fine sandy loam, loam, loamy-clay, loam - sandy loam, loam \\u2013 silt-loam, loamy sand, loamy silt, non-chalky clay, sandy, sandy clay loam, sandy loam, sandy silt-loam, silt loam, silty, silty-clay, silty clay loam, silty loam.\"\n}"

Municipal compost greatly reduced soil loss and water runoff in semi-arid soils (action 890), with studies showing less water loss as runoff from soils with added compost (action 1377). However, compost addition also resulted in more nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in runoff, and more organic matter in runoff compared to soils without compost (action 1377). \n\nOrganic processing wastes showed mixed effects: high rates of cotton gin compost and poultry manure improved soil structure and reduced soil loss but increased nutrient loss (action 891). When molasses were added to organic processing wastes, studies found improved nutrient retention and increased barley yield (action 891). \n\nBoth amendment types were tested on similar soil types including sandy loam and clay-textured soils. The evidence suggests municipal composts are particularly effective for erosion control and water retention in semi-arid conditions, while organic processing wastes can improve soil structure and crop yields but may increase nutrient leaching depending on application rates.",

Hedgerows managed for wildlife benefit (with less frequent cutting, gap-filling, and restricted spraying) showed mixed results for butterflies and moths - some studies found higher abundance and species richness, while others found similar diversity compared to conventionally managed hedgerows. Hedgerows with more complex structures (including trees) generally supported more butterfly and moth species than simple hedgerows. Windbreaks showed mixed effects on birds, with one study showing increased European nightjar populations, while another found that windbreaks disrupted greater prairie chicken lekking behavior. For crop production, one study found that crop yields were similar in fields with hedgerows compared to fields with bare/weedy edges.

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage.

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done. One randomized, replicated study from Portugal found no effect of tillage treatment on yield.\\n\\u00a0\\nSOIL TYPES COVERED: anthrosol, calcareous silt loam, chalky, clay, clay loam, fine sandy loam, loam, loamy-clay, loam - sandy loam, loam \\u2013 silt-loam, loamy sand, loamy silt, non-chalky clay, sandy, sandy clay loam, sandy loam, sandy silt-loam, silt loam, silty, silty-clay, silty clay loam, silty loam.\"\n}"
