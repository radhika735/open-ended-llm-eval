In terms of design, bats were found to use black bat boxes more than grey, white, or wooden ones, and larger bat boxes had higher occupancy rates (1024). One study found that more bats occupied boxes with two compartments than one during the breeding season (1024). While one study found that resin bat boxes were occupied more quickly than wood boxes, another found that bats used both (1024). Concrete bat boxes had higher occupancy rates than wooden ones in one UK study, and in the USA, Indiana bats used rocket boxes more than wooden bat boxes or bark-mimic roosts (1024). Different bat box designs may be used by different species (1024). When it comes to placement, bat box orientation and the amount of sun exposure can affect occupancy, although one study found orientation did not have a significant effect (1024). The height of the box has also been shown to affect occupancy in some studies but not others (1024). Bat boxes on buildings had higher occupancy than those on trees (1024). Higher occupancy rates were found in farm forestry sites compared to native forest and in pine stands versus mixed deciduous stands (1024). Occupancy rates were also higher in areas where bats were already known to roost (1024). Furthermore, the more bat boxes that were installed across a site, the more likely they were to be occupied (1024). However, in cases where roosts were destroyed, newly built bat boxes or lofts were four times less likely to be used by returning bats than roosts that were retained during development (949). In two studies, bats did not use any of the alternative roosts provided after being excluded from buildings (949).",

In terms of design, bats were found to use black bat boxes more than grey, white, or wooden ones, and larger bat boxes had higher occupancy rates (1024). One study found that more bats occupied boxes with two compartments than one during the breeding season (1024). While one study found that resin bat boxes were occupied more quickly than wood boxes, another found that bats used both (1024). Concrete bat boxes had higher occupancy rates than wooden ones in one UK study, and in the USA, Indiana bats used rocket boxes more than wooden bat boxes or bark-mimic roosts (1024). Different bat box designs may be used by different species (1024). When it comes to placement, bat box orientation and the amount of sun exposure can affect occupancy, although one study found orientation did not have a significant effect (1024). The height of the box has also been shown to affect occupancy in some studies but not others (1024). Bat boxes on buildings had higher occupancy than those on trees (1024). Higher occupancy rates were found in farm forestry sites compared to native forest and in pine stands versus mixed deciduous stands (1024). Occupancy rates were also higher in areas where bats were already known to roost (1024). Furthermore, the more bat boxes that were installed across a site, the more likely they were to be occupied (1024). However, in cases where roosts were destroyed, newly built bat boxes or lofts were four times less likely to be used by returning bats than roosts that were retained during development (949).
