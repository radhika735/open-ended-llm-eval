Three of these studies indicated an increase in the number of natural enemies in plots with such plants, and one lab study confirmed the specific plant's attractiveness to natural enemies [724]. A single study found no impact on parasitism, but the plant in question was found to be unattractive to natural enemies in lab tests [724]. All four studies observed a reduction in either pest populations or pest-related damage in plots with these non-crop plants [724]. Additionally, one replicated, randomized, controlled study reported an increase in crop yield [724]. The crops involved in these studies were lettuce, orange, safflower, and sorghum [724]. For the use of manufactured chemicals to attract natural enemies, one review and two of five studies found that these chemicals led to increased parasitism [754]. Two studies showed greater parasitism for some but not all chemicals, crops, sites, or years, and one study found no effect [754]. One study indicated that parasites located pests more quickly, while another found lower egg predation by natural predators [754]. Five of thirteen studies reported an increase in natural enemies, while eight found that positive effects varied between enemy groups, sites, or study dates [754]. Four of thirteen studies found more natural enemies with some but not all test chemicals [754]. Two of four studies showed that higher chemical doses attracted more enemies, but one study found lower doses to be more effective, and one found no effect [754]. Three of nine studies noted fewer pests, two found an increase in pests, and four found no effect [754]. In terms of crop damage, one study found reduced damage with some chemicals but not others, and another study found no effect [754]. One study reported higher wheat yields [754].

    "relevant_summary": "Several studies have documented the financial impacts of various natural pest control strategies, primarily focusing on crop yield. The use of crop rotations has been found to result in higher crop yields in some instances when compared to monocultures (1354). Similarly, adding compost to the soil has led to higher crop yields in some comparisons (1346), and in one case, fewer dead tomato plants (1392). The addition of pig slurry to the soil has also been associated with higher crop yields in some studies (1349).\n\nThe effects of other strategies have been more varied. For example, while planting flowers has been shown to increase crop yields in certain situations (1360) and lead to greater pest reduction (1400), it has also been linked to increased pest numbers and crop damage in other cases (1400), and smaller lettuces in one study (1360). The use of organic fertilizer has an inconsistent effect on yields, with some studies reporting higher, lower, or similar yields compared to inorganic fertilizers (1350).\n\nDifferent tillage practices also show mixed results. Reduced tillage has been found to lead to higher, lower, or similar yields depending on the type of crop (1359). Similarly, studies on no-tillage systems have reported a range of outcomes, with yields being higher, lower, or the same as conventional tillage depending on the specific circumstances (1355, 1358).\n\nThe use of ground cover has also shown variable results. While allowing natural ground cover to regenerate can have mixed effects on pest populations (720), planting or maintaining ground cover in orchards and vineyards has been found to decrease grape and avocado yields in some studies, while increasing chestnut and mushroom yields in others (1352). Furthermore, growing cover crops in arable fields has been found to result in lower, inconsistent, or no difference in cash crop yields in a number of studies (1351).",
