General tree logging/removal within forests showed mixed but positive results, with four of seven studies finding that logging trees increased species richness and diversity of understory plants, while three studies found no effect (Action ID: 1273).

Effects on young trees are more variable, with five of 15 studies finding increased density and biomass, two finding decreased density, and eight showing no effect or mixed effects depending on tree species, location and fire frequency (action 1220). For understory vegetation, prescribed fire shows both benefits and negative impacts - eight of 22 studies found increased cover, density and biomass while six found decreased plant cover (action 1221). However, understory plant diversity generally benefits, with 14 of 24 studies finding increased species richness and diversity, while only one found decreased richness (action 1221). Wildlife effects are also mixed - for amphibians, eight of 14 studies found no effect on abundance or species numbers, while four found mixed effects and three found increased abundance (action 877).

This approach also increased the density of young trees in France (Action 1274). Cutting and mowing can be used to control problematic herbaceous plants, though effectiveness varies - studies in fens showed mixed effects on vegetation cover, with some increasing characteristic plant species but having variable impacts on overall plant community composition (Action 1770).\n\n**Physical barriers and ground covering:** Covering the ground with plastic mats after restoration planting decreased the cover of herbaceous plants and grasses in Canada (Action 1239). However, weed mats showed no effect on seedling height in Hong Kong (Action 1267). Covering the ground with mulch after planting increased total plant cover in the USA (Action 1240).\n\n**Manual weeding:** Weeding can be used to promote regeneration of indigenous tree communities, though no quantitative evidence was found for its effectiveness (Action 1588).\n\n**Mid-storey vegetation removal:** Removing mid-storey vegetation in forest increased both mammal species richness and abundance in the USA (Action 2480).\n\nThe evidence shows that mechanical disturbance combined with vegetation removal appears most effective for promoting tree establishment, while ground covering methods have variable results depending on the specific technique used.",

    "relevant_summary": "The evidence on the effectiveness of different methods to control invasive plant species in forests is limited and shows mixed results. Herbicide control has shown no effect on native plant species richness according to replicated, randomized, controlled studies in the USA (actions 1229, 1314). Mechanical/manual removal methods have produced varying outcomes: removal of invasive grass species increased understory plant biomass in Hawaii, but had no effect on understory plant diversity in the USA. Invasive weed removal increased tree seedling height in Ghana, but showed no effect on growth rate of native species in Hawaii (action 1228). For manual control or removal of midstorey and ground-level vegetation in forests, evidence from multiple studies shows mixed results on bird species richness and densities, with some studies finding higher species richness and others finding similar or lower numbers compared to control areas (action 335). Prescribed burning for invasive species control has been studied for specific species like lantana, where burning made plants smaller and less abundant compared to unburned areas in Australia, and resulted in fewer new shoots compared to cutting in India (action 912). However, burning also increased seed germination rates for lantana when seeds were exposed to smoke. Evidence for biological control using herbivores is lacking, with no studies found testing this approach (action 1277). The overall evidence base is limited with most studies being single investigations in specific locations, making it difficult to draw general conclusions about the most effective control methods.",

Action 1157 states there is no evidence found for the effect of raising awareness amongst the general public through campaigns and public information on forests specifically. However, evidence from related conservation contexts provides some insights. Action 162 indicates that a review of programmes in the USA and Canada argues that education was not sufficient to change behaviour on its own, although it was necessary as a catalytic factor for economic incentives and law enforcement. Action 274 found that five out of six studies from across the world showed increases in bird populations or decreases in mortality following education programmes, with one study from Canada also finding a significant shift in local peoples' attitudes to conservation following educational programmes. Action 1571 provides evidence that multimedia campaigns using theatre, film, print media and discussions showed positive results, with studies in Belize finding black howler monkey numbers increased by 61-138% over 3-13 years after multimedia campaigns alongside other interventions, and studies in Brazil and Colombia finding that education programs improved attitudes towards and knowledge about species. Action 3681 found that community engagement in conservation activities showed positive results for reptile populations across six studies, with communities participating in monitoring and protection leading to reduced poaching and improved conservation outcomes. Action 1844 reported that following awareness-raising activities, the percentage of the public buying peat-free compost increased, demonstrating behaviour change from public awareness campaigns.",

For wire fencing, the evidence is more extensive: five of ten studies in Australia, Bhutan, Canada, France, Portugal and the USA found that using wire fencing to exclude large herbivores increased the cover and size of understory plants, while six studies found no effect on cover, seed density, species richness or diversity of understory plants (Action 1230). Regarding effects on young trees specifically, wire fencing showed mixed results - one study found it increased biomass, one found it decreased the density of young trees, and one found mixed effects depending on the species (Action 1230). Two replicated, controlled studies in the USA found that using wire fencing to exclude large herbivores increased tree density (Action 1230). Additional research on non-electric fencing found that a high woven wire fence with small mesh, an overhang and an apron was the most effective design at deterring crossings by coyotes (Action 2415). The evidence base for electric fencing appears more limited compared to wire fencing, with only one study identified specifically evaluating electric fencing effectiveness against large native herbivores.",

Sowing tree seeds after wildfire has been studied, though three studies found it decreased the number and cover of native species and tree seedling density, with no effect on total plant cover or species richness (Action 1236). Tree thinning after wildfire shows more positive results, with five studies indicating it can increase plant species richness and aspen sapling cover, though it may decrease plant biomass in some cases and can decrease pine seedling mortality (Action 1234). Prescribed fire after tree planting can be beneficial, with two studies showing it increased survival and sprouting rates of planted trees, though one study found it decreased planted tree size (Action 1255). Post-fire tree removal interventions include removing burned trees, which increased total plant species richness and cover of some plant species according to studies in Israel and Spain (Action 1237). Removing burnt trees and branches after wildfire was also evaluated, though one study in Spain found no significant effect on European wild rabbit numbers (Action 2478). Vegetation management approaches include removing mid-storey vegetation in forests, which increased mammal species richness and abundance (Action 2480), and removing trees and shrubs to recreate open areas, which increased rodent abundances and Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep habitat use (Action 2483). Additional supportive measures include retaining or increasing leaf litter or mulch, which increased reptile species richness and abundance (Action 3525), and leaving standing deadwood snags in forests, though studies showed mixed effects on reptile diversity and abundance (Action 3631).",

Additional supportive measures include retaining or increasing leaf litter or mulch, which increased reptile species richness and abundance (Action 3525), and leaving standing deadwood snags in forests, though studies showed mixed effects on reptile diversity and abundance (Action 3631).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"1236\",\n    \"1234\",\n    \"1255\",\n    \"1237\",\n    \"2478\",\n    \"2480\",\n    \"2483\",\n    \"3525\",\n    \"3631\"\n  ]\n}"

Organic matter amendments have demonstrated varied effects: in brackish/saline wetlands, adding manure to plots planted with tree seedlings had mixed effects on survival and growth over three years, depending on the tree species and manure dose (Action 3311). In freshwater wetlands, large amounts of compost amendment resulted in larger birch saplings three years after planting, but also led to plant communities characteristic of drier conditions and reduced plant species richness and diversity compared to unamended plots (Action 3310). Lime amendments showed potential negative effects, with one study finding that adding lime before restoration planting decreased the survival of pine seedlings, while another found no effect on oak seedling growth (Action 1259). Fertilizer applications after tree planting produced mixed outcomes: two studies found increased tree size, while one study found mixed effects on seedling survival and height, and three studies found no effect on tree size, survival rate, or health (Action 1260). Soil enhancers including fertilizer had mixed effects on seedling survival and height in one study, while combinations of soil enhancers did not increase seedling survival, height, diameter, or health in another (Actions 1153, 1260). Mixed organic and inorganic amendments showed benefits for soil properties including higher microbial biomass and activity, increased organic carbon content, and improved erosion control through reduced soil cracking (Action 902).",

    "relevant_summary": "Evidence for the effectiveness of community-based forest management comes from studies conducted in several regions worldwide. Two studies from Ethiopia and Nepal (including one replicated, before-and-after, site comparison) found that forest cover increased more in community-managed forests than in forests not managed by local communities (action 1152). However, one replicated, site comparison study in Colombia found that deforestation rates in community-managed forests did not differ from deforestation rates in forests that were not managed by local communities, or in uninhabited national parks (action 1152). Additional evidence shows monetary benefits provided to local communities for forest management had mixed results: one before-and-after study in Belize found that numbers of black howler monkeys increased by 138% over 13 years after local communities received monetary benefits alongside other interventions (action 1509), and one before-and-after study in the Republic of Congo found that most central chimpanzees reintroduced to an area where local communities received monetary benefits alongside other interventions survived over five years (action 1509). However, one before-and-after study in Rwanda, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo found that numbers of mountain gorillas declined by 28% over 41 years despite the implementation of development projects in nearby communities alongside other interventions (action 1509). Community engagement in conservation activities has shown some effectiveness, with one site comparison study in Brazil finding that areas where community-based management of fishing practices was implemented had a higher abundance of river turtles than areas with no community-based management (action 3681).",

Five of ten studies found that logging increased the density and cover of understory plants, while four of seven studies found it increased species richness and diversity of understory plants (Action 1273).\n\n**Mature Trees:** Logging has mixed effects on mature trees. Three of seven studies found logging decreased tree density and cover, while two found it increased tree density and two found no effect. For tree size, three of six studies found logging increased tree size, while two found it decreased size. Tree species diversity was negatively impacted, with two of four studies finding decreased species richness and diversity (Action 1271).\n\n**Young Trees:** Limited evidence shows logging can increase young tree density, with one study finding increased density and another showing mixed effects (Action 1272).\n\n**Non-vascular Plants:** Logging negatively impacts non-vascular plants, with two of three studies finding decreased epiphytic plant abundance and fern fertility (Action 1270).\n\n**Wildlife:** Selective logging practices show some benefits for wildlife. Studies found that primate densities were higher in low-intensity logged forests compared to high-intensity logged areas, and lemur numbers increased following selective logging (Action 1485). For insects, selective logging forests showed similar or higher butterfly species richness and abundance compared to primary forests, and higher moth caterpillar abundance than clearcut areas (Action 3867). Wildlife corridors retained in logged areas supported seven species of arboreal marsupials (Action 2651).\n\n**Regeneration:** Re-planting native trees after logging resulted in similar species richness but lower diversity compared to naturally regenerating secondary forest (Action 3874).",

However, several individual studies from both regions provide insights into different approaches and their effectiveness.\n\nEuropean studies show varied results for soil improvement techniques. In Finland, soil disturbance decreased understory vegetation cover (Action ID: 1252). In Sweden, tilling showed mixed effects on different tree species (Action ID: 1251). French studies found that vegetation removal combined with mechanical soil disturbance increased understory plant cover, diversity, and young tree density (Action ID: 1274). A Portugal study found that ploughing increased understory plant cover and diversity (Action ID: 1251). In Portugal, applying fertilizer after planting increased planted tree size (Action ID: 1260), while French studies found no effect of fertilizer on tree size, survival rate, or health (Action ID: 1260). Swedish studies showed that ground preparation treatments increased planted tree survival and growth rates (Action ID: 1263).\n\nUSA studies present different findings. Ploughing increased understory plant cover and diversity (Action ID: 1251), but did not decrease invasive grass seedling spreading distance and density (Action ID: 1251). Canadian studies (included with North American context) found that ploughing had mixed effects on young tree density, with some studies showing increases and others showing decreases (Action ID: 1251). Canadian studies also found that applying fertilizer after planting increased planted tree size (Action ID: 1260) and that ground preparation treatments increased planted tree survival and growth rates (Action ID: 1263).\n\nThe documents do not provide systematic comparisons between European and USA approaches, and most studies focus on individual techniques rather than comprehensive effectiveness assessments across regions.",

Shelterwood harvesting increased abundance, species richness and diversity of understory plants, as well as growth and survival rate of young trees according to six of seven studies (action 1223). Group-selection harvesting had mixed effects on forest plants - four of eight studies found it increased cover and diversity of understory plants and density of young trees, while two studies found it decreased understory species richness and biomass (action 1224). Selective or reduced impact logging showed variable outcomes - logging trees in forests increased density and cover of understory plants in five of ten studies, while five studies found no effect or mixed effects (action 1273). Four of seven studies found that logging trees in forests increased species richness and diversity of understory plants (action 1273). For comparison, clearcutting itself increased cover and species richness of understory plants in eight of 12 studies, while two studies found it decreased density and species richness of understory plants (action 1222). Thinning as an alternative showed that forest species richness of moths was higher after thinning than after clearcutting and was similar to unharvested forest (action 3868).",

For prescribed burning, which is the most studied intervention, eight of 14 studies found no effect on amphibian abundance or species numbers, while four found mixed effects and three found increased abundance or species numbers (action 877). Prescribed fire effects on understory plants showed mixed results: eight of 22 studies found increased cover/density/biomass while six found decreases, and fourteen of 24 studies found increased species richness/diversity while nine found no effect or mixed effects (action 1221). Prescribed burning on deciduous forests showed minimal evidence with one study finding similar bird species richness in burned versus unburned areas and mixed results for specific species (action 317). For mechanical vegetation removal interventions, three studies found that mechanically removing understorey vegetation did not increase mammal abundances compared to prescribed burning (action 2482), while removing mid-storey vegetation increased mammal species richness and abundance in one study (action 2480). Creating fire breaks mechanically showed that areas with more recent/regular clearance had greater butterfly species richness and abundance (action 3881), and fire suppression combined with predator exclusion increased reptile abundance over time (action 3658).

A literature review reported that a large number of cranes of seven species used nature reserves in China, whilst a replicated, randomised and controlled study from Argentina found that some guilds of birds were found at higher species richnesses in protected forests.\n\nAdopting protected species legislation (Action ID 1201): No evidence was found of the effects of adopting protected species legislation on forests.\n\nDesignating protected areas (Action ID 3384): Four studies evaluated the overall effects of designating protected areas involving marshes or swamps. Two studies in China reported that the area of marsh, swamp or unspecified wetland in protected areas declined over 6-12 years. One study in Puerto Rico reported that protection had no clear effect on mangrove forest area. One study of a mangrove forest in Malaysia reported that it retained at least 97% of its forest area over 98 years of protection as a forest reserve.\n\nEnforcing existing legislation for habitat protection (Action ID 2916): No specific evidence was found regarding enforcement of existing legislation for habitat protection.",
