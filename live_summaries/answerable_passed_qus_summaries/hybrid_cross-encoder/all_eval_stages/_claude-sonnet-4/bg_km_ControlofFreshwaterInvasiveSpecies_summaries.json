    "relevant_summary": "Chemical herbicide methods show variable effectiveness for controlling Crassula helmsii. Glyphosate reduced C. helmsii in seven studies, with one study showing a 98% reduction when glyphosate was combined with diquat (Action 1279). When glyphosate was applied after covering plants with carpet, it resulted in an 80% reduction (Action 1279, 1313). Three out of four studies found that diquat or diquat alginate reduced cover or eradicated submerged C. helmsii, though one small trial found no effect (Action 1279). Other herbicides showed partial effectiveness: dichlobenil led to partial biomass reduction in one out of two studies, while terbutryne partially reduced biomass of submerged plants (Action 1279). Hydrogen peroxide did not control C. helmsii in controlled tank trials (Action 1281).\n\nPhysical methods using lightproof barriers demonstrated strong effectiveness. Five before-and-after studies found that covering C. helmsii with black sheeting or carpet strips eradicated or severely reduced plant cover, though progressive recolonization occurred at two sites where eradication was initially reported (Action 1294). Aquatic dyes to reduce light levels did not reduce C. helmsii coverage (Action 1293).\n\nSalt water treatment showed consistent effectiveness, with two replicated controlled container trials and two before-and-after field trials finding that seawater eradicated C. helmsii (Action 1288).",

Direct removal of juveniles using double fyke nets was found to be effective in catching bullfrog tadpoles in small shallow ponds (action 1046). One study found that removal of juveniles by trapping resulted in a significant reduction in the number of recorded adults and juveniles when carried out as part of a combination treatment (action 1046). For adult removal, one study found that adult bullfrogs can be captured overnight using a single trap floating on the water surface (action 1045), however catchability of adult bullfrogs in small shallow ponds using double fyke nets for 24 hours was found to be very low (action 1045). One study found that bullfrog populations rapidly rebounded following intensive removal of adults (action 1045), though shooting of metamorphosed individuals before reproduction resulted in a significant reduction in adults and juveniles when part of a combination treatment (action 1045). General bullfrog removal and control has been shown to benefit native amphibian populations, with studies finding that removing American bullfrogs significantly increased California red-legged frog populations and increased the range of leopard frogs (action 825). No evidence was found for the effectiveness of pond destruction, draining ponds/altering water timing, or habitat modification as control methods for American bullfrogs (actions 1042, 1043, 1041).",

A replicated, controlled laboratory study in Canada found 100% mortality of round gobies within 48 hours of exposure to water of 30% salinity (Action 1072). A controlled, replicated field study in the USA found that an electrical barrier prevented movement of round gobies across it, and that increasing electrical pulse duration and voltage increased effectiveness of the barrier (Action 1074).

Creating barriers using concrete dams across streams with features designed to prevent red swamp crayfish from crawling over them was found to be effective at containing spread of the population upstream in a study conducted in Spain between 2007 and 2010 (Action 1037). Trapping and removal methods show promise, with a study in Italy finding that baiting traps with food (tinned meat) trapped the most red swamp crayfish compared to using male and female pheromones or no bait, with over half of all crayfish caught found in food-baited traps (Action 1029). Chemical control methods have been tested, with one study in Italy finding that red swamp crayfish could be killed using the natural pyrethrum Pyblast at a concentration of 0.05 mg/l, though application to drained crayfish burrows was not effective (Action 1036). Biological control through encouraging predators is another option, with studies showing that eels fed on red swamp crayfish and reduced population size, and pike were found to predate red swamp crayfish in studies from Italy and France (Action 1030). Male sterilization using X-rays was found to reduce the number of offspring produced by 43% in a laboratory study in Italy (Action 1032). Several other potential control methods including draining waterways, electrofishing, removing food sources, and relocating vulnerable native crayfish species currently have no evidence for their effectiveness against Procambarus crayfish populations (Actions 1034, 1035, 1033, 1038, 797).",

The timing and frequency of removal operations significantly impacts success - annual physical removal of recently established skunk cabbage plants over five years removed the entire stock, while twice yearly full removal programmes for mature skunk cabbage populations required continued removal of large numbers of plants even after four years (action 1101). The regeneration rate relative to removal rate is crucial, as demonstrated with floating pennywort where the growth rate exceeded the removal rate following a two-week physical removal program (action 1126). Method and thoroughness of removal matter, with mechanical digger removal combined with monthly hand picking greatly reducing floating pennywort cover but not achieving complete eradication (action 1126). Combination approaches can improve effectiveness, with herbicide application followed by mechanical removal achieving a 75% kill rate for water primrose, and combinations of herbicide, physical removal, native plant promotion and mulching reducing Peruvian primrose-willow coverage by 85-90% (action 1140).",

Some chemical treatments showed effectiveness: iodine solution, acetic acid, Virkon S and sodium hypochlorite added to freshwater killed invasive killer shrimp, but were considered impractical for field application (Action ID: 1095). Exposure to parasites showed promise, as an introduced parasitic mould reduced populations of an invasive shrimp (Action ID: 1089). Changing salinity showed mixed results: one study found increasing salinity killed the majority of invasive shrimp within five hours, while another found it did not kill invasive killer shrimp (Action ID: 1091). Carbonating water stunned invasive killer shrimp (Action ID: 1088). The least effective actions include changing water pH, which did not kill invasive killer shrimp (Action ID: 1093), and several chemicals - methanol, citric acid, urea, hydrogen peroxide and sucrose did not kill invasive killer shrimp (Action ID: 1095). Several actions had no evidence captured for their effectiveness including biological control using predatory fish (Action ID: 1087), exchanging ballast water (Action ID: 1097), exposure to disease-causing organisms (Action ID: 1090), and cleaning equipment (Action ID: 1096).",

However, the same studies also found that eliminating fish using rotenone increased numbers of amphibian species, abundance and recruitment or newt populations, and that fish control including rotenone increased breeding success for four amphibian species (Action 828).\n\nThe evidence base for broader environmental impacts of biocides on marine and freshwater ecosystems appears limited, with systematic searches finding no studies that evaluated the effects of using biocides or other chemicals to control invasive or problematic species on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations (Action 2171) or on marine and freshwater mammal populations (Action 2937).",

However, there are two documented exceptions: A replicated, controlled laboratory study from Poland found that lowering water levels in sand killed three species of invasive Ponto-Caspian gammarids (freshwater shrimp), although one species required water content levels of 4% and below before it was killed (Action 1094). Additionally, one replicated, randomized, controlled laboratory study in the USA found that water removal to expose parrot's feather plants to drying during the summer led to lower survival than exposing plants to drying during the winter (Action 1585).",

Combining trapping with other control methods significantly enhances effectiveness. A before-and-after study in Switzerland found that introducing predators combined with trapping significantly reduced red swamp crayfish populations in a pond, and a replicated, controlled study from Italy demonstrated that trapping and predation in combination was more effective at reducing red swamp crayfish populations than predation alone (Action ID: 1031).",

    "relevant_summary": "Several factors influence the success of herbicide treatments for invasive aquatic plants. The specific chemical used is a critical factor, with different herbicides showing varying effectiveness. For parrot's feather, laboratory studies found that 2,4-D led to greater reduction in growth than diquat, glyphosate or imazapyr (Action 1606), and triclopyr led to greater reduction in cover than glyphosate (Action 1689). For water primrose, triclopyr TEA at 0.25% concentration killed 100% of young plants within two months (Action 1139). Concentration levels significantly affect outcomes, as demonstrated with triclopyr TEA at 0.25% achieving complete mortality in water primrose (Action 1139). Application method also influences success - for water primrose, glyphosate combined with TopFilm achieved 100% mortality while mixing with a non-oil based sticking agent achieved 97% mortality (Action 1139). Combination treatments can enhance effectiveness, as glyphosate with surface active agent Cygnet-Plus followed by mechanical removal achieved 75% kill rate in water primrose (Action 1140), and combined application of 2,4-D and MCPA completely eliminated parrot's feather in field studies (Action 1606). Plant age affects susceptibility, with young cultivated water primrose showing complete mortality to triclopyr TEA treatment (Action 1139). Laboratory versus field conditions produce different results - diquat reduced parrot's feather growth in laboratory studies but showed no reduction in field studies (Action 1680). Timing after treatment affects outcomes, with some studies showing initial cover reduction that later increased to pre-treatment levels for parrot's feather treated with endothall (Action 1681) and triclopyr (Action 1689). For skunk cabbage specifically, no evidence was found for fungal-based herbicide treatments (Action 1100).",

Changing water temperature was found to be highly effective, with heating water to >36\u00b0C killing all shrimps after 15 minutes exposure and at >43\u00b0C all shrimps died immediately (Action 1092). Dewatering (drying out) the habitat also proved effective, with a study finding that lowering water levels in sand killed three species of invasive freshwater shrimp, although one species required water content levels of 4% and below before it was killed (Action 1094). Chemical treatments showed mixed results, with iodine solution, acetic acid, Virkon S and sodium hypochlorite being effective at killing invasive killer shrimp in laboratory conditions but considered impractical for field application, while methanol, citric acid, urea, hydrogen peroxide and sucrose did not kill invasive killer shrimp when added to freshwater (Action 1095). The least effective environmental manipulation technique identified was changing water pH, as lowering the pH of water did not kill invasive killer shrimp (Action 1093). Other techniques like carbonating water to stun the shrimp showed some promise but limited effectiveness (Action 1088). No evidence was found for several other potential control methods including biological control using predatory fish, exposure to disease-causing organisms, cleaning equipment, and exchanging ballast water (Actions 1087, 1090, 1096, 1097).",

Direct removal of juveniles using double fyke nets has been found effective for catching bullfrog tadpoles in small shallow ponds (Action 1046). Removal of juveniles by trapping, when carried out as part of a combination treatment, resulted in a significant reduction in the number of recorded adults and juveniles (Action 1046). Direct removal of adults can be accomplished through several methods: double fyke nets have very low catchability in small shallow ponds for 24 hours, while floating traps on the water surface can capture adults overnight (Action 1045). However, bullfrog populations rapidly rebound following intensive removal of adults alone (Action 1045). Shooting of metamorphosed individuals before reproduction, when carried out as part of a combination treatment, resulted in a significant reduction in recorded adults and juveniles (Action 1045). General removal or control of invasive bullfrogs has been shown to significantly increase California red-legged frog populations, increase leopard frog range, and cause California red-legged frogs to be found out in the open twice as frequently (Action 825). Collection of egg clutches using bilge pumps or nets has been referenced in studies, though no direct evidence of effectiveness was captured (Action 1047). No evidence was captured for habitat modification (Action 1041), biological control of co-occurring beneficial species (Action 1040), or public education (Action 1049) as effective methods for bullfrog control.",

For red swamp crayfish (Procambarus species), concrete dams across streams specifically designed with features to prevent crayfish from crawling over them were effective at containing spread of the population upstream in a study conducted between 2007 and 2010 in Spain (Action 1037). For round gobies, electrical barriers prevented movement across them, with increasing electrical pulse duration and voltage increasing barrier effectiveness in a controlled field study in the USA (Action 1074). Additional control methods for red swamp crayfish include trapping with food baits, with tinned meat trapping the most crayfish compared to pheromones or no bait (Action 1029), chemical control using natural pyrethrum Pyblast at 0.05 mg/l concentration which killed crayfish but was not effective when applied to drained burrows (Action 1036), and encouraging natural predators such as eels and pike which fed on red swamp crayfish and reduced population size in studies from Italy and France (Action 1030). However, no evidence was found for several other potential control methods including electrofishing for crayfish removal (Action 1035), biocide application for gobies (Action 1063), biological control using native predators for gobies (Action 1061), and trapping gobies using visual, sound and pheromonal lures (Action 1069).",

A combination treatment of cutting followed by glyphosate chemical treatment removed floating pennywort in a Western Australia study (action 1128). Physical removal using a mechanical digger and monthly hand picking greatly reduced floating pennywort cover but did not completely eradicate it in a UK study (action 1126). A flame treatment lasting 3 seconds followed by a repeat treatment after 11 days proved fatal to floating pennywort in a Netherlands study (action 1131). Hydrogen peroxide sprayed at 30% concentration caused leaf curling and transparency but was insufficient to kill the plant (action 1129).\n\nFor parrot's feather control, several herbicides showed effectiveness: carfentrazone-ethyl reduced growth in five laboratory studies (action 1676), diquat reduced growth in two laboratory studies but did not reduce growth in one field study (action 1680), endothall reduced growth in laboratory studies and temporarily reduced cover in field studies though cover later returned to pre-treatment levels (action 1681), and triclopyr reduced growth in laboratory studies and cover in field studies but cover later increased to levels close to pre-treatment (action 1689). Water level drawdown during summer led to lower survival of parrot's feather plants compared to winter exposure (action 1585). However, no evidence was found for the effectiveness of mechanical harvesting, suction dredging, mechanical excavation, or manual harvesting for parrot's feather control (actions 1568, 1573, 1570, 1575).",

    "relevant_summary": "Several control options are available for managing American bullfrogs in shallow ponds with varying effectiveness. Direct removal methods include removal of adults and juveniles, with different approaches and success rates. For adult removal, double fyke nets used for 24 hours in small shallow ponds showed very low catchability (action 1045). However, adult bullfrogs can be captured overnight using single traps floating on the water surface (action 1045). Shooting of metamorphosed individuals before reproduction has been used as part of combination treatments and resulted in significant reductions in recorded adults and juveniles (action 1045). Adult bullfrog populations rapidly rebounded following intensive removal, indicating limited long-term effectiveness of adult-only removal (action 1045). For juvenile removal, double fyke nets were effective in catching bullfrog tadpoles in small shallow ponds (action 1046). Removal of juveniles by trapping, when carried out as part of a combination treatment, resulted in significant reduction in the number of recorded adults and juveniles (action 1046). Chemical control using biocides has been tested, with studies finding that several chemicals killed American bullfrogs, including caffeine (10% solution), chloroxylenol (5% solution), and a combined treatment of Permethrin (4.6% solution) and Rotenone (1% solution) (action 1048). Removal or control of invasive bullfrogs has been shown to benefit native amphibian populations, with studies finding significant increases in California red-legged frog populations and increased range of leopard frogs following bullfrog eradication (action 825). No evidence was found for the effectiveness of habitat modification or draining ponds and altering water timing as control methods (actions 1041, 1042).",

For Ponto-Caspian gobies, electrical barriers have proven beneficial, with a controlled, replicated field study in the USA finding that an electrical barrier prevented movement of round gobies across it, and that increasing electrical pulse duration and voltage increased effectiveness of the barrier (Action 1074). Many other alternative methods have been identified but lack evidence of effectiveness, including electrofishing, combination of netting and electrofishing, biological control using native predators, draining invaded waterbodies, habitat manipulation, trapping using sound or pheromonal lures, increasing carbon dioxide concentrations, and public education programs.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence, several control methods show promise for managing invasive red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) in European ponds. Trapping combined with encouragement of predators appears to be one of the most effective approaches, with studies in Switzerland showing that introducing predators combined with trapping significantly reduced red swamp crayfish populations in a pond, and a study in Italy demonstrating that trapping and predation in combination was more effective at reducing populations than predation alone (Action ID 1031). Creating barriers shows effectiveness for preventing spread, as a study in Spain found that concrete dams across streams with features designed to prevent crayfish from crawling over them were effective at containing upstream population spread (Action ID 1037). Trapping and removal shows promise, with an Italian study finding that baiting traps with food (tinned meat) trapped the most red swamp crayfish compared to pheromones or no bait, with over half of all crayfish caught in food-baited traps (Action ID 1029). Encouraging predators alone has demonstrated effectiveness, with studies in Italy showing that eels fed on red swamp crayfish and reduced population size, and a French study finding that pike predated red swamp crayfish (Action ID 1030). Chemical control using natural pyrethrum (Pyblast) at 0.05 mg/l concentration was effective at killing crayfish in an Italian study, though application to drained burrows was not effective (Action ID 1036). Male sterilization through X-ray exposure reduced offspring production by 43% in a laboratory study in Italy (Action ID 1032). Several other methods including draining waterways, electrofishing, and removal of food sources had no evidence available for their effectiveness (Action IDs 1034, 1035, 1033).",

For skunk cabbage (action 1109), no evidence was captured on the impact of public education programmes on control. This pattern extends to other invasive species including American bullfrogs (action 1049), water primrose (action 1148), and Asian clams (action 1122), where no evidence was captured on the use of public education for control. However, one broader review of programmes in the USA and Canada (action 162) argues that education was not sufficient to change behaviour on its own, although it was necessary as a catalytic factor for economic incentives and law enforcement.

    "relevant_summary": "Based on available research evidence, several factors influence the effectiveness of biological control for invasive aquatic plants like floating pennywort and water primrose. Host specificity appears to be a critical factor. For floating pennywort, one study in South America found that a South American weevil caused more feeding lesions on floating pennywort than on any other plant species, demonstrating host specificity, but field results showed the weevil did not reduce floating pennywort biomass (Action 1123). For water primrose, a controlled field study in China found that a flea beetle was specific to prostrate water primrose and Indian toothcup and caused heavy feeding destruction when added to field cages (Action 1135). Environmental context and study setting also appear to influence effectiveness. In contrast to the floating pennywort weevil study, a field study in the USA found that introduction of flea beetles to a pond significantly reduced the abundance of large-flower primrose-willow (Action 1135). For parrot's feather (another aquatic invasive), effectiveness varied by location and study type - laboratory studies in Portugal found grass carp did not reduce biomass or cover, while field studies in Argentina and the USA found that stocking with grass carp reduced biomass or abundance (Action 1599). The type of biological control agent also matters, as demonstrated by a field study in South Africa that reported reduced growth of parrot's feather following release of a South American leaf-feeding Lysathia (Action 1599). However, evidence gaps exist for many biological control approaches, with no evidence found for fungal-based herbicides or native herbivores for both floating pennywort and water primrose.",

Increasing water salinity killed the majority of invasive shrimp within five hours according to one of two laboratory studies, though one study found increased salinity did not kill invasive killer shrimp (Action ID: 1091). Temperature control showed more consistent results, with water heated to >36\u00b0C killing all shrimps after 15 minutes exposure and >43\u00b0C killing all shrimps immediately (Action ID: 1092). For Asian clams, both methods demonstrated high effectiveness with 100% mortality rates. High salinities (18-34\u2030) achieved 100% mortality of Asian clams in laboratory conditions (Action ID: 1115). Similarly, temperatures of 36\u00b0C or higher killed Asian clams within or after four days (Action ID: 1116). Temperature control appears to achieve faster results for Ponto-Caspian gammarids (15 minutes vs 5 hours), while both methods showed complete effectiveness for Asian clams with temperature requiring a longer exposure period (4 days vs immediate effect of salinity).",

Temperature control shows effectiveness, with temperatures of 36\u00b0C or higher killing Asian clams within or after four days (Action 1116). Chemical treatment methods include dosing with biocides such as chlorine, potassium and copper, which killed Asian clams in laboratory studies (Action 1118). Higher concentrations of chlorine and bromine, delivered at higher temperatures, shortened the time required to kill Asian clams (Action 1118). A controlled field-based trial in Spanish irrigation systems showed that fat-coated particles called BioBullets could kill 100% of the Asian clams within pipes (Action 1118). Mechanical removal methods have proven effective, with suction dredging reducing Asian clam densities within sediment by 96% over two weeks with reduction persisting for a year (Action 1120). Three types of dredges were equally effective at removing Asian clams, resulting in biomass reduction ranging from 74% to >95% and density reduction ranging from 65% to 95% (Action 1120). A study in Portugal found that mechanical removal and regular cleaning of industrial pipes or addition of a sand filter were effective methods of permanently removing or reducing numbers of Asian clams respectively (Action 1119). Oxygen reduction methods were found to be ineffective, as Asian clams were resistant to extreme very low levels of oxygen regardless of water temperature or length of immersion (Action 1113).",
