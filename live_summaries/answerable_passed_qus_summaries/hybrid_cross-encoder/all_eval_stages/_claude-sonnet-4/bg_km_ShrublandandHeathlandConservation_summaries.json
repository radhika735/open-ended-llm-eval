For cutting alone, action 1653 shows that one randomized, controlled, before-and-after trial in Norway and two randomized, controlled studies in the UK found that cutting bracken reduced bracken cover or biomass, while one controlled study in the UK found that cutting bracken did not decrease the abundance of bracken. The combination approach showed promise, with action 1654 reporting that three randomized, controlled studies in the UK and Norway found that cutting and applying herbicide reduced bracken biomass or cover. Additionally, action 1654 found that one replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK showed that cutting bracken followed by applying herbicide increased plant species richness when compared with applying herbicide followed by cutting, suggesting the order of treatment matters. Regarding effects on heather recovery, action 1652 found mixed results for herbicide alone with some studies showing increased heather biomass and seedlings while others showed no increase in heather cover. Action 1653 similarly showed mixed results for cutting, with some studies finding increased heather cover or biomass while others found no increase. The combination approach in action 1654 showed one study where cutting and applying herbicide did not alter heather biomass in the UK, but increased heather cover in Norway.",

Studies from the UK found that using fences to exclude livestock increased shrub cover or abundance, increased shrub biomass or the biomass and height of individual heather plants, and found that heather presence or cover was higher in fenced areas (Action 1545). Similarly, studies in Germany found that using fences increased shrub biomass (Action 1545). However, one site comparison study in the USA found that using fences led to decreased cover of woody plants, and three replicated, controlled studies in the USA and UK found that fencing either had a mixed effect on shrub cover or did not alter shrub cover (Action 1545). In broader grazing exclusion studies across multiple countries, fifteen studies in grasslands, shrublands deserts, and mixed habitats in the USA, Israel, Chile, Spain, and Australia found higher biomass, cover, or abundance of some or all plant groups in areas with cattle, sheep, goats, or alpacas excluded compared to grazed areas (Action 2292). However, two studies from Australia found lower biomass, cover, or abundance of some or all plant groups in areas with grazers excluded compared to grazed areas, and five replicated, controlled studies in grasslands in the USA found no difference in the cover of plants between ungrazed and grazed areas (Action 2292).",

While there is some evidence for related mitigation strategies in other contexts, such as tunnels and culverts for mammals where seventeen of 20 studies found that crossing structures beneath roads were used by mammals (Action 2514), and one study in Italy found that restoring connectivity between wetlands by raising a road on a viaduct significantly decreased deaths of migrating amphibians (Action 840), these findings do not specifically address shrubland ecosystems.

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, the most beneficial interventions for restoring shrubland vegetation after fire include several approaches with varying effectiveness:\n\nNatural regeneration appears to be highly effective, as allowing shrubland to regenerate without active management increased shrub cover or biomass in five before-and-after trials across the USA, UK, and Norway (Action 1679). This passive approach also resulted in decreased grass cover or biomass in trials in the USA and UK, and led to increases in vegetation cover and height of protea species in South Africa (Action 1679).\n\nActive seeding and planting interventions show mixed results. Sowing seeds and planting individual plants did not increase cover of native plant species compared to seeding or planting alone in one study in the USA (Action 1700). However, applying herbicide and sowing seeds of shrubland plants was effective in increasing shrub seedlings compared to areas that were not treated, though results varied for reducing non-native grass cover (Action 1644).\n\nMechanical interventions combined with seeding show promise. Cutting or mowing grass and sowing seeds of shrubland plants increased shrub seedling abundance and reduced grass cover in one study, though it did not consistently change biomass compared to seeding alone (Action 1639).\n\nSoil amendments may provide limited benefits. Adding topsoil alongside sowing seeds increased grass biomass but reduced forb biomass compared to topsoil addition alone (Action 1857).\n\nFor broader restoration efforts, sowing native grass and forbs increased overall plant species richness in 16 of 28 studies across Europe, North America and New Zealand, and increased the abundance of sown species in most cases (Action 3432). Irrigation after seeding showed mixed results, increasing plant diversity in only four of 10 cases in one study (Action 3430).",

For turf planting, two randomized, controlled studies in the UK found that planting turf from intact heathland sites increased the abundance or cover of heathland species, with one study also finding increased seedling abundance for a majority of heathland plant species (Action 1703). Turf planting increased forb cover and reduced grass cover, while planting large turves from intact heathland sites increased the number of plant species, though smaller turves did not show this effect (Action 1703). For seed sowing, five of six studies found that sowing seeds of shrubland species increased shrub cover, with one replicated, randomized, controlled study finding that shrub seedling abundance increased after seeds were sown (Action 1698). The community composition of shrublands where seeds were sown was similar to that found in undisturbed shrublands, and seed sowing increased the cover of heathland plants (Action 1698). However, one replicated, controlled study in the USA found that planting California sagebrush and sowing of seeds did not increase cover of native plant species compared to sowing of seeds or planting alone (Action 1700). Additionally, a replicated, randomized, controlled study found that areas where seeds were sown did not differ significantly in native cover compared to areas where shrubland plants had been planted (Action 1698). Some studies also noted that two of three studies found sowing seeds resulted in increased grass cover, which may be undesirable in shrubland restoration (Action 1698).",

    "relevant_summary": "Several methods have been found beneficial for restoring degraded shrublands through plant reintroduction. Planting turf from intact heathland sites has shown effective results, with studies in the UK finding that this method increased the abundance or cover of heathland species and increased seedling abundance for a majority of heathland plant species (Action 1703). Additionally, planting turf increased forb cover and reduced grass cover, while large turves from intact heathland sites increased the number of plant species compared to smaller turves (Action 1703).\n\nFor specific shrubland restoration, applying herbicide combined with sowing seeds of shrubland plants has proven effective, with studies in the USA finding this method increased shrub seedlings and the number of native plant species (Action 1644). One study found this approach reduced non-native grass cover, though results on non-native grass control were mixed across studies (Action 1644).\n\nIndividual plant methods have shown varied success. Planting individual California sagebrush plants did not increase native plant species cover compared to seed sowing alone, though a majority of planted plants survived after one year (Action 1697). Combining seed sowing with individual planting also did not increase native plant species cover compared to either method alone (Action 1700).\n\nIrrigation has demonstrated benefits for degraded shrublands, with one study in the USA finding that temporary irrigation increased shrub cover (Action 1696). For heathland/shrubland restoration specifically, studies found that restored sites showed moth communities more similar to established heather moorland than degraded moorland, though topsoil removal alone resulted in lower butterfly species richness compared to surrounding landscapes (Action 3946).",

Cutting also showed mixed effects on plant diversity, with one study finding increased species richness of heathland plant species and another finding no change in species richness but increased species diversity (Action 1653). One systematic review found that cutting may be equally effective as herbicides (Action 105). Cut and burn methods have been identified as a potential intervention, though no studies have yet been found that evaluated this approach (Action 1655). Cutting followed by rotovating has been tested, with one controlled study in the UK finding that this combination did not increase total plant biomass or biomass of heather (Action 1656). The use of a 'bracken bruiser' mechanical device has been trialled, with one randomized, replicated, controlled, before-and-after, paired study in the UK finding that bracken bruising actually increased bracken cover and had no effect on the number of plant species or plant diversity (Action 1726).

While fencing has been extensively studied for livestock exclusion in shrublands, with multiple controlled studies showing that fences generally increased shrub cover, abundance, and biomass (Action 1545), these studies focus on livestock rather than human disturbance. Signs and access restrictions have been studied primarily for mammal conservation rather than vegetation protection, with studies showing increased use of areas by wildlife when human access was restricted (Action 2325, Action 2330). One study from Turkey found that fencing sea turtle nests combined with signs resulted in higher hatching success compared to areas with no protection measures (Action 3642). Overall, there is a notable lack of evidence specifically evaluating physical barriers or deterrents for reducing human recreational disturbance to shrubland vegetation.\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"1619\",\n    \"3023\",\n    \"1545\",\n    \"2325\",\n    \"2330\",\n    \"3642\"\n  ]\n}"

The only available evidence comes from studies on other habitat types: one study in Canada found significantly higher abundances of some birds, but not forest specialists, in forest patches connected to continuous forest compared to isolated patches, and evidence that corridors were used by some bird species more than clearcuts between patches (Action 160). Studies on reptiles found that forest fragments connected by corridors and isolated forest fragments had similar species composition, richness, and abundance in Brazil, while in Madagascar an area with hedges connecting different habitat types had more unique reptile species and reptile communities were more similar across habitat types compared to areas without hedges (Action 3663).

One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the UK found that grazing with both cattle and sheep, as opposed to grazing with sheep only, reduced cover of purple moor grass but had no effect on four other plant species (Action 1608).\n\nRegarding shortening grazing periods, one replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the UK found that shortening the period in which livestock can graze had mixed effects on heather, bilberry, crowberry, and grass cover (Action 1609). One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK found that grazing in only winter or summer did not affect heather or grass height compared to year-round grazing (Action 1609).\n\nFor context on grazing effects more broadly, studies show that increased livestock numbers generally result in decreased shrub cover. Two site comparison studies in the UK found that cover of common heather declined in sites with a high density of livestock, and one site comparison in the Netherlands found that dwarf shrub cover was lower in grazed areas than in ungrazed areas (Action 1628). A systematic review of four studies in North Western Europe found that increased grazing intensity increased the cover of grass species, relative to heather species (Action 1628).",

In South Africa, a before-and-after trial found that reducing grazing increased shrub abundance (action 1607). In Spain, reducing grazing increased the cover of western gorse (action 1607). In the Netherlands, dwarf shrub cover was higher in ungrazed sites (action 1607). In France, ungrazed sites had higher cover of ericaceous shrubs but lower cover of non-ericaceous shrubs than grazed sites (action 1607). In contrast, studies in the USA found that stopping grazing did not increase shrub abundance (action 1607), and fencing led to decreased cover of woody plants in one study (action 1545). In peatland environments across multiple countries including the UK, Australia, USA, Spain, and Chile, excluding livestock had variable effects: some studies found no effect on shrub cover while others found increased shrub cover (action 1734).

Allowing shrubland to regenerate without active management has demonstrated consistent benefits, with five before-and-after trials in the USA, UK, and Norway finding increased shrub cover or biomass after fire recovery without intervention (Action ID: 1679). One replicated, paired study in the USA found that sites allowed to recover without active restoration had similar shrub cover to unburned areas (Action ID: 1679).\n\nActive restoration approaches include introducing seeds of trees and shrubs. Studies show that sowing shrub seeds can increase establishment, with studies in Germany and the USA reporting germination and survival of heather and willow seeds respectively, though success varies by species (Action ID: 1824). Direct planting of trees and shrubs has shown promise, with eight studies in various locations reporting that the majority of planted trees and shrubs survived over periods between 10 weeks and 13 years (Action ID: 1820).\n\nSoil preparation techniques can enhance restoration success. Studies in the UK found that removal of topsoil combined with adding seed or clippings increased cover of heathland plants and heather and gorse (Action ID: 1711). Additionally, cutting or mowing grass combined with sowing shrubland seeds showed mixed results, with one study in the USA finding increased shrub seedling abundance and reduced grass cover (Action ID: 1639).\n\nThinning trees after wildfire in burnt forest areas can support recovery, with studies in Spain and Canada finding increased plant species richness and aspen sapling cover respectively (Action ID: 1234).",

For cutting alone, no studies were found that evaluated the effects of cutting/mowing to control trees on shrublands (Action 1633). Prescribed burning to control trees showed mixed results - one study in the USA found that burning did not change cover of two of three grass species, while a study in Italy found that prescribed burning reduced cover of common heather, increased cover of purple moor grass, and had mixed effects on the basal area of trees (Action 1721). Grazing alone to control trees was found in one Italian study to reduce cover of common heather and the basal area of trees, but did not alter cover of purple moor grass (Action 1634). Herbicide application to trees increased plant diversity but did not increase shrub cover in one South African study, and increased the abundance of common heather seedlings in a UK study (Action 1629). Combined methods showed different outcomes: cutting trees and applying herbicide increased heather seedling abundance in one UK study but did not alter common heather cover compared to cutting alone in another UK study, increased total plant species and diversity in South African studies, and reduced cover of silver birch trees (Action 1636). The combination of increased livestock numbers and prescribed burning reduced cover of common heather and tree basal area but did not alter purple moor grass cover (Action 1722).

    "relevant_summary": "Several soil amendment techniques involving material addition have been studied for shrubland restoration. Adding topsoil showed positive results in UK studies, with increased cover or abundance of heathland plant species, increased abundance of woody plants, and increased number of seedlings for a majority of heathland plants (Action 1686). In Namibia, topsoil addition increased plant cover and number of plant species, though these remained lower than at undisturbed sites (Action 1686). When topsoil was added alongside seeding in the USA, it increased grass biomass but reduced forb biomass compared to topsoil alone (Action 1857). Organic matter addition showed mixed results: leaf litter addition in Brazil increased tree species richness, while in Costa Rica it decreased young tree density in forest gaps, with no effects under intact forest canopy (Action 1250). In Portugal, adding plant material to soil surface increased total plant cover (Action 1250). Various soil amendment approaches using composts and wastes were studied: Municipal waste composts in Spain greatly reduced soil loss and water runoff in semi-arid soils (Action 890). Organic processing waste composts applied at high rates improved soil structure and reduced soil loss but increased nutrient loss (Action 891). Manures and agricultural composts showed consistent benefits including higher microbial biomass, reduced soil loss and water runoff when combined with other treatments, higher soil carbon levels, and increased crop yields (Action 911). Mixed organic and inorganic amendments resulted in higher microbial biomass and activity, increased soil organic carbon, and improved crop yields (Action 902). Fresh plant material incorporation increased microbial biomass, reduced soil loss, increased soil nitrogen levels and carbon content, and improved yields (Action 910). Fertilizer application showed generally positive outcomes, increasing total plant cover, understory plant biomass, young tree size, and cover of artificially seeded species (Action 1248).",

    "relevant_summary": "Several soil manipulation and plant reintroduction interventions have shown beneficial outcomes for shrubland restoration. Adding fertilizer to soil alongside planting/seeding increased cover of shrubs and trees in a majority of cases in Iceland and increased biomass of four-wing saltbush in a majority of cases in the USA (Action 1704). Temporary irrigation of degraded shrublands increased shrub cover according to a study at two sites in the USA (Action 1696). Stripping or disturbing topsoil alongside planting/seeding showed positive results, with two studies in the UK finding increased cover of heathland plants or heather and gorse, and one study finding increased numbers of heathland plants (Action 1711). Topsoil removal alone showed mixed results, with some UK studies finding increased heather cover and increased cover of both specialist and generalist plant species, though effects varied (Action 1685). Adding peat to soil alongside sowing seed increased cover of common heather in the majority of cases and increased density of heather seedlings compared to seeding alone, though no seedlings survived after two years in one UK study (Action 1705). In contrast, some interventions showed limited benefits: sowing seeds and planting individual plants together did not increase cover of native plant species compared to either method alone (Action 1700), and adding mulch to soil alongside planting/seeding did not increase shrub numbers or height of California sagebrush, though it did increase seedling numbers but not survival in one study (Action 1706). Adding mulch and fertilizer together showed no significant effects on seedling abundance or grass cover in most cases (Actions 1694, 1707).",
