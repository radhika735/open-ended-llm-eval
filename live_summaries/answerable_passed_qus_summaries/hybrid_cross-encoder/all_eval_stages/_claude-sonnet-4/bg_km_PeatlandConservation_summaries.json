Action 1731 shows that tree removal alone increased cover of some herb species including cottongrasses and sedges in bogs and fens, reduced cover of forest-characteristic mosses in bogs, and increased total plant species richness in rich fens.

This combined approach increased abundance of wetland-characteristic plants, showed mixed to positive effects on Sphagnum moss cover with two studies finding increased Sphagnum cover, and increased cover of herbs including cottongrasses and sedges across multiple studies. The combined intervention changed overall plant community composition to become less like sites that remained drained and forested, reduced the number of tall trees for 1-3 years, and increased plant species richness in rich fens.\n\nAction 1756 indicates that rewetting alone typically reduces or has no effect on tree and shrub cover across multiple studies, increases Sphagnum moss cover in twelve studies, and increases cover of various herb groups including sedges, cottongrasses, and reeds.

Five studies (one paired, controlled, before-and-after) in Finland, Sweden\\u00a0and Canada\\u00a0reported that rewetting bogs or fens had no effect on cover of non-Sphagnum mosses (or mosses/lichens). However, two controlled studies in bogs in Ireland\\u00a0and the UK\\u00a0reported that rewetting reduced cover of non-Sphagnum mosses\\u00a0or bryophytes. One site comparison study in Finland\\u00a0reported that a rewetted peatland had similar moss cover (Sphagnum and total) to a natural peatland, but another site comparison study in Canada\\u00a0reported that a rewetted bog had lower moss cover (Sphagnum and other) than nearby target peatlands.\\nHerb cover (25 studies): Twenty-one studies (including four replicated, paired, controlled) reported that rewetting (sometimes\\u00a0along with other interventions) increased cover of at least one group of herbs.

    "relevant_summary": "Several management options are available to mitigate damage from human recreational access on peatlands, though evidence for their effectiveness is limited. Direct access control measures include restricting pedestrian access to peatlands (Action 1751), installing boardwalks/paths to prevent trampling (Action 1753), and limiting, ceasing or prohibiting access for recreational purposes (Action 2152). However, no studies were found that evaluated the effects of these direct access management approaches on peatland vegetation. Alternative management approaches include adopting ecotourism principles/creating an ecotourism site (Action 1755), though again no studies evaluated effects on peatland vegetation. Protection and enforcement measures such as increasing 'on-the-ground' protection through rangers (Action 1800) showed some evidence of effectiveness, with one before-and-after study in a peat swamp forest in Indonesia reporting that the number of illegal sawmills decreased over two years of anti-logging patrols. Education and awareness approaches include providing education or training programmes about peatlands or peatland management (Action 1848), which showed behavior change effects in two studies in tropical peat swamps, with over 3,500 households adopting sustainable farming practices following workshops. Raising general awareness amongst the public (Action 1844) also demonstrated behavior change, with one before-and-after study in the UK reporting that following awareness-raising activities, the percentage of the public buying peat-free compost increased. Engaging volunteers in peatland management or monitoring (Action 1847) is another option, though no studies evaluated its effects on peatland habitats or vegetation.",

Moss cover, including Sphagnum, was higher in plots burned more often in UK bog studies. Burning reduced purple moor grass cover and lowered heather cover in both German and UK bog studies.\n\nFor maintaining or restoring disturbance (Action 1763): Burning reduced tree/shrub cover in fens in the USA and UK. Two studies found that burning increased plant species richness or diversity in a fen in the USA and a bog in New Zealand. Burning reduced forb cover and increased sedge/rush cover in USA fen studies.\n\n**Negative impacts of prescribed fire in peatlands:**\n\nFrom control of problematic plants studies (Action 1774): Burning reduced or limited plant species richness in both USA fen and UK bog studies. Plots burned more frequently contained less total vegetation, shrub and bryophyte biomass despite containing more grass-like plant biomass.\n\nFrom disturbance management studies (Action 1763): One UK fen study reported that burning reduced grass/sedge/rush cover and had no effect on cover of fen-characteristic mosses or herbs. Another UK study found burning typically had no effect on plant species richness and diversity.\n\nThe evidence shows mixed results depending on ecosystem type (bogs vs fens), burning frequency, and management objectives, with effects varying between increased biodiversity in some contexts and reduced species richness in others.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on 36 studies evaluating the effects of rewetting on peatland vegetation (Action 1756), typical effects include significant changes in plant community composition where drier grassland communities are replaced by more wetland- or peatland-characteristic communities. Rewetting typically increases Sphagnum moss cover or abundance in bogs, fens and other peatlands, with 12 studies reporting this effect. Herb cover shows consistent increases, particularly for sedges (13 of 15 studies showed increased sedge cover), cottongrass (8 of 9 studies), and reed/rush cover (5 of 7 studies). Tree and shrub cover typically reduces or shows no effect following rewetting, with 10 studies reporting these outcomes. Wetland-characteristic plants generally increase in abundance following rewetting, while upland plant cover decreases. Effects on overall plant species richness and diversity are mixed, with 6 studies showing increases and 5 studies showing no effect. For combined interventions of cutting/removing trees and rewetting (Action 1732), studies show increased cover of herbs including cottongrasses and sedges, increased Sphagnum cover in some cases, and changes in plant community composition to become less like drained forested sites. Multiple restoration interventions including rewetting (Action 1803) consistently increase total moss or bryophyte cover and herbaceous plant cover including cottongrass and other grass-like plants.",

Five studies (one paired, controlled, before-and-after) in Finland, Sweden\\u00a0and Canada\\u00a0reported that rewetting bogs or fens had no effect on cover of non-Sphagnum mosses (or mosses/lichens). However, two controlled studies in bogs in Ireland\\u00a0and the UK\\u00a0reported that rewetting reduced cover of non-Sphagnum mosses\\u00a0or bryophytes. One site comparison study in Finland\\u00a0reported that a rewetted peatland had similar moss cover (Sphagnum and total) to a natural peatland, but another site comparison study in Canada\\u00a0reported that a rewetted bog had lower moss cover (Sphagnum and other) than nearby target peatlands.\\nHerb cover (25 studies): Twenty-one studies (including four replicated, paired, controlled) reported that rewetting (sometimes\\u00a0along with other interventions) increased cover of at least one group of herbs.

For combined interventions of cutting/removing trees and rewetting (Action 1732), studies show increased cover of herbs including cottongrasses and sedges, increased Sphagnum cover in some cases, and changes in plant community composition to become less like drained forested sites. Multiple restoration interventions including rewetting (Action 1803) consistently increase total moss or bryophyte cover and herbaceous plant cover including cottongrass and other grass-like plants.\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"1756\",\n    \"1732\",\n    \"1803\"\n  ]\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, several alternative disturbance-based management interventions to mowing are available for maintaining fen and fen meadow habitats:\n\n**Grazing** is an established alternative that has been evaluated in four studies in fens or fen meadows (Action 1762). Grazing can maintain disturbance by increasing cover of some herb groups like cottongrasses, sedges or grass-like plants, and can reduce shrub cover in some cases. However, grazed fen meadows may contain fewer fen-characteristic plant species than mown meadows according to one study.\n\n**Prescribed fire** has been studied as a disturbance management tool in three studies, including two in fens (Action 1763). Burning can reduce tree/shrub cover and may increase plant species richness or diversity. Effects on herb cover varied, with one study showing reduced forb cover and increased sedge/rush cover, while another showed reduced grass/sedge/rush cover.\n\n**Cutting large trees/shrubs** is another intervention studied in fens, where removing shrubs (along with other interventions) made plant community composition more like a target fen meadow and increased abundance of fen meadow plant species (Action 1761). Tree cutting in forested fens increased herb cover and biomass.\n\n**Removing plant litter** has been evaluated in fen meadows and fens as a disturbance maintenance technique (Action 1760). One study in a fen meadow found that removing plant litter increased plant species richness and diversity, though effects on plant community composition were not observed in two studies.\n\n**Removing the upper layer of peat/soil** represents a more intensive intervention that has been studied in nine fen or fen meadow studies (Action 1809). Soil stripping increased cover of wetland-characteristic or peatland-characteristic plants after 4-13 years, increased total plant species richness over 2-18 years, and increased cover of rushes, reeds or sedges while reducing purple moor grass cover.",

However, fertilizer had no effect on three planted tree species and reduced survival of one tree species in one study, had no effect on growth for some species or conditions, and typically had no effect on growth of peat swamp tree seedlings in nursery conditions. For lime application (Actions 1790 and 1825), benefits include increased overall vegetation biomass (mostly grass) in fen meadows, increased survival of planted fen mosses, increased growth of planted fen mosses, and increased cover of sown mosses in some studies. However, lime also showed harmful effects including typically reduced survival of planted fen herbs after two growing seasons, reduced or no effect on Sphagnum moss growth in bog pools, reduced growth rates for the majority of peat swamp tree seedlings in nursery conditions, and no effect on total vegetation, vascular plant or bryophyte cover in some studies. The effectiveness appears to depend on the specific species, chemical composition of treatments, peat preparation methods, and whether the system is being restored as a bog versus fen.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available action documents, several management strategies exist to mitigate negative impacts of livestock on peatlands: \n\n1. Complete exclusion strategies - Studies have evaluated excluding or removing livestock from degraded peatlands (action 1734). Ten studies found that this approach typically had no effect on key vegetation components like cottongrass cover (5 studies), sedge cover (2 studies), Sphagnum moss cover (5 studies), and heather cover in wetter areas. However, in drier areas, excluding sheep increased heather cover and favored dry moorland plants. One study found that excluding sheep increased total vegetation, shrub and bryophyte biomass.\n\n2. Physical barriers - Using barriers to keep livestock off ungrazed peatlands that have never or not recently been grazed is another strategy (action 1733), though no studies have directly evaluated this approach's effectiveness on peatland vegetation.\n\n3. Density management - Limiting the density of livestock on farmland near peatlands (action 1786) is identified as a strategy, though no studies have evaluated its effects on peatland vegetation.\n\n4. Livestock type changes - Changing the type of livestock (action 1736) is mentioned as a potential strategy, though again no studies have directly evaluated this approach for peatlands specifically.\n\n5. Grazing for plant control - Using grazing to control problematic plants (action 1773) is identified as a management option, though no studies have evaluated this specifically for peatlands.\n\n6. Semi-natural habitat grazing - Employing areas of semi-natural habitat including bog and fen for rough grazing (action 3944) has been studied, with nine studies showing various effects on butterflies and moths but focused on biodiversity rather than peatland vegetation impacts.",
