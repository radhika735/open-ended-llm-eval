For sea lice control specifically, cleaner wrasse (corkwing and goldskinny species) can be as effective as chemical treatments, though rockcook cleaner wrasse were found to be ineffective (Action 738). Altering lighting conditions can reduce lice numbers, with lower intensity artificial light or natural lighting resulting in fewer lice compared to more intense artificial lighting (Action 741). Dietary modifications using probiotics and immunostimulants can reduce lice infection levels by 28%, and adding beta-glucans to diets can decrease infection levels by an additional 28% (Action 732). For disease control, vaccinations provide higher survival rates against various bacterial diseases including Aeromonas salmonicida, Yersinia ruckeri, marine flexibacteriosis, bacterial kidney disease, and infectious salmon anaemia (Action 733). Breeding for resistance traits increases survival levels when salmon are exposed to infectious pancreatic necrosis (Action 735). Fallowing systems reduce lice numbers on Atlantic salmon (Action 1026). Environmental modifications include using larger cage sizes to reduce amoebic gill disease levels (Action 742) and aerobic training, particularly interval training, to improve survival rates against infectious pancreatic necrosis (Action 740). Freshwater bathing shows mixed results for reducing amoebic gill disease, with some studies showing reduction in amoebae numbers persisting for up to 10 days while others show no difference (Action 739).",

Vaccinations appear highly effective, with controlled studies from Iceland and Norway showing higher survival rates in vaccinated salmon compared to unvaccinated control groups after exposure to disease-causing bacteria Aeromonas salmonicida spp.achromogenes and Yersinia ruckeri (Action 733). Additional controlled studies in Australia and Canada reported higher survival in salmon infected with marine flexibacteriosis and bacterial kidney disease following vaccination, and two controlled studies in Norway reported similar positive results for salmon vaccinated against infectious salmon anaemia (Action 733). Aerobic training shows promise, with a study in Norway finding higher survival rates in salmon exposed to infectious pancreatic necrosis when they had undergone aerobic training, with interval training being more effective than continuous training (Action 740). Breeding for resistance traits also demonstrates effectiveness, as a controlled study in Norway found increased survival levels in salmon exposed to infectious pancreatic necrosis when families were bred for high resistance compared to families bred for low resistance (Action 735). Probiotics and immunostimulants show potential, with a study in Scotland finding increased survival in salmon fed probiotics before exposure to four different disease-causing bacteria over 28 days compared to controls (Action 732). Environmental management approaches also show benefits: larger cage sizes resulted in lower levels of amoebic gill disease compared to smaller cages in Australian studies (Action 742), while altered lighting conditions, specifically low intensity artificial light or natural lighting, resulted in lower numbers of lice on salmon compared to more intense artificial light in Norwegian studies (Action 741).",

For genetically modified alternatives, three controlled, replicated studies (two randomised) in Norway found no difference in growth rate of Atlantic salmon fed diets containing either GM or non-GM soybeans, and one randomised, replicated, controlled study found no differences in fish histology between GM and non-GM soybean diets (Action 928). For yeast as an alternative protein source, one replicated, controlled experiment in Norway found no differences in weight between Atlantic salmon fed diets containing Yarrowia lipolytica yeast compared to a control diet containing fishmeal (Action 920). Regarding plant-based proteins, Norwegian studies produced varied results: some found decreased growth rates and reduced final body weights in salmon fed plant-based protein diets compared to fish meal-based diets, while others found similar growth rates and final body weights between plant-based and fish meal diets (Action 924). For plant-based oils, three replicated studies (two controlled) in Norway found growth rates were similar in salmon fed diets containing fish oil and vegetable oil, with one replicated study finding higher growth rates in vegetable oil diets (Action 926). Norwegian studies also examined bacterial protein sources, with two replicated, controlled studies finding similar growth rates in salmon fed either 100% fish meal or experimental diets containing up to 25% bacterial protein, though 50% bacterial protein resulted in lower growth rates (Action 918). For krill meal substitutes, two replicated studies in Norway found similar final weight gain between salmon fed diets containing fish meal only or krill meal substitute (Action 916). Studies on reduced fish meal showed that two replicated studies in Norway found similar final weights in salmon fed diets containing low, medium or high levels of fish meal (Action 915). Additionally, one controlled, replicated study in Norway found no difference in weight gain of salmon fed diets with or without taurine supplementation (Action 930). A replicated, controlled study in Norway also found that salmon fed a diet with 28% plant-based protein had 28% reduced lice infection levels, with beta-glucans providing additional 28% reduction compared to controls (Action 732).",

Integrated aquaculture systems can be used where blue mussels absorbed waste from a salmon farm (Action 932), and one replicated controlled study in the USA reported greater growth of scallops grown next to fish farms (Action 932). For direct sludge management, sludge drying beds can be implemented as two replicated trials in Canada found sludge drying beds removed phosphorus from freshwater fish farm sludge (Action 943). Preventive measures include improving fish food and pellets to reduce aquaculture waste production (Action 2192) and reducing aquaculture stocking densities (Action 2186). Operational strategies involve leaving a fallow period during fish/shellfish farming, where studies found that following a fallow period, abundances of pollution-indicator polychaete worms decreased (Action 2191). Additional waste management approaches include establishing aquaculture to extract nutrients from run-offs (Action 2883), using other bioremediation methods in aquaculture (Action 2197), cleaning waste water before it enters the environment (Action 3142), and switching to land-based aquaculture systems (Action 3583). Water quality can be managed through introducing and enforcing water quality regulations for aquaculture systems (Action 2876).",

The morphology of the distal intestine was altered in two randomised, replicated, controlled studies where salmon were fed diets containing plant-based proteins (Action 924). Feeding efficiency showed mixed results, with two replicated, controlled studies finding lowered levels of feeding efficiency, while another study found increased feeding efficiency in salmon fed plant-based protein diets compared to fish meal diets (Action 924). Survival rates and appetite were not affected by plant- or fish meal-based protein diets according to two studies (Action 924). The condition of salmon showed variable results, being increased in plant-based protein diets in one randomised, replicated, controlled study but reduced in two other replicated studies (Action 924). For salmon fed krill meal, the number of aerobic bacteria in the hindgut was higher and the composition of the bacterial flora was different compared to fish meal diets (Action 916). Feed conversion ratios were found to be similar between fish meal and krill meal diets (Action 916).

Fallowing systems can reduce lice numbers on Atlantic salmon in cages (Action 1026). Dietary factors also influence success: salmon fed a diet composed of fish meal and 28% plant-based protein had 28% reduced lice infection levels, and adding beta-glucans to the diet decreased lice infection levels by a further 28% compared with controls (Action 732).

Digestibility was negatively affected in two replicated, controlled studies, showing lower digestibility of feed components when diets contained plant proteins compared to fish meal (Action 924). Morphological changes were observed, with the morphology of the distal intestine being altered in two randomised, replicated, controlled studies where salmon were fed diets containing plant-based proteins (Action 924). Positive or neutral effects include some studies finding similar growth rates between plant-based and fish meal diets, with three replicated and/or controlled studies from Norway, Canada and Scotland showing no difference (Action 924). Two controlled studies from Norway found similar final body weights between both diet types (Action 924). One study in Norway found increased feeding efficiency levels in salmon fed plant-based protein diets, and two studies in Canada and Scotland found similar feeding efficiency levels across both diet types (Action 924). Two randomised, replicated, controlled studies in Scotland and Norway found similar levels of digestibility across both diet types (Action 924). Survival rates and appetite were not affected by plant- or fish meal-based protein diets in two studies (Action 924). One randomised, replicated, controlled study found increased condition in salmon fed plant-based protein diets, though two other replicated studies found reduced condition (Action 924).",
