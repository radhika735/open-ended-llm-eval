Two reviews and two replicated controlled trials from the UK found that leaving uncut strips of rye grass on silage fields resulted in benefits to birds including increased numbers (Action 132).

However, birds that fed on different food resources such as insect-eaters showed more variable results with some preferring plots cut two or more times (Action 132).

A review from the UK found that raising mowing height may have increased productivity of Eurasian skylarks, but not sufficiently to maintain the local population (Action 222). A randomised, replicated and controlled study from the UK found that no more foraging birds were attracted to plots with raised mowing heights, compared to plots with shorter grass (Action 222). Similarly, a randomized, replicated, controlled trial from the UK found that raising mowing height on grasslands had no effect on numbers of foraging birds or invertebrates (Action 138). One replicated study from the UK found that northern lapwing and common starling chicks had greater foraging success in shorter grass (Action 138). For butterflies and moths, one replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK found that intensively managed grassland plots cut to 10 cm had similar species richness and abundance of butterflies and caterpillars to plots cut to 5 cm (Action 3968).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on studies from multiple European countries including Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Lithuania, Netherlands, Slovakia, Switzerland, UK, Italy, Spain, and others, reducing tillage on European farmland shows several documented benefits and some potential drawbacks.\n\n**Documented Benefits:**\n\nSoil health improvements: Studies found higher soil organic carbon and organic matter content under reduced tillage systems compared to conventional tillage (Action 906, 1369, 1371). Reduced tillage increased soil water content and water infiltration rates in multiple European studies (Actions 1384, 1386). Soil erosion was reduced in seven out of nine studies, showing decreased soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage (Action 906).\n\nBiodiversity benefits: Studies across European countries found positive effects on earthworms including increased biomass and abundance (Actions 126, 1369). Some invertebrates showed greater abundance under reduced tillage systems (Action 126). Microbial biomass generally increased in soils with reduced tillage compared to conventional systems (Actions 1369, 1371). Bird species including Eurasian skylark showed benefits such as higher nest density, earlier laying dates, and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields (Actions 126, 211).\n\nNutrient retention: Studies found higher nitrogen and phosphorus retention in soils under reduced tillage systems (Actions 906, 1369, 1371). Water use efficiency improved for crops like barley under no-tillage systems compared to conventional tillage (Action 1384).\n\n**Potential Drawbacks:**\n\nCrop yield variations: Studies showed mixed results for crop yields, with some finding lower yields under reduced tillage, particularly for cereals in certain comparisons (Actions 1359, 1358). Some legume crops showed reduced yields under reduced tillage systems (Action 1359).\n\nSoil compaction: Three studies found higher compaction under reduced tillage systems compared to conventional methods (Action 906).\n\nInconsistent effects: Some studies found negative, no effect, or inconsistent effects on earthworm abundance, some invertebrates, and certain bird species under reduced tillage (Action 126). Greenhouse gas emissions showed mixed results, with some studies finding increased carbon dioxide or nitrous oxide emissions under reduced tillage (Actions 1369, 1371).\n\nPest and weed management: Studies indicated potential increases in some weed species under reduced tillage systems, though this also included beneficial effects on weed diversity (Action 126).\n\nTime-dependent effects: Long-term studies (after ten years) showed variable results, with some benefits decreasing over time, possibly due to extreme weather events (Actions 126, 211).",

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done.

    "relevant_summary": "Multiple management techniques are available for restoring or creating species-rich wet meadows in European agricultural landscapes. Successful wet meadow restoration techniques include topsoil removal, introduction of target plant species, raising water levels, grazing, mowing, or combinations of removing topsoil and introducing target plant species plus livestock exclusion (Action 119). Traditional water meadow management involves techniques such as mowing once per year in autumn or light grazing with cattle or horses (Actions 3971, 696). Raising water levels in ditches or grassland increases plant species that favour wet conditions and can establish species typical of wet grassland more rapidly than vegetation management alone (Action 121). For species-rich grassland restoration, effective techniques include grazing, introducing plant species, hay spreading and mowing (Action 133). Mowing regime modifications are important, with cutting in June helping maintain relatively stable vegetation, though mowing has variable effects on plant species richness (Action 696). The timing of cutting affects plant communities, with summer-mown plots showing increased plant species richness compared to spring- or autumn-mown plots in fen meadows (Action 1771). Livestock type also influences results, with semi-natural grasslands grazed by cattle or horses showing greater butterfly species richness than those grazed by sheep (Action 3963). Reducing management intensity on permanent grasslands through multiple interventions can benefit plants, invertebrates and birds, though results vary (Action 69). Studies show positive restoration effects can occur within five years, though some restoration takes more than 10 years and may not be complete even after 20 years (Actions 119, 133).",

Seven individual studies examining the effects of reverting arable land to grassland found no clear benefit to wildlife, monitoring UK birds in winter and summer, wading birds in Denmark, grey partridges, brown hares in the UK, and plants in the Czech Republic (Action 561). One controlled before-and-after study from the UK showed that grey partridge numbers fell significantly following the reversion of arable fields to grassland (Actions 561, 210).\n\nSet-aside areas show more positive effects for wildlife. Of 34 studies comparing set-aside areas with control farmed fields, 20 studies from Austria, Finland, Germany and the UK showed benefits to or higher use by all wildlife groups considered. Twelve studies found some species or groups used set-aside more than crops, others did not. Only two studies found no effect, and one found an adverse effect of set-aside (Action 156). A systematic review from the UK found significantly higher densities of farmland birds on fields removed from production and under set-aside designation than on conventionally farmed fields in both winter and summer (Action 156). Three studies looking at skylarks found mixed results for reproductive success, with two UK studies finding higher nest survival or productivity on set-aside than control fields, while one UK study found lower nest survival on set-aside (Action 156).\n\nFor butterflies and moths, restoring arable land to permanent grassland shows positive effects. Three replicated studies found that 4-5-year-old created grasslands and abandoned cropland had greater species richness of butterflies, burnet moths and all moths than conventionally managed grassland or cultivated farms. Two studies found that restored grassland had higher abundance of moths than conventional grassland or unrestored crop fields (Action 3929).",

    "relevant_summary": "Several alternatives to direct predator control can improve breeding success of ground-nesting birds on farmland. Physical protection methods include protecting individual nests with exclosures or barriers, which studies found increased fledging success and reduced predation rates (action 108, 400). Protecting nests from livestock trampling using cages prevented nest destruction in studies (action 237).\n\nHabitat management approaches include leaving cultivated, uncropped margins or plots (lapwing plots), which increased northern lapwing hatching success, Eurasian skylark nesting success, and provided breeding habitat for lapwing, skylark, grey partridge and yellow wagtail (action 562). Providing or retaining set-aside areas showed benefits, with studies finding higher nest survival or productivity for skylarks on set-aside compared to control fields (action 156). Planting wild bird seed or cover mixture increased bird diversity, densities, nesting densities and provided higher productivities for some species compared to other habitats (action 187).\n\nTiming modifications of farming operations offer additional alternatives. Delaying mowing or first grazing dates resulted in increased breeding wading bird densities and increased Eurasian skylark productivity (action 131). Delaying haying/mowing specifically reduced nest destruction by machinery and increased late-season nesting (action 223). Using wildlife-friendly mowing techniques reduced mortality levels for corncrakes and Eurasian skylarks compared to other techniques (action 192). Marking bird nests during harvest or mowing made marked northern lapwing nests less likely to fail from farming operations (action 148).\n\nSupplementary feeding increased farmland bird abundance, breeding population size, density, hatching, nestling growth and fledging rates in multiple studies (action 648). Providing refuges during harvest or mowing reduced contact between machinery and unfledged quail and corncrakes (action 147).",

For solitary bees, evidence from 30 replicated trials across 10 countries (including Europe) shows that 29 trials demonstrated occupancy by bees, with many species readily nesting in boxes including endangered species on German farmland (Action 47). German studies specifically found that four medium to large European species have foraging ranges of 150-600m, requiring nest boxes within this distance of resources (Action 47). Three trials on agricultural land showed that occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated provision, and one US blueberry field study found increased foraging bee populations compared to fields without boxes (Action 47). For bumblebees, evidence shows much lower success rates with UK trials since 1989 showing very low uptake rates of 0-2.5% for surface nest boxes, while earlier trials in the UK, USA and Canada found 10-48% uptake rates, with underground boxes generally most effective (Action 48). However, no evidence was captured for effects on bumblebee populations (Action 48). For birds on European agricultural habitats, studies from Netherlands, UK, Finland, Sweden and Switzerland found nest boxes were readily occupied by various species including Eurasian kestrel, long-eared owl, common starling, tits, tree sparrow, stock dove, jackdaw, Eurasian wryneck and Eurasian hoopoe (Action 155). Two studies found increases in Eurasian kestrel clutches and breeding tree sparrows following nest box provision, though one Swiss study found Eurasian wryneck broods declined over five years while hoopoe broods increased (Action 155). Studies also found nest success was related to available pasture and boxes positioned higher had better occupancy and breeding success (Action 155). For wildfowl, six studies from North America and Europe found population increases with artificial nests, though one Finnish study found no increase in broods or chicks (Action 482).",

Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes. In one trial, these introduced species more commonly occupied the boxes than native bees.\\nA small trial tested three soil-filled nest boxes for the mining bee Andrena flavipes in the UK, but they were not occupied.\"\n}"

However, over 10 years after restoration, the number of butterfly species on seeded grassland remained similar each year (Action 3929).

For birds, twenty-four studies from four European countries (including systematic reviews) found increases in population size, density or more favourable population trends of some or all birds studied on sites with agri-environment schemes compared to non-scheme sites, while eleven studies found negative or no effects (Action 700). Twenty-two of 25 European studies found that at least some bird species were at higher densities or had higher population levels on sites with agri-environment schemes, though fifteen studies found that some or all species showed no differences or had similar population trends compared to non-scheme sites (Action 172). For wild bees, four replicated trials in Europe showed enhanced diversity and/or abundance of foraging wild bees on land managed under various European agri-environment schemes, including Swiss Ecological Compensation Areas, German organic arable farming, Dutch botanical agreements, and Scottish Rural Stewardship Scheme. However, four other European trials found that bee numbers and/or species were not enhanced, and two UK trials found bumblebee populations were not enhanced on a wider landscape scale (Action 24). For plants, seven studies from five European countries found agri-environment schemes maintained or had little effect on plants and plant diversity, while three studies found increases in plant species richness and two found decreases (Action 700). For invertebrates, six studies from three European countries showed agri-environment schemes maintained or had little effect on invertebrate diversity, abundance or species richness, while five studies found increases in abundance or species richness of some invertebrates (Action 700). A European review found that two out of three agri-environment schemes in Europe benefited wildlife (Action 700).",

Spring barley undersown with a mix of grasses and legumes had higher species richness and abundance of butterflies compared to extensively or conventionally managed grassland (Action 3926). Some studies found higher densities of certain bird species on undersown fields or margins compared with other fields, or increased field use after undersowing (Action 208). However, not all wildlife groups showed consistent benefits, as some studies found that undersowing spring cereals did not benefit invertebrates, plants, grey partridge population indicators, or nesting densities of two out of three farmland bird species (Action 136).

Eleven studies found that undersowing spring cereals benefited some birds, plants, insects, spiders and earthworms (Action 136). These benefits included increases in barnacle goose abundance, densities of singing Eurasian skylark and nesting dunnock, arthropod abundance and species richness, and bumblebee, butterfly, earthworm, ground beetle, spider or springtail abundances (Action 136). For butterflies specifically, spring barley undersown with a mix of grasses and legumes had higher species richness and abundance of butterflies than extensively or conventionally managed grassland (Action 3926). Studies found higher densities of some study species on undersown fields or margins compared with other fields, or that use of fields increased after they were undersown (Action 208). However, some studies showed mixed results, with five studies finding that undersowing spring cereals did not benefit invertebrates, plants, grey partridge population indicators, or nesting densities of two out of three farmland bird species (Action 136). Compared to conventional tillage practices, reduced tillage systems provide increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms, greater abundance of some invertebrates, increased numbers of some weeds, higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying date and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields (Action 126).",

Thirty-four studies (of which 21 were replicated and controlled and seven also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found some positive effects on earthworms, some invertebrates (other than earthworms), weeds or farmland birds, of reducing tillage compared to conventional management. Positive effects included increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms, greater abundance of some invertebrates other than earthworms, increased numbers of some weeds and/or weed species, higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying date and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields, and greater abundance of some birds - including Eurasian skylark, seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in late winter on non-inversion or conservation tillage. A review found tillage had negative effects on invertebrate numbers and no-till systems had more invertebrate bird food resources.\\nTwenty-six studies (of which 13 replicated and controlled and three also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found reducing tillage had either negative, no effect or no consistent effects on abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates (other than earthworms), earthworm abundance, biomass, or species richness, number of different plant species found as seeds, number of some weed species, mammal abundance, some bird species, and one study found bird preferences for conservation tillage fields decreased over time.

    "relevant_summary": "Several factors influence the occupancy and success rates of nest boxes for birds on farmland. Nest box design affects use, productivity and usurpation rates, with thirteen studies finding that these varied with different designs (action 498). The position and orientation of nest boxes is also important, with fourteen studies finding different occupation or success rates depending on positioning (action 498). Specifically, nest boxes positioned higher above the ground had higher occupancy, numbers of eggs and numbers of hatched young (action 155). The surrounding habitat influences success, with nest success in boxes being related to the amount of pasture available (action 155). Tree sparrows showed a preference for nest boxes in wetland habitat compared to those in farmland sites (action 155). Nest box maintenance affects occupancy, as five studies found that various songbirds preferentially nested in cleaned nest boxes compared to used ones, though some studies found birds showed preference for uncleaned boxes and there were no differences in success or parasitism levels between cleaned and uncleaned boxes (action 499). Predation is a significant factor, with predation rates being lower for relocated nest boxes compared to controls (action 420), and nest boxes or nesting 'tubs' showing lower predation or higher nesting success than natural nests (action 402). Predator deterrents such as metal cones with 7.6 cm overhang and increased distance between entrance hole and roof from 30 to 60 cm can prevent raccoons from entering nest boxes (action 402). Nest box density may also play a role, with one study finding more nesting attempts in areas with more nest boxes, though another study found no differences in behaviour or productivity between areas with high or low densities of nest boxes (action 498).",

Thirty-four studies (of which 21 were replicated and controlled and seven also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found some positive effects on earthworms, some invertebrates (other than earthworms), weeds or farmland birds, of reducing tillage compared to conventional management. Positive effects included increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms, greater abundance of some invertebrates other than earthworms, increased numbers of some weeds and/or weed species, higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying date and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields, and greater abundance of some birds - including Eurasian skylark, seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in late winter on non-inversion or conservation tillage. A review found tillage had negative effects on invertebrate numbers and no-till systems had more invertebrate bird food resources.\\nTwenty-six studies (of which 13 replicated and controlled and three also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found reducing tillage had either negative, no effect or no consistent effects on abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates (other than earthworms), earthworm abundance, biomass, or species richness, number of different plant species found as seeds, number of some weed species, mammal abundance, some bird species, and one study found bird preferences for conservation tillage fields decreased over time.

One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done. One randomized, replicated study from Portugal found no effect of tillage treatment on yield.\\n\\u00a0\\nSOIL TYPES COVERED: anthrosol, calcareous silt loam, chalky, clay, clay loam, fine sandy loam, loam, loamy-clay, loam - sandy loam, loam \\u2013 silt-loam, loamy sand, loamy silt, non-chalky clay, sandy, sandy clay loam, sandy loam, sandy silt-loam, silt loam, silty, silty-clay, silty clay loam, silty loam.\"\n}"
