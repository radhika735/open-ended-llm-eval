    "relevant_summary": "For increasing soil organic matter in Mediterranean vineyards, several evidence-based actions are available. Ground cover establishment is highly effective - ten studies from Chile, France, Spain, and the USA found more organic matter in vineyard soils with ground cover compared to soils without ground cover, with two meta-analyses from Mediterranean climates also confirming this benefit (Action 1367). Permanent ground cover was found to be more effective than temporary ground cover in France (Action 1367). Adding compost directly to soil is consistently beneficial - twelve replicated controlled studies from Italy, Spain, Syria, Turkey, and the USA found more organic matter in soils with added compost compared to soils without compost (Action 1362). Using organic fertilizers instead of inorganic fertilizers shows promise - eight replicated studies from France, Italy, Spain, Turkey, and Mediterranean countries found more organic matter in soils with organic fertilizer compared to inorganic fertilizer in some comparisons (Action 1366). Cover crops between vineyard rows also increase soil organic matter - two controlled trials from India and South Africa found that soil organic matter increased under cover crops (Action 897). Reduced tillage practices are beneficial - one meta-analysis from multiple Mediterranean countries and eleven replicated studies from Italy, Spain, Syria, and the USA found more organic matter in soils with reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage (Action 1371). Adding manures and agricultural composts increases soil organic carbon - four studies from India, Japan and the UK found higher carbon levels when manures were applied (Action 911). Mulching around vines provides additional benefits - one trial showed that mulch improved soil structure and increased soil organic matter (Action 887). Retaining crop residues also contributes - two randomized trials from Australia and China found higher soil organic carbon when residues were retained (Action 907). For slurry application, results are mixed - one replicated study from Spain found more organic matter in soils with added slurry in some comparisons, but three other studies found similar amounts compared to soils without slurry (Action 1365).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents examined, cover crops in Mediterranean farmland show mixed but generally positive effects on soil health and variable effects on crop production. \n\n**Soil Health Effects:**\nCover crops consistently improve soil organic matter and carbon content in Mediterranean climates. One meta-analysis of studies from Mediterranean-type climates and ten replicated controlled studies from Italy, Spain, and the USA found more organic matter in soils with winter cover crops compared to soils without them (Action 1345). Studies from Denmark found increased soil carbon levels under cover crops, with levels increasing further when legumes were included (Action 898).\n\nFor soil nutrients, cover crops show positive effects on nitrogen availability. Ten replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Italy, Spain, and the USA found more nitrogen in soils with winter cover crops compared to soils without them in some comparisons (Action 1345). Five studies from Italy, Spain, and the USA found more nitrogen in soils that were cover cropped with legumes compared to non-legumes (Action 1345).\n\nSoil biological activity increases with cover crops. Five replicated, randomized, controlled studies from the USA found more microbial biomass in soils with cover crops compared to soils without them (Action 1345). One replicated, randomized, controlled study from Spain found more bacteria and fungi in soils with winter cover crops compared to soils without them (Action 1345).\n\nCover crops reduce soil erosion and improve soil structure. Two controlled studies from Israel and the USA found less erosion of soils with cover crops compared to soils with fallows or bare soils (Action 1345). Two replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Spain and the USA found more water-stable soil aggregates in plots with winter cover crops compared to plots without them (Action 1345). Three randomized, replicated studies from Denmark, Turkey and the UK found that growing cover crops improved soil structure and nutrient retention (Action 898).\n\n**Crop Production Effects:**\nThe effects on crop yields are mixed. Six replicated, controlled studies from Spain and the USA found lower cash crop yields in plots with winter cover crops compared to plots without them in some comparisons, while three replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Italy and the USA found higher cash crop yields in plots with winter cover crops in some comparisons (Action 1351). Seven controlled studies from France, Israel, Spain, and the USA found no differences in cash crop yields between plots with or without cover crops (Action 1351).\n\nHowever, implementation with legumes shows more consistent benefits. Eight studies from Italy, Spain, and the USA found higher cash crop yields in plots that had legumes as winter cover crops compared to non-legumes (Action 1351). One replicated trial from the USA found higher tomato yield from soils which had been under a ryegrass cover crop (Action 898).",

Growing cover crops beneath the main crop or between crop rows (action 897) was shown by two studies from France and the USA to reduce erosion, with one controlled study finding highest soil stability under grass cover and one randomized replicated study finding reduced soil loss. Growing cover crops in arable fields (action 1345) was demonstrated by two controlled studies from Israel and the USA to reduce erosion compared to soils with fallows or bare soils. Using reduced tillage in arable fields (action 1371) was found by one replicated, randomized, controlled study from Egypt to reduce erosion with fewer tillage passes compared to more intensive tillage. Retaining crop residues (action 907) was shown by one review to reduce water runoff and soil erosion, and by one replicated study from the USA to have mixed results on soil erosion depending on tillage practices. Adding mulch to crops (action 887) was found by five studies from India, France, Nigeria and the UK to increase soil stability and reduce soil erosion and runoff, with one trial finding some mulches more effective than others. Adding compost to the soil (action 1362) was demonstrated by two replicated, controlled studies from Spain to reduce soil erosion compared to soils without added compost. Using erosion blankets/mats to aid plant establishment (action 1692) was found by studies in the USA and China to increase plant establishment and cover, though specific erosion reduction data was limited.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence, several habitat creation actions can support pollinators on Mediterranean farmland besides planting hedgerows:\n\nPlanting dedicated floral resources shows substantial benefits, with fourteen trials in Europe and North America recording substantial numbers of wild bees foraging on perennial or annual sown flowering plants in agricultural environments. Ten trials found substantial numbers of foraging wild bees, particularly bumblebees, on patches sown with phacelia, though one replicated trial shows that phacelia is not very attractive to wild bees in Greece specifically (action 17).\n\nCreating wildflower field margins provides effective habitat, with five replicated trials in the UK showing that uncropped field margins sown with wild flowers support higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees than cropped field edges, grassy margins, or naturally regenerated margins. Perennial leguminous herbs in seed mixtures are particularly important forage sources for bumblebees (action 19).\n\nPlanting nectar flower mixtures and wildflower strips benefits pollinators, with multiple studies showing higher species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths compared to conventional field margins, unsown margins, or cropped fields (action 3932).\n\nMaintaining ground cover in orchards or vineyards can help, with one replicated site comparison from Greece finding more bee species and more deposited pollen grains in managed olive orchards compared to abandoned olive orchards (action 1404).\n\nProviding or retaining set-aside areas in farmland offers habitat opportunities, with 34 studies comparing set-aside areas with control farmed fields, of which 20 showed benefits to or higher use by wildlife groups (action 156).\n\nRestoring habitat along watercourses may provide pollinator support, with one study finding similar numbers of bees and bee species in restored sites compared to remnant sites, though with different bee communities (action 1408).",

    "relevant_summary": "The evidence from action documents shows mixed effects of different grazing management strategies on plant biodiversity. Regarding grazing versus no grazing, studies found that grazed plots had higher cover or abundance of some plant groups compared to ungrazed plots, while other studies found lower cover or abundance of some plant groups on grazed plots compared to ungrazed plots (action 1419). Three studies found more plant species on grazed plots compared to ungrazed plots in some or all comparisons, with one study also finding more non-native species on grazed plots, while two other studies found no difference in the number of plant species between grazed and ungrazed plots (action 1419). Studies on grazing intensity showed that six studies found higher cover of some species of plants, herbaceous plants, or native plants in areas grazed at lower compared to higher intensities, while four studies found no effect of grazing intensity on biomass, cover, or abundance of plants (action 1418). For plant diversity, three studies found no differences in plant diversity between sites with different grazing intensities, while two studies found no differences in the number of plant species between sites with different grazing intensities (action 1418). Seasonal grazing effects included five studies showing that the cover of native or non-native plants, or plant abundance, differed between sites grazed at different times in some comparisons, while two studies found no difference in plant cover between areas grazed at different times (action 1421). Two studies found differences in the number and diversity of plant species between plots grazed at different times (action 1421). For rotational grazing, one study found higher cover of native plants after adoption of rotational grazing, and another study found that plants had more reproductive stems under rotational grazing in two of three years (action 1420). Studies on reduced management intensity found that six of 10 studies showed less intensively managed grasslands had higher species richness of butterflies and moths than conventionally managed grasslands, while four studies found similar species richness between less intensively and conventionally managed grasslands (action 3958). Cessation of grazing showed that six of nine studies found grasslands not grazed for more than 5 years had similar species richness of butterflies and moths to grazed grasslands, while two studies found abandoned grasslands had lower species richness than grazed grasslands, and three studies found abandoned grasslands had higher species richness than grazed grasslands (action 3956).",

A further two studies found that grasslands which had been abandoned for &gt;5\\u201320 years\\u00a0or many years\\u00a0had a lower species richness of butterflies than grazed grasslands (in one study grazing and mowing were not distinguished). The other study found that butterfly species richness was higher in grasslands where grazing ceased 2\\u20139 years ago than those abandoned &gt;10 years ago or those currently grazed. Three replicated studies (including one randomized, controlled study and two site comparison studies) in Switzerland, Germany\\u00a0and the UK\\u00a0found that grasslands which had been abandoned for 4, 5\\u201310\\u00a0or &gt;10 years\\u00a0had a higher species richness of butterflies and day-flying moths\\u00a0and nocturnal moths\\u00a0than extensively grazed, recently abandoned\\u00a0or commercially grazed grasslands.

Two of these studies only found a difference compared to grazing at commercial/intensive, not low, densities. Four of the studies found that grasslands which had been abandoned for two weeks, 5\\u201320 years\\u00a0or an undetermined time\\u00a0had a lower abundance of butterflies\\u00a0and spring webworm caterpillars\\u00a0than grasslands grazed by cattle\\u00a0or a mix of livestock\\u00a0(in two studies grazing and mowing were not distinguished). A further four of the studies found that grasslands which had been abandoned for 5-15 years had a similar abundance of butterflies, burnet moths, day-flying moths\\u00a0and meadow neb moth caterpillars\\u00a0to grasslands grazed by sheep, horses and cattle\\u00a0or a mix of livestock. A further four of the studies found that in grasslands which had been abandoned for &gt;10 years, many years\\u00a0or an unspecified number of years, and in one case with burning, abundance or density was mixed depending on butterfly\\u00a0and moth\\u00a0species compared to grasslands grazed by cattle\\u00a0or unspecified grazers\\u00a0or grazed with cattle and burned. The other study found that butterfly density was higher in grasslands where grazing ceased 2\\u20139 years ago than those abandoned &gt;10 years ago or those currently grazed. Two replicated studies (including one controlled, before-and-after study and one site comparison study) in Spain\\u00a0and Germany\\u00a0found that grasslands which had been abandoned for 1\\u20136 years\\u00a0or an unspecified time period\\u00a0had a higher abundance of woodland and hedgerow butterflies\\u00a0and burnet moths, but a lower abundance of grassland\\u00a0or farmland\\u00a0species, than grasslands managed by grazing and/or mowing (results not distinguished). Two studies also found that the large blue\\u00a0and silver-studded blue\\u00a0went extinct in some abandoned meadows. One replicated, site comparison study in Sweden\\u00a0found that grasslands which were ungrazed for the year had a lower abundance of clouded Apollo butterflies than lightly grazed grasslands, but a higher abundance than heavily grazed grasslands. One review in Europe\\u00a0reported that ceasing grazing on grassland benefitted six out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (3 STUDIES)\\n\\nUse (3 studies): One replicated, paired, site comparison study in Germany\\u00a0found that grassland which had been abandoned for &gt;5 years had a similar occurrence of hoary bell moth caterpillars to grassland grazed by sheep. One replicated, site comparison study in the UK\\u00a0found that a similar proportion of grasslands which had been abandoned for one year, and grazed grasslands, contained &gt;20 marsh fritillary caterpillar webs. One replicated, site comparison study in Spain\\u00a0found that grizzled skipper and painted lady occurred less frequently, but small pearl-bordered fritillary occurred more frequently, in meadows which had been abandoned for at least 1\\u20132 years than in meadows managed by grazing or mowing (results not distinguished).\"\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from action documents, several practices can reduce nutrient loss from Mediterranean farmland soils into water:\n\nSoil amendments and organic matter management: Amending soil with manures and agricultural composts reduces nutrient loss and results in higher nitrogen levels when farmyard or poultry manure is applied (Action 911). Using organic fertilizer instead of inorganic can help with nutrient retention, with studies from Mediterranean countries showing more nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in soils with organic fertilizers compared to inorganic fertilizer in some comparisons (Action 1366). Adding compost to soil was found to reduce water runoff in studies from Spain (Action 1377).\n\nTillage practices: Using reduced tillage in arable fields can help, with one study from France finding that less water was lost through drainage from soils with reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage during the growing season, and less herbicide was leached from soils with reduced tillage (Action 1386).\n\nCover crops and ground cover: Growing cover crops in arable fields shows promise, with studies from Spain and the USA finding that less nitrate was leached from soils with winter cover crops compared to soils without them in some or all comparisons (Action 1357). Planting or maintaining ground cover in orchards or vineyards can reduce nutrient runoff, with one study from Chile finding less nitrogen, phosphorus, and dissolved organic carbon in runoff from plots with seeded cover crops compared to plots with bare soil (Action 1382).\n\nBuffer strips: Planting buffer strips can help reduce nutrient runoff, with one study from the USA finding less nitrate in runoff from irrigated pastures with buffer strips (Action 1387). Buffer strips to reduce pesticide and nutrient run-off into margins, waterways and ponds have been specifically designed for this purpose (Action 3894).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, several management practices can improve soil fertility on Mediterranean farmland without using amendments like manure or slurry:\n\nCover crops and ground cover: Growing winter cover crops in arable fields increases organic matter and nitrogen in soils (action 1345). Planting or maintaining ground cover in orchards and vineyards increases organic matter in soils, with permanent ground cover being more effective than temporary cover for enhancing soil fertility (action 1367). Legume cover crops are particularly effective for increasing nitrogen in soils compared to non-legumes (actions 1345, 1367).\n\nNo-tillage practices: Using no tillage in arable fields increases organic matter in soils and generally maintains or increases nitrogen levels compared to tilled soils (action 1369). Reduced tillage practices maintain or increase soil organic matter and improve soil structure while enhancing nutrient retention (action 906). No-tillage systems also result in higher soil organic carbon compared to conventionally tilled systems (action 906).\n\nCrop rotation: Using crop rotations can improve soil fertility, though effects vary. Including legumes in crop rotation increases microbial biomass and fungi in soils (action 2305). Crop rotations can increase nitrogen in soils in some comparisons and may improve soil aggregation (action 1368).\n\nIntercropping systems: Alley cropping with trees increases diversity of beneficial soil fungi (arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi) (action 903). Intercropping practices can enhance soil biological activity and earthworm abundance (action 124).\n\nAll these practices work by enhancing soil biological activity, increasing organic matter content, improving soil structure, and reducing erosion while maintaining or increasing nutrient availability without relying on external organic amendments.",

Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion.

Thirty-four studies (of which 21 were replicated and controlled and seven also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found some positive effects on earthworms, some invertebrates (other than earthworms), weeds or farmland birds, of reducing tillage compared to conventional management. Positive effects included increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms, greater abundance of some invertebrates other than earthworms, increased numbers of some weeds and/or weed species, higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying date and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields, and greater abundance of some birds - including Eurasian skylark, seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in late winter on non-inversion or conservation tillage. A review found tillage had negative effects on invertebrate numbers and no-till systems had more invertebrate bird food resources.\\nTwenty-six studies (of which 13 replicated and controlled and three also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found reducing tillage had either negative, no effect or no consistent effects on abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates (other than earthworms), earthworm abundance, biomass, or species richness, number of different plant species found as seeds, number of some weed species, mammal abundance, some bird species, and one study found bird preferences for conservation tillage fields decreased over time. Two studies found that crop type affected the number of weeds under different tillage regimes.\\nOne small replicated trial in the UK compared bird numbers under two different forms of reduced tillage, and found more birds from species that make up the \\u2018Farmland Bird Index\\u2019 on broadcast than non-inversion tillage fields.\\nTwo studies looked at the long-term effects of reduced tillage on earthworms (after ten years).

Two replicated studies from the USA found more earthworms in soils without tillage compared to soils with tillage (action 2306).\n\n**Reduced tillage**: Eleven replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Italy, Spain, and the USA found more microbial biomass in soils with reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage in some comparisons (actions 2307, 1371). One replicated site comparison from the USA found more earthworms in fields with fewer passes of the plough in one of three comparisons (actions 2307, 1371).\n\n**Cover crops**: Four replicated studies from France and the USA found more microbial biomass in soils with ground cover compared to bare or tilled soils in some or all comparisons (action 2304). Five replicated, randomized, controlled studies from the USA found more microbial biomass in soils with cover crops compared to soils without them in some or all comparisons (action 1345). One replicated, controlled study from the USA found more earthworms in soils with winter cover crops compared to soils without them (action 1345). Two replicated, randomized, controlled studies from the USA found more nematodes in soils with cover crops compared to soils without them in some comparisons (action 1345).\n\n**Organic fertilizers**: Four replicated studies from France, Italy, and Spain found more microbial biomass in soils with organic fertilizer compared to inorganic fertilizer in some comparisons (action 1366). One study from Italy found that compost increased microbial biomass (action 889).\n\n**Crop rotation**: Four randomized, replicated trials from Canada, Portugal and Zambia found that including legumes in crop rotations increased the number of microbes and diversity of different soil animals (action 857).",

Crop rotation has been shown to increase crop yields and improve crop quality, with one study from Italy finding more protein in wheat grown in rotation compared to continuously-grown wheat (action 1354). Planting crops in spring rather than autumn resulted in higher numbers of farmland birds, weed diversity or weed density and one arable weed species produced more fruit on spring-sown crops (action 137). Converting to or maintaining organic farming systems provides an alternative approach to conventional farming methods (action 460). Planting hedgerows for pest regulation shows promise, with one study from the USA finding that a higher proportion of pest eggs were parasitized in tomato fields with hedgerows compared to fields with weedy edges, and fewer pests in fields with hedgerows (action 1401). Managing the agricultural landscape to enhance floral resources, such as through pollen and nectar agri-environment agreements, can support beneficial insects like long-tongued bumblebees (action 362). In potato farming systems specifically, crop rotation reduced pest populations and crop diseases in at least one year or site in multiple studies, with three out of five studies finding that crop rotation increased crop yield in some years or with certain rotation crops (action 719).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available action documents, the effects of no-tillage in arable fields in Mediterranean climates show mixed results across different parameters:\n\n**Crop Yield Effects**: Studies from Mediterranean regions show varied yield responses to no-tillage. Eight replicated, controlled studies from Italy and Spain found higher crop yields with no-tillage compared to conventional tillage in some or all comparisons, while seven studies from Italy, Lebanon, Spain, and the USA found lower crop yields with no-tillage in some or all comparisons (Action 1355). Three studies from Spain found higher cereal yields with no-tillage compared to reduced tillage, while one study found lower cereal yields in some comparisons (Action 1358). Studies on fruits and vegetables from Italy found lower yields with no-tillage compared to reduced tillage in some comparisons (Action 1358).\n\n**Soil Health Effects**: No-tillage systems demonstrate positive effects on soil organic carbon, with all twelve studies from various regions including Europe finding higher soil organic carbon in no-tillage or reduced tillage systems compared to conventionally tilled soil (Action 906). Eight studies found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage (Action 906). Four trials found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage (Action 906).\n\n**Water Availability Effects**: Results are mixed for water-related parameters. Six controlled studies from Egypt and Spain found more water in soils with reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage in some or all comparisons, though two of these studies also found less water in some comparisons (Action 1386). Two studies from Spain and Turkey found that crops used water more efficiently with reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage in some comparisons (Action 1386). One study from Egypt found faster water infiltration rates with reduced tillage in some comparisons (Action 1386).\n\n**Pest Numbers Effects**: Weed populations show increased numbers under no-tillage systems. Seven replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Italy, Lebanon, Spain, Turkey, and the USA found more weeds in plots with reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage in some or all comparisons (Action 1399). However, four replicated, controlled studies from Italy, Lebanon, and Spain found fewer weeds in plots with no-tillage compared to reduced tillage in some or all comparisons (Action 1398). One study from the USA found similar numbers of diseases and pest insects in plots with reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage (Action 1399).",

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done.

    "relevant_summary": "Several conservation actions can be implemented along watercourses on Mediterranean farmland to benefit biodiversity. Buffer strips alongside water courses (rivers and streams) show evidence of positive effects, with three studies from the Netherlands and UK reporting that riparian buffer strips positively influenced plant, invertebrate and bird diversity or abundance, and supported vegetation associated with habitats preferred by water voles (Action 120). However, two replicated site comparison studies from France and Ireland found that riparian buffer strips on farms did not result in increased plant species numbers compared to farms without buffer strips (Action 120). Planting new hedges along watercourses provides evidence for biodiversity benefits, with five studies showing that established hedgerows had higher species richness of butterflies and macro-moths than in-field beetle banks, crops or pasture, and six studies finding higher abundance of butterflies, moths, macro-moths and gatekeepers along hedgerows compared to grass margins without hedgerows or field interiors (Action 3976). Creating or restoring wetlands and ponds along watercourses also shows promise, with studies finding that wetland creation increased macroinvertebrate diversity and that created wetlands were colonized by multiple amphibian species (Actions 3949, 880, 878). For pond restoration specifically, studies found that pond restoration and creation increased numbers of amphibian species, maintained or increased populations, or increased pond occupancy and breeding success (Action 878). However, evidence gaps exist for some actions - no studies were found evaluating the effects of establishing riparian buffers to reduce pollutants on marine and freshwater mammal populations (Action 2882), and no studies evaluated effects of preventing pollution from agricultural land entering watercourses on bat populations (Action 2015).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from Mediterranean and related studies, several management actions show promise for mitigating soil greenhouse gas emissions while others appear harmful:\n\n**Most Promising Actions:**\nNo-tillage practices demonstrate strong potential for greenhouse gas mitigation. Studies from Mediterranean countries found that no-tillage systems generally increase soil organic matter compared to conventional tillage (Action 1369), and one meta-analysis specifically from Mediterranean countries confirmed higher organic matter in no-tillage soils. Some studies found reduced greenhouse gas emissions with no-tillage compared to reduced tillage (Action 1370). Reduced tillage also shows benefits, with multiple Mediterranean studies finding increased soil organic matter and some evidence of reduced carbon dioxide emissions compared to conventional tillage (Action 1371).\n\nUsing organic fertilizers instead of inorganic fertilizers shows mixed but generally positive results. Multiple studies from Spain found lower nitrous oxide emissions with organic fertilizers, and some studies found that organic fertilizers enhanced methane absorption by soils (Action 1366). However, some studies also found higher carbon dioxide emissions with organic fertilizers.\n\n**Actions with Mixed Results:**\nAdding compost to soil increases organic matter and soil stability consistently across Mediterranean studies, but also increases greenhouse gas emissions in some cases (Action 1362). Crop rotations show inconsistent effects on greenhouse gas emissions - one study found lower nitrous oxide and methane emissions, while another found higher carbon dioxide emissions (Action 1368).\n\n**Potentially Harmful Actions:**\nAdding slurry to soil appears problematic for greenhouse gas mitigation. Multiple Spanish studies found higher carbon dioxide emissions and higher nitrous oxide emissions in soils with added slurry compared to soils without it, with five of six studies showing increased nitrous oxide emissions (Action 1365). Adding manure to soil also shows concerning results, with studies finding higher carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions compared to soils without manure (Action 1363).",

One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention.

    "relevant_summary": "Several management practices can improve soil aggregation and stability on Mediterranean farmland beyond organic amendments. Cover crops grown beneath main crops or between crop rows can increase soil stability, with studies from Spain and the USA showing reduced erosion and highest soil stability under grass cover (Action 897). Reduced tillage practices significantly improve soil aggregation, with multiple studies from Mediterranean countries showing higher water-stability of soil aggregates in reduced tillage systems compared to conventional tillage, and some studies finding more large aggregates (Action 1371). No-tillage systems also enhance soil stability, with studies from Spain and the USA demonstrating that soils without tillage were more stable than tilled soils in multiple comparisons (Action 1369). Crop rotation can contribute to soil stability improvement, with studies from Syria showing increased water infiltration and higher water-stability in rotated soils compared to continuous crops, particularly when legumes are included (Actions 857, 1368). Adding mulch to crops increases soil stability and reduces erosion according to studies from multiple countries including France and the UK (Action 887). Reducing grazing intensity helps prevent soil compaction and aids recovery, with studies from Australia showing compacted soils recovered when sheep were excluded for 2.5 years, and trials from Syria finding less sediment erosion when grazing time was reduced (Action 901).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on studies from Mediterranean orchards and vineyards, planting or maintaining ground cover for pest regulation shows mixed benefits and drawbacks. Benefits include: increased natural enemy numbers in some comparisons, with four replicated, controlled studies from Spain and the USA finding more natural enemies in plots with ground cover compared to plots without ground cover (Action 1395). One study found more natural enemies in plots with mown cover crops one week after mowing compared to before mowing (Action 1395). Studies show potential for increased parasitism of leafhopper eggs, though effects were inconsistent across different comparisons (Action 1395).\n\nHowever, significant drawbacks were documented: one replicated, randomized, controlled study from the USA found that more grapes were damaged by pests in plots with cover crops compared to bare fallows in some comparisons (Action 1395). For specific pest species, studies found inconsistent effects on leafhopper numbers, with some studies showing fewer leafhoppers in plots with cover crops while others found more leafhoppers or similar numbers (Action 1395). One study found more navel orangeworm moths in plots with resident vegetation compared to tilled soil in one of two comparisons (Action 1395). Additionally, competition effects were noted, with some studies finding more weeds in plots with cover crops compared to bare soil (Action 1395).\n\nNatural regeneration studies showed that effects varied between natural enemy groups, with some studies finding mixed effects where higher numbers of some natural enemy groups occurred but not others, and some studies found more pests in natural ground covers compared to sown ground covers (Action 720). Implementation approaches matter, as studies found fewer pests in plots with mown ground cover compared to unmown ground cover (Action 1395).",

    "relevant_summary": "The evidence regarding impacts of different grazing management strategies on invertebrate biodiversity shows mixed and limited results, with very few studies specifically focused on Mediterranean farmland contexts. From seasonal grazing strategies, one replicated, randomized, controlled before-and-after study in wet grasslands in the USA found more aquatic invertebrate species in continuously grazed plots compared to seasonally grazed plots in some comparisons (action 1421). For general grazing management, multiple studies show varied outcomes: two replicated studies in grasslands in the USA and Spain found more invertebrates in sheep-, goat-, or cattle-grazed plots compared to ungrazed plots in some or all comparisons, while one before-and-after study found that a threatened, endemic butterfly species did not recolonize a site after grazing was reintroduced (action 1419). Studies on grazer exclusion found that two replicated studies in wetlands and grasslands in the USA found more species or families of invertebrates in areas with cattle excluded compared to grazed areas for some or all groups, though one study found fewer aquatic invertebrate species in areas with cattle excluded in some comparisons (action 1417). Regarding grazing intensity, one replicated, randomized, controlled study in wet grasslands in the USA found more families of insects in streams in areas grazed by cattle at lower compared to higher intensities (action 1418). For rotational grazing, no studies specifically examined invertebrate responses, with available evidence limited to plant effects (action 1420). From broader evidence on reduced grazing intensity, studies from France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and the UK found that reducing grazing intensity increased invertebrate diversity and abundance in some cases (action 704). For butterfly and moth communities specifically, multiple studies from France, the USA and the UK showed that rotational grazing had variable effects on species richness and abundance compared to continuous grazing, with some studies finding benefits and others showing no difference (action 3965). The evidence base appears to be predominantly from temperate regions rather than Mediterranean farmland specifically, limiting direct applicability to Mediterranean contexts.",

Six studies (including three replicated controlled trials of which two randomized) found that excluding or delaying summer grazing increased plant species diversity, invertebrate abundance and benefited breeding Eurasian skylark. A review found a study that showed that removing autumn grazing after a silage cut increased the winter abundance of seed-eating birds. A review and a replicated controlled study from the UK\\u00a0found that reduced grazing intensity or seasonal removal of livestock increased the number of invertebrates, plant seed heads and foraging skylark, and that some bird species preferred plots with seasonal removal of livestock.\\nThree studies (including one randomized, replicated, controlled trial) from the Netherlands and the UK found no benefit to plants or invertebrates from reduced grazing intensity. One randomized, replicated controlled trial excluded grazing in autumn/winter and another study excluded grazing in the summer. A further study found that reducing grazing intensity throughout the year did not increase plant diversity.\\nNine studies from France, Germany and the UK reported mixed results for some or all species or wildlife groups considered (including one randomized, replicated, controlled trial and two reviews and a systematic review). Of these, eight studies found that reduced grazing intensity throughout the year benefited some species but not others, one found that the impact depended on the type of vegetation grazed, and one found benefits to bee and wasp abundance but not species richness. One study found that the response of birds to removal of summer grazing varied between functional groups and depended on time of year. A UK review found that reduced grazing benefited invertebrates, plants, rodents and some but not all birds. \\nA systematic review of the effects of grazing intensity on meadow pasture concluded that intermediate levels of grazing are usually optimal for plants, invertebrates and birds but that trade-offs are likely to exist between the requirements of different taxa.\"\n}"

Similarly, no-tillage systems (Action 1355) have demonstrated higher crop yields in some or all comparisons across studies from Italy and Spain.\n\n**Fertilization Strategies:** Adding compost to soil (Action 1346) has resulted in higher crop yields in studies from Italy, Spain, and the USA compared to plots without added compost, in some or all comparisons. Using organic fertilizer instead of inorganic (Action 1350) has shown higher yields in plots from Italy and Spain in some comparisons, though results were mixed with some studies showing lower yields.\n\n**Soil Amendment:** Amending soil using a mix of organic and inorganic amendments (Action 902) has increased maize yield in studies from China with mixed manure and inorganic fertilizer amendments.\n\n**Crop Management Practices:** Using crop rotations (Action 1354) has resulted in higher crop yields in studies from Italy, Spain, and Turkey compared to monocultures in some comparisons. Growing cover crops in arable fields (Action 1351) showed mixed results, with some studies from Spain and the USA finding higher cash crop yields with winter cover crops in some comparisons, while others found lower yields.\n\n**Orchard and Vineyard Management:** Planting or maintaining ground cover in orchards or vineyards (Action 1367) provides soil benefits including increased organic matter and nitrogen in soils, which can support crop productivity, as evidenced by studies from Chile, France, Spain, and the USA.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence from Mediterranean studies, the effectiveness of actions for improving crop quality varies considerably. For crop yield improvements, several actions show promising results: Crop rotations (action 1354) showed higher crop yields in Italy, Spain, and Turkey studies, and one study from Italy found more protein in wheat grown in rotation compared to continuously-grown wheat. Adding slurry to soil (action 1349) demonstrated consistent positive effects, with six studies from Spain finding higher crop yields in plots with added pig slurry. Cover crops (action 1351) showed mixed but often positive results, with three studies from Italy and the USA finding higher cash crop yields with winter cover crops, though effectiveness varied by implementation with legume cover crops generally outperforming non-legumes.\n\nFor no-tillage practices, results were highly variable. No tillage in arable fields (action 1355) showed eight studies from Italy and Spain finding higher crop yields in some comparisons, but seven studies found lower yields, indicating inconsistent effectiveness. One study from Italy found less protein in wheat grains from no-tillage plots, while one Spanish study found heavier cereal grains. No tillage instead of reduced tillage (action 1358) showed mixed results with three Spanish studies finding higher cereal yields but three Italian studies finding lower fruit or vegetable yields.\n\nFertilization approaches showed moderate effectiveness. Using organic fertilizer instead of inorganic (action 1350) produced mixed results with four studies from Italy and Spain finding higher yields in some comparisons, but three studies finding lower yields. Adding compost (action 1346) showed three studies finding higher crop yields in some or all comparisons, but effectiveness was inconsistent. Adding manure (action 1347) showed limited evidence with only one Greek study finding higher maize yields in two of three comparisons.\n\nActions with limited effectiveness for crop quality included planting flowers (action 1360), which showed only two studies with positive yield effects but no specific crop quality improvements documented. Ground cover in orchards/vineyards (action 1352) showed mixed results for crop yields but provided some crop quality benefits, with studies finding similar sugar contents in grapes and some improvements in grape weight and chestnut size.",

Manure application resulted in higher crop yields according to four controlled, replicated studies from India, Spain and Turkey (Action 911). In Mediterranean-specific research, studies from Spain found higher crop yields in plots with added pig slurry compared to plots without it (Action 1349). For compost, studies primarily from Spain and Italy are referenced, though specific yield comparisons are limited in the Mediterranean context. Studies from Spain found that cotton gin compost and poultry manure improved soil structure and reduced soil loss, while molasses addition improved nutrient retention and increased barley yield (Action 891). One study from Italy found that high rates of compost increased fruit yield (Action 889). When comparing organic amendments, research from Italy found more organic matter, nutrients, and microbial biomass in plots fertilized with compost compared to manure (Action 1366). Studies from Spain indicated that plots with slurry absorbed methane while plots with manure emitted methane (Action 1366). Mixed organic and inorganic amendments showed increased maize yields in controlled trials from China (Action 902), though this is outside the Mediterranean region. The research indicates that slurry and manure both effectively increase crop yields in Mediterranean conditions, while compost shows benefits for soil health and fruit production, with compost potentially providing greater soil benefits than manure alone.",

    "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4",
    "provider": null,
    "relevant_summary": "Based on studies from Mediterranean countries including Italy, Spain, Lebanon, and other Mediterranean regions, tillage systems show complex effects on weed populations with several key trade-offs. No-till versus reduced-till comparisons reveal mixed outcomes for weed management (Action 1398). Four studies from Italy, Lebanon, and Spain found fewer weeds in no-till plots compared to reduced-till in some or all comparisons, while two of these studies also found more weeds in some comparisons. One study from Australia found more weeds in no-till compared to reduced-till, and one Spanish study found similar weed amounts between systems. For weed species diversity, one Spanish study found fewer weed species in no-till versus reduced-till, while two studies from Italy and Spain found similar numbers of weed species between systems (Action 1398).\n\nWhen comparing no-till to conventional tillage, Mediterranean studies show predominantly increased weed pressure with no-till systems (Action 1397). Three studies from Italy and Spain found more weeds in no-till plots compared to conventional tillage in some comparisons. Four studies from Italy, Spain, and the USA found inconsistent differences, with sometimes more weeds in no-till and sometimes fewer. Only one Lebanese study found similar weed numbers between no-till and conventional systems. For weed species diversity, one Italian study found more weed species in no-till compared to conventional tillage, while three studies from Italy and Spain found similar numbers of species.\n\nReduced-till systems generally increase weed populations compared to conventional tillage (Action 1399). Seven studies from Italy, Lebanon, Spain, Turkey, and the USA found more weeds in reduced-till plots compared to conventional tillage in some or all comparisons. One study also found fewer weeds in reduced-till in some comparisons, while one Italian study found similar weed numbers between systems. Weed species diversity showed mixed results, with two studies from Spain and Turkey finding similar numbers of species between reduced-till and conventional systems, while one USA study found different weed community compositions.\n\nAdditional research from Mediterranean countries confirms that reduced tillage practices generally lead to increased weed challenges compared to conventional approaches (Action 126). Studies indicate that crop type can affect the number of weeds under different tillage regimes, suggesting that weed management trade-offs may vary depending on the specific crops grown in Mediterranean arable systems.",

No-tillage practices in arable fields provide benefits, with one replicated, randomized, controlled study from the USA finding more pollinators in plots with no tillage compared to deep tillage (action ID 1405). Planting hedgerows demonstrates multiple benefits for pollinators, with studies showing higher seed-set in canola plants due to flower visitation by native bees in fields next to planted hedgerows, higher crop visitation rates by native bees, and more bee species in fields with hedgerows or in hedgerows themselves compared to fields without hedgerows (action ID 1407). Restoring habitat along watercourses provides pollinator benefits, with one replicated, paired site comparison finding similar numbers of bees and bee species in restored and remnant sites (action ID 1408). Managing the agricultural landscape to enhance floral resources shows promise, with one large replicated controlled trial demonstrating that the average abundance of long-tongued bumblebees on field margins was positively correlated with the number of 'pollen and nectar' agri-environment agreements in a 10 km grid square (action ID 362). Planting dedicated floral resources on farmland has been evaluated, though one replicated trial shows that phacelia is not very attractive to wild bees in Greece (action ID 17).",

    "relevant_summary": "Evidence from US grassland studies shows varied impacts of different grazing management strategies on invertebrate and mammal biodiversity, though specific Mediterranean climate studies are limited in the available data.\n\nFor invertebrate biodiversity, multiple grazing strategies show different effects. Studies found that two replicated studies in grasslands in the USA found more invertebrates in sheep-, goat-, or cattle-grazed plots compared to ungrazed plots in some or all comparisons (Action 1419). However, one replicated randomized controlled study in grasslands in the USA found fewer invertebrates in plots with simulated grazing compared to ungrazed plots, but found similar numbers of invertebrate species (Action 1419). One before-and-after study in grassland in the USA found that a threatened, endemic butterfly species did not recolonize a site after grazing was reintroduced (Action 1419). Additionally, one replicated site comparison in forested grasslands found higher beetle diversity in grazed plots compared to ungrazed plots in one of two beetle groups (Action 1419).\n\nRegarding grazing exclusion effects on invertebrates, two replicated studies in wetlands and grasslands in the USA found more species or families of invertebrates in areas with cattle excluded compared to grazed areas for some or all groups (Action 1417). One replicated before-and-after site comparison in grasslands in the USA found that populations of a threatened, endemic butterfly declined in sites with cattle excluded, but also declined in cattle-grazed sites (Action 1417).\n\nFor reduced grazing intensity, one replicated randomized controlled study in wet grasslands in the USA found more families of insects in streams in areas grazed by cattle at lower compared to higher intensities (Action 1418). Studies on reduced stocking density found that eight replicated studies in the USA found that grasslands grazed with lower stocking densities had a greater abundance of all butterflies, butterflies with grass host plants, all moths, burnet moths, their caterpillars or specific species than grasslands grazed at higher stocking densities (Action 3959).\n\nFor rotational grazing, two of four replicated controlled studies in the USA found that rotational cattle-grazed grassland had a higher abundance of butterflies and burnet moths and caterpillars than continuously grazed grasslands, though one study only found this in the first of three years of management (Action 3965).\n\nFor mammal biodiversity, evidence shows that two replicated controlled studies in grasslands in the USA found that abundances of some or all rodents were higher, or increased more, on sheep- or cow-grazed plots compared to ungrazed plots, but they also found that some species were less abundant or monthly survival was lower on grazed plots (Action 1419). Two replicated site comparisons in deserts and grasslands found more mammal species in areas with cattle or sheep excluded compared to grazed areas, with one study also finding higher mammal diversity, and both studies found higher mammal abundance in areas with grazers excluded compared to grazed areas in some or all comparisons (Action 1417).",

For broader organic fertilizer comparisons in Mediterranean regions, four replicated studies from Italy and Spain found higher yields with organic fertilizer compared to inorganic fertilizer in some comparisons, while three studies from Spain and USA found lower yields, and three studies from Greece and Spain found similar yields (Action 1350).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"1349\",\n    \"1347\",\n    \"1348\",\n    \"1350\"\n  ]\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from studies conducted in Mediterranean countries, the most beneficial tillage practices for increasing soil organic matter in arable fields are:\n\nNo-tillage practices showed the strongest benefits for soil organic matter. A meta-analysis from Mediterranean countries found more organic matter in soils without tillage compared to soils with tillage (action 1369). Fourteen replicated studies from Italy, Spain, and the USA found more organic matter in soils without tillage compared to soils with tillage in some or all comparisons (action 1369). One replicated study from Spain found more organic matter in soils that had not been tilled for a long time compared to a short time (action 1369).\n\nReduced tillage also provides significant benefits. A meta-analysis from multiple Mediterranean countries found more organic matter in soils with reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage (action 1371). Eleven replicated studies from Italy, Spain, Syria, and the USA found more organic matter in soils with reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage in some or all comparisons (action 1371).\n\nWhen comparing no-tillage versus reduced tillage, three replicated studies from Spain found more organic matter in soils with no tillage compared to reduced tillage in some or all comparisons (action 1370).\n\nAdditional practices that enhance soil organic matter include retaining crop residues, which two randomized replicated trials from Australia and China found increases soil organic carbon and nitrogen when residues were retained (action 907). Growing cover crops also benefits soil organic matter, with two controlled trials from India and South Africa finding that soil organic matter increased under cover crops (action 897).\n\nThe use of organic fertilizers instead of inorganic fertilizers provides complementary benefits, with eight replicated studies including one meta-analysis from France, Italy, Spain, Turkey, and Mediterranean countries finding more organic matter in soils with organic fertilizer compared to inorganic fertilizer in some comparisons (action 1366).",

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate.

    "relevant_summary": "Based on studies from Mediterranean countries including Spain, Italy, Portugal, France, and Israel, several trade-offs of growing cover crops in arable fields have been documented regarding crop yield and water availability.\n\nRegarding crop yield impacts, studies show mixed results. Six replicated, controlled studies from Spain and the USA found lower cash crop yields in plots with winter cover crops compared to plots without them in some comparisons (Action 1351). However, three replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Italy and the USA found higher cash crop yields in plots with winter cover crops compared to plots without them in some comparisons (Action 1351). Eight replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Italy and the USA found inconsistent differences in cash crop yields between plots with or without cover crops (Action 1351). Seven controlled studies from France, Israel, Spain, and the USA found no differences in cash crop yields between plots with or without cover crops (Action 1351).\n\nConcerning water availability, the evidence shows competing effects. Seven replicated, randomized, controlled studies from the USA found less water in soils with winter cover crops compared to soils without them in some or all comparisons, while two studies found more water in soils with winter cover crops in some comparisons (Action 1357). Of two replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Spain, one found that cover crops used more water than bare fallows, and one found no difference in water use (Action 1357). Five controlled studies from France, Israel, Spain, and the USA found that less water was lost through drainage, runoff, or evaporation from plots with cover crops compared to plots without them in some or all comparisons, although one study from Spain found that more water was lost through drainage from plots with winter cover crops in some comparisons (Action 1357). Four replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Spain and the USA found that less nitrate was leached from soils with winter cover crops compared to soils without them in some or all comparisons (Action 1357).\n\nIn Mediterranean vineyard systems, studies from Spain, Italy, Portugal, and France show similar trade-offs. Two replicated, randomized, controlled studies from France and the USA found lower grape yields in plots seeded with grass between vine rows compared to plots with bare soil in some or all comparisons, while six studies from Italy, Portugal, Spain, and the USA found similar grape yields with or without ground cover (Action 1352). Four studies from Spain and the USA found less water or less available water in soils with seeded cover crops compared to tilled soils in some comparisons, while two studies from Portugal and the USA found more water or more available water in soils with ground cover compared to tilled soils in some comparisons (Action 1382). Six replicated, controlled studies from Chile, France, Italy, Spain, and the USA found that less water was lost as runoff from plots with seeded cover crops compared to bare or tilled plots in some or all comparisons (Action 1382).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence, several actions can increase natural enemies for pest regulation on Mediterranean farmland. Planting flower strips increases natural enemy numbers, with studies from Italy and the USA finding more natural enemies in fields with planted flower strips compared to fields without them (Action ID: 1400). Some flower species are more attractive to natural enemies than others, and planting more flower species results in more species of natural enemies over time (Action ID: 1400). Planting hedgerows also increases natural enemy populations, with studies from the USA finding more natural enemies in fields with hedgerows compared to fields with weedy edges, and higher ratios of natural enemies to pests in hedgerows (Action ID: 1401). Additionally, hedgerows result in a higher proportion of pest eggs being parasitized in tomato fields up to 100 meters into the crop (Action ID: 1401). Planting nettle strips in field margins increases the number of aphid predator species, with some insect families including green lacewings only found on nettles (Action ID: 118). Managing ant populations can also enhance natural enemies - excluding ants that protect pests leads to greater parasitism of pests by natural enemies in studies from Japan and the USA (Action ID: 886), while isolating colonies of beneficial ants results in predatory ants occupying more trees and providing better pest control (Action ID: 773). Reduced or no tillage practices in arable fields show some potential, with one study from the USA finding similar numbers of predatory mites in soils with reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage (Action ID: 1399, 1397). However, adding compost to soil showed mixed results, with one study finding similar percentages of pests consumed by natural enemies and similar ratios of natural enemies to pests in plots with or without added compost (Action ID: 1392).",

However, the available evidence contains limited direct comparisons between flowers and hedgerows specifically on Mediterranean farmland, with most hedgerow studies conducted in the USA rather than Mediterranean regions.\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"1406\",\n    \"1407\",\n    \"2468\",\n    \"2515\",\n    \"2313\"\n  ]\n}"
