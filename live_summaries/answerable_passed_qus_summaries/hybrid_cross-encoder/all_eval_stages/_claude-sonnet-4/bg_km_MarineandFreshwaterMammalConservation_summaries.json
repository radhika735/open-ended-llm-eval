    "relevant_summary": "The evidence for acoustic devices to reduce human-wildlife conflict shows different patterns between aquaculture systems and fishing gear applications. At aquaculture systems (Action 2775), six studies were conducted with four of six studies finding that acoustic devices at salmon farms reduced predation on caged salmon by grey seals, harbour seals and South American sea lions, or reduced the number of harbour seals approaching fish cages. However, two studies found that acoustic devices did not reduce harbour seal predation at salmon farms or reduce the presence, approach distances, group sizes or time spent around fin-fish farms by common bottlenose dolphins.\n\nFor fishing gear applications (Action 2808), thirty-three studies evaluated acoustic devices with more extensive evidence. In terms of human-wildlife conflict specifically, five of six controlled studies found that acoustic devices reduced damage to fish catches and/or fishing nets caused by common bottlenose dolphins and seals, while one study found acoustic devices did not reduce damage to swordfish catches by California sea lions. Additionally, acoustic devices on fishing gear showed broader benefits with nine studies finding reduced collisions or entanglements of various marine mammals including humpback whales, harbour porpoises, Franciscana dolphins, beaked whales and small cetaceans, though some studies found mixed results or no effect for certain species.\n\nThe evidence base for fishing gear applications (33 studies) is substantially larger than for aquaculture systems (6 studies). Both applications show predominantly positive but not universal effectiveness, with fishing gear studies demonstrating additional conservation benefits through reduced entanglements beyond human-wildlife conflict reduction. Related acoustic approaches include devices on fishing vessels (Action 2815) where one study found no reduction in predation of squid catches by Risso's dolphins, and acoustic decoys (Action 2820) where one study found limited effectiveness in diverting sperm whales from fishing lines.",

    "relevant_summary": "Evidence for interventions that directly manage individual mammals to boost threatened populations includes several approaches with varying degrees of success. Captive breeding and release programs show mixed results: captive-bred mammals generally have lower post-release survival rates than wild-born translocated animals, though populations of mountain gazelles, Corsican red deer, P\u00e8re David's deer, Eurasian otters and swift foxes increased following release (2476). Reviews found that over half of mammal release programs were considered successful, with 61% of macropod releases resulting in successful population establishment and 40% surviving over five years (2476). For marine mammals, two of three Antillean manatees and two of 14 Florida manatees born in captivity and released survived for at least one year (2933). Captive breeding itself shows promise, with the majority of 118 captive-bred mammal populations increasing in a global review (2471). Supplementary feeding to boost survival and reproduction shows positive results in some species: it increased abundance or density of bank voles, red squirrels, striped mice, brown hyena and black-backed jackals, and increased survival of mule deer, bank voles, northern flying squirrels and eastern cottontail rabbits (2367). Disease management interventions also show effectiveness: vaccination programs reduced rabies frequency in red foxes, reduced tuberculosis in Eurasian badgers, and halted a rabies outbreak in Ethiopian wolves, with red fox numbers increasing following anti-rabies vaccination (2582). Medical treatment healed most mouflons infected with foot rot disease (2581). Targeted removal of problematic individuals can benefit populations, as removing aggressive male Hawaiian monk seals increased survival of adult females and reduced injuries (2929). Providing artificial refuges during releases shows mixed success: some studies found higher abundances at sites with artificial burrows, while others found no difference (2453).",

Nine studies found that using acoustic devices on cod traps or fishing nets resulted in fewer collisions and entanglements, though effectiveness varied by location - one study in the North Sea and Baltic Sea found acoustic devices reduced harbour porpoise entanglements in one fishing area but not another.\n\nAcoustically reflective fishing gear materials (action 2807) show promise, with two controlled studies in the North Sea and Bay of Fundy finding that fishing nets made from acoustically reflective materials (iron-oxide or barium sulfate) had fewer entanglements of harbour porpoises than conventional fishing nets. However, one study found that nets made from barium sulfate did not reduce dolphin entanglements.\n\nExclusion and escape devices for mammals (action 2823) demonstrate effectiveness in some contexts, with controlled studies showing that installing exclusion and/or escape devices on trawl nets reduced the number of trapped or entangled marine mammals, though survival rates through escape hatches were variable with less than one third of common bottlenose dolphins exiting escape hatches alive.\n\nAdditional interventions include acoustic devices on moorings (action 2816), which reduced activity of harbour porpoises, short-beaked common dolphins and common bottlenose dolphins in some studies, and modified gillnet configurations (action 2701) which showed mixed results for reducing unwanted catch in Atlantic waters.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence, both catch protection devices on longlines and fishing pot modifications show mixed effectiveness for reducing human-wildlife conflict. For catch protection devices on fishing gear (including longlines), five studies evaluated their effects on marine mammals across the South Pacific, Indian Ocean, and Southwest Atlantic Ocean (Action ID: 2821). Two of four studies found that net sleeves or cage and chain devices on fishing hooks reduced damage to fish catches by sperm whales, killer whales and toothed whales. However, two other studies found that attaching 'umbrella' or 'spider' devices on fishing hooks did not reduce predation and/or damage to fish catches by sperm whales or toothed whales. One study found that catch protection devices made from streamers reduced dolphin predation on fish bait, but only during the first two trials (Action ID: 2821). For fishing pot modifications, six studies evaluated the effects of modifying fishing pots and traps to exclude mammals across various locations including the North Sea, Indian Ocean, and Baltic Sea (Action ID: 2822). Two controlled studies found that installing wire grids or steel bars on fishing trap-nets or bag-nets, along with strengthened netting, reduced damage to salmon catches by seals. One study found that one of two methods of securing crab pot doors with a bungee cord reduced dolphin interactions. Another study found that installing wire grids on trap-nets resulted in higher catches of undamaged salmon but not whitefish, likely due to reduced seal predation (Action ID: 2822). Both approaches also showed effectiveness in reducing unwanted catch and entanglements, with fishing pot modifications showing consistent results across studies in preventing marine mammals from entering or becoming trapped in pots (Action ID: 2822).",

Bubble curtains or screens can be used to dampen underwater noise emissions during pile driving, with one study in the North Sea showing that these methods resulted in harbour porpoise detections decreasing less within 15 km compared to sites without such mitigation measures (Action 2901). Hammer energy can be reduced during pile driving operations, though no studies have yet evaluated the effectiveness of this approach (Action 2900). Acoustic deterrent devices can be deployed to deter marine mammals from areas where noise exposure may occur, with studies in the North Sea, Great Belt, and Faxafl\u00f3i Bay showing these devices reduced harbour porpoise activity and sightings at distances of 1-18 km and caused minke whales to swim away, increase speed, and swim more directly (Action 2896). 'Soft start' procedures can be implemented to gradually increase noise levels, with studies in the South Atlantic, South Pacific, and UK waters showing that cetaceans avoided or moved away from vessels during these procedures, though responses varied among species (Action 2897). Operations can be delayed or ceased if marine mammals are detected within specified zones, though no studies have evaluated this intervention's effectiveness (Action 2898). Vessels can be modified to reduce noise disturbance, though again no studies have assessed this approach (Action 2904).",

One study in the Kenai Fjords (Alaska) found that training tourist guides resulted in fewer harbor seals being disturbed during kayak excursions (Action 2840).

    "relevant_summary": "The evidence for modifying fishing pots and traps to exclude mammals comes from six studies across various locations including the North Sea, Indian River Lagoon, Gulf of Finland, Bothnian Sea, Indian Ocean, and Baltic Sea (Action 2822). Two controlled studies found that installing steel rods on lobster pots or metal frames on fishing pots reduced the number of Australian sea lion pups or grey seals and harbour seals that entered or became trapped in pots (Action 2822). Additionally, four studies found that modifications such as installing wire grids or steel bars on fishing trap-nets or bag-nets, along with strengthened netting, reduced damage to salmon catches by seals and reduced common bottlenose dolphin interactions (Action 2822).\n\nIn comparison, the evidence for installing exclusion and/or escape devices on fishing nets comes from seven studies conducted in the Indian Ocean, Tasman Sea, and South Atlantic Ocean (Action 2823). The net-based approach showed mixed survival outcomes, with one study finding that less than one third of common bottlenose dolphins exited escape hatches on trawl nets alive, while another study found that fewer fur seals died in exclusion devices with large escape openings than in those with small openings (Action 2823). However, five studies found that installing exclusion and/or escape devices on trawl nets reduced the number of trapped or entangled Antarctic fur seals and common bottlenose dolphins, with one study showing reduced entanglements for three of four fishing vessels (Action 2823).\n\nBoth approaches demonstrate effectiveness in reducing unwanted marine mammal interactions, but the pot and trap modifications appear to focus more on preventing access entirely, while net-based devices aim to allow escape after initial capture. The evidence base is similar in size (six studies for pots/traps versus seven for nets), but the geographic distribution differs, with pot/trap studies more concentrated in northern waters and net studies more focused on southern oceans.",

Two site comparison studies in the Indian Ocean (South Africa) and South Pacific Ocean (Australia) found that baited lines used for shark control had fewer entanglements of dolphins, whales and dugongs than nets. Additionally, one study in the South Pacific Ocean found that using baited lines instead of nets increased the survival of entangled common and bottlenose dolphins (Action 2856).\n\nCatch and hook protection devices also show effectiveness in these regions (Action 2821). Studies in the South Pacific Ocean (Chile, Australia and Fiji) and Indian Ocean (Seychelles, Madagascar) found that using cage or chain devices on fishing hooks resulted in fewer unwanted catches of toothed whales, and that net sleeves or cage and chain devices on fishing hooks reduced damage to fish catches by sperm whales, killer whales and toothed whales.\n\nAcoustically reflective fishing gear materials provide another option (Action 2807), though evidence is limited for these specific ocean regions. Two of three controlled studies found that fishing nets made from acoustically reflective materials (iron-oxide or barium sulfate) had fewer entanglements of harbour porpoises than conventional fishing nets, though one study found that nets made from barium sulfate did not reduce dolphin entanglements.",

Additionally, no studies were found evaluating acoustic devices at cooling water intake structures, renewable energy sites, or moving vessels, indicating knowledge gaps in understanding potential trade-offs in these applications (actions 2751, 2748, 2761).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"2808\",\n    \"2815\",\n    \"2896\",\n    \"2816\",\n    \"2775\",\n    \"2751\",\n    \"2748\",\n    \"2761\"\n  ]\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents reviewed, several strategies are available to reduce the negative impacts of aquaculture systems on marine mammals. The most extensively studied strategy is the use of acoustic devices at aquaculture systems (Action 2775), where six studies found that four of six studies showed acoustic devices reduced predation on caged salmon by grey seals, harbour seals and South American sea lions, or reduced the number of harbour seals approaching fish cages, while two studies found acoustic devices did not reduce harbour seal predation or reduce the presence of common bottlenose dolphins around fin-fish farms. \n\nAnother strategy with some evidence is replacing or repairing damaged anti-predator nets around aquaculture systems (Action 2774), where one study in the North Atlantic Ocean found that replacing anti-predator nets more frequently at salmon farms resulted in fewer salmon losses to harbour seal predation.\n\nAdditional strategies identified include: introducing and enforcing regulations to prevent the use of harmful deterrents on mammals at aquaculture systems (Action 2746); modifying anti-predator nets around aquaculture systems (Action 2743); modifying aquaculture gear (Action 2742); minimizing food waste at aquaculture systems (Action 2744); reducing the amount of antibiotics used in aquaculture systems (Action 2878); introducing and enforcing water quality regulations for aquaculture systems (Action 2876); and using non-toxic antifouling coatings on surfaces (Action 2908).

    "relevant_summary": "Evidence for alternative methods to shark nets that reduce harm to marine mammals comes from studies in Australia and South Africa. Using baited lines instead of nets for shark control shows significant benefits: two site comparison studies in the Indian Ocean (South Africa) and South Pacific Ocean (Australia) found that baited lines had fewer entanglements of dolphins, whales and dugongs than nets (Action 2856). Additionally, one study in the South Pacific Ocean found that using baited lines instead of nets increased the survival of entangled common and bottlenose dolphins (Action 2856).\n\nOther alternative methods include installing exclusion and/or escape devices on fishing nets. Studies in the Indian Ocean (Australia, Tasmania) and Tasman Sea (Tasmania) demonstrate that these devices can reduce marine mammal entanglements: three studies found that installing exclusion and/or escape devices on trawl nets reduced the number of trapped or entangled Antarctic fur seals and common bottlenose dolphins, and one before-and-after study found that these devices reduced common bottlenose dolphin entanglements for three of four fishing vessels (Action 2823).\n\nAcoustic devices on fishing gear represent another alternative approach. Multiple studies including those in Moreton Bay (Australia), Rainbow Channel (Australia), and Indian Ocean (Australia) found that acoustic devices resulted in fewer entanglements or reduced interactions with nets for harbour porpoises, common bottlenose dolphins, and other marine mammals (Action 2808). Nine studies found that acoustic devices on fishing nets resulted in fewer entanglements of harbour porpoises, Franciscana dolphins, beaked whales and small cetaceans (Action 2808).",

Installing wire grids or steel bars on fishing trap-nets or bag-nets, along with strengthened netting, reduced damage to salmon catches by seals and resulted in higher catches of undamaged salmon (Action 2822). Using acoustic devices on moorings demonstrated effectiveness in one study, with deployment reducing the number of harbour seals feeding on migrating juvenile salmon (Action 2816).

Setting and enforcing vessel speed limits has demonstrated effectiveness, with studies showing that setting vessel speed limits during specific periods in key habitats resulted in fewer North Atlantic right whale deaths caused by collisions (Action 2777). Speed limit enforcement in all areas also showed fewer manatee deaths compared to partial enforcement in zones only (Action 2777).\n\nOther available actions include diverting shipping routes to avoid whale habitats (Action 2754), using observers on board vessels to detect mammals and allow vessel course or speed to be altered (Action 2755), and training vessel operators on appropriate avoidance techniques to reduce collisions (Action 3534). Technology-based solutions are also available, such as using real-time automated tools on board vessels to detect mammals and allow vessel course or speed to be altered (Action 2756), using remote tools to detect mammals in an area and allow vessel course or speed to be altered (Action 2757), and using technology and reporting systems to avoid collisions (Action 3535).\n\nAdditional vessel modifications include modifying vessels to reduce risk of physical injury to mammals (Action 2762) and reducing shipping along inland waterways (Action 2763). However, for most of these actions except speed limits, no studies have yet been found that directly evaluated their effectiveness on marine mammal populations.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the documented evidence, captive rearing and rehabilitation of marine mammals shows several benefits and some negative outcomes:\n\n**Benefits:**\nRehabilitation programs have achieved survival rates of 10-100% for dolphins, porpoises, whales, seals, sea lions and manatees during post-release monitoring periods ranging from three days to five years (Action 2925). Approximately three-quarters of captive-reared Antillean manatees and two-thirds of Florida manatees survived for at least one year after release, with some surviving for more than seven years (Action 2926). More than a quarter of rehabilitated Hawaiian monk seals reproduced after release (Action 2925). Most captive-reared Antillean manatees released into the wild reproduced (Action 2926). Captive-reared and released Pacific harbour seal pups had similar survival estimates to wild pups, with similar diving behavior to wild pups (Action 2926). Two of three Antillean manatees and two of 14 Florida manatees born in captivity and released into the wild survived for at least one year without further intervention (Action 2933). In captive breeding programs, 80% of common bottlenose dolphins born in captivity over two decades survived, with survival increasing with improved husbandry techniques (Action 2932).\n\n**Negative Outcomes:**\nSome rehabilitated animals died before or after release, had to be returned to captivity after release, or survived only with supplemental feeding, including three West Indian manatee calves, seven Hawaiian monk seal pups and one Antillean manatee calf (Action 2926). At least a quarter of California sea lions treated for toxic algae poisoning and released died or had to be euthanized (Action 2925). California sea lions treated for toxic algae poisoning showed altered behavior after release, traveling further from shore, spending less time diving or hauled out, and making shorter, shallower dives than wild sea lions (Action 2925). Most captive-born Amazon river dolphins, narrow-ridged finless porpoises and Irrawaddy dolphins did not survive in captivity (Action 2932). A population of Yangtze finless porpoises breeding in semi-captive conditions had low genetic diversity (Action 2932). Some captive-reared animals like a grey whale calf and five pygmy and dwarf sperm whale calves either were not released or died in captivity (Action 2926).",
