Two studies (including one review) in the UK\\u00a0reported that captive-bred large copper\\u00a0and belted beauty moth\\u00a0populations released as caterpillars (sometimes into managed habitat) died out one, two\\u00a0or 12\\u00a0years after release, or required further releases to survive. One replicated study in the UK\\u00a0reported that three of 10 captive-bred barberry carpet moth populations released as caterpillars (and in one case as adults) established, and at least one persisted for five years. One review across the UK and Ireland\\u00a0found that 25% of captive-bred and translocated butterfly populations survived for &gt;3 years, but 38% died out in that time, and only 8% were known to have survived for &gt;10 years.\\nReproductive success (2 studies): One study in the UK\\u00a0reported that after the release of a captive-bred population of large copper, the number of eggs laid/female increased over the first three years. One before-and-after study in the UK reported captive-bred adult pearl-bordered fritillaries released into coppiced woodland successfully bred at least once.\\nSurvival (3 studies): Three studies (including two replicated, site comparison studies and one review) in the UK\\u00a0and the UK and the Netherlands\\u00a0found that released, captive-bred large copper caterpillars had a lower survival rate than captive, wild\\u00a0or translocated caterpillars.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\"\n}"

In two studies, abundance of green frogs and/or American toads was higher where grazing occurred (746). A randomized, replicated, controlled before-and-after study found that excluding cattle from ponds did not increase numbers of eggs or larval survival of Columbia spotted frogs (746). A before-and-after study reported that pond restoration that included livestock exclusion increased pond use by breeding natterjack toads (746). In terrestrial plots, one replicated, controlled study found that grazed plots did not have higher natterjack toad abundance than ungrazed plots and had lower common toad abundance (780). In contrast, five studies (including four replicated) that implemented habitat management with reintroduction of grazing reported increased green toad populations, maintained or increased natterjack toad populations, and maintained common toad populations (780). A before-and-after study found similar declines in amphibian species under both traditional season-long and intensive-early cattle stocking, indicating no difference between these grazing regimes in that context (780).",

Restored wetlands in Canada and the USA were frequently similar to natural wetlands in amphibian abundance, numbers of species and species composition in most site comparisons, with some cases showing lower values or different composition [879]. Across North American and some additional studies, restoration often increased numbers of amphibian species and, in some cases, established breeding populations, though several studies found no increase or mixed effects; factors affecting outcomes included wetland size, proximity to source ponds and seasonality [879]. A review that combined restored and created wetlands reported that in the majority of cases these wetlands had similar or higher amphibian abundance or numbers of species compared to natural wetlands [879], and another synthesis combining created and restored wetlands reported many cases with higher or similar numbers of species or abundance relative to natural wetlands [880].",

Installing barrier fencing to guide amphibians to entrances is common and associated with decreased road deaths in most studies; one study found decreased deaths only when fencing was present [884]. Barrier design affects performance: fencing at least 0.6 m high was required to prevent green frogs and leopard frogs climbing over, while treefrogs and 10% of common toads climbed over fencing during breeding migrations [756].

For green toads, two before-and-after studies in Denmark found significant population increases, and a replicated before-and-after study in Sweden found 59% of created ponds were used and 41% supported reproduction [864]. More broadly for European toads, studies reported establishment of breeding populations by translocated or naturally colonizing toads (in one case in 33% of created ponds), natural colonization by common and midwife toads in 29\u2013100% of created ponds, no colonization by captive-bred garlic toads, and reproduction by midwife toads in 16% of created ponds; creating/restoring ponds alongside head-starting increased European fire-bellied toad populations [868]. Complementary European-focused evidence from multi-species studies indicates amphibians used 64\u2013100% of created ponds and reproduced in 64\u201368%, or used 8\u2013100% and reproduced in 2\u201362% depending on species (France, Netherlands, UK); pond creation (and restoration) maintained or increased populations or species numbers in Denmark, Estonia, and France; outcomes were influenced by pond age, permanence, vegetation, surrounding landscape, distance to existing ponds, and presence of fish (Austria, Denmark, Poland, Netherlands) [869].",

For natterjack toads, three studies (including a review) found translocated eggs, tadpoles, juveniles or adults established breeding populations at one site or in 30\\u201370% of cases; some efforts also released head-started or captive-bred animals or included habitat management; re-establishing on dune or saltmarsh was more successful than on heathland [859]. One replicated UK study found populations increased at sites established by translocations, particularly with replicated translocations of wild rather than captive-bred toads [859]. Two replicated, before-and-after studies found that translocating eggs or tadpoles resulted in breeding at 8\\u201370% of sites [859].\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"875\",\n    \"881\",\n    \"859\"\n  ]\n}"

Harvesting trees in small groups did not result in higher amphibian or salamander abundance than clearcutting, but the same meta-analysis found partial harvests (including group or individual tree harvests, thinning, and shelterwood) led to smaller reductions than clearcutting (844). Leave-tree harvesting, where a low density of trees is retained, did not result in higher salamander abundance than clearcutting (846). Compared to no harvesting, shelterwood, group harvesting, and leave-tree harvesting decreased salamander abundance and changed species composition; reproductive metrics (proportion of females with eggs, eggs per female, proportion of juveniles) were similar or lower in harvested plots including these treatments, depending on species and time since harvest (851, 844, 846).",
