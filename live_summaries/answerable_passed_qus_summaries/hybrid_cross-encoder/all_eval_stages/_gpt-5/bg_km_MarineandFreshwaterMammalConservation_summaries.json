Devices on fixed moorings reduced numbers or activity of grey and harbour seals, harbour porpoises, short-beaked common dolphins and common bottlenose dolphins, and reduced harbour porpoise echolocation activity, while the probability of porpoises approaching within 125 m increased over 10\u201311 days (ID: 2816). Devices attached to fishing gear led to animals approaching gear less closely, fewer encounters or interactions with nets or lines, and reduced activity or sightings in surrounding areas for porpoises, dolphins, and seals (ID: 2808).",

One replicated study in the South Atlantic (Brazil) reported that most captive-reared Antillean manatees released back into the wild reproduced [2926]. However, individual cases reported mixed outcomes: three West Indian manatee calves and one Antillean calf either died before or after release, had to be returned to captivity, or survived only with supplemental feeding, including a case in Guerrero Lagoon (Mexico) [2926]. For captive-bred releases, two studies reported that two of three Antillean manatees in Brazil and two of 14 Florida manatees in the USA survived for at least one year without further intervention [2933].",

On fishing gear, multiple controlled and before\u2013after studies reported reduced interactions or activity of several species near nets or lines and fewer entanglements for some taxa, though effectiveness varied by species, area, device coverage, and gear type, with some studies finding no significant effects (2808). At aquaculture systems, most studies reported reduced predation on caged fish or fewer approaches by seals, but some found no reductions in seal predation or dolphin presence/behavior around farms (2775). Devices on moorings reduced seal numbers or porpoise and dolphin activity in some studies, while others found no significant effects on migrating humpback whales; one study observed porpoises\u2019 proximity increasing over 10\u201311 days, and another reduced upstream seal numbers without reducing overall numbers (2816). On vessels, studies found dolphins and killer whales moved farther from boats or reduced foraging/socializing near vessels, yet one experiment found no reduction in depredation of catches; effects diminished after first exposure in one case (2815). For several applications\u2014moving vessels, renewable energy sites, and cooling water intakes\u2014no studies were found assessing population-level impacts or harms (2761; 2748; 2751). Across categories, community- and population-level responses were not assessed, and some studies reported reduced echolocation activity or behavior changes without demonstrating population benefits (2815; 2816). Overall, trade-offs include potential bycatch and conflict reduction in some contexts versus variable or short-lived effectiveness, species- and site-specific responses, behavioral disturbance (including reduced foraging/socializing or echolocation), lack of demonstrated population benefits, and evidence gaps in several settings (2808; 2775; 2816; 2815; 2761; 2748; 2751).",
