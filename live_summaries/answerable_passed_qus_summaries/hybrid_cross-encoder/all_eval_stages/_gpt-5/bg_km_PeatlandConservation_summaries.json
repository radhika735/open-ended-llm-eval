Herb cover frequently increased, especially sedges, cottongrasses, and some reeds/rushes; purple moor grass often decreased; total herb cover sometimes showed no change; in some comparisons herbs were more abundant in rewetted than in natural peatlands [1756]. Tree and shrub cover typically decreased or showed no change, but increases were reported in some fens and species-specific mixed responses occurred in at least one bog [1756]. Overall vegetation cover increased in some bogs, decreased in one fen, and was unchanged in another peatland [1756].

Five studies (one paired, controlled, before-and-after) in Finland, Sweden\\u00a0and Canada\\u00a0reported that rewetting bogs or fens had no effect on cover of non-Sphagnum mosses (or mosses/lichens). However, two controlled studies in bogs in Ireland\\u00a0and the UK\\u00a0reported that rewetting reduced cover of non-Sphagnum mosses\\u00a0or bryophytes. One site comparison study in Finland\\u00a0reported that a rewetted peatland had similar moss cover (Sphagnum and total) to a natural peatland, but another site comparison study in Canada\\u00a0reported that a rewetted bog had lower moss cover (Sphagnum and other) than nearby target peatlands.\\nHerb cover (25 studies): Twenty-one studies (including four replicated, paired, controlled) reported that rewetting (sometimes\\u00a0along with other interventions) increased cover of at least one group of herbs. These studies were in bogs, fens or other peatlands in the UK, Finland, Ireland, the Czech Republic, the USA, the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, China, Latvia, Poland, Canada\\u00a0and Spain. Specifically, rewetting increased other/total sedge cover in 13 of 15 studies, increased cottongrass cover in eight of nine studies, and increased reed/rush cover in five of seven studies. Three\\u00a0of four before-and-after studies in peatlands in the UK and Sweden reported that rewetting reduced purple moor grass cover; the other study\\u00a0reported no effect. One replicated site comparison study in forested fens in Finland\\u00a0reported that rewetting had no effect on total herb cover. Two site comparison studies in Europe\\u00a0reported greater herb cover in rewetted than natural peatlands (overall\\u00a0and sedges/rushes, but not forbs).\\nTree/shrub cover (13 studies):\\u00a0Ten\\u00a0studies (including two paired and controlled) in peatlands in Finland, the UK,\\u00a0Germany, Latvia\\u00a0and Canada\\u00a0reported that rewetting typically reduced (seven studies)\\u00a0or had no effect (six studies)\\u00a0on tree and/or shrub cover. Two before-and-after studies in fens in Sweden\\u00a0and Germany\\u00a0reported that rewetting increased tree/shrub cover. One before-and-after study in a bog in the UK\\u00a0reported mixed effects of rewetting on different tree/shrub species.\\nOverall vegetation cover (4 studies): Of four before-and-after studies (three also controlled) that examined the effect of rewetting on overall vegetation cover, two in bogs in Ireland\\u00a0and Sweden\\u00a0reported that rewetting increased it. One study in a fen in New Zealand\\u00a0reported that rewetting reduced vegetation cover. One study in a peatland in Finland\\u00a0reported no effect.\\nOverall plant richness/diversity (14 studies): Six studies (including one replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after) in Sweden, Germany\\u00a0and the UK\\u00a0reported that rewetting increased total plant species richness or diversity in bogs, fens or other peatlands. However, five studies found no effect: in bogs in the Czech Republic\\u00a0and Latvia, fens in Sweden\\u00a0and Germany, and forested fens in Finland. One study in fen meadows in the Netherlands\\u00a0found scale-dependent effects. One paired, controlled, before-and-after study in a peatland in Finland\\u00a0reported that rewetting reduced plant diversity. Of four studies that compared rewetted and natural peatlands, two in Finland\\u00a0and Germany\\u00a0reported lower species richness in rewetted peatlands, one in Sweden\\u00a0found higher species richness in rewetted fens, and one in Europe\\u00a0found similar richness in rewetted and natural fens.\\nGrowth (1 study):\\u00a0One replicated site comparison study in forested fens in Finland\\u00a0found that rewetting increased Sphagnum moss growth to natural levels.\"\n}"

Excluding or removing livestock from degraded peatlands has mixed vegetation responses across multiple bogs and fens: plant community composition sometimes showed no effect, with dry moorland plants favored only in drier bog areas when sheep were excluded [1734]. Herb cover typically showed no effect on key groups (including no effect on cottongrass in five studies and no effect on sedges in two), though rush cover increased in one Spanish poor fen after cattle exclusion alongside other interventions; overall herb cover increased in one Chilean site comparison with other interventions, while one Australian study found no effect on overall herb cover [1734].
