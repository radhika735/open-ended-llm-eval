Using cleaner wrasse as natural control agents showed mixed results: corkwing and goldsinny wrasse matched chemical treatments in controlling lice in one controlled study, while rockcook wrasse were ineffective in a replicated, controlled study (738). Freshwater bathing for AGD produced mixed outcomes in Australia: one study found reduced amoebae on gills lasting up to 10 days, while a replicated, controlled study found no difference from untreated fish (739). Altering lighting reduced lice loads in a replicated, controlled Norway study, with lower lice under low-intensity artificial or natural light and higher lice under more intense artificial light (741). Dietary approaches including probiotics, plant-based protein inclusion, and immunostimulants showed benefits: in Scotland, probiotics increased survival after bacterial challenges; in Norway, a diet with 28% plant protein reduced lice infection by 28% and adding beta-glucans reduced lice a further 28%; mannan oligosaccharides improved gut function and prevented soybean-induced enteritis (732). Vaccinations increased survival against multiple pathogens in controlled studies from Iceland, Norway, Australia, and Canada, including Aeromonas salmonicida spp. achromogenes, Yersinia ruckeri, marine flexibacteriosis, bacterial kidney disease, and infectious salmon anaemia (733). Selective breeding for resistance improved survival under infectious pancreatic necrosis exposure in a replicated, controlled Norway study (735).",
