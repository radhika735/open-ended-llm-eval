Six studies\\u00a0found similar fish species/richness between one and 20 years after all fishing was banned in protected areas, compared to fished areas. One systematic review in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans\\u00a0found no difference in species richness between unfished protected areas and fished areas. One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that the effects of prohibiting all fishing on fish species richness/diversity after 15 years varied with the sampling method used.\\n\\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (66 STUDIES)\\n\\nAbundance (64 studies): Thirty of 54 site comparison studies (18 replicated, eight replicated and paired, two before-and-after, one paired and before-and-after, and one replicated and before-and-after) in the Indian Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, Pacific Ocean, Tasman Sea, Coral Sea, Philippine Sea, Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and the Sulu Sea, found that marine protected areas that had been prohibiting all fishing for up to 25 years or more, had higher abundances (density and/or biomass) of all fish (total fish biomass, total fish density), fishery targeted fish species, non-fishery targeted fish species\\u00a0and all or most of the individual fish species/groups monitored, except fish densities (all or most)\\u00a0and non-fishery targeted species, compared to unprotected fished areas and/or partly-fished protected areas. The studies also found that in some cases where the total fish biomass or densities were higher in no-fished areas, the effect varied between individual groups of fish based on species family\\u00a0and/or position in the food chain, commercial target and non-target species, fish sizes, depth\\u00a0and habitat types. Eight studies found that inside protected areas prohibiting all fishing there were similar abundances of all fish, and all or most of the individual fish species/groups monitored, compared to fished areas between one and 20 years after implementation. The other sixteen studies\\u00a0found that the effect of prohibiting fishing in protected areas for three to 20 years on fish abundance varied between fish species or groups and on their fished status (fishery target or non-target)\\u00a0and/or position in the food chain. One also found that the effect varied with size or age of the protected areas. Five of six reviews (three systematic) across the world, in the Pacific and/or Atlantic Oceans\\u00a0and in unreported regions\\u00a0found that non-fished marine reserves with one to 27 years of protection had higher abundances of all fish, all fish and invertebrates combined\\u00a0and blue cod\\u00a0compared to fished areas, but there were differences between species/groups and fishing intensity outside reserves. The other review\\u00a0found that fish abundance varied between species in no-take marine reserves between one and 25 years old, and was affected by food chain position, level of exploitation and duration of protection. One replicated study in the Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found a long-term decline in the abundance/presence of eight of 12 shark and ray species inside an established (&gt;15 years) no-fishing protected area, however enforcement was poor. One before-and after, site comparison study in the Pacific Ocean, found no differences in overall fish abundance between a marine reserve closed permanently to fishing for five years and a closed area that was harvested for two years during the same period. One site comparison study in the Coral Sea\\u00a0found that in a no-take zone of an area protected for at least 10 years, fish abundance of four of six fish groups were similar to no-entry and fished zones, but two had lower abundance than the no-entry zone. One replicated, paired, site comparison study in the Tasman Sea\\u00a0found that in a non-fished marine park zone abundance of commercially targeted fish was higher than partly fished zones but lower than unprotected areas after four to eight years.\\nReproductive success (1 study): One site comparison study in the Mediterranean Sea\\u00a0found more eggs of four commercially targeted fish species inside a non-fished marine reserve enforced for three years than in fished areas outside the reserve.\\nSurvival (1 study): One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that prohibiting all fishing in a marine protected area for three years resulted in similar survival of red hind grouper, compared to fished areas.\\nCondition (20 studies): Two global review studies\\u00a0(one systematic) and two systematic reviews in the Pacific Ocean\\u00a0and the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans\\u00a0found that prohibiting all fishing in marine protected areas for one to 27 years resulted in larger fish overall\\u00a0and larger blue cod\\u00a0compared to fished areas, but there were differences between individual fish families or species. Eight of 11 site comparison studies (four replicated, one before-and-after, one paired, and one replicated and paired) in the Tasman Sea, Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, Atlantic Ocean, Java Sea\\u00a0and the Philippine Sea, found that non-fished protected areas had larger fish overall\\u00a0and larger individuals of all or most of the fish species/groups monitored, compared to fished areas, after one to 22 years. The other three studies\\u00a0found similar fish sizes of all or all but one species, compared to fished areas one to 16 years after all fishing was prohibited. Three site comparison studies (one replicated) in the Coral Sea, Caribbean Sea\\u00a0and the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that fish size in protected areas that had not been fished for six to more than 20 years, varied between fish species or food chain groups. One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that red hind grouper were larger, but had similar growth, in an area protected from fishing for three years compared to fished areas. One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that young lemon sharks in areas protected from fishing for 20 years had similar growth rates, but lower condition, than sharks in unprotected fished areas.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)\\u00a0\\n\\nBehaviour change (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in the Pacific and Indian Oceans\\u00a0found that surgeonfish and parrotfish inside established protected areas where fishing was prohibited, showed a similar avoidance response to fishing gears as in fished areas, and this increased with increasing fishing intensity outside the protected areas. One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that in non-fished areas protected for one and 24 years, fish grazing rates were higher compared to fished areas.\\n\\n\\u00a0OTHER (15 STUDIES)\\n\\nUse (7 studies): Four of six site comparison studies in the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0and the Tasman Sea\\u00a0found that marine protected areas where all fishing had been prohibited for at least five to 15 years, were used for a large proportion of time by shark and ray species\\u00a0and commercially important reef fish species, compared to fished areas, thus were provided protection from fishing. Two other studies\\u00a0found that time spent inside areas closed to all fishing for 20 years\\u00a0and over 30 years, varied between species and with size for three shark species\\u00a0and with size for giant trevally. One replicated study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that most individuals of five fish species remained inside a marine reserve zone closed to fishing over a nine-year period.\\n\\n\\nCatch abundance (2 studies): One of two site comparison studies in the Mediterranean Sea\\u00a0and Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found that commercial fish catch rates in small-scale traditional fisheries were highest closest to a marine reserve closed to all fishing for 22 years, and decreased with increasing distance from the reserve. The other study\\u00a0found that there was no increase in fish catch rates in commercially landed catch in the five years after a no-fishing zone was implemented in a co-managed protected area.\\nStock biomass (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that the stock biomass (the harvested portion of the population) of reef fish species was highest in enforced protected areas closed to all fishing, compared to various other area management regimes.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\nFishing mortality (2 studies): Two site comparison studies in the North Sea\\u00a0and Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found that prohibiting fishing in protected areas resulted in reduced commercial fishing mortality of corkwing wrasse tagged inside non-fished marine reserves compared to fished areas, and that the overall fishing mortality of grey reef sharks tagged inside protected areas was low.\"\n}"

One found that sites closed to all fishing had higher abundances of spiny lobsters and slipper lobsters after eight to ten years compared to fished sites. Two found that sites closed to all fishing for six to seven years had more European lobsters than sites where potting was allowed.

Two site comparison studies in the Caribbean Sea found that inside marine protected areas with a zonation system, abundances of adult queen conch increased over time in a zone closed to all fishing and were greater than in zones with fewer restrictions, but abundances of juvenile conch did not differ or vary differently between zones, after either five to eight years\\u00a0or 14 to 20 years.\\nMollusc condition (1 study): One site comparison study in the Caribbean Sea\\u00a0found that inside a marine protected area with a zonation system, the size of queen conch decreased similarly in the area prohibiting all fishing and in the area with fewer restrictions, after 14 to 20 years.\\nSponge abundance (1 study): One site comparison study in the Mediterranean Sea\\u00a0found that inside a marine protected area with a zonation system, the cover of sponges Cliona was higher at a site prohibiting all fishing for six years compared to sites where some fishing occurred.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\\n\\nCrustacean behaviour (1 study): One site comparison study in the Caribbean Sea\\u00a0found that, inside a marine protected area with a zonation system (year of designation unspecified), 80% of the lobster population occurring in the unfished area remained in the protected unfished area, and thus remained protected.\"\n}"

In the English Channel, a replicated, paired, controlled study found a square mesh codend caught fewer non-commercial invertebrates in one of two areas and similar amounts in the other compared to a standard diamond mesh codend [2136]. Also in the English Channel, trawl nets fitted with two large square mesh release panels and a square mesh codend caught fewer unwanted non-commercial invertebrates than standard trawls [2138]. Some European studies also reported improved size selectivity for several commercially targeted fish species with square mesh codends compared to diamond mesh, while others found no difference or effects that varied with fish body shape, and selectivity increased with mesh size for both mesh types; short-term survival after escape or capture was higher for some species in the Aegean Sea and Bristol Channel with square mesh compared to diamond mesh [2714].",

Five of six reviews (three systematic) across the world, in the Pacific and/or Atlantic Oceans\\u00a0and in unreported regions\\u00a0found that non-fished marine reserves with one to 27 years of protection had higher abundances of all fish, all fish and invertebrates combined\\u00a0and blue cod\\u00a0compared to fished areas, but there were differences between species/groups and fishing intensity outside reserves. The other review\\u00a0found that fish abundance varied between species in no-take marine reserves between one and 25 years old, and was affected by food chain position, level of exploitation and duration of protection. One replicated study in the Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found a long-term decline in the abundance/presence of eight of 12 shark and ray species inside an established (&gt;15 years) no-fishing protected area, however enforcement was poor. One before-and after, site comparison study in the Pacific Ocean, found no differences in overall fish abundance between a marine reserve closed permanently to fishing for five years and a closed area that was harvested for two years during the same period. One site comparison study in the Coral Sea\\u00a0found that in a no-take zone of an area protected for at least 10 years, fish abundance of four of six fish groups were similar to no-entry and fished zones, but two had lower abundance than the no-entry zone. One replicated, paired, site comparison study in the Tasman Sea\\u00a0found that in a non-fished marine park zone abundance of commercially targeted fish was higher than partly fished zones but lower than unprotected areas after four to eight years.\\nReproductive success (1 study): One site comparison study in the Mediterranean Sea\\u00a0found more eggs of four commercially targeted fish species inside a non-fished marine reserve enforced for three years than in fished areas outside the reserve.\\nSurvival (1 study): One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that prohibiting all fishing in a marine protected area for three years resulted in similar survival of red hind grouper, compared to fished areas.\\nCondition (20 studies): Two global review studies\\u00a0(one systematic) and two systematic reviews in the Pacific Ocean\\u00a0and the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans\\u00a0found that prohibiting all fishing in marine protected areas for one to 27 years resulted in larger fish overall\\u00a0and larger blue cod\\u00a0compared to fished areas, but there were differences between individual fish families or species. Eight of 11 site comparison studies (four replicated, one before-and-after, one paired, and one replicated and paired) in the Tasman Sea, Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, Atlantic Ocean, Java Sea\\u00a0and the Philippine Sea, found that non-fished protected areas had larger fish overall\\u00a0and larger individuals of all or most of the fish species/groups monitored, compared to fished areas, after one to 22 years. The other three studies\\u00a0found similar fish sizes of all or all but one species, compared to fished areas one to 16 years after all fishing was prohibited. Three site comparison studies (one replicated) in the Coral Sea, Caribbean Sea\\u00a0and the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that fish size in protected areas that had not been fished for six to more than 20 years, varied between fish species or food chain groups. One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that red hind grouper were larger, but had similar growth, in an area protected from fishing for three years compared to fished areas. One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that young lemon sharks in areas protected from fishing for 20 years had similar growth rates, but lower condition, than sharks in unprotected fished areas.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)\\u00a0\\n\\nBehaviour change (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in the Pacific and Indian Oceans\\u00a0found that surgeonfish and parrotfish inside established protected areas where fishing was prohibited, showed a similar avoidance response to fishing gears as in fished areas, and this increased with increasing fishing intensity outside the protected areas. One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that in non-fished areas protected for one and 24 years, fish grazing rates were higher compared to fished areas.\\n\\n\\u00a0OTHER (15 STUDIES)\\n\\nUse (7 studies): Four of six site comparison studies in the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0and the Tasman Sea\\u00a0found that marine protected areas where all fishing had been prohibited for at least five to 15 years, were used for a large proportion of time by shark and ray species\\u00a0and commercially important reef fish species, compared to fished areas, thus were provided protection from fishing. Two other studies\\u00a0found that time spent inside areas closed to all fishing for 20 years\\u00a0and over 30 years, varied between species and with size for three shark species\\u00a0and with size for giant trevally. One replicated study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that most individuals of five fish species remained inside a marine reserve zone closed to fishing over a nine-year period.\\n\\n\\nCatch abundance (2 studies): One of two site comparison studies in the Mediterranean Sea\\u00a0and Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found that commercial fish catch rates in small-scale traditional fisheries were highest closest to a marine reserve closed to all fishing for 22 years, and decreased with increasing distance from the reserve. The other study\\u00a0found that there was no increase in fish catch rates in commercially landed catch in the five years after a no-fishing zone was implemented in a co-managed protected area.\\nStock biomass (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that the stock biomass (the harvested portion of the population) of reef fish species was highest in enforced protected areas closed to all fishing, compared to various other area management regimes.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\nFishing mortality (2 studies): Two site comparison studies in the North Sea\\u00a0and Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found that prohibiting fishing in protected areas resulted in reduced commercial fishing mortality of corkwing wrasse tagged inside non-fished marine reserves compared to fished areas, and that the overall fishing mortality of grey reef sharks tagged inside protected areas was low.\"\n}"
