    "relevant_summary": "The most beneficial interventions for restoring shrubland vegetation after fire include allowing natural regeneration without active management, which has shown positive results across multiple studies. Specifically, allowing shrubland to recover after fire without intervention increased shrub cover or biomass in five before-and-after trials conducted in the USA, UK, and Norway. This passive restoration approach also resulted in sites having similar shrub cover to unburned areas and increases in heather height and protea species height. Studies showed increases in the cover of woody plant species and vegetation cover overall, though effects on plant species numbers were mixed. Natural regeneration was associated with decreases in grass cover and herbaceous species cover, suggesting successful transition toward shrubland communities. For active restoration interventions, replanting native vegetation has been studied extensively, with evidence showing planted native trees, shrubs, and grasses can achieve similar species richness and abundance of butterflies and other insects compared to naturally regenerating and remnant habitats, though results vary by location and specific planting approach. The evidence base strongly supports passive recovery approaches for shrubland restoration following fire.",

    "relevant_summary": "From the available research evidence, sowing seeds has shown mixed results for shrubland restoration. Five of six studies reported that sowing seeds increased shrub cover, with one study finding higher abundance of specific shrub species like Wyoming big sagebrush and another showing increased shrub seedling abundance (Action ID: 1698). However, one study found no increase in shrub cover, and some studies reported very low germination rates for certain species. Additionally, seed sowing sometimes increased grass cover and did not consistently improve native plant cover compared to other methods (Action ID: 1698, 1700).\n\nPlanting turf showed more consistent positive results in the studies examined. Two randomized controlled studies in heathland restoration found that planting turf from intact sites increased the abundance or cover of target heathland species (Action ID: 1703). These studies also showed increased seedling abundance for most heathland plant species and increased forb cover while reducing grass cover. One study indicated that larger turf samples were more effective than smaller ones for increasing plant species numbers (Action ID: 1703).\n\nWhen these methods were directly compared, one study found that planting California sagebrush shrubs combined with seed sowing did not increase native plant cover compared to either sowing seeds alone or planting shrubs alone (Action ID: 1700).\n\nThe evidence suggests that turf transplantation may provide more immediate and reliable results for shrubland vegetation restoration, particularly for heathland species, while seed sowing offers lower establishment rates but may be more practical for large-scale applications.",

Manure amendments demonstrate more consistent benefits across various soil types, including higher soil organic carbon levels (action 902, 911), improved soil structure and reduced soil loss when applied as composts (action 891), and increased microbial biomass and activity (action 911). Mixed organic and inorganic amendments were more effective than single amendments, showing higher microbial biomass, increased organic carbon, and better reduction of soil cracks (action 902).

Regarding impacts on shrubland vegetation, cutting increased the cover or biomass of heather in two studies, but did not increase heather cover or abundance of heather seedlings in two other studies. One study found cutting increased species richness of heathland plant species, while another found it increased species diversity without affecting species richness. Cutting also increased cover of wavy hair-grass and sheep's fescue in one study. Increasing livestock numbers has been proposed as another alternative intervention, but no studies have evaluated its effectiveness for bracken control in shrublands.

A replicated, controlled study found that corridors connecting forest patches were used by some bird species more than clearcuts between patches, and showed higher abundances of some birds in connected patches versus isolated ones (Action ID 160). Connectivity restoration measures have shown positive effects on some taxa, including decreased amphibian mortality when road viaducts restored wetland connectivity (Action ID 840) and maintained populations of 8 of 13 frog species when native vegetation corridors were retained (Action ID 853). Habitat connectivity restoration has demonstrated benefits for butterflies and moths, with four studies showing increased abundance of various species when connectivity between habitat patches was restored (Action ID 3934). Additionally, connecting areas of natural or semi-natural habitat showed some colonization by invertebrates and mammals, though results varied between taxa and colonization was often slow (Action ID 579).\\n\\nOverall, while there is evidence that habitat connectivity can benefit various species, there is a significant gap in research specifically focused on shrubland ecosystems and their response to corridor creation or maintenance in the context of human development impacts.\", \"action_ids\": [\"1617\", \"1610\", \"1618\", \"1739\", \"1543\", \"1677\", \"160\", \"840\", \"853\", \"3934\", \"579\"]}",

Studies from the USA, UK, and Norway found that allowing shrubland to recover after fire without active management increased shrub cover or biomass, with some sites achieving similar shrub cover to unburned areas. This passive approach also led to increases in heather height in Norway and increases in woody plant species cover in Spain and Portugal. However, effects varied by context - one study found no increase in shrub cover, and another found the number of woody plant species did not increase. Prescribed burning techniques are also used as a management tool, though primarily for maintaining or creating disturbance rather than post-fire recovery specifically. The evidence suggests that natural regeneration can be beneficial, though outcomes may vary depending on specific site conditions and the time frame considered.",

Topsoil addition has shown positive effects on heathland/shrubland restoration, with studies in the UK finding increased cover or abundance of heathland plant species, increased seedlings for a majority of heathland plants, and increased forb cover but reduced grass cover. A study in Spain found topsoil addition increased woody plant abundance, while research in Namibia showed increased plant cover and species richness, though still lower than undisturbed sites. Adding topsoil alongside planting/seeding was found to increase grass biomass but reduce forb biomass compared to topsoil alone. Organic matter addition demonstrated benefits including increased young tree species richness in Brazil, increased total plant cover in Portugal, and varied effects on understory plant cover in the USA. Soil amendment using mixed organic and inorganic materials showed increased microbial biomass and activity in five controlled trials from China, India, and Japan, plus increased soil organic carbon and nutrients. Amendment with fresh plant material or crop remains increased soil carbon levels in six studies from China, Denmark, and India, while also improving soil structure and reducing erosion in some cases. Fertilizer addition showed mixed vegetation responses, with most studies finding increased vegetation cover, though effects varied by plant group and species.",

Adding fertilizer alongside planting/seeding increased cover of shrubs and trees (action 1704). For heathland restoration specifically, topsoil removal combined with spreading heather litter resulted in higher butterfly abundance compared to sites without litter spreading (action 3946). Transplanting turf increased seedling abundance for a majority of heathland plant species (action 1703).
