Benefits include increased amphibian abundance, recruitment, survival and population growth. Four studies found that removing fish by catching significantly increased abundance of salamanders or frogs and improved recruitment, survival and population growth rate of cascades frogs. Eliminating fish using rotenone increased numbers of amphibian species, abundance and recruitment or newt populations in three studies. Fish exclusion using barriers increased weight gain of axolotls in one study, and pond drying to eliminate fish increased numbers of amphibian species and breeding success of frogs and newts.\n\nHowever, several harms and limitations were documented. One study found fish control had no significant effect on great crested newt populations and fish remained or returned within a few years. Fish control did not increase green toad breeding success in one study and fish were soon reintroduced. Most significantly, when rotenone was applied, many frogs died and a small number of newts showed symptoms of negative effects in two replicated studies. These findings demonstrate that while fish control can benefit some amphibian populations, the methods used can also directly harm amphibians and may not provide long-term solutions if fish reinvade.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on global reviews and studies, amphibian translocations show moderate success rates. One global review found that 35 of 54 (65%) amphibian translocations resulted in established breeding populations or substantial recruitment to the adult population. Another review found that success rates were higher when translocations involved over 1,000 animals, but success was not related to whether animals were from wild or captive sources, life-stage, continent, or reason for translocation.\n\nFor specific amphibian species, studies on natterjack toads showed variable results: translocated eggs, tadpoles, juveniles, or adults established breeding populations in 30-70% of cases. Head-starting programs for amphibians showed mixed success, with six of ten studies finding that released head-started animals established breeding populations or increased populations, while two studies found mixed results and two found no establishment of breeding populations.\n\nHowever, captive-bred green and golden bell frog releases showed poor outcomes, with studies finding that captive-bred frogs released mainly as tadpoles did not establish breeding populations, or only established stable breeding populations following one of four release programmes. Overall, while some amphibian translocations achieve success, the establishment of new populations through either translocation or release of captive-bred individuals appears to be challenging, with success rates varying significantly between species and programs.",

One before-and-after study in the UK reported captive-bred adult pearl-bordered fritillaries released into coppiced woodland successfully bred at least once.\\nSurvival (3 studies): Three studies (including two replicated, site comparison studies and one review) in the UK\\u00a0and the UK and the Netherlands\\u00a0found that released, captive-bred large copper caterpillars had a lower survival rate than captive, wild\\u00a0or translocated caterpillars.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\"\n}"

Six of eight studies testing treatment with itraconazole found it effective at curing amphibians, while one study found it reduced infection levels and one found mixed effects. Temperature treatment is another effective approach, with four of five studies finding that increasing temperature to 30-37\u00b0C for over 16 hours cured frogs and toads of chytridiomycosis. Wild treatment approaches have shown more limited success - treating wild midwife toads with fungicide along with pond drying reduced infection levels but did not eradicate chytridiomycosis. Adding salt to ponds was found to keep a population of green and golden bell frogs free of chytridiomycosis for at least six months. However, vaccination with formalin-killed chytrid fungus did not significantly reduce infection rates or mortality in mountain yellow-legged frogs. Some treatments also carry risks, as six studies found that specific fungicides caused death or other negative side effects in amphibians.",

Hormone treatments to induce sperm and egg release have demonstrated success in stimulating reproduction, with studies showing male hormone treatment can stimulate or increase sperm production and result in successful breeding in captivity (Action ID 883, 3767). However, hormone treatments show variable results for females, with 30-71% producing viable eggs depending on the combination, amount, or number of doses of hormones (Action ID 883). Some studies found that hormone treatment did not stimulate egg production in certain cases. Artificial fertilization has also shown limited success, with one Australian study finding 55% of eggs were fertilized artificially but soon died (Action ID 834). The key challenge identified is that the success of artificial fertilization depends on the type and number of hormone doses used to stimulate egg production beforehand (Action ID 834). Both techniques require careful optimization of hormone protocols, and neither approach guarantees consistent breeding success across different frog species in Australian captive programs.",

One review found that 41% of release programmes for captive-bred or head-started amphibians showed evidence of breeding in the wild for multiple generations, with 29% showing some evidence of breeding. Head-starting involves rearing amphibians from eggs to later life stages (tadpoles, metamorphs or juveniles) before release, with six of ten studies finding that released head-started individuals established breeding populations or increased existing populations. Nine of ten studies found that head-started amphibians released at various life stages successfully metamorphosed, survived their first season or year, or bred successfully. Captive breeding programs can be enhanced using hormone treatments to induce sperm and egg release, with nine of ten studies showing successful stimulation of male sperm production and mixed but generally positive results for female egg production. These techniques allow for population establishment or augmentation without the need for creating new pond habitats.",

    "relevant_summary": "Several alternatives to clearcutting have been studied for their effects on amphibian populations. Thinning trees within forests showed mixed effects: some studies found higher amphibian abundance in thinned forests compared to clearcuts, while others found mixed effects depending on species, life stage, and time since harvest. A meta-analysis of 24 North American studies found that partial harvest methods (including thinning) resulted in smaller reductions in salamander populations than clearcutting. Shelterwood harvesting was found to result in higher, similar, or initially higher and then similar salamander abundance compared to clearcutting, with the same meta-analysis showing smaller population reductions than clearcutting. However, shelterwood harvesting still decreased salamander abundance compared to unharvested forests in some studies. Harvesting trees in small groups did not result in higher amphibian or salamander abundance compared to clearcutting, though the meta-analysis again showed smaller reductions than clearcutting. Selective harvesting showed mixed effects on different species, with some being more abundant and others less abundant compared to both control stands and other management types. Patch retention harvesting had limited evidence regarding amphibians, with one study finding that red-legged frogs did not show significant movement towards retained tree patches, though large patches were selected more than small ones. Leaving coarse woody debris in forests showed no significant difference in abundance for most amphibian species between clearcuts with debris retained or removed.",

Creating artificial hibernacula or aestivation sites has shown some positive results, with one replicated before-and-after study in the UK finding that providing artificial hibernacula along with other terrestrial habitat management maintained populations of great crested newts, and another replicated study finding that created hibernacula were used by common frog and smooth newts (Action 759). Creating refuges through adding coarse woody debris to forest floors had mixed effects, with two replicated controlled studies in the USA and Indonesia finding no effect on amphibian species numbers or overall abundance, but one before-and-after study in Australia found that restoration including reintroducing coarse woody debris increased frog species (Action 772). Artificial refugia were found to be used by translocated Hamilton's frogs and hellbenders in two studies (Action 772). Creating ponds specifically for amphibians has been extensively studied, with 28 studies finding that amphibians used some or all created ponds, and creation of ponds maintained and increased amphibian populations in several European and North American studies (Action 869). Adding woody debris to ponds, encouraging aquatic plant growth as refuge against fish predation, and creating refuge areas in aquatic habitats are potential actions, though no studies were found that directly tested their effects on amphibian populations (Actions 814, 796, 813). Providing specific enclosure furniture such as rotting logs and hollow bamboo pipes promoted egg laying in frogs in one replicated study in Fiji (Action 1876). Leaving coarse woody debris in forests showed complex effects, with some studies finding no significant difference in abundance for most species when debris was retained versus removed, but other studies finding positive effects on survival and migration (Action 843).",

Fourteen studies (one replicated) in South Africa, the USA, the Netherlands, Italy, France\\u00a0and Spain found that following translocation, populations of warthogs, Eurasian beavers, red squirrels, roe deer, Alpine ibex, Iberian ibex, Cape mountain zebra, 22 species of grazing mammals, black bears, brown bear, bobcats\\u00a0and most populations of river otters\\u00a0increased. Two reviews in South Africa\\u00a0and Australia\\u00a0found that reintroductions (mainly through translocations) led to increasing populations for four of six species of large carnivores\\u00a0and that over half of translocations were classified as successful. One replicated study in the USA and Mexico\\u00a0found that translocating desert bighorn sheep did not increase the population size. Two studies (one replicated) and a review in USA and Canada, the USA\\u00a0and Australia\\u00a0found that translocated American martens, and sea otters\\u00a0at four of seven sites, established populations and that translocated and released captive-bred macropod species\\u00a0established populations in 44 of 72 cases. A study in Italy\\u00a0found that following the translocation of red deer, the density of Apennine chamois in the area almost halved. A worldwide review\\u00a0found that translocating ungulates was more successful when larger numbers were released, and small populations grew faster if they contained more mature individuals and had an equal ratio of males and females.\\nReproductive success (16 studies): A controlled study in Italy\\u00a0found that wild-caught translocated Apennine chamois reproduced in similar numbers to released captive-bred chamois. Fourteen studies (four replicated) in Canada, the USA, Zimbabwe, South Africa, the UK, Italy, the Netherlands\\u00a0and Slovakia\\u00a0found that translocated black and white rhinoceroses, warthogs, common dormice, European ground squirrels, cougars, bobcats, brown bears, sea otters, river otters\\u00a0and some Eurasian otters\\u00a0reproduced.

Five of four studies (two replicated, four controlled) and two reviews in Canada, Canada and the USA, the USA, Italy, Sweden\\u00a0and Africa, Europe, and North America\\u00a0found that wild-born translocated swift foxes, European otters, black-footed ferret kits\\u00a0and a mix of carnivores\\u00a0had higher survival rates than released captive-bred animals.

The other two studies found that two of 10 translocated white rhinoceroses\\u00a0died within three days of release and an American marten\\u00a0population did not persist. A review in Australia\\u00a0found that over half of translocations, for which the outcome could be determined, were classified as successful. Two of three studies (one replicated) and one review in Sweden, the UK, the Netherlands\\u00a0and the USA and Mexico\\u00a0found that following release of wild-caught translocated and captive-bred animals, European otters\\u00a0and common dormice\\u00a0survived three months to seven years. The review found that most black-footed ferret\\u00a0releases were unsuccessful at maintaining a population. A replicated study in the USA\\u00a0found that following translocation of bighorn sheep, 48\\u201398% of their offspring survived into their first winter.\\nCondition (3 studies): Three studies (including one replicated, controlled study) in the USA\\u00a0and Italy\\u00a0found that following translocation, populations of elk\\u00a0had similar levels of genetic diversity to non-translocated populations, descendants of translocated swift fox\\u00a0had genetic diversity at least as high as that of the translocated animals and brown bear\\u00a0genetic diversity declined over time.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (9 STUDIES)\\n\\nUse (7 studies): A study in Italy\\u00a0found that following translocation, Alpine ibex used similar habitats to resident animals. Two of four studies (including one randomized, controlled study) in the USA, Netherlands\\u00a0and Botswana\\u00a0found that following translocation (and in one case release of some captive-bred animals), most Eurasian otters\\u00a0settled and all three female grizzly bears\\u00a0established ranges at their release site.

However, one study found no population establishment from captive-bred and head-started toads. For Puerto Rican crested toads, survival was notably low with 25% being predated within two days of release.\n\nIn terms of captive breeding success, Mallorcan midwife toads achieved 85% survival to metamorphosis, though toads bred for nine or more generations showed slower tadpole development and decreased genetic diversity.
