    "relevant_summary": "To increase soil organic matter in Mediterranean vineyards, you can implement several evidence-based actions. Planting or maintaining ground cover in vineyards significantly increases soil organic matter according to ten studies from Mediterranean and similar climates (Action 1367). This practice also enhances soil microbial biomass and reduces erosion. Adding compost to vineyard soils consistently increases organic matter levels, as demonstrated in twelve studies from Mediterranean countries including Italy and Spain (Action 1362). Using reduced tillage practices shows strong benefits for soil organic matter, with fourteen Mediterranean studies finding increased organic matter compared to conventional tillage (Action 1371). Additionally, growing cover crops during fallow periods and amending soils with manures or compost (Action 911) effectively builds soil organic carbon and nutrient levels. Retaining crop residues on vineyard soils also contributes to higher soil organic carbon and nitrogen content (Action 907). These practices work synergistically and can be combined for maximum benefit in Mediterranean vineyard conditions.",

Multiple replicated, controlled studies from Mediterranean countries including Spain, France, Italy, and Chile found that maintaining ground cover significantly reduces soil erosion in orchards and vineyards. Six replicated studies from these regions showed less erosion with ground cover compared to bare or tilled soils in some or all comparisons. The benefits were greatest with permanent cover crops compared to temporary ones.\n\n2. **Growing cover crops between crop rows** (Action ID: 897). Studies from France and the USA demonstrated reduced erosion under cover crops. One randomized replicated study specifically found that cover crops reduced soil loss, with soil stability being highest under grass cover.\n\n3. **Adding compost to the soil** (Action ID: 1362). Two controlled studies from Spain found less soil erosion with added compost compared to soils without compost in some or all comparisons. Compost application also improved soil stability and increased organic matter content.\n\nThese soil conservation measures are particularly effective because they not only reduce erosion but also improve soil structure, increase organic matter content, enhance water retention, and support beneficial soil organisms including microbial biomass and mycorrhizal fungi.",

Sixty-four individual studies show some benefits to one or more wildlife groups.\\n\\n\\nSixty-five individual studies reported the effects of flower strips on invertebrates. Of these, fifty reported positive effects. Forty-one studies from eight European countries (including five reviews and twenty-three replicated controlled studies, of which one randomized and two site comparisons) found evidence that flower strips had a positive influence on invertebrate numbers with increased abundance, species richness/diversity, or both. Ten studies (nine replicated of which two controlled) found invertebrates visited or foraged on flower strips but did not specify increases/decreases in numbers. Two studies found effects on ground beetles other than changes in numbers. One replicated controlled study showed that ground beetles were more active or had enhanced feeding/reproductive conditions in flower strips. A review found flower strips supported ground beetle species that were rarely found in crops. Fifteen studies reported mixed or negative effects of flower strips on invertebrates. Six studies found no significant effects.\\n\\n\\nTwenty-one studies looked at the effects of flower strips on plants. Sixteen studies from seven European countries (including ten replicated controlled studies of which one randomized) found evidence that flower strips had higher plant cover, number of flowers, diversity, and species richness. One review found flower strips benefited plants but did not specify how. Four studies found negative or no effects of flower strips on the number or diversity of plant species.\\u00a0Five studies described the effects of different margin establishment or management techniques on plants.\\n\\n\\nSeven studies investigated birds and wildflower strips. Four replicated, controlled studies from Switzerland and the UK (two of which were randomized) and one review of European studies found evidence that plots sown with a wildflower or legume seed mix had a positive influence on birds. Flower strips attracted more birds or bird species and the number of birds using flower strips increased over time. Eurasian skylarks preferentially foraged in, and nested in or near, sown weed patches and were less likely to abandon their territories when they included sown weed patches. However one replicated trial in Switzerland found barn owls avoided sown wildflower areas. Two winter recording periods of the same replicated, controlled study in the UK found there were not more bird species or individuals on wildflower plots compared to control margins.\\n\\n\\nAll five studies investigating the effects of wildflower strips on small mammals (four replicated studies from Switzerland and one review of studies from north-western Europe) found evidence that small mammals benefit from strips sown with wildflowers or flowers rich in pollen and nectar, with increases in abundance, density and species richness.

    "relevant_summary": "Evidence from multiple studies shows varied effects of different grazing management strategies on plant biodiversity. Reducing grazing intensity has been found to increase plant species diversity and abundance in several replicated controlled studies (Action 704). The use of grazers to manage vegetation shows mixed results, with some studies finding higher plant cover and abundance with cattle, sheep, or goat grazing compared to ungrazed plots, while other studies found lower cover or no difference (Action 1419). Using fewer grazers resulted in higher cover of some plant species in areas with lower grazing intensities, though plant diversity responses were inconsistent across studies (Action 1418). Seasonal grazing showed different effects on plant cover and diversity depending on timing, with some studies finding differences in species number and diversity between plots grazed at different times (Action 1421). Rotational grazing demonstrated limited evidence, with one study finding higher native plant cover after adoption, while another found no difference in plant density but more reproductive stems under rotational grazing (Actions 1420, 3965). Excluding grazers entirely showed complex effects, with 32 studies finding higher biomass, cover, or abundance of some plant groups in ungrazed areas, while 14 studies found lower abundance of some plant groups, and plant diversity responses varied significantly (Action 1417). Ceasing grazing to allow early succession revealed that grasslands abandoned for different time periods showed varying species richness compared to grazed grasslands, with some studies finding higher richness in abandoned grasslands and others finding lower richness (Action 3956). The evidence consistently indicates that Mediterranean grassland plant biodiversity responses to grazing management are highly context-dependent, varying with grazing intensity, timing, and specific environmental conditions.",

Six studies (including three replicated controlled trials of which two randomized) found that excluding or delaying summer grazing increased plant species diversity, invertebrate abundance and benefited breeding Eurasian skylark. A review found a study that showed that removing autumn grazing after a silage cut increased the winter abundance of seed-eating birds.

One replicated, site comparison study in Switzerland\\u00a0found that meadows mown at least twice/year after mid-June had a similar species richness of butterflies to sown wildflower strips.\\n\\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (16 STUDIES)\\n\\nAbundance (16 studies): Five of ten site comparison studies (including nine replicated studies) in Germany, the USA, Russia and Finland, Italy, Spain\\u00a0and the Czech Republic\\u00a0found that semi-natural grasslands had a similar abundance of butterflies generally, and individual species of butterflies\\u00a0and moth caterpillars, when managed by extensive sheep, sheep and goat, cattle\\u00a0or livestock\\u00a0grazing compared to annual\\u00a0or occasional\\u00a0mowing, or rotational mowing or burning. Four of these studies found that grasslands managed by cattle, sheep\\u00a0or livestock\\u00a0grazing had a higher abundance of butterflies generally, and individual species of butterflies\\u00a0and moth caterpillars, than grasslands managed by annual mowing, rotational burning\\u00a0or unmanaged grasslands. Three of these studies found that grasslands managed by haying had a higher abundance of individual butterfly species\\u00a0than grasslands managed by grazing\\u00a0or burning\\u00a0or unmanaged grasslands. Four of these studies found that specific butterfly species\\u00a0and all butterflies\\u00a0were less abundant in mown, grazed\\u00a0or rotationally burned\\u00a0grassland than in unmanaged, rotationally burned\\u00a0or grazed and burned grassland.\\u00a0The ninth study found that in some areas, the abundance of specialist and grassland butterflies was higher in prairies managed by two-year rotational haying or by grazing, but in all cases abundance was higher at sites longer after they were last managed. One of three replicated, site comparison studies in Germany\\u00a0and Switzerland\\u00a0found that traditional hay meadows mown once/year in June or July had a higher abundance of heath fritillary adults and caterpillars than old, abandoned meadows. One study found that summer-grazed or mown grasslands had a higher abundance of farmland butterflies and burnet moths, but a lower abundance of woodland butterflies and burnet moths, than abandoned grasslands. The third study found that mown grasslands had a lower abundance of moths than unmown grasslands, but grazed grasslands had a similar abundance of moths to ungrazed grasslands. Two replicated, site comparison studies in China\\u00a0and Switzerland\\u00a0found that semi-natural grasslands managed by grazing\\u00a0or cutting twice/year after mid-June\\u00a0had a lower abundance of marsh fritillary eggs and caterpillars\\u00a0and adult butterflies\\u00a0than ungrazed margins and intercrops\\u00a0or sown wildflower strips. One replicated, site comparison study in Hungary\\u00a0found that semi-natural grasslands managed by either light grazing or mowing once/year in May or June had a higher abundance of butterflies than conventional wheat fields.\\nSurvival (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in China\\u00a0found that marsh fritillary eggs had a similar survival rate in uncultivated, grazed meadows and cultivated, ungrazed field margins and intercrops, but the survival of caterpillars was higher in the grazed meadows.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (5 STUDIES)\\nUse (5 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies in Austria\\u00a0and Germany\\u00a0found that 14 species of moth\\u00a0preferred grazed pastures while 24 others avoided them, and three species of butterfly\\u00a0and ten nocturnal moths\\u00a0preferred mown meadows, while 19 nocturnal moth species avoided them. One replicated, site comparison study in Spain\\u00a0found that meadows managed by summer-grazing or hay-mowing were more likely to be occupied by grizzled skipper and painted lady than unmanaged meadows, but small pearl-bordered fritillary occurred less frequently in grazed meadows than in hay meadows or abandoned meadows. One replicated, site comparison study in Finland and Russia\\u00a0found that three of 37 butterfly species preferred meadows which were mown annually in July or August to cattle-grazed pasture, but the other 34 species showed no preference. One replicated, site comparison study in China\\u00a0found that uncultivated, grazed meadows were less likely to be occupied by marsh fritillary eggs and caterpillars than cultivated field margins and intercrops.\"\n}"

Planting or maintaining ground cover in orchards or vineyards (action ID 1382) has been shown to reduce nitrogen, phosphorus, and dissolved organic carbon in runoff. Using reduced tillage in arable fields (action ID 1386) can improve water use efficiency and increase water infiltration rates. Providing buffer strips to reduce pesticide and nutrient run-off into margins, waterways and ponds (action ID 3894) helps create barriers that filter nutrients before they reach water bodies. Growing cover crops beneath main crops or between crop rows (action ID 897) increases soil stability and reduces erosion. Using crop rotation (action ID 857) can improve water infiltration when legumes are included in the rotation. Amending soil with manures and agricultural composts (action ID 911) has been shown to reduce nutrient loss while increasing nitrogen levels. Reducing grazing intensity (action ID 901) can decrease sediment erosion and maintain soil nutrient levels.",

A study from Spain (Action 1345) found higher soil quality in plots with long-term cover crops compared to short-term cover crops. For soil organic matter, multiple meta-analyses from Mediterranean climates (Actions 1345, 1367) found more organic matter in plots with ground cover compared to those without. In orchard and vineyard systems (Action 1367), permanent ground cover showed more organic matter compared to temporary ground cover in some comparisons, and an Italian study found the least erosion with permanent cover crops and the most erosion with temporary cover crops. For water outcomes (Action 1357), a Spanish study found more water in soils with long-term cover crops compared to short-term cover crops in some comparisons. The evidence consistently demonstrates that longer-term cover crop implementation leads to improved soil quality, increased organic matter, reduced erosion, and enhanced water retention in Mediterranean agricultural systems.",

Positive effects included increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms, greater abundance of some invertebrates other than earthworms, increased numbers of some weeds and/or weed species, higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying date and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields, and greater abundance of some birds - including Eurasian skylark, seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in late winter on non-inversion or conservation tillage. A review found tillage had negative effects on invertebrate numbers and no-till systems had more invertebrate bird food resources.\\nTwenty-six studies (of which 13 replicated and controlled and three also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found reducing tillage had either negative, no effect or no consistent effects on abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates (other than earthworms), earthworm abundance, biomass, or species richness, number of different plant species found as seeds, number of some weed species, mammal abundance, some bird species, and one study found bird preferences for conservation tillage fields decreased over time. Two studies found that crop type affected the number of weeds under different tillage regimes.\\nOne small replicated trial in the UK compared bird numbers under two different forms of reduced tillage, and found more birds from species that make up the \\u2018Farmland Bird Index\\u2019 on broadcast than non-inversion tillage fields.\\nTwo studies looked at the long-term effects of reduced tillage on earthworms (after ten years). One study found higher earthworm biomass under reduced tillage, the other study found earthworm abundance was the same between conventional and reduced tillage plots.\\nThree of the studies mentioned above did not distinguish between the effects of reducing tillage and reduced pesticide and/or fertilizer inputs.\"\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from Mediterranean farmland studies, several actions show effectiveness for increasing beneficial soil organisms:\n\n**No tillage systems** consistently demonstrate positive effects on soil organisms. Studies from Italy and Spain showed increased microbial biomass in no-tillage soils compared to tilled soils (Action 2306). Additionally, no-tillage systems resulted in more earthworms, as found in studies from the USA (Action 2306).\n\n**Reduced tillage practices** also prove beneficial for soil organisms. Studies from Italy, Spain, and the USA found increased microbial biomass in reduced tillage systems compared to conventional tillage (Action 2307). One study also found more earthworms in fields with fewer plough passes (Action 2307).\n\n**Cover cropping** significantly enhances soil biological activity. Studies from the USA found more microbial biomass, more nematodes, and more earthworms in soils with cover crops compared to soils without them (Action 1345). Additionally, research from Spain showed more bacteria and fungi in soils with winter cover crops, while Italian studies found more beneficial mycorrhizal fungi spores and species (Action 1345).\n\n**Organic amendments** including manure and compost applications effectively boost soil organisms. Studies from the UK and USA showed higher microbial biomass when manure or compost was applied (Action 911). Mixed organic and inorganic amendments also increased microbial biomass and activity in studies from China and India (Action 902).\n\n**Crop rotation systems** show mixed but generally positive effects. Portuguese studies found more fungi in soils with crop rotations compared to continuous crops (Actions 2305, 1368), while Italian studies showed increased microbial biomass in some comparisons with crop rotations (Actions 2305, 1368).",

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done.

Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done. One randomized, replicated study from Portugal found no effect of tillage treatment on yield.\\n\\u00a0\\nSOIL TYPES COVERED: anthrosol, calcareous silt loam, chalky, clay, clay loam, fine sandy loam, loam, loamy-clay, loam - sandy loam, loam \\u2013 silt-loam, loamy sand, loamy silt, non-chalky clay, sandy, sandy clay loam, sandy loam, sandy silt-loam, silt loam, silty, silty-clay, silty clay loam, silty loam.\"\n}"

The evidence shows that providing buffer strips alongside water courses (rivers and streams) has mixed effects on biodiversity. Three studies from the Netherlands and UK found that riparian buffer strips had positive effects on plant, invertebrate and bird diversity, supported water vole habitat, and increased invertebrate biomass. However, two replicated site comparison studies from France and Ireland found no increase in plant species numbers on farms with riparian buffer strips compared to those without. One study found that ground beetle diversity was higher in grazed riparian zones and narrow fenced strips than in wide riparian buffer strips, though the beetle assemblages in wide buffers were more distinct from adjacent pasture fields. Managing ditches to benefit wildlife showed more consistent positive results, with five out of eight studies from the Netherlands and UK finding increased invertebrate biomass, plant species richness, emergent plant cover, amphibian diversity, and bird visit rates. Creating or restoring waterways showed some benefits for reptile populations, with restored and pristine streams having similar turtle community composition and abundance in US studies.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on Mediterranean farmland studies, several management actions show different effects on soil greenhouse gas emissions. **Promising actions** that reduce emissions include: using organic fertilizer instead of inorganic fertilizer, which lowered nitrous oxide emissions in some studies (action 1366); no tillage systems that reduced greenhouse gas emissions compared to reduced tillage (action 1370); and compost addition in some cases (action 1362). Crop rotations showed mixed results but reduced nitrous oxide and methane emissions in one Australian study (action 1368). **Harmful actions** that increase emissions include: adding slurry to soil, which consistently increased nitrous oxide emissions (five of six studies) and carbon dioxide emissions (two of three studies) (action 1365); adding sewage sludge, which increased carbon dioxide emissions in both studies (action 1364); and reduced tillage systems that showed higher carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions compared to conventional tillage in some studies (action 1371). Grazing exclusion showed mixed effects with higher soil respiration (carbon dioxide) but lower methane emissions (action 1375).",

    "relevant_summary": "Besides adding organic amendments like compost or manure, several other management practices can improve soil aggregation and stability on Mediterranean farmland. Reduced tillage and no-tillage systems have been shown to increase soil aggregate water-stability compared to conventional tillage, with seven replicated studies finding that soils without tillage were more stable than tilled soils. Growing cover crops beneath main crops or between crop rows increases soil stability, with studies from France showing reduced erosion under cover crops and controlled studies demonstrating highest soil stability under grass covers. Maintaining ground cover in orchards and vineyards also significantly improves soil aggregation, with four replicated randomized controlled studies from Chile and Spain finding that soil aggregates were more water-stable in plots with seeded cover crops compared to tilled or bare soils. Retaining crop residues on fields reduces soil erosion and improves aggregation, as shown by a Canadian replicated site comparison study that found mixed effects on soil physical properties including the size of soil aggregates. Adding mulch to crops increases soil stability and reduces erosion, with five studies from India, France, Nigeria and the UK finding that mulches increased soil stability and reduced both soil erosion and runoff. Crop rotation practices can also enhance soil structure, with one replicated controlled study from Syria finding higher water-stability in soils with crop rotations compared to continuous crops.",

Six studies (including three replicated controlled trials of which two randomized) found that excluding or delaying summer grazing increased plant species diversity, invertebrate abundance and benefited breeding Eurasian skylark. A review found a study that showed that removing autumn grazing after a silage cut increased the winter abundance of seed-eating birds. A review and a replicated controlled study from the UK\\u00a0found that reduced grazing intensity or seasonal removal of livestock increased the number of invertebrates, plant seed heads and foraging skylark, and that some bird species preferred plots with seasonal removal of livestock.\\nThree studies (including one randomized, replicated, controlled trial) from the Netherlands and the UK found no benefit to plants or invertebrates from reduced grazing intensity. One randomized, replicated controlled trial excluded grazing in autumn/winter and another study excluded grazing in the summer. A further study found that reducing grazing intensity throughout the year did not increase plant diversity.\\nNine studies from France, Germany and the UK reported mixed results for some or all species or wildlife groups considered (including one randomized, replicated, controlled trial and two reviews and a systematic review). Of these, eight studies found that reduced grazing intensity throughout the year benefited some species but not others, one found that the impact depended on the type of vegetation grazed, and one found benefits to bee and wasp abundance but not species richness. One study found that the response of birds to removal of summer grazing varied between functional groups and depended on time of year. A UK review found that reduced grazing benefited invertebrates, plants, rodents and some but not all birds. \\nA systematic review of the effects of grazing intensity on meadow pasture concluded that intermediate levels of grazing are usually optimal for plants, invertebrates and birds but that trade-offs are likely to exist between the requirements of different taxa.\"\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence reviewed, several actions can increase crop yields on Mediterranean farmland. Reduced tillage in arable fields can lead to higher cereal yields in some cases, with studies from Egypt, France, Spain, and Turkey showing positive results (Action 1359). No tillage can also increase crop yields, with studies from Italy and Spain demonstrating higher yields compared to conventional tillage (Action 1355). Growing cover crops in arable fields can increase cash crop yields, particularly when legumes are used as winter cover crops compared to non-legumes (Action 1351). Crop rotations can increase crop yields compared to monocultures, with studies from Italy, Spain, and Turkey showing positive results (Action 1354). Soil amendments also show positive effects - adding compost to soil can increase crop yields, with studies from Italy, Spain, and the USA demonstrating higher yields in plots with added compost (Action 1346). Using organic fertilizer instead of inorganic can increase crop yields, with studies from Italy and Spain showing higher yields in some comparisons (Action 1350). Adding slurry to the soil can increase crop yields, with studies from Spain finding higher yields in plots with added pig slurry (Action 1349). Soil amendments with crops grown as green manures can increase grain yields, with studies from India and Pakistan showing increased yields when green manures were grown (Action 908). Amending the soil with bacteria or fungi can increase crop yields, with studies from India and Turkey finding higher yields (Action 888). Using organic fertilizer instead of inorganic can also improve soil conditions that support crop production, including increased organic matter, nutrients, and microbial biomass (Action 1366).",

    "relevant_summary": "The most effective actions for improving crop quality in Mediterranean arable fields include reduced tillage (Action 1359), which showed positive results in 9 out of 16 replicated studies from Mediterranean countries including Egypt, France, Spain, and Turkey, with higher cereal yields compared to conventional tillage. Organic fertilizer use (Action 1366) also demonstrated effectiveness, with 8 out of 13 replicated studies from France, Italy, Spain, Turkey, and Mediterranean countries showing increased soil organic matter, which is associated with improved crop quality. Cover crops (Actions 1351 and 1345) showed mixed but promising results, with some studies indicating higher crop yields and improved soil quality, particularly when legumes were used as cover crops compared to non-legumes.\n\nThe least effective actions include no tillage (Action 1355), which showed inconsistent results across 23 studies with 7 studies finding lower crop yields compared to conventional tillage, particularly in Mediterranean conditions. Crop rotations (Action 1368) demonstrated limited effectiveness, with 5 out of 9 studies showing reduced organic matter in soils compared to continuous crops, though results varied significantly across different Mediterranean regions. Integrated farm management (Action 169) showed no evidence of effectiveness, as no intervention-based studies were found to support crop quality improvements in Mediterranean conditions.",

Manure applications also demonstrated yield benefits, with studies from Greece and Turkey showing higher crop yields when manures or compost were applied (action IDs 911, 1347). Specifically, pig slurry applications in Spain consistently resulted in higher crop yields compared to plots without slurry (action ID 1349). When comparing organic versus inorganic fertilizers, studies from Mediterranean countries including Italy, Spain, and Greece showed mixed results: some found higher yields with organic fertilizers in certain comparisons, while others found similar yields between organic and inorganic treatments (action ID 1350). A direct comparison between compost and manure in Italy found that compost applications resulted in more organic matter, nutrients, and microbial biomass than manure (action ID 1366).

Positive effects included increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms, greater abundance of some invertebrates other than earthworms, increased numbers of some weeds and/or weed species, higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying date and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields, and greater abundance of some birds - including Eurasian skylark, seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in late winter on non-inversion or conservation tillage.

Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon.

    "relevant_summary": "Several actions besides planting flower strips show evidence of benefiting pollinators on Mediterranean farmland. Planting or maintaining ground cover in orchards and vineyards has been shown to provide benefits, with studies from Mediterranean olive orchards in Greece finding more bee species and deposited pollen grains in managed orchards with ground cover compared to abandoned orchards (1404). Reducing cutting frequency on grasslands has demonstrated positive effects for pollinators including butterflies and moths, with studies from Italy and Germany showing meadows cut once/year had higher species richness compared to those cut multiple times/year (3961). Vineyard management practices that encourage native plants and reduce chemical inputs have been shown to increase butterfly abundance in Spain (3919). No-tillage practices in arable fields have evidence of benefit, with studies finding more pollinators in plots with no tillage compared to deep tillage (1405, 2516). Creating or retaining hedgerows provides significant benefits for pollinator communities, with studies showing higher bee species richness and abundance in fields with hedgerows (2515). Managing landscapes to enhance floral resources has shown positive correlations with pollinator abundance (362), and providing set-aside areas in farmland has been documented to benefit various wildlife groups including pollinators (156). Diversifying ground vegetation and canopy structure around woody crops like olive groves has shown higher reptile diversity and abundance, indicating ecosystem benefits that could extend to pollinators (3526).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on multiple studies conducted in Mediterranean countries and similar climates, the most beneficial tillage practices for increasing soil organic matter in arable fields include reduced tillage and no-tillage systems. A meta-analysis from multiple Mediterranean countries found that both reduced tillage and no-tillage systems consistently increased soil organic matter compared to conventional tillage. Specifically, 14 studies found more organic matter in soils with reduced tillage versus conventional tillage, while a meta-analysis and 14 additional studies found more organic matter in no-tillage soils compared to tilled soils.\n\nConservation tillage practices are most effective when combined with crop residue retention and cover cropping. Retaining crop residues on fields was shown to increase soil organic carbon and nitrogen levels in multiple studies from Australia and China. Growing winter cover crops in arable fields significantly increased soil organic matter (measured as carbon) in Mediterranean-type climates, with a meta-analysis and ten controlled studies from Italy, Spain, and the USA demonstrating consistent benefits.\n\nThe research indicates that the combination of no-tillage or reduced tillage with residue retention and cover crops creates optimal conditions for soil organic matter accumulation. These practices work synergistically to reduce soil erosion, improve soil aggregation, and enhance microbial biomass. Implementation should be long-term, as studies showed higher soil quality and greater organic matter accumulation in plots with long-term conservation tillage compared to short-term implementations.",

Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion.

Regarding crop yield, the evidence from Spain and Italy shows mixed results: six studies found lower cash crop yields with winter cover crops compared to plots without them, while three studies found higher yields, eight studies showed inconsistent differences (sometimes higher, sometimes lower), and seven studies found no yield differences. The yield impacts varied by cover crop type, with legumes generally providing better outcomes than non-legumes.\n\nFor water availability, the evidence reveals several trade-offs: seven studies found less water in soils with winter cover crops, while two found more water in some comparisons. However, five studies found that less water was lost through drainage, runoff, or evaporation from plots with cover crops. Two Spanish studies showed conflicting results on water use - one found cover crops used more water than bare fallows, while another found no difference. The water content effects also varied with implementation, as Spanish studies found more water in soils with long-term versus short-term cover crops, and differences in water availability between different cover crop types.\n\nAdditional Mediterranean-specific findings include reduced nitrate leaching in Spanish studies with cover crops, and implementation options matter significantly - legume cover crops generally performed better for both yield and water conservation outcomes compared to non-legumes.",

Planting flowers and hedgerows has been shown to significantly increase natural enemy numbers, with studies from Italy finding more species and higher numbers of natural enemies in planted flower strips compared to bare ground. Creating beetle banks provides habitat for beneficial insects including ground beetles and other invertebrate natural enemies. Growing non-crop plants that produce chemicals attractive to natural enemies has been shown to increase parasitism and natural enemy numbers while reducing pest populations. Using reduced tillage practices may support natural enemy populations by preserving soil habitat, though effects vary by species. Allowing natural regeneration of ground cover beneath crops provides habitat and increases natural enemy numbers, with some studies finding more natural enemies in natural ground cover compared to bare ground. Adding compost to soil may help with disease suppression, though effects on natural enemies are mixed.",

Flower planting also increased wild bee species and individuals in some comparisons, though results varied for different pollinator groups (action 1406). Implementation studies from Italy and Spain showed that pollinator response to flower strips depended on the number and type of flower species planted, with some species being more attractive than others (actions 2468, 1406).\n\nPlanting hedgerows showed different benefits, with studies primarily from the USA (as no Mediterranean-specific hedgerow studies were found) demonstrating increased native bee species richness and crop visitation rates by native bees adjacent to hedgerows, though honey bee and syrphid fly responses were inconsistent (actions 1407, 2515). Hedgerows supported more bee species, syrphid fly species, and specialist bees compared to field edges without hedgerows (actions 1407, 2515). The effectiveness of hedgerows increased with age, with older hedgerows supporting more bee and syrphid fly species than younger ones (actions 1407, 2515).\n\nNeither intervention showed consistent effects across all pollinator groups, with flowers showing more variable results and hedgerows primarily benefiting native bees. The evidence base is limited for Mediterranean contexts, with most hedgerow studies originating from the USA.",
