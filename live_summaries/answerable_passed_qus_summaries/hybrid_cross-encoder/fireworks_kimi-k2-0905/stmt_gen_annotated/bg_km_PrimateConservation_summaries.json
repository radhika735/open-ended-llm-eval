    "relevant_summary": "The evidence base for conservation actions designed to mitigate the impacts of commercial logging on primate populations shows mixed results. For selective logging versus clear-cutting, one site comparison in Sierra Leone found that primate densities were higher in forest that had been logged at low intensity than in a forest logged at high intensity (Action ID: 1485). One before-and-after study in Madagascar found that the number of lemurs increased following selective logging (Action ID: 1485). However, one site comparison study in Uganda found that primate densities were similar in forest that had been logged at low intensity and forest logged at high intensity (Action ID: 1485). For community control measures, a site comparison study in the Democratic Republic of Congo found that community control was more effective at reducing illegal bushmeat hunting, including primates, compared to the nearby national park (Action ID: 1482). A before-and-after study in Cameroon found that no incidents of gorilla poaching occurred over three years after implementation of community control and monitoring of illegal activities (Action ID: 1482). A site comparison study in Nigeria found that there were more gorillas and chimpanzees in an area managed by a community conservation organisation than in areas not managed by local communities (Action ID: 1482). However, no evidence was found for the effectiveness of many other proposed conservation actions, including using set-asides for primate protection within logging areas, incorporating forested corridors or buffers into logged areas, providing domestic meat to logging workers to reduce hunting, closing non-essential roads after logging operations, reducing forestry team sizes, certifying forest concessions as primate friendly, implementing road blocks to inspect cars for illegal primate bushmeat, avoiding slashing of specific vegetation types, and implementing small and dispersed logging compartments.",

For orangutans, one study in Malaysia found that a majority survived reintroduction, while another controlled study found that the reintroduced population declined 33 years after release. In Belize, primate populations increased five years after reintroduction into habitat with existing species, while in Thailand, populations declined post-reintroduction. Sixteen studies across Brazil, French Guiana, Indonesia, Madagascar, South Africa, and other locations showed variable survival rates, with some finding majority survival for 2-12 months and others finding minority survival for 15 weeks to 7 years.

Additionally, all six monitored lemur species in Madagascar used bridges to cross roads and pipelines. For rope bridges between canopies, nine studies across Australia, Brazil, and Peru documented that rope bridges were used by a range of mammal species, with seven studies showing between three and 25 species utilizing the bridges. One study confirmed that arboreal marsupials using rope bridges did not experience high predation rates during crossing attempts.\n\nFor green bridges (overpasses), no evidence was found for effects specifically on primate populations, highlighting a significant research gap in this area. However, studies on general overpass structures for terrestrial mammals show promising results. Twenty-two studies found that overpasses were used by a wide range of mammals including rodents, carnivores, ungulates, bears, and marsupials, with four studies demonstrating that overpasses combined with fencing reduced vehicle-mammal collisions.

Studies found that primates born and reared in cages had poor survival outcomes: most golden lion tamarins did not survive over seven years or had higher mortality than wild-born tamarins, and more squirrel monkeys died or were returned to captivity compared to wild-born monkeys. Additionally, black-and-white ruffed lemurs reared in cages showed dietary patterns that did not overlap with wild lemurs. In contrast, primates born and raised in free-ranging environments showed better outcomes: two out of three black lion tamarins survived over four months, and black-and-white ruffed lemurs showed dietary overlap with wild lemurs. Primates with limited free-ranging experience showed mixed results: while most black-and-white ruffed lemurs died over five years, most western lowland gorillas survived over periods of nine months to four years.

One study in the UK\\u00a0reported that a captive population of marsh fritillary increased in size over two years. One study in Poland\\u00a0reported that all captive-reared scarce large blue caterpillars died within 35 days. One review\\u00a0reported that attempts to rear caterpillars of four species of large blue had mixed success.\\nReproductive success (5 studies): One controlled study in the UK\\u00a0reported that female large copper laid more eggs, and these eggs had a higher hatching success, in a cage kept in a greenhouse than in a cage kept outside. One study in South Africa\\u00a0reported that a Dickson\\u2019s copper butterfly laid eggs in captivity in the presence of black cocktail ants from the site where she emerged but not from 10 km away. One study in the UK\\u00a0found that female large white from a population kept in captivity for &gt;25 years laid more eggs than females from a population in its third generation in captivity. One study in the UK\\u00a0reported that Fisher\\u2019s estuarine moths successfully bred in captivity.

The sixth study\\u00a0found that mountain Alcon blue caterpillars had a similar survival rate in ant nests with or without queens present. Two of these studies, and one replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the USA, found that the survival of large blue, mountain Alcon blue\\u00a0and monarch\\u00a0caterpillars differed when reared in ant nests of different species\\u00a0or on different species of milkweed. Two site comparison studies in the UK\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0found that large copper\\u00a0and Puget blue\\u00a0eggs had a similar survival rate to the caterpillar\\u00a0and adult\\u00a0stage whether they were laid in captivity or collected from the wild and reared in captivity. One of these studies also found that Puget blue caterpillars kept in refrigerators while overwintering had a lower survival than caterpillars kept in environmental chambers or outside.

One study in South Africa\\u00a0reported that wild-caught final instar Cape Peninsula butterfly caterpillars reared in an artificial pugnacious ant nest successfully pupated and became adults, but captive-hatched first instar Cape Peninsula and Riley\\u2019s skolly butterfly caterpillars placed next to a nest did not survive to pupation.\\nCondition (5 studies): Two studies (including one controlled study) in the UK\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0found that adult large white from a population kept in captivity for &gt;25 years were heavier, and had smaller wings, than individuals from a population in its third generation in captivity, and captive-reared Puget blue adults were smaller than wild-caught butterflies. One of these studies also found that Puget blue caterpillars raised in environmental chambers or outdoor enclosures reached a similar size as adults. One replicated, controlled study in Spain\\u00a0found that mountain Alcon blue caterpillars reared in ant colonies with winged females were lighter than caterpillars reared in colonies without winged females. One replicated, controlled study in Israel\\u00a0found that spring webworm caterpillars fed vegetation from cattle-grazed pasture had a similar growth rate to caterpillars fed vegetation from an ungrazed paddock. One study in South Africa\\u00a0reported that Brenton blue butterfly caterpillars reared on Indigofera erecta leaves with no ants became dwarf adults, but those reared on whole Indigofera plants with an ant colony became full-sized adults.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\"\n}"

However, evidence from translocating other problem mammals (such as bears) away from residential areas provides relevant insights. Studies show that translocated mammals often have poor survival outcomes - fewer than half of black bears translocated from conflict situations survived after one year, and grizzly bears translocated away from conflict situations had lower survival rates than non-translocated bears. A significant drawback is that many translocated mammals return to their original capture locations and continue causing nuisance, with some black bears returning up to six times following translocation. In the case of leopards translocated from human-dominated areas, attacks on humans and livestock actually increased compared to before translocation. Brown bears that returned to capture areas continued to cause nuisance problems, suggesting that relocation may not effectively resolve human-wildlife conflict long-term.",

Rope or pole (canopy) bridges have documented success, with one study in Brazil showing black lion tamarins and capuchins used a pole bridge to cross a road, a before-and-after study in Belize finding that a black howler monkey population increased after pole bridge construction over man-made gaps, and a before-and-after study in Madagascar finding that all six monitored lemur species used bridges to cross roads and pipelines. Rope bridges between canopies were used by 3-25 species across nine studies in Australia, Brazil and Peru, with arboreal marsupials not suffering high predation rates when using them. For general road mortality reduction, barrier fencing along roads reduced mammal vehicle collisions in three controlled studies in the USA, Germany and Brazil, with two before-and-after studies in the USA finding that roadside fencing with one-way gates reduced deer-vehicle collisions. A review across the USA, Canada and Sweden found that longer roadside fencing led to greater reduction of collisions between large mammals and cars. However, road mitigation effectiveness varies by species and design, with some studies showing no significant effects. No evidence was found for primate-specific measures like speed limits in high primate density areas, speed bumps, or primate road signage.",
