Large ridges or ledges increased mussel and limpet abundance but not barnacles (Action ID: 3465).\n\nShore level: The vertical position on the intertidal zone influences outcomes. Studies found that habitat modifications had different effects on invertebrate abundance depending on shore level (Action ID: 3475, 3476).\n\nSite-specific factors: Local environmental conditions affect whether modifications increase invertebrate abundance. Multiple studies reported that the same habitat modifications had different effects depending on the site location (Action ID: 3459, 3464, 3469).\n\nSurface material: The construction material influences invertebrate colonization.

Creating rock pools and hole habitats that retain water during low tide can support invertebrate species absent from standard artificial surfaces (Action ID: 3476, 3467).\n\nPresence of existing organisms: Transplanting or seeding organisms onto structures can influence subsequent invertebrate colonization, with effects varying depending on the presence of grooves and small ridges on surfaces (Action ID: 3472).",

Site location is critical, with oyster survival varying between sites and being higher when transplanted into grooves compared with on ridges. The design of artificial structures significantly affects outcomes - creating pit habitats (1-50 mm) and grooves can enhance both oyster survival and broader biodiversity. Three studies found that oysters transplanted onto intertidal artificial structures supported macroalgae, mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate, and fish species that were absent from structures without transplanted oysters. However, the effectiveness depends on specific design features: survival in grooves versus on ledges varied by site, and the presence and size of grooves and small ridges on structure surfaces influenced species richness and abundance outcomes. Using environmentally-sensitive materials can also impact success, with some studies showing that alternative concrete compositions can alter community composition and species richness. The biodiversity benefits include increased mobile invertebrate species richness, though effects on fish abundance and species richness were generally not significant across multiple studies.
