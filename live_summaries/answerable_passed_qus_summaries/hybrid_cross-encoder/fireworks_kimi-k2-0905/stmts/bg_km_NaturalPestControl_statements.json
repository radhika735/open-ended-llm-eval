Five of six studies found higher abundance of butterflies, moths, macro-moths along hedgerows compared to beetle banks, grass margins without hedgerows, or field interiors. One study found reptile communities in cultivated areas with hedges were more similar to forest communities than areas without hedges. Beetle Banks - Multiple UK studies show beetle banks provide benefits to farmland biodiversity. Fourteen reports from eight studies found beetle banks provide some benefits to farmland biodiversity. Five reports found positive effects on invertebrate densities and higher ground beetle density and species diversity in spring and summer. One replicated study found beetle banks had higher densities of harvest mouse nests compared to field margins. However, effects varied between different invertebrate groups, with some studies finding lower invertebrate densities or no difference compared to other habitats. Alley Cropping - One controlled study from Canada found that intercropping with trees resulted in higher diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in sandy-loam soils. Field Size Reduction - One Canadian study found that agricultural landscapes with smaller fields had higher activity of six of seven bat species compared to landscapes with larger fields. The evidence shows these linear features generally enhance biodiversity, though effectiveness can vary by species group, season, and habitat type.",

For herbicide timing delays (action 774), two studies found more natural enemies when herbicide treatments were delayed, though benefits varied by enemy group and timing. However, delayed herbicide use also resulted in more weeds and showed mixed effects on insect pests - one study found more pests for some groups while another found fewer pests in some experiments. Yield effects were also mixed, with one study finding lower yields and another finding no effect. \n\nIn contrast, altering insecticide timing (action 723) showed more consistent benefits for natural enemies, with one study reporting more natural enemies when insecticides were sprayed earlier rather than later. For pest control, two of four studies found fewer pests or less disease damage when insecticides were applied early, though effects varied with insecticide type and two studies found no effect. Yield effects were mixed, with two studies finding mixed effects, one finding no effect, and one finding higher yields when insecticides were applied at times of suspected crop susceptibility. One study also found higher profits when insecticides were only applied at suspected susceptibility times.\n\nThe evidence suggests that altering insecticide timing may provide more consistent benefits for natural enemy conservation and pest control compared to delaying herbicide use, though both strategies show variable outcomes depending on specific conditions, pest types, and crop varieties studied.",

Action 123 provides evidence for controlling weeds without damaging other plants in conservation areas, showing that specific management regimes can reduce pernicious weeds, with cutting and fungal pathogen infection being effective for controlling creeping thistle, and lenient grazing providing long-term control. Mixed pasture (Action 721) was found to reduce weeds in two studies from the USA, with both randomized, replicated trials showing reduced weeds compared to monoculture pasture. Delaying mowing or first grazing date on pasture or grassland (Action 131) resulted in benefits including higher plant species richness and higher densities of rare arable weeds according to studies from the Netherlands, Sweden and the UK. Reducing chemical inputs in permanent grassland management (Action 459) was tested as an approach, though the evidence showed no increase in foraging birds attracted to pasture plots with no fertiliser compared to controls. Additional vegetation management approaches include using prescribed fire to maintain or restore disturbance in grasslands (Action 3882) and managing vegetation using livestock grazing (Action 2545), though these were primarily studied for their effects on butterflies/moths and mammals respectively rather than specifically for weed control.",
