Adding organic amendments such as composts, manures, and crop residues consistently improves nutrient retention. Specifically, incorporating straw or compost reduces nitrate leaching while increasing soil nitrogen levels. Growing cover crops between main crops or during fallow periods significantly reduces nitrate leaching and improves nutrient retention. Adding mulch to crops increases soil stability and reduces nutrient loss through erosion control. Using formulated chemical compounds like nitrification inhibitors can reduce nitrate losses and nitrous oxide emissions. Combining organic and inorganic amendments shows superior results for nutrient retention compared to either alone. Retaining crop residues rather than removing them helps maintain soil organic matter and reduces erosion, thereby preventing nutrient loss. These actions work by improving soil structure, increasing organic matter content, reducing erosion, and enhancing the soil's capacity to hold nutrients.",
