A replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the UK (action 3415) found that removing turf before sowing seeds increased both grass and forb species richness in most cases compared to simply disturbing the soil before sowing. Topsoil removal also showed additional benefits including increased plant community similarity to intact steppe, enhanced species richness of sown plants, and improved seedling survival rates (3415). However, soil disturbance alone also showed some positive effects, such as increased abundance or species richness of specialist and generalist plant species (1728) and increased heathland plant numbers when combined with spreading heathland plant clippings (1711). Both approaches can reduce unwanted species - topsoil removal reduced cover of perennial rye-grass (1711) and common knapweed (3415), while soil disturbance reduced wavy hair grass cover (1685).

For mowing management, one UK study (action 3419) found that cutting vegetation yearly after sowing seeds increased plant species richness compared to grazing with livestock, and another UK study found that cutting sown plots each year and removing cut vegetation increased sown grass and forb species richness compared to not removing cut vegetation. Mowing after seeding also increased the richness and abundance of sown forb species in UK studies, with more frequent mowing increasing abundance of multiple sown forb species. For grazing management after seeding, one UK study (action 3423) found that grazing with livestock reduced plant species richness compared to cutting vegetation after sowing, but increased sown species richness when cattle were used instead of sheep. However, cattle grazing reduced the cover of sown species compared to sheep grazing. One UK study found that grazing with livestock after sowing seeds reduced plant species richness compared to cutting vegetation after sowing, while winter grazing resulted in higher survival of cut-leaved cranesbill seedlings. The comparison between mowing and grazing cessation shows that ceasing mowing (action 3957) and ceasing grazing (action 3956) leads to early succession changes, with abandoned grasslands showing different community composition and abundance patterns compared to managed areas.",
