For aquaculture systems, six studies showed mixed results: four studies found that acoustic devices reduced predation on caged salmon by seals and sea lions or reduced seal approaches to fish cages, while two studies found no reduction in seal predation or dolphin presence around fin-fish farms. For fishing gear applications, the evidence is more limited and less promising. Only one study examined acoustic decoys to divert mammals from fishing gear, finding that increasing distance between the decoy and fishing lines reduced sperm whale presence at the lines, though whale arrival times and overall presence were unaffected. Additionally, five studies on acoustic devices deployed from fishing vessels showed that while dolphins avoided boats more frequently and killer whales maintained greater distances during initial exposure, the devices did not reduce predation of squid catches by dolphins. Overall, acoustic devices appear to show more consistent beneficial effects for reducing human-wildlife conflict at aquaculture systems compared to their use on fishing gear, where effects are either limited or ineffective for reducing catch predation.",

      "relevant_summary": "Based on multiple studies from various coastal waters including the North Atlantic Ocean, North Sea, Mediterranean Sea, and Baltic Sea, acoustic devices attached to fishing gear have shown several benefits in protecting porpoises and other marine mammals. Nine studies found that these devices resulted in fewer entanglements of various species including harbour porpoises, Franciscana dolphins, humpback whales, beaked whales, and small cetaceans. The primary mechanism appears to be behavioral modification - twelve of sixteen controlled studies found that acoustic devices caused marine mammals including harbour porpoises to approach nets less closely, have fewer encounters with nets, and reduce activity in surrounding areas. Additionally, some studies documented reduced damage to fish catches caused by dolphins and seals when acoustic devices were used.\n\nHowever, the evidence is not uniformly positive. Four studies found that acoustic devices did not have significant effects on bottlenose dolphins, harbour porpoises, or dugongs. Three studies showed mixed results with fewer entanglements of some species but not others. Some controlled studies in the North Sea and elsewhere found that acoustic devices reduced porpoise entanglements in some fishing areas but not others. One study noted that while porpoise echolocation activity decreased, the probability of porpoises approaching within 125 meters of the device actually increased over time, suggesting potential habituation effects.\n\nThe evidence primarily comes from studies on harbour porpoises and other marine mammals in temperate coastal waters, with most research focusing on gillnets, cod traps, and trawl fisheries. While the devices show promise for bycatch reduction, their effectiveness appears to vary by location, gear type, and potentially by the specific acoustic parameters used.",

      "relevant_summary": "Documented benefits of captive rearing and rehabilitation of marine mammals include successful reproduction of released individuals, with one study finding that most captive-reared Antillean manatees reproduced after release. Survival rates vary by species, with approximately three-quarters of captive-reared Antillean manatees and two-thirds of Florida manatees surviving at least one year post-release. Captive-reared Pacific harbour seal pups showed survival similar to wild pups, and controlled breeding programs have produced viable offspring in some species.\n\nNegative outcomes include high mortality rates during and after rehabilitation, with some studies showing death before or after release, or individuals requiring return to captivity. One review found that most captive-born Amazon river dolphins, narrow-ridged finless porpoises, and Irrawaddy dolphins did not survive in captivity, and one controlled study found at least a quarter of California sea lions treated for toxic algae poisoning and released died or required euthanasia. Some captive-reared individuals displayed problematic post-release behaviors, such as travelling greater distances from release sites and showing reduced diving behaviors compared to wild counterparts, potentially affecting their ability to survive in natural environments. A Yangtze finless porpoise population maintained in semi-captive conditions had notably low genetic diversity.",
