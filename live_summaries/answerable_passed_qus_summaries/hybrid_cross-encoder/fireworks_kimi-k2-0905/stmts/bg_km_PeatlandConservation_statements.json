The combined approach increases abundance of wetland-characteristic plants (Action 1732), while tree removal alone only increases cover of some herb species like cottongrasses and sedges (Action 1731). Sphagnum moss responses differ significantly - the combined intervention increases Sphagnum cover (Action 1732), whereas tree removal alone decreases Sphagnum cover over three years (Action 1731). Both approaches increase plant species richness, though one study found the effect is smaller when trees are removed from rewetted plots compared to drained plots (Action 1731). Action 1756 (rewetting alone) demonstrates that water table management is crucial for peatland restoration, showing increased Sphagnum moss cover, reduced tree/shrub cover, and increased herb cover including sedges and cottongrasses.",

The most studied approach is excluding or removing livestock from degraded peatlands (Action ID 1734), with 10 studies evaluated. This intervention showed variable effects on vegetation - typically no effect on cottongrass, sedge, herb or moss cover, though one study reported increased rush cover and another found increased shrub cover. Some studies found increased shrub biomass and total vegetation when livestock were excluded. Reducing grazing intensity (Action ID 1735) was evaluated in one study, which found greater total vegetation, shrub cover and cottongrass cover at lower grazing intensities. Other proposed strategies include using barriers to keep livestock off ungrazed peatlands (Action ID 1733), limiting livestock density on farmland near peatlands (Action ID 1786), and changing the timing or season of grazing (Action ID 1737), though these latter approaches have not yet been evaluated in scientific studies.",

When combined with rewetting, tree removal shows more consistent benefits including increased cover of wetland-characteristic plants, Sphagnum moss cover, and herbaceous vegetation including cottongrasses and sedges (Action ID: 1732).\n\n**Water Table Management:**\nRewetting (raising the water table) is a fundamental intervention that shows increased wetland-characteristic plant abundance, improved Sphagnum moss cover (12 of 19 studies), and enhanced herb cover including sedges and cottongrasses (21 of 25 studies) (Action ID: 1756). This intervention typically reduces tree and shrub cover while promoting peatland vegetation.\n\n**Direct Planting:**\nDirect planting interventions include planting peatland mosses (Action ID: 1818), herbs (Action ID: 1819), and trees/shrubs (Action ID: 1820). Studies show planted mosses can survive and spread, increasing moss coverage. Planted herbs typically survive over 2-3 years, and most planted trees/shrubs show >50% survival over periods up to 13 years.\n\n**Seed Introduction:**\nIntroducing seeds of peatland trees/shrubs shows mixed results, with some studies reporting successful germination and survival of heather and willow seeds, and increased shrub cover in some cases (Action ID: 1824).\n\n**Site Stabilization Techniques:**\nAdditional interventions include stabilizing the peatland surface using materials like coconut fibre rolls (Action ID: 1815), applying organic mulch (Action ID: 1813), and using the moss layer transfer technique (Action ID: 1804) which has shown development of bog-characteristic plant communities within 11 years.\n\n**Supporting Interventions:**\nBuilding artificial bird perches can encourage seed dispersal (Action ID: 1817), and reprofiling/relandscaping (Action ID: 1807) can help prepare sites for vegetation recovery.",

Mowing increased total moss or bryophyte cover in four studies from Belgium, Switzerland and Czech Republic. Eight studies in fens and fen meadows across the UK, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Czech Republic and Poland found that mowing increased plant species richness compared to no mowing or grazing. Mowing reduced cover of problematic herbs including bindweed, reeds, sedges, purple moor grass and grass-like plants overall, and reduced shrub cover in some cases.\n\nMowing trade-offs: Some studies found mixed effects on vegetation biomass and structure. Three studies reported that single mowing events had no effect on vegetation height, and two studies found single mows had no effect on bryophyte cover or plant species richness.\n\nGrazing benefits: Two UK studies reported that grazing with cattle or horses increased cover of some herb groups (cottongrasses, sedges or all grass-like plants) and reduced purple moor grass cover in some cases. One UK study found that plant species richness increased after grazing was reinstated. Grazing reduced shrub cover in one UK study.\n\nGrazing trade-offs: One replicated, paired, site comparison study in Germany found that grazed fen meadows contained fewer fen-characteristic plant species and fewer plant species overall than mown meadows. The overall plant community composition differed between grazed and mown fen meadows. Grazing reduced Sphagnum moss cover in one UK study and typically had no effect on shrub cover in another UK study. Two before-and-after studies in UK fens reported that there was typically no effect on plant species richness.",

Vegetation cover responses vary: four studies in Belgium, Switzerland, and the Czech Republic found mowing increased total moss or bryophyte cover, while studies in Sweden showed mixed effects on Sphagnum moss cover. Cutting problematic herbaceous plants typically increased Sphagnum moss cover while reducing purple moor grass cover. For large tree/shrub management, cutting and removal has been shown to alter plant community composition toward more open fen conditions, with studies in Sweden and the USA reporting increased species richness and cover of fen-characteristic plants. Physical removal of problematic plants such as moss carpets had mixed effects on herb cover and typically reduced total bryophyte and Sphagnum cover in the short term, though effects varied depending on drainage conditions. Tree removal from forest plantations increased herb cover including cottongrasses and sedges, while reducing forest-characteristic moss cover.
