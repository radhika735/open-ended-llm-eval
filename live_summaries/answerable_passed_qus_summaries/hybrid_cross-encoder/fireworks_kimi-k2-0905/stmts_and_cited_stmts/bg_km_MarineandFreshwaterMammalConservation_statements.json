      "relevant_summary": "The evidence for using acoustic devices to reduce human-wildlife conflict differs between aquaculture systems and fishing gear applications. For aquaculture systems, six studies showed mixed results: four studies found that acoustic devices reduced predation on caged salmon by seals and sea lions or reduced seal approaches to fish cages, while two studies found no reduction in seal predation or dolphin presence around fin-fish farms. For fishing gear applications, the evidence is more limited and less promising. Only one study examined acoustic decoys to divert mammals from fishing gear, finding that increasing distance between the decoy and fishing lines reduced sperm whale presence at the lines, though whale arrival times and overall presence were unaffected. Additionally, five studies on acoustic devices deployed from fishing vessels showed that while dolphins avoided boats more frequently and killer whales maintained greater distances during initial exposure, the devices did not reduce predation of squid catches by dolphins. Overall, acoustic devices appear to show more consistent beneficial effects for reducing human-wildlife conflict at aquaculture systems compared to their use on fishing gear, where effects are either limited or ineffective for reducing catch predation.",

Translocation of marine and freshwater mammals has been successful, with studies showing 50-83% survival rates for translocated Hawaiian monk seal pups, and over 25% of translocated seals reproduced after release (Action ID: 2930). Captive breeding and release programs show mixed results - while two of three released Antillean manatees and two of 14 Florida manatees survived at least one year (Action ID: 2933), primates born and reared in cages had poor survival outcomes compared to wild-born individuals (Action ID: 1594), though those raised in free-ranging environments had better outcomes (Action ID: 1596).\n\nDisease treatment interventions show potential, with medical treatment healing most infected mouflons against foot rot disease (Action ID: 2581). Providing supplementary food has demonstrated positive effects on reproduction and survival across multiple studies, increasing breeding proportions in striped mice, arctic fox litters, and prairie vole litter sizes, while also improving survival rates for mule deer, bank voles, and eastern cottontail rabbits (Action ID: 2367). Supplementary feeding during translocation also improved survival and reproductive success for various species including black-tailed prairie dogs, red squirrels, and Eurasian badgers (Action ID: 2470).\n\nRemoving problematic individuals can benefit populations - after removing aggressive male Hawaiian monk seals, adult female survival increased and fewer females were injured (Action ID: 2929). Training mammals to avoid predators showed limited success, with trained greater bilbies not showing increased post-release survival despite some behavioral changes (Action ID: 2580).",

Specifically, research on using acoustic devices to deter marine and freshwater mammals from an area at wind farm construction sites and pelagic sites found reduced activity and sightings of harbour porpoises at distances of 1–18 km from the devices. A study in Faxaflói Bay found that when acoustic devices were deployed, minke whales exhibited stress responses by swimming away from the device, increasing their swimming speed, and swimming more directly.

Nine studies found that these devices resulted in fewer entanglements of various species including harbour porpoises, Franciscana dolphins, humpback whales, beaked whales, and small cetaceans. The primary mechanism appears to be behavioral modification - twelve of sixteen controlled studies found that acoustic devices caused marine mammals including harbour porpoises to approach nets less closely, have fewer encounters with nets, and reduce activity in surrounding areas. Additionally, some studies documented reduced damage to fish catches caused by dolphins and seals when acoustic devices were used.\n\nHowever, the evidence is not uniformly positive. Four studies found that acoustic devices did not have significant effects on bottlenose dolphins, harbour porpoises, or dugongs. Three studies showed mixed results with fewer entanglements of some species but not others. Some controlled studies in the North Sea and elsewhere found that acoustic devices reduced porpoise entanglements in some fishing areas but not others. One study noted that while porpoise echolocation activity decreased, the probability of porpoises approaching within 125 meters of the device actually increased over time, suggesting potential habituation effects.\n\nThe evidence primarily comes from studies on harbour porpoises and other marine mammals in temperate coastal waters, with most research focusing on gillnets, cod traps, and trawl fisheries. While the devices show promise for bycatch reduction, their effectiveness appears to vary by location, gear type, and potentially by the specific acoustic parameters used.",

Six studies (Action ID 2775) evaluated the use of acoustic devices at aquaculture systems, with mixed results: four studies found that acoustic devices reduced predation on caged salmon by grey seals, harbour seals, and South American sea lions, or reduced harbour seal approaches to fish cages, while two studies found no effect on harbour seal predation or bottlenose dolphin presence around fin-fish farms. Two studies (Action ID 2806) examined acoustically reflective objects on fishing gear, finding no reduction in dolphin entanglements or sperm whale predation on fish catches. One study (Action ID 2901) found that bubble curtains used to dampen underwater noise emissions during pile driving resulted in harbour porpoise detections decreasing less compared to sites without dampening methods. However, no studies were found for actions 2748, 2751, and 2761 regarding acoustic devices at renewable energy sites, cooling water intake structures, or moving vessels, meaning their effectiveness and potential harmful impacts remain unevaluated. Action 2746 notes the need for regulations to prevent harmful deterrents at aquaculture systems but also lacks direct studies.",

For marine mammals, installing exclusion and escape devices on fishing nets reduced entanglements of Antarctic fur seals and common bottlenose dolphins (actions 2823, 2808). Using acoustic devices on fishing gear was effective in 12 of 16 studies, reducing encounters with and damage from harbour porpoises, common bottlenose dolphins, and seals (action 2808). Modifying fishing pots and traps with wire grids or steel bars reduced seal access and damage to salmon catches (action 2822). Establishing handling and release protocols for captured mammals resulted in lower mortality of short-beaked common dolphins (action 2829).\n\nFor seabirds, using streamer lines on longlines showed strong evidence for reducing bycatch across multiple studies, with the effect enhanced when multiple streamer lines were used (action 285). Setting longlines at night reduced bycatch rates in six of eight studies (action 283). Setting lines underwater through specialized funnels reduced bycatch of northern fulmars, albatross and petrels (action 288). Releasing offal overboard during line setting significantly reduced attacks and captures of albatross and petrels (action 299). However, one study found that barriers installed at wild fisheries did not effectively deter harbour seals from feeding on salmon (action 2824).\n\nThe effectiveness of these actions varies by species, with some interventions working better for certain wildlife groups than others.",

In contrast, acoustic devices on fishing vessels have limited evidence for conflict reduction, with only one study finding no reduction in predation of squid catches by Risso's dolphins, though they did show behavioral effects on marine mammals in 4 studies. Acoustic devices on moorings have moderate evidence for effectiveness, with one study showing reduced harbor seal predation on migrating juvenile salmon and 7 studies demonstrating behavioral changes in marine mammals. The fishing gear deployment appears most effective for directly addressing human-wildlife conflict through reduced bycatch and gear damage, while vessel-based devices primarily affect animal behavior without clearly reducing conflict, and mooring-based devices show intermediate effectiveness with some conflict reduction benefits.",

A Yangtze finless porpoise population maintained in semi-captive conditions had notably low genetic diversity.",
