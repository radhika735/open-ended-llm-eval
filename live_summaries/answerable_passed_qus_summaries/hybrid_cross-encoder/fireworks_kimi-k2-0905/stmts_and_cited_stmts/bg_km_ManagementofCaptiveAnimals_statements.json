Sound recordings of breeding calls proved effective, with Australian studies showing frogs only bred when recorded mating calls were played, and clutch sizes increased when combined with sex separation and mate choice (Action ID: 1881). However, no evidence was found for simulating rainfall using sound recordings of rain/thunderstorms (Action ID: 1867) or varying enclosure humidity through humidifiers/misters (Action ID: 1863).

However, this diet was associated with decreased mineral retention and lower plasma taurine levels compared to the supplemented animal-based protein diet. Taurine supplementation to animal-protein diets successfully increased plasma taurine levels in maned wolves, addressing this nutritional concern. For cheetahs, whole rabbit carcasses represent an alternative dietary option compared to commercial beef-based diets. Cheetahs fed whole rabbits showed lower blood protein urea, zinc, and vitamin A levels compared to when they were fed supplemented beef, along with reduced inflammatory bowel indicators. Both maned wolves and cheetahs fed commercial diets showed mixed nutritional outcomes - maned wolves had similar dry matter intake despite lower protein content, and cheetahs had plasma a-tocopherol, retinol and taurine concentrations within recommended ranges for domestic cats, though they showed higher creatine levels compared to those fed horse meat.",

For primates, a UK study found that when lorises were provided with live insect prey, inactivity reduced and foraging increased to levels seen in wild lorises (Action ID: 1333). In carnivores, a study found that provision of live prey increased explorative behaviors in fennec foxes compared to other types of enrichment (Action ID: 1926). Live prey provision as part of pre-release training showed that captive-bred black-footed ferrets fed on live prairie dogs took longer to disperse after release but showed greater subsequent movements than those not fed with live prey (Action ID: 2518). The provision of live natural prey also contributed to post-release survival, with rehabilitated Iberian lynx and captive-reared orphaned cheetahs and leopards surviving for periods ranging from three months to 19 months after release (Action ID: 2518).",

Hormone treatment has proven successful, with one review and nine of 10 replicated studies finding that hormone treatment of male amphibians stimulated or increased sperm production and resulted in successful breeding in captivity. For female amphibians, hormone treatment had mixed results with 30-71% of females producing viable eggs following treatment in various studies. Environmental simulation methods have also been effective, including playing recordings of breeding calls to simulate breeding season in the wild, which was found to both induce breeding and increase clutch size in Australian frogs. Providing natural substrates for species which do not breed in water has also promoted egg laying, along with adding enclosure furniture like rotting logs and hollow bamboo pipes. Additionally, simulated wet and dry seasons were found to be crucial for reproductive success, with one study showing captive frogs started breeding when housed in enclosures with simulated seasonal changes along with appropriate calling, perching and laying sites. Temperature control was identified as another important factor affecting reproductive success in captive frogs.",

Additionally, two before-and-after studies from the USA and UK found that puzzle feeders increased tool use in primates, though they also noted increased aggression and decreased food sharing (Action 1318).

Another Australian study increased breeding success by providing a pre-breeding cooling period combined with weight gain for females, sex separation during non-breeding periods, mate choice, and recorded mating calls (Action 1864). Artificial rainfall simulation is particularly effective, with two replicated studies in Germany and Austria finding that simulating wet and dry seasons successfully stimulated breeding and egg deposition (Action 1872). Enclosure modifications also play a role, as an Austrian study found captive frogs began breeding when housed in enclosures with more calling, perching and laying sites along with simulated wet and dry seasons (Action 1876), while a Fiji study showed that adding rotting logs, hollow bamboo pipes and substrate variety promoted egg laying (Action 1876). Lighting variation is another option, though one UK study found UV boosts resulted in greater fungal loads without improving clutch size (Action 1865). Other potential actions include varying enclosure humidity using humidifiers, foggers or misters (Action 1863), allowing dormancy periods for species from highly seasonal environments (Action 1869), and permitting temperate amphibians to hibernate (Action 1868), though these lack current evidence for effectiveness.",
