Restoring habitat along watercourses can support similar numbers of bees and bee species as remnant sites [1408]. Planting or maintaining ground cover, for example in olive orchards, has been shown to result in more bee species and more deposited pollen grains [1404]. Planting flower strips can lead to more pollinators on adjacent crops, and more wild bee species and individuals in the flower strips themselves [2468, 1406]. The composition and diversity of planted flowers can influence pollinator numbers, with some studies indicating that a greater number of flower species does not always result in more pollinators [2468, 1406]. Another supportive action is the use of no-tillage in arable fields, which was found to increase the number of pollinators compared to deep tillage [1405, 2516].",

Thirty-four studies (of which 21 were replicated and controlled and seven also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found some positive effects on earthworms, some invertebrates (other than earthworms), weeds or farmland birds, of reducing tillage compared to conventional management. Positive effects included increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms, greater abundance of some invertebrates other than earthworms, increased numbers of some weeds and/or weed species, higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying date and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields, and greater abundance of some birds - including Eurasian skylark, seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in late winter on non-inversion or conservation tillage. A review found tillage had negative effects on invertebrate numbers and no-till systems had more invertebrate bird food resources.\\nTwenty-six studies (of which 13 replicated and controlled and three also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found reducing tillage had either negative, no effect or no consistent effects on abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates (other than earthworms), earthworm abundance, biomass, or species richness, number of different plant species found as seeds, number of some weed species, mammal abundance, some bird species, and one study found bird preferences for conservation tillage fields decreased over time.

Additionally, cover crops were found to increase bacterial numbers and activity in one study [897]. Reduced tillage has also been shown to be effective. In some comparisons, three studies in Spain found that reduced tillage resulted in soil aggregates with higher water-stability [1371]. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of studies in Mediterranean countries and eleven other studies found more organic matter in soils with reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage [1371]. Reduced tillage was also found to increase microbial biomass in eleven studies, and another study found more earthworms in fields with fewer plough passes [1371]. One study also found that less erosion occurred with less tillage, specifically one pass with a tractor compared to two [1371].\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"897\",\n    \"1371\"\n  ]\n}"

However members of the crow family showed the opposite trend. A review found excluding cattle from fenland reduced the number of plant species, and that low-medium grazing levels could have positive effects on fenland biodiversity but may need to be accompanied by additional management such as mowing.\\nOne study from the UK found northern lapwing nest survival and clutch size were greater on ungrazed than grazed marshes. A replicated site comparison from the UK found the proportion of young grey partridges was negatively associated with rough grazing (in combination with several other interventions).\"\n}"
