Cleared patches in forests were found to have a greater species richness of butterflies but a lower species richness of moths (3938). One study noted that butterfly species richness declined in the first three years after clearing (3938). Cleared patches, sometimes managed with coppicing and grazing, showed a higher abundance of butterflies, including specific species like the chequered blue and high brown fritillary (3938). However, one study found that wider rides had a lower abundance of macro-moths (3938). Thinning of coniferous woodland, in some cases with other management like prescribed burning, led to a greater species richness of butterflies and, in some cases, higher abundance (3940). Conversely, another study found that forests managed by thinning had a similar species richness and abundance of fruit-feeding butterflies to unmanaged forests (3940). Coppicing was found to support different communities of moths and butterflies depending on the age of the coppice (3939). Some studies found that coppiced woodland had a greater species richness of butterflies than unmanaged woodland, while another found a lower species richness of macro-moths compared to mature forest (3939). The abundance of butterflies was higher in coppiced woodland in some studies, with specific timeframes after coppicing showing higher numbers for certain species (3939).",

Another US study found butterfly abundance was highest in the third year after burning (3883). However, other replicated studies in the US showed mixed effects. One found that rotationally burned prairies had more rapidly declining populations of grass-skipper butterflies than unmanaged or lightly managed fields (3883). For three fritillary species, rotational burning did not affect abundance, but for three others, abundance was lower in prairies managed by rotational burning compared to those managed with only haying or grazing, or in unmanaged prairies (3883). In contrast, one site comparison study in the US reported that regal fritillary abundance was higher in grasslands and oak barrens managed by rotational burning every three years than on unmanaged sites (3883).

Four of six replicated studies in the USA (including five site comparison studies\\u00a0and one randomized, controlled study) found that rotational burning in prairies, pine barrens\\u00a0and grasslands\\u00a0had mixed effects on butterflies, compared to unmanaged, hayed, grazed, mowed or completely burned sites. The fifth study found that prairies managed by rotational burning had more strongly declining populations of grass-skipper butterflies than unmanaged pine barrens or lightly managed fields. The sixth study found that for three fritillary species rotational burning in prairies did not affect abundance, but for three others, in at least one region surveyed, abundance was lower in prairies managed by rotational burning, sometimes in combination with haying, grazing and/or mowing, than in prairies managed with only haying or grazing, or in unmanaged prairies. One replicated, site comparison study in the USA\\u00a0reported that Karner blue butterfly abundance was similar in rotationally burned and unmanaged oak savannas and prairies. One site comparison study in the USA\\u00a0reported that regal fritillary abundance was higher in grasslands and oak barrens managed by rotational burning every three years (following restoration by seeding) than on unmanaged sites or remnant prairies. One replicated, site comparison study in the USA\\u00a0found that the abundance of regal fritillary was higher in rotationally burned prairies four years after the last burn than one or eight years after the last burn. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the USA\\u00a0found that, in June, the abundance of regal fritillaries in prairies burned on rotation that spring was lower than in prairies burned 1\\u20132 years ago, but in July the abundance was higher in recently burned prairies.\\nSurvival (1 study): One replicated study in South Africa\\u00a0found that populations of Karkloof blue persisted for at least a year following rotational burning.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\"\n}"

Two of four studies found that excluding non-native pigs and deer led to greater species richness of butterflies and macro-moths, while two other studies on elk exclusion showed mixed effects on species richness depending on the year and fire intensity (3891). A global systematic review found that reducing or removing grazing by wild or domestic herbivores in temperate and boreal forests did not affect the species richness of butterflies and moths (3891). Five of eight studies discovered that fencing to exclude or reduce the density of deer, sheep, pigs, and other large herbivores resulted in a higher abundance of butterflies, moths, caterpillars, rare macro-moths, and New Forest burnet moths (3891). A global systematic review also found that reducing or removing grazing in temperate and boreal forests increased the abundance of butterflies and moths (3891). One study noted that excluding sika deer led to a lower abundance of tree-feeding moths (3891). In one study, all Glanville fritillary caterpillar nests survived in a grassland area fenced to exclude sheep, compared to 88% in a grazed area, and fewer nests were damaged (3891).",

    "relevant_summary": "Several studies have compared the effectiveness of different methods for creating field margins on butterfly communities in European farmland. When comparing sown wildflower strips to grass or uncultivated margins, floristically enhanced grass buffers or wildflower strips were found to have a greater species richness of butterflies than standard grass margins in three studies based in the UK and Sweden (3982). Two studies from the UK and Sweden also showed that margins sown with wildflowers had a greater butterfly species richness than grass-only margins (3932). However, two other UK studies found that farms with floristically enhanced margins had a similar species richness of butterflies and moths as farms with standard grass margins (3982). In a wider review of thirteen studies, eight found that sown wildflower strips had a higher species richness and diversity of butterflies and moths compared to conventional or unsown margins, while four studies found the species richness to be similar (3932).\n\nRegarding butterfly abundance, four studies in the UK and Sweden indicated that floristically enhanced grass buffers or wildflower strips supported a higher abundance of butterflies than standard grass or uncultivated margins (3982). This is supported by two studies in the UK and Sweden that found wildflower-sown margins had a higher butterfly abundance than grass-only margins (3932), and ten studies across the UK, Switzerland, and Finland that reported a higher abundance of butterflies in sown wildflower strips compared to conventional or unsown margins (3932). In contrast, two UK studies found that farms with floristically enhanced margins had a higher abundance of some butterfly species but a lower abundance of others compared to farms with standard grass margins (3982, 3932). Additionally, the width of the margin can be a factor, as some studies found that wider grass margins (up to 6m) supported a greater species richness and diversity of butterflies and moths than narrower margins (3982). In comparison, beetle banks were found to have a lower species richness of butterflies than hedgerows and a similar abundance of caterpillars to field margins (3927).",
