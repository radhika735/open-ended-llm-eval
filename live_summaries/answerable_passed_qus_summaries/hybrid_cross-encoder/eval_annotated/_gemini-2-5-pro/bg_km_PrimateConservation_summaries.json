A controlled study in Romania, however, found that translocated brown bears occurred less frequently inside high potential conflict areas than outside (2336). In terms of survival, a controlled study in the USA found that translocated grizzly bears had lower survival rates than non-translocated bears (2336). Another replicated study in the USA found that fewer than half of black bears translocated from conflict situations survived after one year (2336). Similarly, a study in Russia found that most Amur tigers translocated after attacking dogs or people did not survive for a year after release (2336). Two of three studies in the USA on white-tailed deer found that after translocation away from urban sites, survival was lower than that of non-translocated deer, while the third study found short-term survival was lower but long-term survival was higher (2336).",
