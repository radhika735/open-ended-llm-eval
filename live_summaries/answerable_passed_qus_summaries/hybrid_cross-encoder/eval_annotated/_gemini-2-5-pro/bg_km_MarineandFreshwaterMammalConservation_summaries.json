Additionally, two replicated studies in the South Atlantic Ocean and Florida found that approximately three-quarters of Antillean manatees and two-thirds of Florida manatees that were captive-reared and released were known to have survived for at least one year, with some surviving for over seven years (2926). However, three captive-reared West Indian manatee calves died, had to be returned to captivity, or only survived with supplemental feeding (2926). For captive-born manatees, two studies in Brazil and Florida found that two of three Antillean manatees and two of fourteen Florida manatees released into the wild survived for at least one year without intervention (2933).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"2926\",\n    \"2933\"\n  ]\n}"

Two controlled studies, one of which was replicated, found that installing steel rods on lobster pots or metal frames on fishing pots reduced the number of sea lions, seals, or pups entering or getting trapped in the pots (2822). Additionally, two controlled studies, including one replicated study, found that installing wire grids or steel bars on trap-nets or bag-nets, along with strengthening the netting, reduced damage to salmon catches by seals (2822). One controlled study noted that securing crab pot doors with a bungee cord reduced interactions with common bottlenose dolphins for one of two methods tested (2822). Another controlled study found that installing wire grids on trap-nets with strengthened netting led to higher catches of undamaged salmon, but not whitefish, which was likely due to less seal predation (2822).\n\nSeven studies evaluated the effects of installing exclusion or escape devices for mammals on fishing nets (2823). In terms of population survival, one study found that less than a third of common bottlenose dolphins that entered escape hatches on trawl nets exited them alive (2823). However, a replicated study found that fewer fur seals died in exclusion devices with large escape openings compared to those with small openings (2823). Five studies looked at the reduction in unwanted catch. Three of these studies, two of which were controlled, found that installing exclusion or escape devices on trawl nets reduced the number of trapped or entangled fur seals and bottlenose dolphins (2823). A before-and-after study also found that these devices reduced common bottlenose dolphin entanglements for three out of four fishing vessels (2823). Finally, one study found that modifying an exclusion and escape device by enlarging and relocating the escape panel resulted in fewer entanglements of Antarctic fur seals (2823).",
