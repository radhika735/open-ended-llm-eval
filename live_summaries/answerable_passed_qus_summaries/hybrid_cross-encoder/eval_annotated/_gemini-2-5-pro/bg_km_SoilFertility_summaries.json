    "relevant_summary": "The documented benefits of adopting reduced tillage systems on European farms include positive effects on soil health, such as increased soil organic carbon (906), maintained or increased soil organic matter (906), improved soil structure (906), higher nutrient retention (906), and in some cases, reduced soil compaction and water runoff (906). Reduced tillage can also lead to an increase in the biomass, species richness, and abundance of earthworms (126), as well as a greater abundance of other invertebrates (126). Some studies have found that reduced tillage can have positive effects on farmland birds, including higher nest densities and greater abundance of certain species (126). Additionally, some studies comparing no-tillage to reduced tillage found higher cereal and legume yields in the no-tillage systems (1358).\n\nThe documented harms of reduced tillage include the potential for increased soil compaction (906), which can negatively impact water absorption and soil water content (906). There are also mixed results regarding soil erosion, with some studies showing increased soil loss under no-tillage systems if there is no crop cover (906). In terms of crop yield, some studies have reported lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional methods (906), and lower fruit, vegetable, and oilseed yields when comparing no-tillage to reduced tillage (1358). The effects on wildlife can also be inconsistent, with some studies showing negative or no effects on invertebrates, earthworms, mammals, and some bird species (126). Furthermore, bird preferences for conservation tillage fields have been observed to decrease over time (126).",

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done. One randomized, replicated study from Portugal found no effect of tillage treatment on yield.\\n\\u00a0\\nSOIL TYPES COVERED: anthrosol, calcareous silt loam, chalky, clay, clay loam, fine sandy loam, loam, loamy-clay, loam - sandy loam, loam \\u2013 silt-loam, loamy sand, loamy silt, non-chalky clay, sandy, sandy clay loam, sandy loam, sandy silt-loam, silt loam, silty, silty-clay, silty clay loam, silty loam.\"\n}"

Thirty-four studies (of which 21 were replicated and controlled and seven also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found some positive effects on earthworms, some invertebrates (other than earthworms), weeds or farmland birds, of reducing tillage compared to conventional management. Positive effects included increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms, greater abundance of some invertebrates other than earthworms, increased numbers of some weeds and/or weed species, higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying date and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields, and greater abundance of some birds - including Eurasian skylark, seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in late winter on non-inversion or conservation tillage. A review found tillage had negative effects on invertebrate numbers and no-till systems had more invertebrate bird food resources.\\nTwenty-six studies (of which 13 replicated and controlled and three also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found reducing tillage had either negative, no effect or no consistent effects on abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates (other than earthworms), earthworm abundance, biomass, or species richness, number of different plant species found as seeds, number of some weed species, mammal abundance, some bird species, and one study found bird preferences for conservation tillage fields decreased over time. Two studies found that crop type affected the number of weeds under different tillage regimes.\\nOne small replicated trial in the UK compared bird numbers under two different forms of reduced tillage, and found more birds from species that make up the \\u2018Farmland Bird Index\\u2019 on broadcast than non-inversion tillage fields.\\nTwo studies looked at the long-term effects of reduced tillage on earthworms (after ten years).

Additionally, four trials indicated higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage (906). In terms of biodiversity, four studies, including some in Europe, found more microbes and earthworms or higher microbe activity with reduced tillage (906). Furthermore, seven trials demonstrated reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing (906). The use of cover crops on sandy loam soils has been shown to increase bacterial numbers and activity in a Spanish study (897) and reduce erosion in a French study (897). Adding mulch to crops, as shown in studies in Poland and Spain, can also increase soil animal and fungal numbers, diversity, and activity (887).\n\nDrawbacks of reduced tillage on these soils include the potential for increased soil compaction, which was observed in three replicated trials, one of which was in Europe (906). One European trial found that conventional ploughing and sub-soiling increased the soil's ability to absorb water and its water content when compared to reduced tillage (906). Moreover, no-tillage was found to increase soil loss when there was no crop cover in two trials (906).",

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done.

One study found that the addition of crop remains and straw increased microbial biomass (910). While one study found that incorporating straw improved soil structure, another found that it did not improve anaerobic soils in compacted conditions (910). In terms of erosion, one study indicated that straw addition reduced soil loss, whereas another reported mixed effects depending on the soil type (910). Some studies have shown higher soil nitrogen levels and reduced nitrate leaching with the application of compost or straw, but the results were inconsistent when processed wastes were used (910). Furthermore, six studies found that adding plant material resulted in higher carbon levels in the soil (910). In terms of yield, one trial observed a higher barley yield when straw was incorporated, and another noted higher grain yields when crop remains were incorporated earlier in the season (910).\n\nRetaining crop residues has also been studied for its effects. A study in Mexico found an increase in microbial biomass when crop residues were retained (907). A review indicated that this practice could reduce water runoff, increase water storage, and lessen soil erosion (907). However, another study found mixed effects on soil physical properties (907). When it comes to soil organic matter, two trials in Australia and China reported higher levels of soil organic carbon and nitrogen when residues were retained, with one trial noting this effect only occurred with the addition of fertilizer (907). Similarly, these two trials found higher yields with residue retention, although one of them specified that this was only in combination with fertilizer application and no-tillage practices (907).\n\nIncorporating plant remains that produce weed-controlling chemicals has been observed to decrease weed growth, although this effect may be temporary (728). This practice can also inhibit crop growth, but adjusting the application timing can minimize this issue, and the effects on yield are mixed (728).",

A review noted that this practice reduced water runoff and soil erosion, while also increasing water storage [907]. However, a replicated site comparison in Canada found mixed effects on soil physical properties [907]. Two randomized, replicated trials in Australia and China observed higher soil organic carbon and nitrogen when residues were retained, with one trial showing this effect only when fertilizer was also applied [907]. These trials also reported higher yields, though one trial specified this outcome was only achieved in combination with fertilizer application and no-tillage [907].\n\nAmending soil with fresh plant material or crop remains was found to increase microbial biomass in one randomized, replicated experiment in Belgium [910]. A study from India showed improved soil structure from incorporating straw [910]. However, a before-and-after trial in the UK found that incorporating straw did not improve compacted, anaerobic soils [910]. On the topic of erosion, one randomized, replicated study from Canada and India found that straw addition reduced soil loss, while another reported mixed effects depending on the soil type [910]. In terms of nutrient loss, four replicated studies from the UK, USA, and Belgium reported higher soil nitrogen levels when compost or straw was applied, but the results were mixed when processed wastes were added [910]. Six studies in China, Denmark, and India all found higher carbon levels when plant material was added to the soil [910].\n\nIncorporating plant remains that produce weed-controlling chemicals has shown varied results. Out of six studies, three found a reduction in weed growth [728]. Two of three studies found that crop growth was inhibited by such plant remains, but this could be minimized by changing the application timing [728]. Yield effects were also inconsistent, with studies finding positive, negative, and mixed results [728].",

Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion.

All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon.
