    "relevant_summary": "Several studies have examined the outcomes of creating new ponds to support toad populations in Europe, with generally positive results. In Denmark, the creation of new ponds, alongside other interventions, was found to significantly increase populations of green toads (864). Similar interventions in the UK and Denmark also led to significant increases in natterjack toad populations, with some sites seeing populations maintained or increased at 75% of locations (866). Furthermore, the creation and restoration of ponds in Denmark, when combined with head-starting programs, increased populations of European fire-bellied toads (868).\n\nNewly created ponds are often colonized by toads. Studies in Germany, the UK, and the USA have all shown that both translocated and naturally colonizing toads can establish breeding populations in these new habitats (868). For instance, common toads and midwife toads were observed to naturally colonize between 29% and 100% of newly created ponds in Denmark and Switzerland (868). In Sweden, green toads were found to use 59% of created ponds and reproduce in 41% of them (864). Similarly, a study in Switzerland found that midwife toads reproduced in 16% of the ponds created for them (868). However, not all attempts at colonization are successful. One study in Denmark found that captive-bred garlic toads did not colonize the new ponds (868).\n\nA comparison between created and natural ponds in the UK revealed some trade-offs for natterjack toads. While the created ponds had lower tadpole mortality due to desiccation, they also had higher rates of predation by invertebrates (866).",

Two out of three studies showed that releasing captive-bred toads as tadpoles, juveniles, or metamorphs led to the establishment of populations, with one study reporting success at 70% of sites (875). Similarly, six out of ten studies found that head-started amphibians released as tadpoles, metamorphs, or juveniles established breeding frog populations or increased existing frog or toad populations (881). Nine out of ten studies noted that head-started amphibians successfully metamorphosed, survived their first season, winter, or year, or bred successfully after release (881), and four studies found that head-started frogs had greater survival to metamorphosis, were larger at metamorphosis, and had a shorter time to metamorphosis compared to wild frogs (881).\n\nHowever, success is not guaranteed. One study found that populations were not established from captive-bred and head-started toads (875), and two studies found that head-starting did not prevent a frog population decline or establish a breeding toad population (881). The survival of released toads can also be low, as evidenced by two studies in Puerto Rico where 25% of captive-bred Puerto Rican crested toads were predated within two days of release (875). Another study found that adult survival was as low as 1-17% over four years, and another noted limited breeding after adults were released (881). In some cases, head-started leopard frogs were smaller than their wild counterparts (881), and while earlier release of corroboree frog tadpoles led to higher survival, it also resulted in a two-week delay in metamorphosis (881). The conditions of head-starting can also impact outcomes, with studies showing that factors like protein levels, housing density, and enclosure location can affect the growth rate, size, stress levels, and survival of amphibians in captivity (881). Two studies also reported mixed success in rearing Houston toad eggs to tadpoles and adults in captivity (881). It is also important to note that for five of the studies, other interventions such as translocation or habitat management were also carried out alongside the release of captive-bred individuals (881).",

However, another study found that populations were not established, and two studies on the Puerto Rican crested toad reported low survival rates and high predation (875).

On the other hand, a UK-based study on a reintroduced population noted that while predator defences were kept, there was a reduction in genetic diversity (873). Further research on head-starting amphibians, including toads, for release found that six out of ten studies reported the establishment of breeding populations or an increase in population numbers (881).

Nine of ten studies found that released head-started amphibians metamorphosed successfully, tended to survive the first season, winter or year, or bred successfully (881). Four studies also found that head-started frogs had greater survival to metamorphosis and size at metamorphosis, and a shorter time to metamorphosis, than wild frogs (881).\n\nHowever, one study found that releasing captive-bred and head-started toads did not establish any new populations (875). Two studies in Puerto Rico found the survival of released captive-bred Puerto Rican crested toads to be low, with one reporting that 25% were predated within two days of release (875). Two studies which head-started amphibians found that this did not prevent a population decline or establish a breeding population (881).
