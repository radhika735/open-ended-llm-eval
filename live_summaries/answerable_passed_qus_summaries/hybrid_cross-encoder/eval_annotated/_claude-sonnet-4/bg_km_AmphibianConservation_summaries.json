    "relevant_summary": "Several actions can be taken to mitigate the impacts of roads on amphibian populations. Road closures during seasonal amphibian migration are effective, with two studies in Germany finding that large numbers of amphibians were protected from death during breeding migrations at road closure sites and at road closure sites with assisted crossings and barrier fences (Action 842). Installing culverts or tunnels as road crossings is a widely studied approach, with six of seven studies finding that they significantly decreased amphibian road deaths, though in one study this was only effective when barrier fencing was also installed (Action 884). The effectiveness of culverts depends on design factors including diameter (wider culverts used more), substrate (natural substrates used more), and lighting effects (Action 884). Installing barrier fencing along roads is effective when combined with culverts, with seven of eight studies finding that barrier fencing with culverts decreased amphibian road deaths (Action 756). Barriers need to be at least 0.6 m high to prevent green frogs and leopard frogs from climbing over, though some species like treefrogs and 10% of common toads can still climb over barriers (Action 756). Human-assisted migration across roads is practiced extensively, with studies finding that large numbers of amphibians were moved across roads by patrols, ranging from 7,532 toads to half a million moved during breeding migrations annually (Action 784). However, despite human assistance, 64-70% of populations still declined over 6-10 years and over 500 toads were still killed on some roads (Action 784). Warning signage for motorists has limited effectiveness, with one study finding that despite warning signs and human assistance, over 500 toads were still killed on some roads (Action 841). Installing overpasses over roads/railways has been studied primarily for reptiles, with limited specific information on amphibians (Action 3510).",

However, all partial harvesting methods still had negative impacts compared to no harvesting. Two studies found that harvesting trees in small groups significantly decreased salamander abundance and changed species composition compared to no harvesting (Action 844). Two of three studies found that shelterwood harvesting decreased salamander abundance and changed species composition compared to no harvesting, though one found no effect (Action 851).

Citizen science programs engaging volunteers to collect amphibian data involved 100-10,506 volunteers and were active in 16-17 states in the USA, with volunteers undertaking 412 surveys, surveying 121-7,872 sites, swabbing almost 6,000 amphibians and submitting thousands of amphibian records (Action 760). Volunteer engagement in habitat management showed population-level benefits, with studies in Estonia and Taiwan finding that habitat management with volunteer participation increased natterjack toad and Taipei frog populations, while programs engaged between eight and 41,000 volunteers in aquatic and terrestrial habitat restoration, restoring up to 1,023 ponds or over 11,500 km\u00b2 of habitat (Action 777). Public awareness campaigns demonstrated reach and impact, with studies in Estonia and the UK finding that raising public awareness, along with other interventions, increased numbers of natterjack toads and created 1,023 ponds for amphibians, while campaigns reached over 50,000 members of the public each year or trained 1,016 people at 57 events over four years (Action 831). Education programmes showed effectiveness in knowledge transfer and conservation outcomes, with studies in Germany, Mexico, Slovenia, Taiwan, Zimbabwe and the USA finding that education programmes increased amphibian knowledge of participants, and in Taiwan, education programmes about wetlands and amphibians, along with other interventions, doubled a population of Taipei frogs (Action 776). Volunteer road assistance programs demonstrated substantial engagement despite mixed conservation outcomes, with studies in Germany, the UK and Italy finding that large numbers of amphibians were moved across roads by patrols, ranging from 7,532 toads to half a million moved annually, with the UK having over 400 patrols and 71 patrols spending an average of 90 person-hours moving toads (Action 784).",

Head-starting programs, where amphibians are raised from eggs and then released, demonstrated that six of 10 studies found that released head-started tadpoles, metamorphs or juveniles established breeding populations or increased existing populations (Action 881). For natterjack toads specifically, translocations established breeding populations in 30-70% of cases (Action 859). Reviews indicated that translocations of over 1,000 animals were more successful, but success was not related to whether animals came from wild or captive sources, life-stage, continent, or reason for translocation (Action 854).",

Three reviews (including one systematic review) in the Netherlands and UK found that legal protection of amphibian species was not effective at protecting populations during development (Action 779). However, Two reviews in the UK found that the number of great crested newt mitigation licences issued over 10 years increased to over 600 in England and Wales (Action 779). In terms of trade regulation, one review found that legislation to reduce trade in two frog species resulted in the recovery of the over-exploited populations (Action 785), and similarly, one review found that reducing trade in two frog species through legislation allowed populations to recover from over-exploitation (Action 824). Regarding habitat protection, one replicated, site comparison study in the UK found that populations of natterjack toads were better protected at sites with a statutory level of habitat protection than those outside protected areas, while one before-and-after study in the UK found that a common frog population increased but common toads decreased following the protection of a pond during development (Action 820). Financial incentive schemes showed more positive results: three studies (including one replicated study) in Denmark, Sweden and Taiwan found that payments to farmers created amphibian breeding habitat or increased frog or toad populations, although a second study in Taiwan found that payments did not maintain green tree frog habitat (Action 818). Additionally, one replicated, site comparison study in the Netherlands found that ditches managed under agri-environment schemes had higher numbers of amphibian species and higher abundance than those managed conventionally (Action 818).",

    "relevant_summary": "Studies have documented both benefits and negative impacts of livestock grazing on amphibian habitats and populations. Regarding benefits, habitat management that included reintroduction of grazing was found to increase green toad populations and maintain or increase natterjack toad populations and common toad populations (Action 780). Some amphibian species showed higher abundance in grazed areas, with bog turtles being less abundant in ungrazed sites compared to grazed sites, and juvenile box turtles being present less frequently in ungrazed sites (Action 3512). Green frogs and American toads were found to have higher abundance with grazing (Action 746). Grazing can be beneficial for breeding habitat, as bog turtle nests were laid only in areas that had been grazed in the current or previous growing season, and after grazing cattle to restore bog turtle habitat, more bog turtle eggs were laid and hatching success was higher (Action 3711). However, negative impacts have also been documented. Grazed plots did not have higher abundance of natterjack toads than ungrazed plots and had lower abundance of common toads (Action 780). Excluding livestock from streams or ponds did not increase numbers of amphibian species or overall abundance, but did increase larval abundance and abundance of green frog metamorphs (Action 746). Trampling damage was identified as a concern, with high-density spring-summer grazing resulting in fewer incidences of trampling compared to moderate-density autumn-winter grazing or low-density year-round grazing (Action 3496). Additionally, excluding cattle from ponds did not increase numbers of eggs or larval survival of Columbia spotted frogs (Action 746). The timing and intensity of grazing appears critical, as moderate density autumn-winter grazing and autumn-spring marsh flooding resulted in higher abundance of European pond turtles than high density spring-summer grazing (Action 3496).",

However, two studies found that created wetlands had fewer amphibian species or lower abundance and different communities compared to natural wetlands (Action 880). One global review and two site comparison studies in the USA combined created and restored wetlands and found that numbers of amphibian species and abundance was higher or similar, or higher in 54% of studies and similar in 35% of studies reviewed compared to natural wetlands (Action 880). Five studies in Kenya and the USA found that four to 15 amphibian species used or colonized created wetlands (Action 880).\n\nFor wetland restoration, ten site comparison studies in Canada and the USA compared amphibian numbers in restored and natural wetlands, with eight finding that amphibian abundance, numbers of species and species composition were similar (Action 879). Two found that the number of species or abundance was lower and species composition different in restored wetlands (Action 879).

Three studies found that fires increased amphibian abundance or numbers of species, and one found that abundance decreased with fires (Action 877). Two studies found that numbers of amphibian species and abundance increased or abundance decreased with time since prescribed forest fires (Action 877). One before-and-after study found that spotted salamander hatching success increased following a prescribed forest fire (Action 877). In grassland habitats, two studies found that annual prescribed fires decreased numbers of amphibian species and abundance, or along with changes in grazing regime, increased rates of species loss (Action 862). One replicated, before-and-after study found that spring burns, but not autumn or winter burns, decreased salamander abundance (Action 862). Studies examining combined reptile and amphibian responses showed that one study found burned areas had higher combined reptile and amphibian species richness than unburned areas, while another found similar species richness and diversity between burned and unburned areas (Action 3646). In wetland contexts, one study found that burned areas had similar abundance of reptiles and amphibians compared to unburned areas (Action 3652).",

For mammalian predators, controlling rats had no significant effect on Hochstetter's frog numbers, but survival of Maud Island frogs was significantly higher in predator-proof enclosures than in the wild, and 58% of translocated Hamilton's frogs survived the first year within predator-proof enclosures (Action 839).

    "relevant_summary": "Several species augmentation techniques can be used as alternatives to creating new ponds for establishing or increasing amphibian populations. Captive breeding and release programs show promise, with one review finding that 41% of release programmes of captive-bred or head-started amphibians showed evidence of breeding in the wild for multiple generations, while 29% showed some evidence of breeding and 12% showed evidence of survival following release (Action 871). Head-starting amphibians involves raising eggs, tadpoles, or juveniles in captivity before release. Six of 10 studies found that released head-started tadpoles, metamorphs or juveniles established breeding frog populations or increased populations of frogs or toads, while nine of 10 studies found that head-started amphibians released as tadpoles, metamorphs or adults metamorphosed successfully, tended to survive the first season, winter or year or bred successfully (Action 881). Four replicated studies found that frog survival to metamorphosis and size at metamorphosis was greater and time to metamorphosis shorter in head-started compared to wild animals (Action 881). Translocation of wild amphibians represents another viable technique, with three global reviews and one replicated study finding that 35 of 54 (65%) amphibian translocations that could be assessed resulted in established breeding populations or substantial recruitment to the adult population (Action 854). One review found that translocations of over 1,000 animals were more successful, but that success was not related to the source of animals (wild or captive), life-stage, continent or reason for translocation (Action 854).",

    "relevant_summary": "Several alternatives to clearcutting forests have been studied for their effects on amphibian populations. Selective harvesting/logging involves harvesting individual trees or small groups rather than clear areas, though one study found no consistent differences between selectively harvested and clearcut stands (action 331). Shelterwood harvesting leaves some mature trees to provide shelter for regenerating forest - three studies found that compared to clearcutting, this method resulted in higher, similar or initially higher and then similar salamander abundance (action 851). A meta-analysis of 24 studies in North America found that partial harvest, which included shelterwood harvesting with three other types, resulted in smaller reductions in salamander populations than clearcutting (action 851). Group harvesting involves removing trees in small clusters rather than large areas - three studies found that compared to clearcutting, harvesting trees in small groups did not result in higher amphibian or salamander abundance, and a meta-analysis found that partial harvest including this method resulted in smaller reductions in salamander populations than clearcutting (action 844). Forest thinning selectively removes some trees to reduce density - five studies comparing amphibians in thinned to unharvested forest found mixed effects depending on species and time since harvest, and a meta-analysis found that partial harvest including thinning decreased salamander populations (action 852). Four studies comparing thinned to clearcut forest found higher amphibian abundance or less negative responses in thinned forest for most species, and the meta-analysis confirmed smaller reductions in salamander populations compared to clearcutting (action 852). Patch retention involves leaving patches of unharvested trees within harvested areas, though no evidence was found for effects on amphibian populations, with one study only examining red-legged frog movement patterns (action 847).",

Creating artificial hibernacula or aestivation sites has shown positive results, with one replicated, before-and-after study in the UK finding that providing artificial hibernacula, along with other terrestrial habitat management, maintained populations of great crested newts (Action 759). Additionally, one replicated study in the UK found that created hibernacula were used by common frog and smooth newts, but not great crested newts, and another study found four amphibian species close to hibernacula at two of three sites (Action 759).\n\nCreating refuges using coarse woody debris has mixed effectiveness. Two replicated, controlled studies in the USA and Indonesia found that adding coarse woody debris to forest floors had no effect on the number of amphibian species or overall abundance, but had mixed effects on abundance of individual species, while one before-and-after study in Australia found that restoration that included reintroducing coarse woody debris to the forest floor increased frog species (Action 772). One replicated, before-and-after study in the UK found that creating refugia for great crested newts, along with other interventions, maintained four populations (Action 772). Two studies in New Zealand and the USA found that artificial refugia were used by translocated Hamilton's frogs and hellbenders, although few were used for breeding (Action 772).\n\nRegarding coarse woody debris in forests, two replicated, controlled studies in the USA found that there was no significant difference in abundance in clearcuts with woody debris retained or removed for eight of nine amphibian species, and one study found that migrating amphibians used clearcuts where woody debris was retained more than where it was removed (Action 843). One study found that within clearcut forest, survival of juvenile amphibians was significantly higher in piles of woody debris than in open areas (Action 843).\n\nSome actions currently lack evidence, including creating refuge areas in aquatic habitats (Action 813), adding woody debris to ponds (Action 814), and encouraging aquatic plant growth as refuge against fish predation (Action 796).",

This suggests that mechanical methods may be more favorable for maintaining amphibian species diversity compared to herbicide treatments, which showed neutral to negative effects on amphibian abundance in US forests.",

Legislative regulation can be effective for trade protection, with one review finding that legislation to reduce trade in two frog species resulted in the recovery of over-exploited populations (Action 785, 824). However, legal protection of species shows mixed effectiveness for development threats - three reviews found that legal protection of amphibian species was not effective at protecting populations during development in the Netherlands and UK, while two UK reviews found that the number of great crested newt mitigation licences issued increased to over 600 in England and Wales over 10 years (Action 779). Habitat protection measures show some promise, with one study in the UK finding that natterjack toad populations were better protected at sites with statutory habitat protection than those outside protected areas, though results were mixed for other species with common frogs increasing but common toads decreasing following pond protection during development (Action 820). Additionally, one study in South Africa found that permits issued for scientific and educational use of amphibians increased from 1987 to 1990 under legislative regulation (Action 785). For broader wildlife protection, regulating wildlife harvesting has shown some success for reptile populations, with studies showing increased population density and average size following legal protection and harvest regulations (Action 3538).",

For Mallorcan midwife toads specifically, three studies found that captive-bred individuals released as tadpoles, toadlets or adults established breeding populations at 38%, 80% or 100% of sites respectively (Action 873). However, one study found that while predator defences were maintained, genetic diversity was reduced in captive-bred reintroduced populations, and toads bred in captivity for nine or more generations showed slower tadpole development, reduction in predator defence traits and decreased genetic diversity (Actions 873, 837).\n\nFor other toad species, two of three studies found that captive-bred toads released as tadpoles, juveniles or metamorphs established populations, with success rates of 70% at some sites (Action 875). However, outcomes varied significantly by species - studies of Puerto Rican crested toads found low survival rates with 25% predated within two days of release (Action 875). Head-starting programs showed more positive results, with six of 10 studies finding that released head-started tadpoles, metamorphs or juveniles established breeding populations or increased existing populations (Action 881).\n\nCaptive breeding success rates also varied by species and conditions. Ten studies found that various toad species produced eggs successfully in captivity, with eight successfully raising captive-bred toads to tadpoles, toadlets or adults, though two found that most toads died after hatching or metamorphosis (Action 848). For harlequin toads, breeding success was more challenging, with only three of five studies achieving reproduction in captivity (Action 836). Environmental factors significantly affected outcomes, with reproductive success influenced by tank humidity and outdoor enclosures showing higher success rates than indoor tanks (Action 848).",

Lighting shows mixed effects across all three studies examining this factor (Action 884). Substrate type influences usage, with natural substrates used more than artificial ones in three of six studies (Action 884).

Entrance location affects usage patterns in one study, and tunnel climate influences usage in one study (Action 884). \n\nBarrier fencing is crucial for guiding amphibians to entrances, as the majority of effective culverts/tunnels had barrier fencing, and one study found decreased road deaths only when barrier fencing was also installed (Action 884). Barriers must be at least 0.6 m high to prevent green frogs and leopard frogs from climbing over (Action 756). However, some amphibians like treefrogs and 10% of common toads can still climb over barrier fencing during breeding migrations (Action 756).\n\nCertain design features result in failure: one-way tunnels with vertical entry chutes resulted in high mortality of common toads, and condensation deposits from steel culverts had very high metal concentrations (Action 884). Studies of culverts with flowing water show mixed results, with some being used by amphibians and others rarely used or not used at all (Action 884).

The presence of water has mixed effects in two of three studies (Action 884). Entrance location affects usage patterns in one study, and tunnel climate influences usage in one study (Action 884). \\n\\nBarrier fencing is crucial for guiding amphibians to entrances, as the majority of effective culverts/tunnels had barrier fencing, and one study found decreased road deaths only when barrier fencing was also installed (Action 884). Barriers must be at least 0.6 m high to prevent green frogs and leopard frogs from climbing over (Action 756). However, some amphibians like treefrogs and 10% of common toads can still climb over barrier fencing during breeding migrations (Action 756).\\n\\nCertain design features result in failure: one-way tunnels with vertical entry chutes resulted in high mortality of common toads, and condensation deposits from steel culverts had very high metal concentrations (Action 884). Studies of culverts with flowing water show mixed results, with some being used by amphibians and others rarely used or not used at all (Action 884). Despite mitigation efforts, one study found that thousands of amphibians were still killed on roads even with culverts installed (Action 884).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"884\",\n    \"756\"\n  ]\n}"
