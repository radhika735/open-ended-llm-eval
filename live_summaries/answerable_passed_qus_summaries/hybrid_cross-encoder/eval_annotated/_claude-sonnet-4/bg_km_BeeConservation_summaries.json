    "relevant_summary": "The most effective ways to manage uncropped field margins on European farmland to support bumblebees include several approaches based on evidence from European trials. Sowing uncropped arable field margins with agricultural nectar and pollen seed mix has been documented to support foraging bumblebees in five replicated trials in Europe, with four trials showing that field margins sown with perennial leguminous flowering plants attract significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated, grassy or cropped field margins (Action 18). Agricultural forage plant mixes including legumes attract greater numbers of bumblebees than perennial wildflower mixes, at least in the first year, though margins sown with agricultural legume plants degrade in their value to bumblebees and would need re-sowing every few years according to three UK trials (Action 18). \n\nSowing uncropped field margins with native wild flower seed mix is also effective, with five replicated UK trials showing that such margins support higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees than cropped field edges, grassy margins or naturally regenerated uncropped margins, with perennial leguminous herbs in seed mixtures being particularly important forage sources for bumblebees, especially long-tongued species (Action 19). Leaving arable field margins uncropped with natural regeneration has shown benefits in four replicated UK trials, with more bumblebees and bee species foraging on uncropped field margins than on cropped margins, though the value is not consistent from year to year and is often based on thistle species considered pernicious weeds (Action 20).\n\nFor nesting habitat, increasing areas of rough grassland provides important nesting sites, with one replicated controlled trial in Scotland showing that grassy field margins attracted nest-searching queen bumblebees at higher densities than cropped field margins (Action 12). Providing grass strips at field margins shows mixed results, with some trials showing enhanced abundance and diversity of bumblebees while others showed no effect (Action 14). European agri-environment schemes have shown variable results, with four trials showing enhanced diversity and abundance of wild bees while four other trials found no enhancement (Action 24).",

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes. In one trial, these introduced species more commonly occupied the boxes than native bees.\\nA small trial tested three soil-filled nest boxes for the mining bee Andrena flavipes in the UK, but they were not occupied.\"\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "Several effective actions can be taken to support wild bee populations in urban areas and along infrastructure corridors. Stopping the use of herbicides on pavements and road verges has proven beneficial, with restored roadside prairies where herbicide application was restricted showing greater species richness and abundance of butterflies than verges dominated by non-native weeds with unrestricted herbicide use (Action 3899). Managing land under power lines for wildlife provides habitat for bees, with one study finding more bee species under power lines managed as scrub than in annually mown grassland (Action 31).\n\nAltering mowing regimes on greenspaces and road verges significantly benefits pollinators, with less frequently mown or unmown urban greenspaces showing higher species richness and diversity of butterflies and moths than more frequently mown areas (Action 3841). Additionally, roads and verges managed by mowing once or twice a year, or not at all, had similar abundance of butterflies to remnant prairies (Action 3854).\n\nRestoring or maintaining species-rich grassland along road and railway verges is highly effective, with restored roadside prairies and verges sown with native wildflowers showing higher species richness and diversity of butterflies, day-flying moths, burnet moths, and meadow-specialist moths than verges dominated by non-native vegetation (Action 3854). Verges with more butterfly species' larval food plants and more plant species in flower had greater abundance of butterflies and burnet moths.\n\nProviding nest boxes for solitary bees is a practical urban solution, with ten studies showing nest boxes were readily used by bees, and repeated nest box provision almost doubling the number of occupied solitary bee nests over three years (Action 80). Occupancy rates ranged from 1-26% of available cavities, supporting between 4.6 and 33 bee species.\n\nPlanting nectar flower mixtures and wildflower strips enhances urban pollinator habitat, with sixty-five studies reporting effects on invertebrates and fifty showing positive results (Action 442). Sown wildflower strips consistently showed higher species richness and diversity of butterflies and moths than conventional field margins, unsown margins, or cropped fields, with higher abundance of generalist and specialist butterflies (Action 3932).",

    "relevant_summary": "Documented outcomes from 22 trials across 13 countries show that captive rearing of bumblebee colonies has been attempted using various methods including confining mated queens alone, with bumblebee workers, honey bee workers, male bumblebee pupae, or following anaesthetisation with CO2 (Action 50). Success rates vary significantly by species, with some North American declining species showing particular challenges - while queens of half-black bumblebee B. vagans and yellow-banded bumblebees B. terricola successfully reared adults in captivity, yellow bumblebee B. fervidus consistently failed as queens laid eggs but larvae died before becoming adults, and similar patterns occurred with rusty-patched bumblebee and American bumblebee B. pensylvanicus (Action 50). One trial documented that over four years of artificial rearing, Bombus terrestris queens gradually decreased in weight (Action 50). Diet composition significantly influences reproductive success, with buff-tailed bumblebee B. terrestris colonies fed freshly frozen pollen producing larger queens with better survival and larger colonies compared to those fed dried, frozen pollen, and workers producing more offspring when fed higher protein content pollen (Action 50). Artificial light regimes of eight hours light and 16 hours darkness can reduce egg-laying time in artificially reared queen B. terrestris relative to constant darkness (Action 50). Hibernation protocols show that queens hibernated at 4-5\u00b0C for 45 days had enhanced egg-laying and colony formation rates but produced smaller colonies than non-hibernated queens, and queens should weigh more than 0.6g and be hibernated for four months or less for good survival (Action 50). For reintroduction, seven replicated trials monitored laboratory-reared colonies introduced to the environment, with variable success - in two UK trials numbers of queens per colony were very low or zero, while two other trials produced good numbers of new queens (Action 52). Social parasitism by cuckoo bees presents a significant challenge, with rates varying from 0% in five trials to 25-66% and 79% in others, though parasitism was reduced by placing colonies in landscapes with intermediate nectar and pollen availability and releasing later in the season (Action 52). Supplementary feeding effects are inconsistent, with one Canadian trial showing improved reproductive success but no reduction in parasite load, while a USA trial found no increase in colony productivity (Action 52). Translocation trials from the 1950s-1960s showed evidence of queen death and lower colony productivity, with only early bumblebee Bombus pratorum colonies adapting well to being moved (Action 53).",

All three trials tried to rear the yellow bumblebee B. fervidus and in all cases the queens laid eggs but the larvae died before becoming adults. One trial found the same pattern for the rusty-patched bumblebee and the American bumblebee B. pensylvanicus.

In one trial, buff-tailed bumblebee B. terrestris colonies fed on freshly frozen pollen produced larger queens that survived better and produced larger colonies themselves than colonies fed on dried, frozen pollen. Two replicated trials demonstrated that B. terrestris workers can produce more offspring when fed types of pollen with a higher protein content.\\nTwo replicated experiments showed that an artificial light regime of eight hours light, 16 hours darkness, can reduce the time taken for artificially reared queen B. terrestris to lay eggs, relative to rearing in constant darkness.\\nWe have captured two replicated trials examining the effect of different artificial hibernation regimes in B. terrestris. One showed that hibernation of queens at 4-5\\u00b0C for 45 days enhanced egg-laying and colony formation rates, but hibernated queens produced smaller colonies than non-hibernated queens. The second showed that queens should weigh more than 0.6 g (wet weight) and be hibernated for four months or less to have a good chance of surviving.\"\n}"

Action 42 found that Nosema bombi infections can occur in managed western bumblebee colonies, though the antibiotic fumagillin was not effective against this infection in trials. Indian meal moth infestations in commercial bumblebee colonies can be controlled using the insect pathogen Bacillus thuringiensis at a strength of 1 g Bt/litre of water.\n\n**Pest Management Issues:**\nAction 41 identified that small hive beetle spread through commercial honey bee transport packages is problematic, with more than half the beetles escaping packages and not being killed by mite-killing strips in trials.\n\n**Parasite and Predation Concerns:**\nAction 54 noted that parasites and pathogens can be problematic for commercially managed solitary bee species in the family Megachilidae, though specific control methods have been developed. Action 47 documented mortality rates ranging from 2-56% overall in managed solitary bee populations due to parasitism and other factors, with rates varying significantly by location and species.\n\n**Parasitism in Released Colonies:**\nAction 52 found variable rates of social parasitism by cuckoo bees in laboratory-reared bumblebee colonies released to the wild, ranging from 0% in some trials to 79% in others. Parasitism rates were reduced by placing colonies in landscapes with intermediate rather than very high nectar and pollen availability, and releasing them late rather than early in the season.\n\n**Management Practices:**\nAction 54 showed that local solitary bee populations can increase up to six-fold in one year under management when good conditions and plentiful floral resources are provided. However, Action 54 also found high larval mortality when rearing bees on artificial diets, including honey bee-collected pollen.",

In two of these (both in the UK), the numbers of queens/colony were very low or zero. In two trials, good numbers of new queens were produced.\\nRates of social parasitism by cuckoo bees Bombus [Psithyrus] spp. in colonies released to the wild are variable. Two replicated trials in Canada and the UK found high rates (25-66% and 79% respectively). The UK trial showed that parasitism was reduced by placing colonies in landscapes with intermediate rather than very high nectar and pollen availability, late, rather than early in the season. Five other replicated trials reported no social parasites. We have not found evidence to compare rates of parasitism in artificial nest boxes with the rate in natural nests.\\nTwo replicated trials examined the effects of supplementary feeding for bumblebee colonies placed in the field. One, in Canada, found supplementary feeding improved the reproductive success of captive-reared colonies, but did not reduce their parasite load.

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes. In one trial, these introduced species more commonly occupied the boxes than native bees.\\nA small trial tested three soil-filled nest boxes for the mining bee Andrena flavipes in the UK, but they were not occupied.\"\n}"

For hedge management for bees in Scotland, one replicated controlled trial showed that hedges managed under the Scottish Rural Stewardship scheme do not attract more nest-searching or foraging queen bumblebees in spring than conventionally managed hedgerows (Action 15). Additionally, studies on general hedge management found mixed results - five studies from the UK found that hedge management did not affect numbers of bumblebee queens (Action 116). For managing land under power lines for bees in the USA, one replicated trial in Maryland found more bee species under power lines managed as scrub than in equivalent areas of annually mown grassland (Action 31). However, it should be noted that there is currently no captured evidence for the effects of managing land under power lines specifically to benefit wildlife on farmland (Action 99). While related studies on butterflies and moths under power lines show positive management effects in multiple countries including the USA, these findings cannot be directly extrapolated to bee populations (Action 3855). The limited evidence suggests that power line corridor management in the USA may show more promise for bee conservation than hedge management approaches tested in Scotland, though more research is needed for definitive comparisons.",

    "relevant_summary": "Evidence for the effectiveness of different sown floral mixes on agricultural land for wild bees shows varied outcomes depending on mix composition and bee species. Five replicated trials in Europe documented bumblebees foraging on field margins sown with agricultural nectar and pollen seed mixes, with four trials showing that margins sown with perennial leguminous flowering plants attracted significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated, grassy, or cropped field margins (Action 18). Three replicated trials demonstrated that agricultural forage plant mixes including legumes attracted greater numbers of bumblebees than perennial wildflower mixes, at least in the first year (Action 18). However, three UK trials found that margins sown with agricultural legume plants degraded in value to bumblebees and would need re-sowing every few years (Action 18). Fourteen trials in Europe and North America recorded substantial numbers of wild bees foraging on perennial or annual sown flowering plants in agricultural environments (Action 17). Ten trials monitoring bees foraging on patches with high proportions of phacelia found substantial numbers of foraging wild bees, particularly bumblebees, with species counts ranging from eight to 35 (Action 17). Five replicated UK trials showed that uncropped field margins sown with wild flowers supported higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees than cropped field edges, grassy margins, or naturally regenerated margins (Action 19). Two trials demonstrated that perennial leguminous herbs in seed mixtures were important forage sources for bumblebees, particularly long-tongued species (Action 19). One replicated trial showed long-tongued bumblebee species strongly preferred perennial wildflower seed mix over annual forage plant mixes (Action 19). One large trial showed positive correlation between long-tongued bumblebee abundance and the number of pollen and nectar agri-environment agreements (Action 362). However, evidence for solitary bees remains limited, with no evidence captured on field margin management effects for this group (Actions 18, 19).",

One replicated controlled trial in Germany and four small trials have demonstrated that artificially exposed areas of bare soil can be successfully colonised by ground-nesting solitary bees and wasps in the first or second year (Action 13). However, no evidence has been captured for the effect of creating areas of bare ground on bee populations or communities on a larger scale (Action 13). Evidence on whether reduced tillage benefits ground-nesting bees is mixed, with two replicated trials on squash farms in the USA showing contrasting results - one found no difference in bee abundance between tilled and untilled farms, while the other found three times more squash bees on no-till farms than on conventional farms (Action 11). Four replicated trials in Europe have shown enhanced diversity and/or abundance of foraging wild bees on land managed under various European agri-environment schemes, including Swiss Ecological Compensation Areas, German organic arable farming, Dutch botanical and meadow bird agreements, and the Scottish Rural Stewardship Scheme (Action 24). However, four other replicated trials in Europe found that the number of bees and/or bee species is not enhanced on land managed under agri-environment schemes in certain contexts (Action 24). While artificial nest sites for solitary bees have shown success across 30 replicated trials in 10 countries with 29 trials showing occupancy by bees (Action 47), one replicated controlled trial showed that excluding ants from solitary nesting sites can increase production of offspring for ground-nesting species (Action 46).",

One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes.

Reducing pesticide or herbicide use generally has been evaluated, with one replicated trial in the USA showing that numbers of foraging bees on squash farms are not affected by the responsible use of pesticides (Action 27). Restricting certain pesticides has been studied, with one site comparison study in Italy showing that a reduction in the number of solitary bee species in late summer associated with repeated applications of the insecticide fenitrothion can be avoided by not applying the insecticide (Action 26). Altering the timing of insecticide use has been examined, though the key messages focus on effects on natural enemies, pests, and yields rather than specifically on wild bees (Action 723). Using pesticides only when pests or crop damage reach threshold levels has been evaluated, resulting in fewer pesticide applications and lower production costs, though the studies primarily measured effects on natural enemies and crop outcomes (Action 750). Leaving headlands in fields unsprayed (conservation headlands) has been studied, showing benefits for butterflies and moths with greater species richness and abundance in unsprayed headlands compared to those sprayed with herbicide and insecticide (Action 3898). Additionally, restricting certain pesticides has shown that areas not sprayed with specific chemicals like glyphosate had greater species richness and higher abundance of butterflies compared to sprayed areas (Action 3896).",

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes.

One replicated controlled trial in the UK showed that planted perennial leguminous herbs, including clovers, were more attractive to bumblebees in landscapes with a greater proportion of arable farming (action 17). Evidence for local patch scale effectiveness: Fourteen trials in Europe and North America have recorded substantial numbers of wild bees foraging on perennial or annual sown flowering plants in the agricultural environment (action 17). Ten trials found substantial numbers of foraging wild bees on phacelia patches, with six trials recording 8-35 bee species (action 17). Four replicated trials in Europe have shown enhanced diversity and/or abundance of foraging wild bees on land managed under various European agri-environment schemes, relative to conventionally-managed fields or field margins (action 24).

These successful schemes included the Swiss Ecological Compensation Areas, the German organic arable farming option, the Dutch botanical and meadow bird agreements, and the Scottish Rural Stewardship Scheme (Action 24). However, four other replicated trials in Europe found no enhancement in bee numbers and/or species, including meadow bird agreements in wet grassland in the Netherlands, measures to protect steppe-living birds and compensation measures around a National Park in Spain, and 6 m wide grass field margin strips in England (Action 24). On a landscape scale, two replicated trials in the UK found that bumblebee populations were not enhanced on farmland managed under agri-environment schemes (Action 24). Studies of specific management practices show variable results: four replicated trials in Europe comparing extensively managed farmland meadows with conventional ones found that two showed enhanced numbers and diversity of wild bees on meadows with delayed first cut and little agrochemical use, while two found no difference (Action 22). Evidence on organic farming is also equivocal, with three replicated trials in Europe or Canada showing higher wild bee abundance under organic arable farming, while three other trials found no significant difference between conventional and organic farms (Action 25).",

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes.

For species-rich grassland restoration, one replicated controlled trial in Scotland found that species-rich grassland managed under agri-environment schemes attracted more nest-searching queen bumblebees but fewer foraging queens in spring than unmanaged grassland, and three small trials found that restored species-rich grasslands had similar flower-visiting insect communities (dominated by bees and/or flies) to paired ancient species-rich grasslands (Action 8). Regarding grazing reduction effects, studies evaluating seasonal removal of livestock and reduced grazing intensity showed that reduced grazing benefited some bee and wasp abundance but not species richness (Action 704). Four replicated trials in Europe demonstrated enhanced diversity and/or abundance of foraging wild bees on land managed under various European agri-environment schemes relative to conventionally-managed fields, though four other trials found that bee numbers and species were not enhanced under different agri-environment schemes (Action 24). The effectiveness appears to depend on specific management combinations, timing of interventions, and local conditions rather than showing consistent superiority of any single approach.",

    "relevant_summary": "Several factors influence the occupancy and productivity of artificial nest sites for solitary bees. Distance from foraging resources is critical - nest boxes must be placed within 150-600 m of forage resources based on replicated experiments estimating the foraging range of four medium to large European solitary bee species (Action 47). Nest box design and materials significantly affect productivity - reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees per nest than other types, while nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, plastic or paper tubes were much less productive due to parasitism or mould (Action 47). Occupancy rates varied from 1-26% of available cavities in studies (Action 80). Twenty-three replicated trials showed cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees, while eleven trials demonstrated occupation of drilled wooden blocks (Action 47). Parasitism and predation significantly impact productivity - mortality rates range from 13% for cavity-nesting bees and wasps in Germany to 56% overall mortality for subtropical carpenter bees in India (Action 47). Temperature regimes are important for survival in rearing conditions (Action 54). Ant exclusion can increase offspring production, as demonstrated in one controlled trial with Australian bee Exonurea nigrescens (Action 46). Multiple years of nest box provision can increase occupancy - the number of occupied solitary bee nests almost doubled over three years in Germany (Actions 47, 80). Some sites showed population increases over time, with one study finding estimated foraging bee numbers increased in fields with nest boxes compared to fields without boxes (Action 47).",

Parasitism and mortality rates are significant concerns, with eleven replicated trials recording solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators (Action 47). Mortality rates range from 13% for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany to 56% mortality overall for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India (Action 47). Competition from introduced species is another problem, as two replicated trials in California showed that introduced European earwigs and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes, with these introduced species more commonly occupying the boxes than native bees in one trial (Action 47). Nest box design significantly affects success, with plastic-lined holes or plastic/paper tubes being much less productive due to parasitism or mould compared to other materials (Action 47). Very low uptake rates are documented for bumblebee nest boxes, with three trials since 1989 in the UK showing 0-2.5% uptake rates for various designs not including underground boxes (Action 48). For certain bee species, complete failure to use nest boxes occurs, as one trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes, and a small trial with soil-filled nest boxes for mining bee Andrena flavipes in the UK found they were not occupied (Action 47).",

    "relevant_summary": "Several factors have been shown to affect the success of captive-rearing and reintroducing bumblebee colonies based on experimental evidence. Diet composition significantly influences reproductive success in captive-reared bumblebees, with three replicated trials demonstrating that pollen diet affects reproductive outcomes (Action 50). Buff-tailed bumblebee colonies fed on freshly frozen pollen produced larger queens that survived better and produced larger colonies themselves compared to colonies fed on dried, frozen pollen, and workers can produce more offspring when fed pollen with higher protein content (Action 50). Social parasitism by cuckoo bees represents a major challenge, with variable rates of parasitism observed in reintroduced colonies ranging from zero to 79% across different trials (Action 52). Parasitism rates were reduced by placing colonies in landscapes with intermediate rather than very high nectar and pollen availability and releasing them late rather than early in the season (Action 52). Supplementary feeding showed mixed results, with one Canadian trial finding it improved reproductive success of captive-reared colonies but did not reduce parasite load, while a USA trial found no increase in colony productivity (Action 52). Artificial hibernation regimes affect colony establishment, with hibernation at 4-5\u00b0C for 45 days enhancing egg-laying and colony formation rates, though hibernated queens produced smaller colonies than non-hibernated queens (Action 50). Queens should weigh more than 0.6 g and be hibernated for four months or less for good survival chances (Action 50). Light regimes also influence development, with eight hours light and 16 hours darkness reducing the time for artificially reared queens to lay eggs compared to constant darkness (Action 50). Additionally, translocation can negatively impact colonies, with evidence showing queen death and lower colony productivity following movement (Action 53).",

Buff-tailed bumblebee colonies fed on freshly frozen pollen produced larger queens that survived better and produced larger colonies themselves compared to colonies fed on dried, frozen pollen, and workers can produce more offspring when fed pollen with higher protein content (Action 50). Social parasitism by cuckoo bees represents a major challenge, with variable rates of parasitism observed in reintroduced colonies ranging from zero to 79% across different trials (Action 52). Parasitism rates were reduced by placing colonies in landscapes with intermediate rather than very high nectar and pollen availability and releasing them late rather than early in the season (Action 52). Supplementary feeding showed mixed results, with one Canadian trial finding it improved reproductive success of captive-reared colonies but did not reduce parasite load, while a USA trial found no increase in colony productivity (Action 52). Artificial hibernation regimes affect colony establishment, with hibernation at 4-5\u00b0C for 45 days enhancing egg-laying and colony formation rates, though hibernated queens produced smaller colonies than non-hibernated queens (Action 50). Queens should weigh more than 0.6 g and be hibernated for four months or less for good survival chances (Action 50). Light regimes also influence development, with eight hours light and 16 hours darkness reducing the time for artificially reared queens to lay eggs compared to constant darkness (Action 50). Additionally, translocation can negatively impact colonies, with evidence showing queen death and lower colony productivity following movement (Action 53).\", \"action_ids\": [\"50\",\"52\",\"53\"]}",
