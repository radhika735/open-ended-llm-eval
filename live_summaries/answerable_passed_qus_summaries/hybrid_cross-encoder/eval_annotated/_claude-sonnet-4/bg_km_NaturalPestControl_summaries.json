Altering the timing of insecticide use resulted in more natural enemies when insecticides were sprayed earlier rather than later in the growing season (Action 723). Using pesticides only when pests or crop damage reach threshold levels increased numbers of natural enemies in two of three years, though effects lasted for as little as three weeks (Action 750). Additionally, threshold-based spraying regimes resulted in fewer pesticide applications being needed (Action 750). Delaying herbicide use led to more natural enemies, though some but not all natural enemy groups benefited and fewer groups benefited early in the season (Action 774). Incorporating parasitism rates when setting thresholds for insecticide use resulted in acceptable levels of crop damage from pests, though effects on natural enemy populations were not monitored (Action 726). Using mass-emergence devices to increase natural enemy populations resulted in higher parasitism at one site but no effect at another site in urban areas (Action 775).",

Growing cover crops in arable fields can reduce weeds, with four replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Israel and Italy finding fewer weeds in plots with cover crops compared to plots without them (Action 1394). Growing plants that compete with damaging weeds is effective, with nine studies from Australia, Slovakia, the UK and the USA finding reduced weed plant weight or ground cover when planting competitive species, and five studies finding that competition reduced weed reproduction, survival or both (Action 722). Converting to organic farming provides weed control through non-chemical methods, with three randomized, replicated, controlled studies from the USA finding more weeds in organically farmed fields but demonstrating that organic methods can manage weeds without herbicides (Action 717). Reducing tillage affects weed populations, with studies finding increased numbers of some weeds and/or weed species under reduced tillage compared to conventional management (Action 126). Physical weed control methods are documented, including cutting which was found effective for controlling weeds like creeping thistle, and long-term grazing control which achieved effective weed management (Action 123). Manual harvesting or hand-weeding is referenced as a physical control method, though specific effectiveness evidence for farmland applications was not found (Action 1575). These methods provide farmers with multiple non-herbicide options for managing weeds while maintaining crop productivity.",

Two studies found that crop type affected the number of weeds under different tillage regimes.\\nOne small replicated trial in the UK compared bird numbers under two different forms of reduced tillage, and found more birds from species that make up the \\u2018Farmland Bird Index\\u2019 on broadcast than non-inversion tillage fields.\\nTwo studies looked at the long-term effects of reduced tillage on earthworms (after ten years). One study found higher earthworm biomass under reduced tillage, the other study found earthworm abundance was the same between conventional and reduced tillage plots.\\nThree of the studies mentioned above did not distinguish between the effects of reducing tillage and reduced pesticide and/or fertilizer inputs.\"\n}"

Mass-emergence devices used in urban areas showed mixed results, with one randomised, replicated, controlled study in Switzerland finding higher parasitism at one site but no effect at another site (action 775). Excluding ants that protect pests can enhance parasitism, as one of two replicated, controlled studies from Japan and the USA found greater parasitism of pests by natural enemies when ants were excluded from trees, though another study found greater parasitism at only one site with no effect at another (action 886). Alley cropping systems showed variable effects on parasitism, with two of four studies from Kenya and the USA finding that effects varied between study sites, sampling dates, pest life stages or the width of crop alleys, while two studies found no effect on parasitism (action 718). One intervention specifically addresses incorporating parasitism rates when setting thresholds for insecticide use, with one controlled study from New Zealand finding this approach resulted in acceptable levels of crop damage from pests (action 726). Flower strips and wildflower plantings were found to benefit invertebrates generally, with 50 out of 65 individual studies reporting positive effects on invertebrates including increased abundance and species richness, though specific parasitism rate effects were not detailed (action 442).",

    "relevant_summary": "Evidence for the effectiveness of manipulating field structure with linear features shows mixed but generally positive results across multiple taxa and agricultural contexts. For beetle banks, studies demonstrate enhanced biodiversity benefits including higher densities of harvest mouse nests compared to field margins (Action ID: 2393), and increased abundance of micro-moths compared to conventionally managed field margins (Action ID: 3927). Beetle banks support more invertebrate predators than surrounding crops, though effects varied with time, and reviews found that predators increased in adjacent crops with potential economic savings if they prevented pests from reaching spray thresholds or causing 5% yield loss (Action ID: 729).\n\nFor hedges, evidence shows established hedgerows had higher species richness of butterflies and macro-moths than in-field beetle banks, crops or pasture in studies from the UK, Ireland and Canada (Action ID: 3976). Newly planted hedges had higher abundance, species richness or diversity of beetles or spiders than crop fields or field margins, with newly established hedges supporting more ground beetles than older hedges (Action ID: 538). However, natural enemy abundance in hedges was affected by the type of hedge shrub/tree planted (Action ID: 752).\n\nAlley cropping showed variable effectiveness, with studies finding that effects on parasitism varied between study sites, sampling dates, pest life stages or crop alley width, and mixed effects on pest populations - two of four studies found more pests in alley cropped plots while one found fewer pests (Action ID: 718). One study found intercropping with trees resulted in higher diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Action ID: 903).\n\nGrass buffer strips and field margins demonstrated consistent benefits for butterflies and moths, with wider grass margins (up to 6m wide) having greater species richness or diversity than narrower margins, and floristically enhanced grass buffers or wildflower strips having higher abundance of butterflies than standard grass margins (Action ID: 3982). Field studies found more positive population trends and higher populations for some bird species at sites with grass margins (Action ID: 191).",

Creating beetle banks (Action 729) provides refuges for invertebrate predators, with studies showing more natural enemies on beetle banks than in surrounding crops. Planting or maintaining ground cover in orchards or vineyards (Action 1395) was found by multiple studies to increase natural enemy numbers in some or all comparisons, though effects varied. Growing non-crop plants that produce chemicals to attract natural enemies (Action 724) showed increased natural enemy numbers in plots with attractive plants. Planting new hedges (Action 752) can support natural enemies, though effects varied between hedge species and natural enemy groups.\n\n**Canopy-focused actions** include isolating colonies of beneficial ants (Action 773), where one study found predatory ants occupied more cashew trees when colonies were kept isolated. Excluding ants that protect pests (Action 886) affects natural enemies in tree canopies, with studies showing effects varied between natural enemy species and groups. Using chemicals to attract natural enemies (Action 754) can be applied in canopy systems, with some studies finding increased natural enemies though effects varied between enemy groups and sites.\n\n**Combined ground and canopy approaches** include diversifying ground vegetation and canopy structure in habitat around woody crops (Action 3526), which affects the overall ecosystem supporting natural enemies. Allowing natural regeneration of ground cover beneath perennial crops (Action 720) was found to affect natural enemies both on the ground and in crop tree or vine canopies, though results varied between studies.",
