One randomized, controlled study in the USA found that treating little brown bats with a probiotic bacterium within a mine increased survival for free-flying bats, but not caged bats (2008). The same USA study found that little brown bats kept within cages in a mine and treated with a probiotic bacterium had a similar severity of white-nose syndrome to untreated bats (2008). For all other strategies including culling infected bats (1012), vaccination against the pathogen (1011), breeding bats in captivity to supplement affected populations (2009), restricting human access to caves (1010), treating hibernacula environments to reduce pathogen reservoirs (2007), and decontaminating equipment to reduce pathogen spread (2006), no studies were found that evaluated their effectiveness on bat populations.",

Green bridges are effective structures, with one study in the UK finding that a green bridge was used by 97% of bats crossing a road (Action 979). Bat gantries or bat bridges represent another option, though studies show mixed effectiveness - two replicated studies in the UK found that fewer bats used bat gantries than crossed the road below at traffic height, and one bat gantry was not used at all, while one replicated study in France found that a temporary bat gantry was used by three bat species/species groups, but almost half of crossing bats flew over the road at other locations (Action 978). Overpasses are used by multiple bat species, with studies in Ireland and France finding that two or three bat species/species groups used overpasses, though up to three-quarters of bats crossed the road below at traffic height or crossed at other nearby locations. One study in the UK found that an overpass with planters was used by two-thirds of crossing bats, while an unvegetated overpass with a paved road over it was not used by crossing bats (Action 977). Underpasses or culverts are also viable options, with eight studies in Germany, Ireland, the UK, Australia and France finding that bats used underpasses and culverts below roads, and crossed over the roads above them, in varying proportions. One study in Australia found that bat species adapted to cluttered habitats used small culverts and underpasses more than bat species adapted to open or edge habitats, and one study in France found that the use of underpasses by five bat species was influenced by underpass type and height, road width, and the amount of forest and hedgerows in the surrounding landscape (Action 976).

Increasing the wind speed at which turbines become operational (cut-in speed) has been extensively studied with 10 of 12 studies showing reduced bat fatalities compared to conventionally operated turbines (Action ID: 1960). Preventing turbine blades from turning at low wind speeds through feathering has shown effectiveness in 5 of 6 studies, with the studies conducted in the USA and Canada demonstrating fewer bat fatalities than at conventionally operated turbines (Action ID: 970). Automatically reducing turbine blade rotation when bat activity is predicted to be high resulted in fewer bat fatalities for all bat species combined and for five specific bat species according to two replicated studies in Germany and the USA (Action ID: 971). Slowing the rotation of turbine blades at low wind speeds was found to reduce bat fatalities in one replicated, randomized, controlled study in Canada (Action ID: 2939). Ultrasonic deterrents showed mixed results, with three studies in the USA finding variable effectiveness ranging from 21-51% reduction in bat fatalities in some cases to minimal effects in others (Action ID: 968).

For fruit orchards, specific deterrent methods include using organic deterrent spray, hanging plastic flags in trees, covering individual tree branches with nylon net bags, and ringing bells in lychee trees to deter flying foxes and fruit bats from accessing fruit (Action 1953). Studies in Madagascar and Mauritius found these methods reduced damage to lychees caused by Madagascan flying foxes and Mauritius fruit bats. For wind turbine conflicts, ultrasonic deterrents can be used to deter bats from turbines, with studies showing 21-51% fewer bat fatalities at turbines with ultrasonic deterrents fitted compared to control turbines, though results were mixed across different studies (Action 968). Additional preventive approaches mentioned include avoiding planting fruit trees alongside roads/railways in areas with fruit bats (Action 1970), and educating farmers, local communities and pest controllers to reduce indiscriminate culling of vampire bats (Action 2044), though no studies have yet evaluated the effectiveness of these latter approaches.",

Using ultraviolet filters on lights can be beneficial, with one study finding that hedges lit with ultraviolet filtered lights had higher soprano pipistrelle activity than hedges lit with unfiltered light (action 1020). Using shielded \"full cut-off\" lights to remove outwards lighting can reduce light scattering, as demonstrated by studies showing fewer moths were attracted to lights fitted with blinds to prevent light scattering compared to conventional lights (action 3904). Low intensity lighting also reduces attraction, with studies showing fewer moths were attracted to low intensity lights compared to higher intensity lights (action 3902).",

    "relevant_summary": "Several specific actions have been identified to protect bats during and after mine closure and reclamation operations. During mine closure and reclamation, actions include excluding bats from roosts prior to mine reclamation (Action 1961) and relocating bats from reclaimed mines to alternative subterranean roost sites (Action 975). After mine closure, protection measures include retaining access points for bats following mine closures (Action 1962) and reopening entrances to closed mines and making them suitable for roosting bats (Action 1965). To maintain suitable conditions for bats in closed mines, maintaining microclimate in closed/abandoned mines is recommended - one study in the USA found that modifying the microclimate of an abandoned mine by closing a man-made entrance resulted in a greater number of bats hibernating within the mine (Action 1964). Installing and maintaining gates at mine entrances to restrict public access can help protect bats, though studies have shown mixed effects - nine studies found that gates can reduce bat abundance and species richness, cause behavioral changes like increased circling at entrances, and result in up to 7% of bats colliding with gates, though 43 of 47 mines continued to be used 12 years after gate installation (Action 1963). To replace lost roost sites, providing artificial subterranean bat roosts to replace roosts in reclaimed mines is an option (Action 974), and creating artificial caves or hibernacula for bats has shown some success with studies showing that artificial hibernacula were used by up to four bat species and usage increased over nine years after construction (Action 2049).",

Five studies evaluated legally protecting bat habitats, with findings showing that protected sites had greater numbers of bat species than unprotected sites in some cases, and higher overall bat activity and greater numbers of bats in protected sites and forests compared to unprotected areas (Action ID: 2045). The activity of common noctule bats was higher in protected forests than unprotected forests, and Daubenton's bat activity was higher over rivers on farms in protected areas than unprotected areas. Additionally, the distributions of 10 of 11 bat species overlapped with areas designated to protect them significantly more than by chance (Action ID: 2045).\n\nOther legislative actions identified for bat protection include introducing and enforcing legislation to control hunting of bats (Action ID: 984), enforcing regulations to prevent trafficking and trade of bats (Action ID: 1971), and introducing and enforcing legislation to regulate harvesting of bat guano (Action ID: 987). However, no studies were found that evaluated the effectiveness of these specific legislative measures (Action IDs: 984, 987, 1971). Similarly, no studies evaluated the effects of legally protecting bat species specifically (Action ID: 2037) or engaging policymakers to make policy changes beneficial to bats (Action ID: 2041).",

The most direct approach is to create artificial hollows and cracks in trees specifically for roosting bats (Action 2047). One replicated study in Australia found that eight of 16 artificial hollows cut into trees with two different entrance designs were used by roosting long-eared bats. Additionally, providing bat boxes for roosting bats (Action 1024) is extensively documented, with 44 studies showing that 41 of 43 studies found that bats used bat boxes installed in various habitats including forest or woodland, forestry plantations, and other environments. Nine replicated studies found that the number of bats using bat boxes increased by 2-10 times up to 10 years after installation. A worldwide review found that 72 bat species used bat boxes, although only 18 species commonly used them, and 31 species used them as maternity roosts. Studies also show that bat box design and positioning affect usage, with factors such as color, size, orientation, height, and habitat type influencing occupancy rates. Providing artificial dens or nest boxes on trees (Action 2584) has also been documented across 30 studies, with 27 studies finding that artificial dens or nest boxes were used by a range of mammal species for roosting and breeding.",

One study in the UK\\u00a0found higher occupancy rates in concrete than wooden bat boxes. One study in the USA\\u00a0found that Indiana bats used rocket boxes more than wooden bat boxes or bark-mimic roosts. One study in Spain\\u00a0found that more bats occupied bat boxes that had two compartments than one compartment in the breeding season. One study in Lithuania\\u00a0found that bat breeding colonies occupied standard and four/five chamber bat boxes and individuals occupied flat bat boxes. Four studies in the USA, UK, Spain\\u00a0and Australia\\u00a0found bats selecting four of nine, three of five, three of four and one of five bat box designs. One study in the UK\\u00a0found that different bat box designs were used by different species. One study in Costa Rica\\u00a0found that bat boxes simulating tree trunks were used by 100% of bats and in group sizes similar to natural roosts.\\nBat box position (11 studies): Three studies in Germany, Spain\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0found that bat box orientation and/or the amount of exposure to sunlight affected bat occupancy, and one study in Spain\\u00a0found that orientation did not have a significant effect on occupancy. Two studies in the UK\\u00a0and Italy\\u00a0found that bat box height affected occupancy, and two studies in Spain\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0found no effect of height. Two studies in the USA\\u00a0and Spain\\u00a0found higher occupancy of bat boxes on buildings than on trees. One study in Australia\\u00a0found that bat boxes were occupied more often in farm forestry sites than in native forest, one study in Poland\\u00a0found higher occupancy in pine relative to mixed deciduous stands, and one study in Costa Rica\\u00a0found higher occupancy in forest fragments than in pasture. One study in the USA\\u00a0found higher occupancy rates in areas where bats were known to roost prior to installing bat boxes. One review in the UK\\u00a0found that bat boxes were more likely to be occupied when a greater number of bat boxes were installed across a site.\"\n}"

Two UK studies found higher activity of Myotis species over water and rivers on organic farms, and one French study found higher activity for two of three bat species over organic fields compared to conventionally managed fields. Additionally, studies on reducing chemical inputs (action 2013) found that farms using few or no chemicals had different bat species compositions and higher diversity of insect-eating bat species compared to farms with high chemical inputs.

    "relevant_summary": "Several alternatives to bat exclusion have been studied during building developments to mitigate disturbance to roosts. Creating alternative bat roosts within developments has been evaluated by eleven studies, with bat boxes or bat lofts/barns being used by bats at 13-74% of development sites, and bat lofts/barns being used by maternity colonies at one of 19 development sites (Action 949). Three of five before-and-after studies found that bat colonies used purpose-built roosts in higher or similar numbers after the original roosts were destroyed, while the other two studies found that bats used purpose-built roosts in lower numbers than the original roost (Action 949). Retaining existing bat roosts and access points within developments has been studied, with four of nine bat roosts retained within developments being used as maternity colonies, in two cases by similar or greater numbers of bats after development had taken place (Action 947). One review found that bats used two-thirds of retained and modified bat roosts after development, and retained roosts were more likely to be used than newly created roosts (Action 947). Relocating access points to bat roosts within developments has been examined in two studies, with one finding that fewer brown long-eared bats used a roost after the access points were relocated, while another found that few lesser horseshoe bats used an alternative access point with a 'bend' design but increased usage occurred after an access point with a 'straight' design was installed (Action 946). Changing timing of building work has been studied, with one before-and-after study finding that carrying out roofing work outside of the bat maternity season, along with retaining bat access points, resulted in a similar number of brown long-eared bats continuing to use a roost within an attic (Action 950). Legal protection through issuing licences during development has been evaluated, with one review finding that 31-67% of compensation roosts provided under licence were used by bats (Action 1935).",

For bat box design, black bat boxes showed higher use than grey, white, or wooden boxes (Action ID 1024). Larger bat boxes had higher occupancy rates in some studies, and boxes with two compartments had more bat occupancy than single compartment boxes during breeding season (Action ID 1024). Different designs were used by different bat species, with some studies finding bats selecting specific designs out of multiple options tested (Action ID 1024). For placement factors, bat box orientation and exposure to sunlight affected occupancy in multiple studies, though one study found orientation had no significant effect (Action ID 1024). Height influenced occupancy in some studies but not others (Action ID 1024). Bat boxes on buildings had higher occupancy than those on trees in multiple studies (Action ID 1024). Habitat type affected success, with higher occupancy in farm forestry sites compared to native forest, and in pine stands relative to mixed deciduous stands (Action ID 1024). Areas where bats were previously known to roost had higher occupancy rates (Action ID 1024). Installing a greater number of bat boxes across a site increased likelihood of occupancy (Action ID 1024). For artificial hibernacula and caves, these structures were used by up to four bat species, with one artificial hibernaculum showing increasing bat use over nine years after construction (Action ID 2049). Temperature management showed mixed results, with modifications to reduce internal roost temperatures increasing bat use in buildings in one study, but heated bat boxes showing limited success in churches and only occasional use at one of seven sites tested (Action ID 2052).",

Nine replicated studies\\u00a0found bats occupying more than half of bat boxes provided (54\\u2013100%).\\n\\nOTHER (23 STUDIES)\\n\\nBat box design (16 studies): Three studies in Germany, Portugal\\u00a0and Australia\\u00a0found that bats used black bat boxes more than grey, white\\u00a0or wooden\\u00a0boxes. One of two studies in Spain\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0found higher occupancy rates in larger bat boxes. One study in the USA\\u00a0found that bats used both resin and wood cylindrical bat boxes, but another study in the USA\\u00a0found that resin bat boxes became occupied more quickly than wood boxes. One study in the UK\\u00a0found higher occupancy rates in concrete than wooden bat boxes. One study in the USA\\u00a0found that Indiana bats used rocket boxes more than wooden bat boxes or bark-mimic roosts. One study in Spain\\u00a0found that more bats occupied bat boxes that had two compartments than one compartment in the breeding season. One study in Lithuania\\u00a0found that bat breeding colonies occupied standard and four/five chamber bat boxes and individuals occupied flat bat boxes. Four studies in the USA, UK, Spain\\u00a0and Australia\\u00a0found bats selecting four of nine, three of five, three of four and one of five bat box designs. One study in the UK\\u00a0found that different bat box designs were used by different species. One study in Costa Rica\\u00a0found that bat boxes simulating tree trunks were used by 100% of bats and in group sizes similar to natural roosts.\\nBat box position (11 studies): Three studies in Germany, Spain\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0found that bat box orientation and/or the amount of exposure to sunlight affected bat occupancy, and one study in Spain\\u00a0found that orientation did not have a significant effect on occupancy. Two studies in the UK\\u00a0and Italy\\u00a0found that bat box height affected occupancy, and two studies in Spain\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0found no effect of height. Two studies in the USA\\u00a0and Spain\\u00a0found higher occupancy of bat boxes on buildings than on trees. One study in Australia\\u00a0found that bat boxes were occupied more often in farm forestry sites than in native forest, one study in Poland\\u00a0found higher occupancy in pine relative to mixed deciduous stands, and one study in Costa Rica\\u00a0found higher occupancy in forest fragments than in pasture. One study in the USA\\u00a0found higher occupancy rates in areas where bats were known to roost prior to installing bat boxes. One review in the UK\\u00a0found that bat boxes were more likely to be occupied when a greater number of bat boxes were installed across a site.\"\n}"

Slowing the rotation of turbine blades at low wind speeds was found to reduce bat fatalities in one replicated, randomized, controlled study in Canada (Action 2939). Automatically reducing turbine blade rotation when bat activity is high demonstrated effectiveness in two replicated studies in Germany and the USA, with both studies finding that this approach resulted in fewer bat fatalities for all bat species combined and for five bat species (Action 971).

However, for most of these actions except treatment with probiotics and habitat protection measures, no studies have been found evaluating their effectiveness against white-nose syndrome specifically.\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"1012\",\n    \"2009\",\n    \"1011\",\n    \"2008\",\n    \"1010\",\n    \"2007\",\n    \"2006\",\n    \"2049\",\n    \"2045\"\n  ]\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "Design factors that influence successful bat box use include color, size, material, and internal structure. Three studies found that bats used black bat boxes more than grey, white or wooden boxes (Action 1024). One of two studies found higher occupancy rates in larger bat boxes (Action 1024). Studies found varied results for materials: bats used both resin and wood cylindrical boxes, but resin boxes became occupied more quickly than wood boxes in one study, while another found higher occupancy rates in concrete than wooden boxes (Action 1024). Indiana bats used rocket boxes more than wooden boxes or bark-mimic roosts (Action 1024). Internal structure matters as more bats occupied boxes with two compartments than one compartment in the breeding season, bat breeding colonies occupied standard and four/five chamber boxes, and individuals occupied flat boxes (Action 1024). Bat boxes simulating tree trunks were used by 100% of bats in group sizes similar to natural roosts (Action 1024).\n\nPlacement factors include orientation, height, mounting location, and surrounding habitat. Three studies found that bat box orientation and/or the amount of exposure to sunlight affected bat occupancy, though one study found orientation did not have a significant effect (Action 1024). Two studies found that bat box height affected occupancy, while two other studies found no effect of height (Action 1024). Two studies found higher occupancy of bat boxes on buildings than on trees (Action 1024). Habitat influences occupancy as bat boxes were occupied more often in farm forestry sites than in native forest, higher occupancy occurred in pine relative to mixed deciduous stands, and higher occupancy was found in forest fragments than in pasture (Action 1024). Higher occupancy rates occurred in areas where bats were known to roost prior to installing bat boxes, and bat boxes were more likely to be occupied when a greater number were installed across a site (Action 1024). Temperature management also affects success, as one study found more bats in artificial roosts after they were modified to reduce internal roost temperatures (Action 2052).",

For organic farming instead of conventional farming, twelve studies were found from Europe, USA, Canada and Chile (Action 961). Results were mixed, with five of seven studies finding no difference in bat species richness between organic and non-organic farms, while two studies found more species on organic farms.

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from multiple studies, several key design and placement factors influence the successful use of bat boxes by bats. Regarding design factors, bat box color significantly affects usage, with bats using black bat boxes more than grey, white or wooden boxes (action 1024). Box size matters, as one of two studies found higher occupancy rates in larger bat boxes (action 1024). Material choice influences occupancy timing, with resin bat boxes becoming occupied more quickly than wood boxes, though both materials are used by bats (action 1024). Concrete bat boxes showed higher occupancy rates than wooden ones (action 1024). Design complexity also affects usage, with bat boxes having two compartments being occupied by more bats than single compartment boxes during breeding season, and standard and four/five chamber bat boxes being occupied by breeding colonies while flat bat boxes were used by individuals (action 1024). For placement factors, orientation and sunlight exposure affect bat occupancy according to three studies, though one study found orientation had no significant effect (action 1024). Height influences occupancy according to two studies, while two other studies found no effect of height (action 1024). Location type is important, with higher occupancy rates found for bat boxes placed on buildings compared to trees (action 1024). Habitat context affects success, with higher occupancy in farm forestry sites than native forest, higher occupancy in pine relative to mixed deciduous stands, and higher occupancy in forest fragments than in pasture (action 1024). Prior bat presence increases success rates, with higher occupancy in areas where bats were known to roost before box installation (action 1024). Installation strategy matters, as bat boxes are more likely to be occupied when a greater number are installed across a site (action 1024). Occupancy rates vary considerably, with 22 studies finding bats occupying less than half of provided bat boxes (0-49%) while nine studies found bats occupying more than half (54-100%) (action 1024).",

Material choice influences occupancy timing, with resin bat boxes becoming occupied more quickly than wood boxes, though both materials are used by bats (action 1024). Concrete bat boxes showed higher occupancy rates than wooden ones (action 1024). Design complexity also affects usage, with bat boxes having two compartments being occupied by more bats than single compartment boxes during breeding season, and standard and four/five chamber bat boxes being occupied by breeding colonies while flat bat boxes were used by individuals (action 1024). For placement factors, orientation and sunlight exposure affect bat occupancy according to three studies, though one study found orientation had no significant effect (action 1024). Height influences occupancy according to two studies, while two other studies found no effect of height (action 1024). Location type is important, with higher occupancy rates found for bat boxes placed on buildings compared to trees (action 1024). Habitat context affects success, with higher occupancy in farm forestry sites than native forest, higher occupancy in pine relative to mixed deciduous stands, and higher occupancy in forest fragments than in pasture (action 1024). Prior bat presence increases success rates, with higher occupancy in areas where bats were known to roost before box installation (action 1024). Installation strategy matters, as bat boxes are more likely to be occupied when a greater number are installed across a site (action 1024). Occupancy rates vary considerably, with 22 studies finding bats occupying less than half of provided bat boxes (0-49%) while nine studies found bats occupying more than half (54-100%) (action 1024).\", \"action_ids\": [\"1024\",\"949\"]}",
