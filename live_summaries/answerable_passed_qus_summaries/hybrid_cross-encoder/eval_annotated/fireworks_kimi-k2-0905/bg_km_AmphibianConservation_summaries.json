Shelterwood harvesting specifically showed variable results: three studies found it resulted in higher, similar, or initially higher and then similar salamander abundance compared to clearcutting (Action ID: 851). Leave-tree harvesting, where a low density of trees is left during harvest, did not result in higher salamander abundance than clearcutting (Action ID: 846).

Key approaches include: (1) Water quality modification - adding salt to ponds has shown effectiveness, as one Australian study found that salt addition kept a green and golden bell frog population free of chytridiomycosis for at least six months (action 762). (2) Temperature management - increasing enclosure or water temperature to 30-37\u00b0C for over 16 hours cured frogs and toads of chytridiomycosis in four of five studies (action 770). (3) Pond drying and treatment - pond drying combined with fungicidal treatment reduced infection levels in Mallorcan midwife toads, though it did not completely eradicate chytridiomycosis (action 766). (4) Biological control - using zooplankton to remove chytrid zoospores has been proposed but no studies have tested this approach yet (action 800). (5) Equipment sterilization - sterilizing equipment when moving between amphibian sites is recommended for preventing disease spread, though its effectiveness has not been directly tested (action 768). (6) Wildfowl management - preventing heavy usage or excluding wildfowl from aquatic habitats has been suggested but not tested (action 799).

    "relevant_summary": "The evidence documents mixed impacts of livestock grazing on amphibians and their habitats. Studies indicate that livestock exclusion from wetlands did not increase overall amphibian abundance or species numbers, though one study found increased larval abundance and green frog metamorph numbers with fencing [action_id: 746]. In grazed plots, natterjack toads did not show higher abundance compared to ungrazed plots, and common toads actually had lower abundance in grazed areas [action_id: 780]. However, habitat management that included grazing reintroduction helped maintain or increase natterjack toad populations in multiple studies [action_id: 780].\n\nRegarding habitat effects, excluding livestock from freshwater marshes for 1-30 years showed mixed effects on plant communities, with some studies finding greater vegetation abundance and height in fenced areas, while others found similar community composition between grazed and ungrazed sites [action_id: 2966]. Managing wetlands through grazing or cutting to prevent succession was evaluated primarily for butterflies and moths rather than amphibians, with limited direct evidence for amphibian habitat benefits [action_id: 3950].\n\nThe evidence suggests that livestock grazing effects on amphibians vary by species and management context, with some amphibians potentially benefiting from moderate grazing regimes while others may be negatively impacted, particularly through trampling effects during sensitive periods [action_id: 3496].",

    "relevant_summary": "Hormone treatments have been extensively studied in Australian frog captive breeding programs, with research showing they can effectively induce sperm and egg release. Studies found that hormone treatment of male amphibians stimulated or increased sperm production and resulted in successful breeding in captivity, with one review and nine of 10 replicated studies showing positive results. However, hormone treatment of females showed mixed results, with 30-71% of females producing viable eggs following treatment, and egg production depending on the combination, amount, or number of doses of hormones used. The success of hormone treatments was found to be highly dependent on dosage and treatment combinations. Artificial fertilization has been less extensively studied, with limited research available. One replicated study in Australia found that 55% of eggs were fertilized artificially, but the embryos soon died. The key challenge identified was that artificial fertilization success depended on the type and number of doses of hormones used to stimulate egg production beforehand. Both techniques face significant challenges in Australian frog captive breeding programs, with hormone treatments showing more consistent success rates for inducing gamete release, while artificial fertilization appears to have lower success rates and presents additional viability issues post-fertilization. The effectiveness of both methods is critically dependent on proper hormone protocols to stimulate reproductive processes.",

Leaving standing deadwood during clearcutting did not result in higher salamander abundances compared to total clearcutting and did not prevent decreases in salamander populations (Action 845). Tree thinning showed mixed effects depending on species and time since harvest, with some studies showing increased abundance compared to unharvested forest, while others found negative effects or no significant impact on abundance (Action 852).

Studies show mixed effects of adding coarse woody debris to forest floors, with some research finding no effect on amphibian species numbers or overall abundance, while other studies found increased frog species following restoration that included reintroducing coarse woody debris (Action 772). Creating refugia was found to maintain great crested newt populations when combined with other interventions (Action 772), and artificial refugia were used by translocated Hamilton's frogs and hellbenders, though few were used for breeding (Action 772). Providing artificial hibernacula along with other terrestrial habitat management maintained great crested newt populations (Action 759), though created hibernacula were used by common frog and smooth newts but not great crested newts in one study (Action 759). Four amphibian species were found close to hibernacula at two of three sites in another study (Action 759). Other potential actions include creating refuge areas in aquatic habitats (Action 813), creating microclimate and microhabitat refuges (Action 809), adding woody debris to ponds (Action 814), encouraging aquatic plant growth as refuge against fish predation (Action 796), and excluding fish with barriers which was shown to increase weight gain of axolotls (Action 829).

For group harvesting, three studies found that this technique did not result in higher salamander abundance compared to clearcutting (Action ID: 844). Leave-tree harvesting with low tree density also did not result in higher salamander abundance compared to clearcutting (Action ID: 846).\n\nAll partial harvesting techniques showed negative effects when compared to unharvested forests, with most studies demonstrating decreased salamander abundance and changed species composition. The reproductive success of salamanders (proportion of females carrying eggs, eggs per female, proportion of juveniles) was similar or lower in harvested plots compared to unharvested plots, regardless of the specific partial harvesting technique used (Action IDs: 851, 844, 846).",

Positive effects include establishment of translocated populations, with one study finding successful establishment of one of three translocated natterjack toad populations following limestone addition to ponds. Additionally, limestone addition has been shown to temporarily increase breeding by natterjack toads, increase larval and/or egg survival, and result in successful metamorphosis at two of three sites.\n\nHowever, negative side effects have also been documented. Studies found that adding limestone to ponds resulted in high tadpole mortality and pond abandonment by natterjack toads. Furthermore, higher numbers of abnormal common frog eggs were observed following limestone treatment.\n\nThe evidence suggests that while lime addition can provide short-term benefits for natterjack toad breeding and survival, it may also cause significant mortality and habitat abandonment issues, making it a management technique that requires careful consideration of potential drawbacks.",

Antifungal treatment, particularly itraconazole, was effective at curing amphibians of chytridiomycosis in 12 of 16 studies, including six of eight studies specifically testing itraconazole (Action ID: 882). However, six studies found that specific fungicides caused death or other negative side effects in amphibians. Temperature treatment showed high effectiveness, with four of five studies finding that increasing enclosure or water temperature to 30-37\u00b0C for over 16 hours cured frogs and toads of chytridiomycosis (Action ID: 770).\n\nThe least beneficial treatment strategies are antifungal skin bacteria or peptides and antibacterial treatments. Three of four studies found that adding antifungal bacteria to the skin of salamanders or frogs exposed to chytrid fungus did not reduce infection rate or death, and treatment with antimicrobial skin peptides did not significantly increase survival of common toads (Action ID: 764). Antibacterial treatments showed mixed results, with trimethoprim-sulfadiazine increasing survival time but not curing blue-and-yellow poison dart frogs of chytridiomycosis (Action ID: 763).",

Lighting affects usage patterns, with all three studies showing mixed effects of lighting conditions. Substrate type influences success, with three of six studies finding that natural substrates are used more than artificial ones. The presence of water has mixed effects according to two of three studies. Entrance location affects usage, as does tunnel climate. Importantly, the majority of successful culverts/tunnels had barrier fencing installed to guide amphibians to entrances. Certain designs should be avoided: one-way tunnels with vertical entry chutes caused high mortality in common toads, and condensation from steel culverts created toxic metal concentrations. Even with well-designed passages, thousands of amphibians may still be killed on roads, indicating that tunnels and culverts alone may not eliminate road mortality.",

Five found that culverts were used by less than 10% of amphibians or were not used. The use of culverts/tunnels was affected by diameter in three of six studies, with wider culverts used more, length in one of two studies, with long culverts avoided, lighting in all three studies, with mixed effects, substrate in three of six studies, with natural substrates used more, presence of water in two of three studies, with mixed effects, entrance location in one and tunnel climate in one study.\\nSix studies (including one replicated, controlled study) in Canada, Spain, the Netherlands and USA investigated the use of culverts with flowing water and found that they were used by amphibians, or rarely used by salamanders or not used, and were used more or the same amount as dry culverts.\\nCertain culvert designs were not suitable for amphibians; one-way tunnels with vertical entry chutes resulted in high mortality of common toads and condensation deposits from steel culverts had very high metal concentrations.
