Spraying insecticides earlier in the season was associated with more natural enemies in one UK study [723]. Using threshold-based spraying increased natural enemy numbers in two of three years in a Finnish study, with effects lasting as little as three weeks [750]. Delaying herbicide applications increased natural enemies in two randomized, replicated, controlled trials, though benefits differed among enemy groups and were fewer early in the season [774]. Broad reductions in chemical inputs often benefited invertebrates, but multiple studies also reported mixed, minimal or no effects [139]; specifically for butterflies and moths, reduced or less frequent chemical inputs were frequently linked to higher richness and/or abundance, with some studies finding similar levels to conventional management [3897]. Incorporating parasitism rates into insecticide thresholds produced acceptable pest damage levels, but effects on natural enemy populations were not monitored [726]. Experimental conversions to organic farming often increased natural enemies in 8 of 12 studies, but several studies found no, inconsistent or negative effects, and responses varied by enemy group and over time [717].",

    "relevant_summary": "Evidence for linear features shows mixed but often positive ecological effects, with variable pest and yield outcomes. Alley cropping: Across four replicated/controlled studies, effects on parasitism varied by site, date, pest stage or alley width, with two studies finding no effect; fungal infection effects were mixed and egg predation was lower in one study; natural enemies included more wasps and spiders but fewer ladybirds in one trial, with hedge tree types influencing some groups; pest numbers increased in two studies, decreased in one, and varied by group/year in another; crop damage increased in one study and showed no effect in another; weeds showed mixed responses; yields were lower in a USA study and similar or lower in a Philippines study; costs were lower but profits also lower in a USA study [718]. Hedges: Two studies (France, UK) found newly planted hedges had higher beetle/spider abundance, richness or diversity than crop fields or field margins, and vascular plant diversity was higher than in recently established grass margins; a review reported newly established hedges supported more ground beetles than older hedges; a literature review reported lower pest outbreaks with new hedges; arthropod diversity varied among seven hedge plant species; an unreplicated German study found 2/85 ground beetle species used new hedges as dispersal stepping stones and passive movers (e.g., snails) benefited most; local hawthorn provenance grew better and was more stock-proof than eight other provenances [538]. Additional hedge evidence: One RCT in China found no effect of hedges on spiders in crops; studies from France/China reported more natural enemies in hedges than adjacent crops or context-dependent effects by crop, hedge species and year; two RCTs (France, Kenya) found natural enemy abundance in hedges depended on shrub/tree species and varied among enemy groups; nematode responses to hedges in Kenya varied among groups; crops included barley, beans, maize and wheat [752]. Beetle banks: For adjacent crops, a review found predator increases, while individual studies showed time-dependent or no effects; two studies observed small/slow predator movements from banks to crops; greater beetle activity in fields did not improve predation in one study; on banks, four studies and a review found more invertebrate predators than in crops, though effects sometimes varied seasonally; compared with other refuge habitats, results ranged from more predators on banks (sometimes seasonally) to similar or lower numbers; pest reductions were greatest nearest banks or on banks in one RCT and a review, and a review found fewer pests in fields with banks; an RCT and a review indicated potential economic savings if banks prevent pests reaching spray thresholds or causing 5% yield loss; certain grass species supported higher predator numbers [729]. Beetle banks and Lepidoptera: compared to hedgerows, butterfly richness and adult abundance were lower on beetle banks, while beetle banks and agri-environment field margins had higher richness and abundance of micro-moths than conventionally managed margins; caterpillar abundance on beetle banks was similar to margins, crop fields and other edge habitats [3927]. Beetle banks and mammals: harvest mouse nest densities were higher on beetle banks than on field margins [2393]. Hedges and Lepidoptera: established hedgerows had higher butterfly and macro‑moth species richness than in‑field beetle banks, crops or pasture in three of four studies; butterfly/moth abundance was higher along hedgerows than beetle banks, grass margins without hedgerows, field interiors, or 5–10 m away from hedgerows in five of six studies; gorse, oak and blackthorn planted within hedgerows supported more arthropod species, including caterpillars, than commonly planted hawthorn; moths near hedgerows were more likely to fly parallel to them [3976].",

Across multiple trials, numbers of natural enemies sometimes increased, but responses varied among enemy groups, sites, dates, and chemicals; dose\\u2013response patterns were inconsistent across studies [754]. Pest outcomes were mixed: some studies found fewer pests (including effects limited to the egg stage), others found more pests, and several found no effect [754]. Crop damage was reduced with some chemicals but not others; one study found no effect; one study reported higher wheat yields [754]. Plant-based attractants (growing non-crop plants that emit attractive chemicals): In four studies, three found higher natural enemy numbers in plots with attractive plants, while one found no effect on parasitism and laboratory tests indicated the plant used was not attractive [724]. All four studies recorded decreased pest populations or damage in plots with attractive plants, and one replicated, randomised, controlled study reported increased crop yield [724].\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"754\",\n    \"724\"\n  ]\n}"
