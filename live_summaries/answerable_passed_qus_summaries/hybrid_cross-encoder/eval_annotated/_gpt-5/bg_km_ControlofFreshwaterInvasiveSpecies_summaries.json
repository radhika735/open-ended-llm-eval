    "relevant_summary": "Across species, success varies with the herbicide active ingredient, combinations, adjuvants, concentration, plant age, time since treatment, and integration with mechanical removal. For parrot’s feather, lab and field results show differing efficacy by chemical and over time: endothall reduced growth in lab but field cover decreased only shortly after treatment before returning toward pre-treatment levels [1681]; dichlobenil reduced growth but was less effective than a 2,4‑D+MCPA mix at 8 days and early cover reductions often rebounded by 45 days [1699]; 2,4‑D reduced growth more than diquat, glyphosate, or imazapyr in lab, 2,4‑D amine reduced biomass in field, and combinations (2,4‑D+MCPA; 2,4‑D+carfentrazone‑ethyl) achieved higher short‑term reductions or elimination, though some advantages diminished by 45 days [1606, 1699]. Some herbicides (fluridone, clopyralid, copper chelate) did not reduce growth, while others (imazamox, imazapyr, flumioxazin, florpyrauxifen‑benzyl, glufosinate‑ammonium, glyphosate) reduced growth or biomass in certain studies [1699]. For water primrose, triclopyr TEA at 0.25% killed 100% of young cultivated plants within two months; glyphosate achieved 97–100% mortality when mixed with specific sticking agents (non‑oil based or TopFilm); halosulfuron‑methyl reduced coverage without apparent rice toxicity, indicating adjuvants, concentration, plant age, and crop selectivity considerations affect outcomes [1139]. Combining herbicides with mechanical removal improved control, with glyphosate plus a surfactant (Cygnet‑Plus) followed by mechanical removal yielding a 75% kill, and integrated programs reducing coverage by 85–90% [1140]. For skunk cabbage, outcomes differed by active ingredient and dose: one UK study reported both glyphosate and 2,4‑D amine killed all plants, while another found 2,4‑D amine at 9 L/ha eradicated plants but glyphosate was unsuccessful beyond limited growth reduction [1102].",
