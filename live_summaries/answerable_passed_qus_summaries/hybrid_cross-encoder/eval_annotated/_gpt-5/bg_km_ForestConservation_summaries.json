For primates, one site comparison in Sierra Leone found higher primate densities in low-intensity logged forest than high-intensity logged forest, one before-and-after study in Madagascar found lemur numbers increased after selective logging, while another site comparison in Uganda found similar primate densities between low- and high-intensity logged forests (1485). Evidence gaps were noted: no evidence was found for the effects of clearing open patches on primate populations (1490), and no studies were found on the effects of retaining riparian buffer strips during timber harvest on butterflies and moths (3872).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"989\",\n    \"1485\",\n    \"1490\",\n    \"3872\"\n  ]\n}"

Shelterwood harvesting generally increased understory plant abundance, species richness and diversity, and improved growth/survival of young trees in most studies, though one study reported decreased plant richness and abundance and another found no effect on tree abundance; one study also reported no effect on red oak acorn production [1223]. Group-selection harvesting showed mixed outcomes: several studies found increased understory cover and diversity and higher density of young trees, while other studies reported decreased understory species richness and biomass, and some found no effect on richness, diversity, tree density or growth rate [1224]. Across a wider set of partial logging interventions (logging/removing trees within forests), about half of studies reported increased understory plant density and cover, with the remainder showing no or mixed effects; species richness/diversity increased in several studies while others found no effect [1273].",
