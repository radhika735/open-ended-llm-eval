Reviews and replicated field trials report that specific management regimes can reduce pernicious weeds; effective approaches documented include cutting, infection with fungal pathogens, and lenient grazing for creeping thistle, while a non-native beetle biocontrol was unsuitable due to poor survival; herbicide performance varied by target (e.g., high-concentration treatments killed less than half of broad‑leaved dock; grass‑specific herbicide eliminated black grass in winter treatments) and some herbicides (asulam) negatively affected non-target green dock beetles (ID: 123). In freshwater swamps dominated by invasive canarygrass, adding prescribed fire after herbicide increased overall diversity relative to herbicide alone, though species richness and native richness did not increase, and tree seedling density was unaffected (ID: 3118). In the same system, mowing before herbicide did not change overall richness or diversity compared to herbicide alone, but multi-action management (cutting/disking/herbicide) increased non-planted tree seedlings versus no management and maintained non-canarygrass herb cover (ID: 3106). Physical disturbance after herbicide (ploughing/disking) increased overall richness and diversity relative to herbicide alone, with mixed effects on tree seedlings and at least maintained non-target herb cover, while affecting abundances of some non-target species (ID: 3097). Cutting invading mangrove trees in salt marshes increased total cover of marsh vegetation when more than half of trees were removed, with greater shifts in plant community composition after two years of continual removal (ID: 3109). Herbicide use against bracken showed mixed vegetation responses across UK heathland studies: increases in heather seedlings or biomass in some trials, no increase in heather cover in others; species richness responses were inconsistent; bracken biomass/cover was often reduced, though one study found no change, and some non-target species (e.g., wavy hair‑grass, sheep’s fescue) increased (ID: 1652). Combined herbicide application and weeding to control non-native grasses reduced non-native grass cover and increased native grass and forb cover, without increasing native species richness, in a replicated field trial (ID: 1645).",

A replicated, controlled and randomized study in the UK found that using grass-specific herbicide reduced grass diversity and resulted in increases in broadleaved plants. \\nEleven studies investigated different methods of controlling plants. A review found that specific management regimes can reduce the abundance of pernicious weeds in nature conservation areas. Four replicated controlled studies (one also randomized) from Denmark and Germany found cutting and infection with fungal pathogens were effective methods for controlling creeping thistle and one replicated, randomized, controlled trial from the UK found long-term control was achieved by lenient grazing. A replicated, controlled and randomized study in Germany found weevils could be used to infect creeping thistle with systemic rust. One study found a non-native beetle was unsuitable for controlling creeping thistle because it had poor survival in the UK climate. A replicated controlled study found that spraying a high concentration of herbicide killed less than half of broad-leaved dock plants.

Preventing livestock grazing increased survival, species richness, and diversity of understory plants in two of three studies, with one reporting mixed effects; it also increased the density of oak seedlings and saplings in one site comparison [1206]. Reducing grazing intensity increased the number of tree saplings in the UK and increased understory biomass in Greece [1207]. Shortening the grazing period or controlling the season increased the abundance and size of regenerating oak trees in Spain, showed no effect on native plant species richness in Australia, and was associated with higher numbers of tree seedlings following summer compared to winter grazing in the UK [1208].\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"1205\",\n    \"1206\",\n    \"1207\",\n    \"1208\"\n  ]\n}"
