    "relevant_summary": "Evidence indicates several food-based approaches have reduced stereotypic or abnormal behaviours in large captive carnivores. Presenting food frozen in ice decreased abnormal/stereotypic behaviours and increased activity in bears and felids (1923). Hiding food around enclosures decreased stereotypical pacing in leopard cats and a black bear, and increased exploring/foraging (1915). Providing bones, hides or partial carcasses decreased stereotypic behaviours in lions and tigers (and Arctic foxes) and increased activity/manipulation time in felids (1902). Presenting food inside objects (e.g., Boomer balls) decreased stereotypic behaviours and increased exploratory/foraging in sloth and spectacled bears, though one case reported decreased exploring/foraging in a sloth bear (1924). Devices that simulate live prey had mixed effects: pacing decreased and walking increased in cougars, but pacing initially increased in tigers when a carcass was provided on a bungee (1927). Providing live vertebrate prey increased hunting and reduced sleeping in a fishing cat, but did not change stereotypical behaviours in tigers (1925). Allocating fast days was associated with more frequent pacing on non-feeding days in large felids (1906).",

A replicated before‑and‑after study in Australia found increased breeding success when a pre‑breeding cooling period was provided in combination with other husbandry changes (females allowed to gain weight, sexes separated outside breeding season, mate choice, and recorded mating calls) [1864]. Two replicated before‑and‑after studies in Germany and Austria found that simulating wet and dry seasons (and, in Austria, moving animals to an enclosure with more egg‑laying sites and flowing water) stimulated breeding and egg deposition; in Germany, no toadlets survived past 142 days [1872]. A review and replicated studies reported that reproductive success in captivity depended on temperature or a simulated wet and dry season in some cases [835]. No evidence was captured on using sound recordings of rain and/or thunderstorms to simulate rainfall [1867]. No evidence was captured for allowing temperate species to hibernate [1868], for providing dormancy during simulated drought in highly seasonal species [1869], or for varying water flow/speed for torrent‑breeding species [1870]. One replicated study in the UK found no difference in clutch size with a UV lighting boost compared to background levels, but UV‑boosted frogs had higher fungal loads [1865].",

Providing devices that simulate live prey had mixed effects on pacing in other felids: pacing decreased in cougars but initially increased in tigers when a carcass was provided on a bungee (1927). Allocating fast days was associated with more frequent pacing on non‑feeding days in large felids (1906). Feeding whole carcasses reduced pacing in lions, leopards, snow leopards and cougars; in cheetahs, feeding whole rabbit altered nutritional markers and showed lower indicators of inflammatory bowel disease compared to supplemented beef (1901).

Providing natural substrates (e.g., varied substrates) and enclosure furniture such as rotting logs and hollow bamboo pipes promoted egg laying; in one Australian study these were combined with temporary enclosure flooding, sex‑ratio manipulation, and playing recorded mating calls when breeding occurred [1874, 1876]. Allowing female mate choice was associated with breeding only after introducing egg‑bearing females, manipulating sex ratios, playing recorded calls, moving frogs to indoor enclosures permitting temporary flooding with organic substrates, and, in another Australian before‑and‑after study, increased clutch size when female choice was provided alongside recorded calls, separating sexes outside the breeding period, and allowing females to gain weight before breeding [1882]. Across captive frog programs, reproductive success depended on temperature or simulating wet and dry seasons; breeding began after adding more calling, perching, and laying sites together with simulated wet/dry seasons, and development was affected by parental care, density, and temperature [835, 1876].",
