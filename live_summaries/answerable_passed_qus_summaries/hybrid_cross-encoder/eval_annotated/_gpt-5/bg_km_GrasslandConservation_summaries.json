One study\\u00a0found that over time areas sown with native grass and forb seeds became more similar to areas that were not sown with seeds.\\nOverall richness/diversity (28 studies): Sixteen of 28 studies (24 of which were controlled and four of which were site comparisons) in Europe, North America\\u00a0and New Zealand\\u00a0found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased overall plant species richness. Seven studies found that there was no change in plant species richness\\u00a0or mixed effects on plant species richness\\u00a0and plant diversity. Three studies\\u00a0found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased plant species richness during the first year, but after 3\\u201313 years, species richness did not differ between sown and unsown areas or was lower in sown areas.

Sowing grass seeds increased the abundance of sown species in one replicated, controlled study in South Africa [3397]. Sowing seeds in spring (start of the growing season) increased cover of sown grass and forb species compared to autumn sowing in a replicated, randomized, paired, controlled UK study [3407]. Applying herbicide before sowing increased cover of sown grass species in a replicated, randomized, controlled USA study [3418]. Grazing management after sowing increased the cover of four of eight sown species under continuous sheep grazing compared to rotational grazing in New Zealand [3423]. Using locally sourced seed increased the abundance of one of four sown characteristic species in a replicated, randomized, paired, controlled German study, and increasing the number of species in the local seed mix increased cover of target plant species in Germany [3400]. Sowing seeds in part of a site led to the appearance of new patches of two of three sown species in previously unsown areas in a USA study [3408]. Sowing at higher seed density increased the cover of a sown species (thickspike wheatgrass) in Canada, though one replicated study in the USA reported no change in overall sown-species cover [3405].",
