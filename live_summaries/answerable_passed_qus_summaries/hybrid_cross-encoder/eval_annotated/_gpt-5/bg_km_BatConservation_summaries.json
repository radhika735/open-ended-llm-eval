Gate design influenced behavior: bats circled more and entered less after gating in one study; funnel designs were used more than round bar or angle iron designs; reducing bar spacing reduced passes; and significantly fewer bats emerged from a gated cave compared to a fenced cave in a paired comparison [999]. For fencing, evidence was limited but indicated no difference in population growth rates or occupancy between fenced/gated and unfenced caves in a replicated site comparison, and replacing a steel gate with a fence led to significantly more emerging southeastern myotis and gray myotis bats [1991]. Overall, studies directly comparing structures reported reduced emergence with gates relative to fences, while broader comparisons showed neutral to positive abundance responses with well-designed gates and neutral population metrics with fencing [999, 1991].",

Preventing blades from turning at low wind speeds (“feathering”), or feathering combined with higher cut-in speeds, reduced bat fatalities in five of six studies in the USA and Canada; one study with automatic feathering found no reduction [970]. Slowing blade rotation at low wind speeds reduced bat fatalities in one replicated, randomized, controlled study in Canada [2939]. Automatically reducing blade rotation when bat activity is predicted to be high reduced bat fatalities in two replicated studies (Germany and USA), for all bats combined and for five species [971]. Ultrasonic deterrents at turbines showed mixed results across three replicated, randomized, controlled studies in the USA, with reductions ranging from 21–51% in one year to variable outcomes (from 2% more to 64% fewer fatalities) in another; species-specific effects were also mixed [968].",

One study in the USA\\u00a0found that Indiana bats used rocket boxes more than wooden bat boxes or bark-mimic roosts. One study in Spain\\u00a0found that more bats occupied bat boxes that had two compartments than one compartment in the breeding season.

Managing livestock water troughs affected bat use and drinking success: removing livestock modifications increased drinking frequency and reduced the number of approaches before successful drinking; larger, full tanks with sparse surrounding vegetation had more bats drinking than smaller, half-full tanks with no or dense vegetation (1951). Creating or maintaining small dams: a replicated site comparison in Portugal found reservoirs created by small dams had greater activity of four bat species than the streams feeding them (1997). Wetland restoration: a replicated, controlled, before–after study in the USA found restoring wetlands increased overall bat activity, and restored wetlands had similar activity to undisturbed wetlands (2036).
