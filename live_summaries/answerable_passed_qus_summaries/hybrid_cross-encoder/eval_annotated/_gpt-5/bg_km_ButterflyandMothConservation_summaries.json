    "relevant_summary": "Across multiple studies, opening forest canopies by clearing, coppicing, or thinning commonly increased butterfly richness and/or abundance, while macro-moths often declined relative to closed or mature forest. Cleared patches had higher butterfly species richness than unmanaged or closed-canopy areas, but lower moth richness; larger clearings supported higher butterfly richness and abundance than undisturbed forest, and wider rides had lower macro-moth abundance than standard-width rides or mature forest; butterfly richness and abundance sometimes declined over the first three years post-clearance, and some species’ abundance peaked 2–4 years after clearance (3938). Thinning (often alongside prescribed burning, mulching, or nearby felling) increased butterfly richness and abundance within 1–4 years compared to unmanaged woodland or before management, while a thinned forest had similar fruit-feeding butterfly richness and abundance to an unmanaged regenerating forest, and partially cleared plots showed higher butterfly but lower moth richness than closed-canopy plots (3940). Coppiced woodland supported different moth and butterfly communities than mature forest; butterfly richness and abundance were higher in coppiced than unmanaged woodland and tended to be greater in more recently coppiced stands (e.g., 2–7 or 12–15 years since cutting) than in older (>15 years) stands; macro-moths had lower richness and abundance in coppiced than in mature forest and did not vary consistently with coppice age (3939).",

On road verges and pavements, restricting or stopping herbicide use in restored roadside prairies was linked to greater butterfly richness and abundance and lower mortality risk than verges dominated by non-native grasses without restrictions; on transmission lines, unsprayed and unmown sites had similar butterfly richness but higher abundance of northern/pearl crescents than sprayed and mown sites, with similar total abundance [3899]. Altering mowing on greenspaces/road verges showed that less frequent or no mowing increased butterfly/moth richness and diversity; unmown parks and road verges/under power lines had higher abundance for all adult butterflies or for pearl/northern pearl crescents, while other species showed similar abundance; late-summer roadside mowing had more ringlets than mid-summer; less frequent or later mowing reduced numbers of butterflies killed by traffic; butterflies were recorded on verges mown once or twice a year and on unmown verges, but on mown verges they were only recorded where hay was removed [3841]. Restoring or maintaining species-rich grassland along verges (e.g., sowing native wildflowers, increasing larval host plants, plant species richness, and flowering plants) increased richness and sometimes abundance of butterflies, day-flying and burnet moths compared to non-native dominated verges; wider verges had higher richness and abundance; in Canada, mown or unmown verges and power-line sites had similar richness and abundance to remnant prairies; mortality risk was lower on restored prairie verges than non-native grass verges, but more dead butterflies/moths occurred on roads with tall meadow verges and with habitat in the central reservation; less frequent or later mowing reduced roadkill; monarch parasite loads on mown verge milkweed were similar to prairies [3854]. Planting road verges with appropriate native species was associated in some studies with higher richness of butterfly/moth adults and caterpillars than verges with mixed or non-native plants, though other studies found similar adult richness, and effects on abundance were mixed [3842].",

In managed fens, mowing was associated with greater butterfly species richness than cattle grazing, whereas recent cutting (including autumn/winter cuts) reduced large copper egg numbers and caterpillar survival compared to uncut fens [3950]. In peatlands, restoration (e.g., re-wetting, raising water tables, tree removal, ditch blocking) increased species richness and abundance of mire specialist butterflies to levels comparable with pristine sites in some studies, and shifted moth communities toward an intermediate state between drained and pristine mires; however, moth abundance responses were mixed by species, large heath caterpillars had lower winter survival where water levels had risen, and Alcon large blue occupancy was lower on recently re-wetted wet heathland [3948]. For creating scrapes and pools, no studies directly evaluated effects on butterflies or moths [3951].",

Forty-one studies from eight European countries (including five reviews and twenty-three replicated controlled studies, of which one randomized and two site comparisons) found evidence that flower strips had a positive influence on invertebrate numbers with increased abundance, species richness/diversity, or both. Ten studies (nine replicated of which two controlled) found invertebrates visited or foraged on flower strips but did not specify increases/decreases in numbers. Two studies found effects on ground beetles other than changes in numbers. One replicated controlled study showed that ground beetles were more active or had enhanced feeding/reproductive conditions in flower strips. A review found flower strips supported ground beetle species that were rarely found in crops. Fifteen studies reported mixed or negative effects of flower strips on invertebrates.

Community composition sometimes remained similar to managed sites, but after abandonment the community became dominated by generalist species with fewer generations per year (3957, 3956). For diversity, after stopping mowing, five of seven studies reported similar species richness to managed grasslands, with some cases of lower richness after 6–13 years or >50 years, and one case of higher richness when meadows were left uncut all summer (3957). After stopping grazing, six of nine studies reported similar richness to grazed sites, one found greater richness than sheep-grazed grassland, two found lower richness after >5–20 years or many years, one found higher richness where grazing ceased 2–9 years ago than in >10-year abandonments or currently grazed, and three studies reported higher richness in grasslands abandoned 4, 5–10 or >10 years compared to extensively or commercially grazed, with similarity to lightly grazed in two cases (3956). For abundance, stopping mowing led to lower abundance in some studies, higher abundance in others, species-specific or habitat-shifted responses (woodland/hedgerow species increasing, grassland/farmland species decreasing), local extinctions in some cases (e.g., silver-studded blue), mixed species responses across regions, and time-since-abandonment effects (e.g., similar abundance after ~6 years but lower after >25 years with no caterpillars) (3957). After stopping grazing, six of 20 studies found higher abundance than grazed (sometimes only vs intensive grazing), four found lower, four found similar, four reported species-specific mixed responses, one found density higher 2–9 years post-cessation than in >10-year abandonments or currently grazed, local extinctions occurred for large blue and silver-studded blue in some meadows, species-specific responses included clouded Apollo being lower than lightly grazed but higher than heavily grazed, and one European review reported benefits for six of 67 species of conservation concern (3956).",

(2) Seasonally removing livestock (e.g., removing cattle in summer, not grazing silage fields in September, removing sheep in winter or during peak flowering) increased butterfly and caterpillar abundance in several replicated, controlled UK studies, while other studies found similar richness or abundance compared to continuous grazing (3960). (3) Using rotational grazing sometimes resulted in greater butterfly and burnet moth species richness and/or abundance than continuous grazing, including cases where rotational systems outperformed continuous grazing at higher stocking densities, though other studies found similar or mixed responses among species (3965). (4) Delaying cutting or first grazing dates (e.g., grazing commencing after mid‑June, cutting in July/September rather than May/June) was associated with higher abundance of butterflies, burnet moths and caterpillars in several studies, and one study reported higher abundance of clouded Apollo where grazing started after 15 June alongside lower stocking density (3967). For context, increasing grazing intensity generally reduced butterfly and moth richness or abundance relative to low or no grazing in multiple studies (3962).",

Abundance responses were mixed: higher abundance for large copper eggs and some butterfly species under cattle/pony grazing in fens and dunes, similar abundance to ungrazed in shrubsteppe, lower abundance in meadow steppe under livestock, and on saltmarsh light grazing increased total micro-moth abundance and some caterpillars compared to moderate/heavy grazing or ungrazed, though other caterpillars were lower under grazing than ungrazed; upland rough grassland had higher butterfly abundance than improved grassland (3944). Occupancy/use: brown argus and Alcon large blue were more likely to occupy grazed calcareous dunes and heathland than unmanaged or differently managed sites (3944). Prescribed fire in open habitats: Species richness of butterflies was often similar between burned and unburned shrubland plots and field margins; patch-burning in pastures yielded lower richness than rotational grazing, similar to some grazed/mown pastures, and higher than continuous grazing (3882). Abundance responses were mixed: increased abundance for heath fritillary adults, marsh fritillary caterpillar webs, and Fender’s blue caterpillars/eggs one or more years after burning compared to before or to unburned/grazed land, but decreased abundance for Brenton blue eggs/adults, rosy marsh moth caterpillars, and regal fritillary on burned sites versus unburned; some species (e.g., regal fritillary, arogos skipper) were less abundant on burned prairies than hayed/grazed, while generalists and some species (e.g., purplish copper) were more abundant on burned than hayed/grazed; one review reported occasional grassland burning benefitted 10/67 species of conservation concern (3882). Survival/occupancy: Fender’s blue caterpillar survival was lower one year post-burn than in unburned plots, while marsh fritillary occupancy of fen meadows was similar among burned, grazed, and unmanaged sites (3882). Overall, both approaches showed mixed, species- and context-dependent effects on richness, abundance, survival, and occupancy across studies (3944, 3882).",

Removing, controlling, or excluding native predators: Across five studies in the UK, USA, and Kenya, predator exclusion (e.g., mesh cages, net sleeves, sticky resin) increased survival of large copper caterpillars, Boisduval silkworm eggs and caterpillars, and Appalachian brown eggs and juveniles, while two studies found no increase in monarch caterpillar survival after excluding vertebrate or terrestrial predators (mainly ants) [3889]. Removing, controlling, or excluding vertebrate herbivores: Studies from multiple countries and a global review found that fencing to exclude or reduce densities of deer, sheep, pigs, and large herbivores sometimes increased butterfly and macro-moth species richness, with mixed effects when excluding elk, and the global review found no effect on richness in temperate and boreal forests; abundance was often higher in fenced plots, though effects were mixed with elk, overall moth abundance was similar but tree-feeding moth abundance lower in sika deer–excluded forest, and a global review found increased abundance when grazing/browsing was reduced; in the Netherlands, all Glanville fritillary caterpillar nests survived and fewer nests were damaged in sheep-excluded grassland compared to grazed areas [3891]. Removing or controlling non-native or problematic plants: Two studies (Mauritius, USA) reported higher butterfly species richness after invasive plant removal (in one case alongside fencing), while several studies found higher abundance of specific butterflies (e.g., Apollo, Fender’s blue eggs) or total butterflies after removing or cutting invasive plants; other studies reported similar abundance or use compared to untreated or uninvaded sites, one case recorded fewer Brenton blue eggs after bracken removal following burning, survival of Columbia silvery blue was similar with herbicide application, and one herbicide reduced snowberry checkerspot survival while two others had no effect; invasive plant removal increased habitat use by Fender’s blue and frosted elfin in some cases, with no change for Columbia silvery blue [3890].

One study in Australia\\u00a0reported that a population of purple copper butterfly caterpillars translocated to an area where invasive plants had been removed, along with host plant translocation and other habitat management, increased in number compared to at the time of translocation.\\n\\n\\nSurvival (2 studies): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the USA\\u00a0found that in plots where herbicide was applied to control invasive grasses, the survival of Columbia silvery blue eggs and caterpillars was similar to unsprayed plots. One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the USA\\u00a0found that one herbicide commonly used to control invasive grasses reduced the survival of snowberry checkerspot caterpillars, but two other herbicides did not affect the survival of snowberry checkerspot, Edith\\u2019s checkerspot or Baltimore checkerspot caterpillars.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (4 STUDIES)\\n\\nUse (3 studies): Two of three randomized, controlled studies (including two replicated, paired studies and one before-and-after study) in the USA\\u00a0found that sites where invasive oat-grass was cut to a similar height to native plants, or where Eastern white pine was removed, were used more by Fender\\u2019s blue\\u00a0and frosted elfin\\u00a0butterflies than untreated sites. The third study found that habitat use by Columbia silvery blue butterflies was similar in plots where herbicide was applied to control invasive grasses and in unsprayed plots.\\nBehaviour change (1 study): One before-and-after study in Poland\\u00a0found that removal of trees and shrubs, in addition to the release of captive bred adults and pupae, allowed adults from two previously separated populations of Apollo butterflies to mix.\"\n}"

(2) Population persistence often required continued interventions such as captive-rearing of wild-laid caterpillars or supplementation by further releases (3914). (3) Survival and persistence varied with source and approach: translocated large copper caterpillars had higher survival than released, captive-bred caterpillars (3909), and released captive-bred large copper caterpillars had lower survival than captive, wild or translocated caterpillars (3914). (4) Life stage and context of release varied (eggs, caterpillars, pupae, adults), with reports of populations persisting 2–28 years in some cases, while others died out within 0–12 years or required further releases (3914; 3909). (5) Captive-rearing conditions affected survival and condition, including lower density improving survival, temperature (20 °C higher survival than 25 °C), ant colony context for myrmecophilous species (higher survival without queens or with winged females present), differences among ant species and among host plant species, and the origin of ants (from sites where parasitic butterfly species occur) influencing survival (3916). (6) Overwintering method during captive rearing influenced survival (lower in refrigerators than in environmental chambers or outside) (3916). (7) Diet and symbiont availability during captive rearing affected development and adult condition, including plant species provided and access to appropriate ant colonies (3916). (8) Long-term captivity influenced traits, with captive lines showing differences in body size and wing size, and differences in fecundity relative to more recently captive lines (3916). (9) Placement of parasitic blue butterflies into specific ant nests without queens improved caterpillar survival during translocation (3909). (10) Genetic considerations were noted, with a translocated population showing similar genetic diversity to its source after 19 years (3909). (11) There is no direct evidence evaluating the introduction of mated females to increase genetic diversity for butterflies and moths (3912).",

    "relevant_summary": "Across multiple studies, established hedgerows were associated with higher species richness of butterflies and macro‑moths than in‑field beetle banks, crops or pasture, though richness was sometimes similar to grass banks between fields [3976]. Hedgerows also supported higher abundances of butterflies, moths/macro‑moths and gatekeepers than beetle banks, grass margins without hedgerows, field interiors, or locations 5–10 m from hedgerows, while one study found similar abundance to grass banks between fields [3976]. Moths recorded close to hedgerows were more likely to fly parallel to them than moths further away [3976]. Within planted hedgerows, gorse, oak and blackthorn hosted more species of arthropods, including caterpillars, than commonly planted hawthorn [3976]. Managing existing hedgerows to increase structural complexity or include trees was linked to higher species richness or diversity of butterflies and macro‑moths than simpler hedgerows without trees [3975]. Cutting regimes that allow incremental growth, cutting once every 2–3 years, or autumn cutting were associated with higher abundance of adult butterflies and moths, moth caterpillars and pupae, and more brown hairstreak eggs than annual, same‑size cutting, although in some cases caterpillar/pupa abundance was similar between regimes [3975]. Hedgerows kept 1–2 m tall had higher butterfly species richness than those kept below 1 m, while one study reported more adult butterflies in hedgerows maintained below 1 m; fields with larger‑volume hedgerows showed higher butterfly richness and abundance in one of two years [3975]. Hedgerows with trees or more complex structure had higher abundance of butterflies and pale shining brown moths, though some studies found similar total macro‑moth abundance with or without trees [3975]. Scalloped hedgerow edges supported more brown hairstreak eggs than straight edges, and field margins next to hedgerow trees had higher abundance of most shrub‑/tree‑feeding moth species than margins away from trees [3975]. Laid or coppiced hedgerows had higher butterfly abundance than unmanaged hedgerows, but one study found managed hedgerows had lower caterpillar abundance than remnant hedgerows [3975].",

Species richness frequently remained similar to managed grasslands, sometimes increased after 4–10 years of abandonment or when meadows were left uncut for a summer, but was often lower after longer periods (e.g., >10–20 years or >50 years) or compared to traditional rotational mowing and burning [3956][3957]. Abundance responses were mixed: in some cases abandonment (from weeks to 25 years) increased total butterflies, day‑flying or nocturnal moths, Scotch argus, caterpillars, and small insects, and uncut or temporarily abandoned meadows had higher abundances than annually or frequently mown sites [3956][3957]. In other cases, abandonment for 1–20 years reduced overall butterflies or some species and caterpillars relative to mowing once or twice per year, with some time‑since‑abandonment effects (e.g., higher densities 2–9 years after cessation than >10 years or currently grazed) and species‑specific mixed responses [3956][3957]. Abandonment tended to increase woodland and hedgerow butterflies and burnet moths, but decrease grassland or farmland species, and extinctions of large blue and silver‑studded blue occurred in some abandoned meadows; heath fritillary abundance was similar around six years post‑abandonment but lower with no caterpillars after >25 years [3956][3957]. Behavioural/use responses included similar occurrence of hoary bell moth caterpillars and similar frequency of marsh fritillary webs in abandoned vs managed sites, but reduced occurrence of grizzled skipper and painted lady and increased occurrence of small pearl‑bordered fritillary in abandoned meadows [3956][3957].",

Fifteen studies on grass margins reported that wider margins (up to 6 m) often supported greater species richness or diversity of butterflies, macro‑moths and micro‑moths than narrower or conventional margins, though one study found macro‑moth richness similar between wide and conventional margins (3982). Seven site comparison studies (including paired designs) found wider grass margins (up to 6 m) had higher abundance of habitat‑sensitive butterflies, macro‑moths and micro‑moths than narrower or conventional margins, while other studies found similar abundance for disturbance‑tolerant butterflies and some moth groups (3982). Replicated controlled studies showed grass margins, compared to cropped edges, often had higher butterfly abundance and sometimes higher richness; however, one UK study found 2‑m margins increased butterfly richness over cropped edges while 6‑m margins did not (3982). A UK paired comparison found margins next to water bodies with restricted agrochemical use (and restricted mowing/grazing) had greater moth abundance but similar moth species richness than conventionally managed margins (3894). UK studies on beetle banks showed micro‑moth richness and abundance were higher on beetle banks and AES‑managed margins than on conventionally managed margins, while adult butterflies were less abundant and less species‑rich on beetle banks than along hedgerows; caterpillar abundance was similar between beetle banks and field margins or crop fields (3927). Some studies reported that floristically enhanced or wildflower‑sown margins/strips had higher butterfly richness and abundance than standard grass margins or cropped/unsown edges; in other cases richness or abundance was similar or mixed among butterfly and moth groups (3932, 3982).",

One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK\\u00a0found that farms with wildflower strips (along with other enhanced agri-environment scheme options) had a higher abundance of some butterflies, but a lower abundance of other butterflies, than farms with simpler agri-environment scheme management such as grass-only margins. One of two replicated, paired, controlled studies (including one randomized study) in the USA\\u00a0and the UK\\u00a0found that plots sown with one of three wildflower mixes had a higher abundance of moths than plots sown with two other mixes or a single flower species. The other study found that plots sown with either complex or simple flower mixes had a similar abundance of butterflies. One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK\\u00a0found that wildflower plots sown with lucerne\\u00a0had a higher abundance of butterflies than plots sown with borage, chicory or sainfoin.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)\\n\\nUse (2 studies): Two studies (including one replicated study) in the UK\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0reported that sown nectar flower plots\\u00a0and tropical milkweed plots\\u00a0were used by six species of butterflies and moths\\u00a0and monarch butterflies and caterpillars.\"\n}"
