Presenting food frozen in ice decreased abnormal or stereotypic behaviors and increased activity levels in bears and felids (action 1923). Hiding food around enclosures increased exploring and foraging behaviors and decreased stereotypical pacing in leopard cats and black bear (action 1915). Presenting food inside objects such as Boomer balls increased exploratory and foraging behaviors and decreased stereotypic behaviors in sloth bears and spectacled bears (action 1924). Providing bones, hides or partial carcasses decreased the frequency of stereotypic behaviors in lions, tigers and Arctic foxes, while also increasing activity and manipulation time in felids and red foxes (action 1902). Implementing unpredictable feeding schedules reduced the frequency of stereotypic pacing behaviors in tigers and cheetahs and increased behavioral diversity in red foxes and alertness in black-footed cats (action 1904). Providing devices to simulate live prey, including sounds, lures, pulleys and bungees, increased activity levels and behavioral diversity in felids and decreased pacing behavior in cougars, though pacing initially increased in tigers (action 1927). However, allocating fast days resulted in large felids pacing more frequently on non-feeding days (action 1906). Scattering food around enclosures increased locomotion in maned wolves (action 1921).",

Scattering food throughout the enclosure increased feeding and exploratory behaviors in rhesus macaques, reduced abnormal behaviors in chimpanzees, reduced aggression in lemurs, increased foraging and activity levels in gorillas (Action 1315). In contrast, hiding food in containers (including boxes and bags) increased activity levels and foraging behaviors in lemurs and gibbons, but the evidence base is more limited with only two studies compared to three studies for scattering (Action 1316). While both methods promote foraging behaviors and increase activity levels, scattering food appears to have additional benefits in reducing problematic behaviors such as abnormal behaviors and aggression that were not reported for container-based feeding enrichment.",

Temperature manipulation shows limited evidence: one small study in Italy found that one of six females bred following a temperature drop from 20-24°C to 17°C combined with filling of an egg laying pond (action 1864). One Australian study found that providing a pre-breeding cooling period, alongside other measures including allowing females to gain weight, separating sexes during non-breeding periods, providing mate choice and playing recorded mating calls, increased breeding success (action 1864). Artificial rainfall manipulation has shown positive results in two studies in Germany and Austria, where simulating wet and dry seasons stimulated breeding and egg deposition, though in the German study no toadlets survived past 142 days old (action 1872). However, no evidence was found for the effectiveness of simulating rainfall using sound recordings of rain and thunderstorms (action 1867). Similarly, no evidence was captured for varying enclosure humidity using humidifiers, foggers, misters or artificial rain (action 1863). General captive breeding research shows that reproductive success depends on temperature or simulated wet and dry seasons according to multiple studies, with 30-88% of eggs hatching and survival rates to metamorphosis of 75%, to froglets of 17-51%, or to adults of 50-90% (action 835). UV lighting manipulation showed no difference in clutch size between frogs given ultraviolet boost compared to background levels, though UV-boosted frogs had significantly greater fungal loads (action 1865). No evidence was found for several other environmental manipulation techniques including hibernation periods, dormancy during simulated drought, or varying water flow speeds (actions 1868, 1869, 1870).",

Hiding food around enclosures has been shown to increase exploring and foraging behaviors in black bears, leopard cats, bush dogs, maned wolves, and Malayan sun bears (Action 1915). Additionally, hiding food decreased stereotypical pacing in leopard cats and black bears, and reduced the time Canadian lynx spent sleeping during the day (Action 1915). In contrast, scattering food around enclosures increased locomotion in maned wolves, and maned wolves spent more time in sections of their enclosure with scattered food compared to sections with food presented on a tray (Action 1921). The evidence base for hiding food appears more extensive, with studies documenting effects across multiple species and behaviors, while the evidence for scattering food is limited to studies with maned wolves.",

For larval development, formulating diets with higher protein content is effective, with one study finding that tadpoles reared on a diet containing 46% protein had higher growth rates, survival and body weights at metamorphosis compared to diets containing less protein (Action 1889). Diet composition also affects larval development, as tadpoles had higher body mass and reached more advanced developmental stages when fed control diets of rabbit chow and fish food or freshwater algae, compared to those fed only pine or oak pollen, which prevented metamorphosis entirely (Action 1889). For breeding adults, supplementing diets with carotenoids can affect reproductive outcomes, with one study finding that adding carotenoids to fruit flies fed to frogs reduced the number of clutches but increased the number of tadpoles and successful metamorphs (Action 1887). However, no evidence was found for the effectiveness of supplementing diets with vitamins or calcium through prey dusting (Action 1886) or gut loading prey (Action 1885), or for formulating adult diets to reflect the nutritional composition of wild foods (Action 1884).",

Feeding whole chickens to ocelots resulted in lower digestible energy and fat compared to commercial diet, and African wildcats had lower organic matter digestibility compared to ground-chicken diet (Action 1901). In contrast, providing live vertebrate prey showed different behavioral effects: hunting behaviour increased and sleeping decreased when a fishing cat was provided with live fish, but there was no change in stereotypical behaviours in tigers when provided with live fish (Action 1925).

Related evidence shows that one replicated, before-and-after study in the Netherlands and Germany found that when presented with stinging nettles captive gorillas used the same processing skills as wild gorillas to forage (Action 1332), and studies of puzzle feeders found they increased foraging behavior and time spent feeding while decreasing inactive time (Action 1318).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"1330\",\n    \"1331\",\n    \"1332\",\n    \"1318\"\n  ]\n}"

For maned wolves specifically, a plant-derived protein diet increased digestible energy and dry matter digestibility but decreased mineral retention and plasma taurine levels compared to a supplemented animal-based protein diet (Action 1903). Supplementing animal-protein diets with taurine increased plasma taurine levels in maned wolves (Action 1908). For cheetahs, feeding whole rabbit carcasses resulted in lower blood protein urea, zinc and vitamin A levels compared to supplemented beef, and showed lower levels of inflammatory bowel indicators (Action 1901). Cheetahs fed a commercial diet had similar likelihood of developing gastritis as those fed horse meat, with lower levels of blood protein urea but higher levels of creatine, and plasma concentrations of a-tocopherol, retinol and taurine within recommended ranges for domestic cats when fed commercial meat diet or whole chicken carcasses (Action 1900). Additional alternatives include supplementing meat-based diets with prebiotic plant material such as Jerusalem artichoke, which increased gut microbiota types, faecal scores and faecal moisture content in leopards (Action 1905).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from captive breeding programs, several effective interventions can stimulate successful breeding in Australian frogs. Hormone treatment is widely used, with one review and nine of 10 replicated studies finding that hormone treatment of male amphibians stimulated or increased sperm production or resulted in successful breeding in captivity (Action 883). For females, hormone treatment showed mixed results with 30-71% of females producing viable eggs following treatment (Action 883). Environmental manipulations prove highly effective, with studies showing that simulating seasonal changes through artificial rainfall stimulates breeding and egg deposition (Action 1872). Playing recordings of breeding calls is particularly effective, with Australian studies finding that frogs only bred when recorded mating calls were played alongside other interventions (Action 1881). Another Australian study found that clutch size increased when recorded mating calls were played along with other breeding stimulation techniques (Action 1881). Manipulating sex ratios within enclosures is also effective, with one Australian study finding that frogs only bred once sex ratios were manipulated along with other interventions (Action 1879). Allowing female mate choice enhances breeding success, with an Australian study showing frogs only bred after females carrying eggs were introduced to males (Action 1882), and clutch size increased when female mate choice was provided (Action 1882). Nutrition plays a role, with one Australian study finding that clutch size increased when females increased in weight before breeding (Action 1888). Providing appropriate substrates and enclosure furniture is important, with studies showing that adding various organic substrates, rotting logs and hollow bamboo pipes promoted egg laying (Action 1874). Housing animals in enclosures with more calling, perching and laying sites also stimulated breeding (Action 1876). The most successful approaches typically combine multiple interventions simultaneously.",

In comparison, simply changing the location of food around enclosures showed more limited documented effects, with one study finding it decreased pacing behaviors in cheetahs (Action 1918). The research suggests that hiding and scattering food provide more comprehensive behavioral enrichment benefits than location changes alone.\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"1915\",\n    \"1921\",\n    \"1918\"\n  ]\n}"

Hiding food around enclosures has been shown to decrease stereotypical pacing in leopard cats and black bears, while also increasing exploring and foraging behaviors in multiple carnivore species (Action 1915). Providing devices to simulate live prey, including sounds, lures, pulleys and bungees, has demonstrated effectiveness specifically in felids - studies found that activity levels and behavioral diversity increased in felids when presented with lure or pulley systems, and pacing behavior decreased while walking increased in cougars when provided with a carcass on a bungee, though pacing initially increased in tigers (Action 1927). Implementing a random temporal feeding schedule has proven particularly effective for reducing stereotypic behaviors, with studies showing that unpredictable feeding schedules reduced the frequency of stereotypic pacing behaviors in tigers and cheetahs, while also increasing behavioral diversity in red foxes and alertness in black-footed cats (Action 1904). Scattering food around enclosures has been found to increase locomotion in maned wolves and influence their spatial use of enclosures (Action 1921). Additionally, providing live invertebrate prey, including in feeding devices, increased explorative behaviors in fennec foxes compared to other types of enrichment (Action 1926).",

Temperature variation is one documented approach - one study in Italy found that one of six females bred following a drop in temperature from 20-24 to 17°C, and filling of an egg laying pond (Action 1864). Additionally, a study in Australia found that providing a pre-breeding cooling period, alongside other measures, increased breeding success (Action 1864). Artificial rainfall simulation has shown positive results - two studies in Germany and Austria found that simulating a wet and dry season stimulated breeding and egg deposition, though in the German study no toadlets survived past 142 days old (Action 1872). Environmental modifications can also support breeding - studies in Austria found that captive frogs started breeding when housed in enclosures with more calling, perching and laying sites combined with simulated wet and dry seasons (Action 1876). Other identified actions include varying enclosure humidity using humidifiers, foggers/misters or artificial rain (Action 1863), varying lighting duration (Action 1866), varying lighting quality/quantity including UV gradients (Action 1865), allowing dormancy periods during simulated drought (Action 1869), simulating rainfall using sound recordings (Action 1867), allowing temperate amphibians to hibernate (Action 1868), varying water flow for torrent breeding species (Action 1870), and varying food provision seasonally (Action 1883), though these latter actions currently have no evidence captured for their effectiveness.",

Replacing milk with fruit juice in gorilla diets led to a decrease in regurgitation and reingestion (action 1329). When lemurs were fed a fruit-free diet, aggression and self-directed behavior were lower compared to previous feeding regimens (action 1329). Providing fresh produce instead of pellet feed resulted in rhesus macaques spending more time feeding and less time inactive (action 1335). When macaques were presented with whole foods instead of chopped foods, both the amount consumed and time spent feeding increased (action 1323). Additionally, when presented with stinging nettles, captive gorillas used the same processing skills as wild gorillas to forage, suggesting that natural food items can maintain natural behavioral patterns (action 1332). Increasing the number of feeds per day led to increased feeding time in chimpanzees, though it also resulted in increased hair eating in baboons (action 1337).",

Another replicated study in Brazil demonstrated that maned wolves spent more time in sections of their enclosure with scattered food compared to sections with food presented on a tray (Action 1921). Studies also showed that hiding food around enclosures increased exploring and foraging behaviours in maned wolves along with other carnivore species (Action 1915). Regarding dietary composition, two studies in the USA found that a plant-derived protein diet increased digestible energy and dry matter digestibility but decreased mineral retention and plasma taurine levels in maned wolves compared to a supplemented animal-based protein diet (Action 1903). Additionally, studies on carnivores in general have demonstrated that providing food on a random temporal schedule reduced stereotypic pacing behaviours and increased behavioural diversity and alertness (Action 1904), while presenting food frozen in ice decreased abnormal or stereotypic behaviours and increased activity levels (Action 1923).",
