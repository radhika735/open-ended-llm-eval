Additionally, one study found more young salmon returning to rivers in the five years after long-term closure of a commercial coastal fishery (Action 2655). In contrast, temporary fishery closures showed limited or no positive effects on fish abundance. One before-and-after, site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean found no increase in the biomass of the spawning stock of cod following a temporary fishery closure compared to fished areas over nine years (Action 2664). Similarly, the same study found no change in cod catches following temporary fishery closure compared to fished areas (Action 2664).

Five of six reviews across the world found that non-fished marine reserves with one to 27 years of protection had higher abundances of all fish and all fish and invertebrates combined compared to fished areas (Action ID: 2682). Two systematic reviews found that marine protected areas prohibiting all fishing had greater overall invertebrate abundance and biomass compared to fished areas (Action ID: 2224).\n\nFor fish diversity and species richness, 14 of 20 site comparison studies found that marine protected areas that had prohibited all fishing for between one to more than 25 years had higher fish species richness compared to fished areas (Action ID: 2682). However, six studies found similar fish species richness between one and 20 years after all fishing was banned in protected areas compared to fished areas, and one systematic review found no difference in species richness between unfished protected areas and fished areas (Action ID: 2682). One study found higher number of fish species in the no-fishing/no access zone of a multi-zoned marine protected area compared to partially fished zones and unprotected fished areas 10 to 15 years after implementation (Action ID: 2674).\n\nThe research also shows that fish in protected areas are larger than those in fished areas. Two global review studies and two systematic reviews found that prohibiting all fishing in marine protected areas for one to 27 years resulted in larger fish overall compared to fished areas (Action ID: 2682).

One study in the Atlantic Ocean found no increase in cod spawning stock biomass, no change in cod survival, and no change in cod length composition over nine years compared to fished areas. However, tagged adult cod spent nearly a third of their time inside seasonally closed spawning areas, providing increased protection from bottom-dwelling fish gear during spawning periods. Studies showed mixed results on commercial catch, with some fish groups showing increased catch rates during temporary closures while others showed no change.\n\n**Long-Term Fishery Closures (Action 2655):**\nFive studies examining long-term closures showed more consistent positive effects. Studies found higher abundance of young salmon returning to rivers five years after closure, though effects varied by species. Fish in long-term closed areas showed reduced flight response distances, making them more vulnerable to capture. Long-term closures resulted in reduced overall fishing effort and varied annual catch rates. However, effects were still mixed, with some studies finding lower abundance of certain species like monkfish in closed areas.\n\n**Complete Fishing Prohibitions (Actions 2667, 2681, 2682):**\nThe most comprehensive evidence comes from 79 studies on complete fishing prohibitions in marine protected areas. These studies found that areas prohibiting all fishing for one to 27 years showed higher fish abundances, larger fish sizes, higher species richness, and different community composition compared to fished areas. However, effects varied between species, with some showing similar abundances between protected and fished areas. The duration of protection influenced effectiveness, with longer protection periods generally showing stronger positive effects.\n\n**Comparative Effectiveness:**\nThe evidence suggests that complete, long-term fishing prohibitions are more effective than temporary closures. While temporary closures provide some protection during critical periods like spawning, they show limited population-level benefits. Long-term closures and complete fishing prohibitions demonstrate more substantial and consistent positive effects on fish abundance, size, and community structure, though the magnitude of effects varies among species and depends on factors such as enforcement, habitat type, and the level of fishing pressure in adjacent areas.",

Action 2682 found that ceasing or prohibiting all types of fishing in marine protected areas resulted in higher fish abundances, larger fish sizes, different community composition, and higher species richness/diversity across multiple studies. These areas provided protection for commercially important reef fish species and shark species for large proportions of time, effectively protecting them from fishing pressure.\n\nTemporary and seasonal fishery closures provide targeted protection during critical spawning periods. Action 2938 found that spawning and nursery areas closed seasonally or permanently to fishing were used by tagged adult Atlantic cod for nearly a third of time during spawning, and by young school sharks for up to 80% of time. Action 2664 showed that tagged adult cod spent nearly a third of time inside seasonally closed cod spawning areas during implementation, providing increased protection from bottom-dwelling fish gears during spawning periods.\n\nLong-term fishery closures demonstrate varied effectiveness. Action 2655 found that areas closed to groundfish fisheries for six to eight years showed higher abundance of some fish species, and areas closed to customary fishing for eight years resulted in fish having lower flight response distances, making them less wary of capture.\n\nPeriodic fishing restrictions offer a balanced approach. Action 2679 found that protected areas fished only for short periods over 18 months to six years had greater fish biomass than openly fished areas and similar biomass to areas permanently closed to fishing for six years.\n\nHabitat protection measures supplement fishing restrictions. Action 2228 found that marine protected areas prohibiting dredging for approximately 2.5 years had different invertebrate and fish community composition and greater cover of habitat-forming species compared to unprotected dredged sites. Action 2654 showed that areas where fishing gears targeting bottom-dwelling species had been prohibited for 15 years had higher numbers of larger and older cod than openly fished areas.",

      "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence from action documents, both Mediterranean Sea and Indian Ocean marine protected areas show positive effects on fish communities when all fishing is prohibited, though specific regional comparisons are limited. In the Mediterranean Sea, studies examining areas that prohibited all fishing for 3-16 years found different fish community composition compared to fished areas (Action 2682). Mediterranean no-take areas showed higher fish species richness and diversity in some cases, with 14 of 20 studies across multiple ocean regions including the Mediterranean finding higher fish species richness in protected areas compared to fished areas after 1-25+ years of protection (Action 2682). Fish abundance studies showed that Mediterranean protected areas had higher abundances of targeted and non-targeted fish species, with effects varying between individual species groups based on their commercial status and position in the food chain (Action 2682). Fish sizes were also larger in Mediterranean no-take areas, with 8 of 11 studies across multiple regions including the Mediterranean finding larger fish in protected areas after 1-22 years compared to fished areas (Action 2682). One Mediterranean study found greater reproductive success, with more eggs of four commercially targeted fish species in a 3-year-old reserve compared to fished areas (Action 2682). In the Indian Ocean, 15 studies examined the effects of prohibiting all fishing, with similar positive patterns observed (Action 2682). Indian Ocean protected areas showed different fish community composition compared to fished areas after 3-16 years of protection (Action 2682). Fish species richness and diversity were higher in Indian Ocean no-take areas in the majority of studies, following the same pattern as Mediterranean areas (Action 2682). Fish abundance was higher in Indian Ocean protected areas, with 30 of 54 studies across all regions including the Indian Ocean finding higher fish abundances in no-take areas after up to 25+ years of protection (Action 2682). Fish grazing rates were higher in Indian Ocean protected areas compared to fished areas (Action 2682). The documents indicate that while both regions show positive responses to no-take protection, the specific magnitude and timing of effects may vary based on local conditions, enforcement, and the particular fish species present.",
