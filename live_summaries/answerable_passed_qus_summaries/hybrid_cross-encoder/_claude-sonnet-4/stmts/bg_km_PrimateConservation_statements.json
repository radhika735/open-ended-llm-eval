For benefits, one study found that 'problem' rhesus monkeys that were translocated survived and remained at release sites for at least four years (Action 1422). Additionally, crop-raiding olive baboons translocated from farmland had similar survival rates to non-translocated populations after 16 years (Action 1422). For primates relocated from development sites, studies found that majorities survived for 5-30 months following translocation to natural habitat (Action 1558), and rhesus monkeys remained at their release sites (Action 1558). However, there are significant drawbacks. No direct evidence exists for the effects of relocating primates to non-residential areas on primate populations (Action 1423). Studies of mammal translocation more broadly show concerning patterns: translocated grizzly bears had lower survival rates than non-translocated bears (Action 2336), fewer than half of translocated black bears survived after one year (Action 2336), and translocated crop-raiding African elephants had lower survival rates than non-translocated elephants (Action 2485). Additionally, many translocated mammals return to their original locations or continue causing problems - at least some brown/grizzly and black bears returned to their capture locations and/or continued causing nuisance after translocation (Actions 2336, 2341), and leopards translocated away from human areas attacked more humans and livestock than before translocation (Action 2336).",
