Hiding food around enclosures increased exploring and foraging behaviors and decreased stereotypical pacing in leopard cats and black bear (action 1915). Presenting food inside objects such as Boomer balls increased exploratory and foraging behaviors and decreased stereotypic behaviors in sloth bears and spectacled bears (action 1924). Providing bones, hides or partial carcasses decreased the frequency of stereotypic behaviors in lions, tigers and Arctic foxes, while also increasing activity and manipulation time in felids and red foxes (action 1902). Implementing unpredictable feeding schedules reduced the frequency of stereotypic pacing behaviors in tigers and cheetahs and increased behavioral diversity in red foxes and alertness in black-footed cats (action 1904). Providing devices to simulate live prey, including sounds, lures, pulleys and bungees, increased activity levels and behavioral diversity in felids and decreased pacing behavior in cougars, though pacing initially increased in tigers (action 1927). However, allocating fast days resulted in large felids pacing more frequently on non-feeding days (action 1906). Scattering food around enclosures increased locomotion in maned wolves (action 1921).",

Temperature manipulation shows limited evidence: one small study in Italy found that one of six females bred following a temperature drop from 20-24°C to 17°C combined with filling of an egg laying pond (action 1864). One Australian study found that providing a pre-breeding cooling period, alongside other measures including allowing females to gain weight, separating sexes during non-breeding periods, providing mate choice and playing recorded mating calls, increased breeding success (action 1864). Artificial rainfall manipulation has shown positive results in two studies in Germany and Austria, where simulating wet and dry seasons stimulated breeding and egg deposition, though in the German study no toadlets survived past 142 days old (action 1872). However, no evidence was found for the effectiveness of simulating rainfall using sound recordings of rain and thunderstorms (action 1867). Similarly, no evidence was captured for varying enclosure humidity using humidifiers, foggers, misters or artificial rain (action 1863). General captive breeding research shows that reproductive success depends on temperature or simulated wet and dry seasons according to multiple studies, with 30-88% of eggs hatching and survival rates to metamorphosis of 75%, to froglets of 17-51%, or to adults of 50-90% (action 835). UV lighting manipulation showed no difference in clutch size between frogs given ultraviolet boost compared to background levels, though UV-boosted frogs had significantly greater fungal loads (action 1865).

Hormone treatment is widely used, with one review and nine of 10 replicated studies finding that hormone treatment of male amphibians stimulated or increased sperm production or resulted in successful breeding in captivity (Action 883). For females, hormone treatment showed mixed results with 30-71% of females producing viable eggs following treatment (Action 883). Environmental manipulations prove highly effective, with studies showing that simulating seasonal changes through artificial rainfall stimulates breeding and egg deposition (Action 1872). Playing recordings of breeding calls is particularly effective, with Australian studies finding that frogs only bred when recorded mating calls were played alongside other interventions (Action 1881). Another Australian study found that clutch size increased when recorded mating calls were played along with other breeding stimulation techniques (Action 1881). Manipulating sex ratios within enclosures is also effective, with one Australian study finding that frogs only bred once sex ratios were manipulated along with other interventions (Action 1879). Allowing female mate choice enhances breeding success, with an Australian study showing frogs only bred after females carrying eggs were introduced to males (Action 1882), and clutch size increased when female mate choice was provided (Action 1882). Nutrition plays a role, with one Australian study finding that clutch size increased when females increased in weight before breeding (Action 1888). Providing appropriate substrates and enclosure furniture is important, with studies showing that adding various organic substrates, rotting logs and hollow bamboo pipes promoted egg laying (Action 1874). Housing animals in enclosures with more calling, perching and laying sites also stimulated breeding (Action 1876). The most successful approaches typically combine multiple interventions simultaneously.",

Behavioral benefits include reduced pacing levels in lions, leopards, snow leopards and cougars, though this feeding method increased pacing in tigers (Action 1901). From a nutritional perspective, cheetahs fed whole rabbit had lower blood protein urea, zinc and vitamin A levels compared to supplemented beef, and showed lower levels of inflammatory bowel indicators (Action 1901). However, there are digestibility trade-offs, as ocelots fed whole 1 to 3 day old chickens had lower digestible energy and fat compared to a commercial diet, and African wildcats had lower organic matter digestibility compared to a ground-chicken diet (Action 1901). For comparison, commercial diets showed different trade-offs: African wildcats fed commercial diet had decreased crude protein digestibility and increased food intake and faecal output compared to raw meat, while cheetahs fed commercial diets had similar gastritis likelihood as those fed horse meat but different blood protein markers (Action 1900).",

One replicated study in Brazil found that scattered feeding increased locomotion in maned wolves (Action 1921). Another replicated study in Brazil demonstrated that maned wolves spent more time in sections of their enclosure with scattered food compared to sections with food presented on a tray (Action 1921). Studies also showed that hiding food around enclosures increased exploring and foraging behaviours in maned wolves along with other carnivore species (Action 1915). Regarding dietary composition, two studies in the USA found that a plant-derived protein diet increased digestible energy and dry matter digestibility but decreased mineral retention and plasma taurine levels in maned wolves compared to a supplemented animal-based protein diet (Action 1903). Additionally, studies on carnivores in general have demonstrated that providing food on a random temporal schedule reduced stereotypic pacing behaviours and increased behavioural diversity and alertness (Action 1904), while presenting food frozen in ice decreased abnormal or stereotypic behaviours and increased activity levels (Action 1923).",
