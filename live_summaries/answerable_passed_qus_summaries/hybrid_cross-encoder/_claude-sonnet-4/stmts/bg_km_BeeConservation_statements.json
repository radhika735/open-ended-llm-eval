Sowing uncropped arable field margins with agricultural nectar and pollen seed mix has been documented to support foraging bumblebees in five replicated trials in Europe, with four trials showing that field margins sown with perennial leguminous flowering plants attract significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated, grassy or cropped field margins (Action 18). Agricultural forage plant mixes including legumes attract greater numbers of bumblebees than perennial wildflower mixes, at least in the first year, though margins sown with agricultural legume plants degrade in their value to bumblebees and would need re-sowing every few years according to three UK trials (Action 18). \n\nSowing uncropped field margins with native wild flower seed mix is also effective, with five replicated UK trials showing that such margins support higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees than cropped field edges, grassy margins or naturally regenerated uncropped margins, with perennial leguminous herbs in seed mixtures being particularly important forage sources for bumblebees, especially long-tongued species (Action 19). Leaving arable field margins uncropped with natural regeneration has shown benefits in four replicated UK trials, with more bumblebees and bee species foraging on uncropped field margins than on cropped margins, though the value is not consistent from year to year and is often based on thistle species considered pernicious weeds (Action 20).\n\nFor nesting habitat, increasing areas of rough grassland provides important nesting sites, with one replicated controlled trial in Scotland showing that grassy field margins attracted nest-searching queen bumblebees at higher densities than cropped field margins (Action 12). Providing grass strips at field margins shows mixed results, with some trials showing enhanced abundance and diversity of bumblebees while others showed no effect (Action 14).

Success rates vary significantly by species, with some North American declining species showing particular challenges - while queens of half-black bumblebee B. vagans and yellow-banded bumblebees B. terricola successfully reared adults in captivity, yellow bumblebee B. fervidus consistently failed as queens laid eggs but larvae died before becoming adults, and similar patterns occurred with rusty-patched bumblebee and American bumblebee B. pensylvanicus (Action 50). One trial documented that over four years of artificial rearing, Bombus terrestris queens gradually decreased in weight (Action 50). Diet composition significantly influences reproductive success, with buff-tailed bumblebee B. terrestris colonies fed freshly frozen pollen producing larger queens with better survival and larger colonies compared to those fed dried, frozen pollen, and workers producing more offspring when fed higher protein content pollen (Action 50). Artificial light regimes of eight hours light and 16 hours darkness can reduce egg-laying time in artificially reared queen B. terrestris relative to constant darkness (Action 50). Hibernation protocols show that queens hibernated at 4-5°C for 45 days had enhanced egg-laying and colony formation rates but produced smaller colonies than non-hibernated queens, and queens should weigh more than 0.6g and be hibernated for four months or less for good survival (Action 50). For reintroduction, seven replicated trials monitored laboratory-reared colonies introduced to the environment, with variable success - in two UK trials numbers of queens per colony were very low or zero, while two other trials produced good numbers of new queens (Action 52). Social parasitism by cuckoo bees presents a significant challenge, with rates varying from 0% in five trials to 25-66% and 79% in others, though parasitism was reduced by placing colonies in landscapes with intermediate nectar and pollen availability and releasing later in the season (Action 52). Supplementary feeding effects are inconsistent, with one Canadian trial showing improved reproductive success but no reduction in parasite load, while a USA trial found no increase in colony productivity (Action 52). Translocation trials from the 1950s-1960s showed evidence of queen death and lower colony productivity, with only early bumblebee Bombus pratorum colonies adapting well to being moved (Action 53).",

Action 47 documented mortality rates ranging from 2-56% overall in managed solitary bee populations due to parasitism and other factors, with rates varying significantly by location and species.\n\n**Parasitism in Released Colonies:**\nAction 52 found variable rates of social parasitism by cuckoo bees in laboratory-reared bumblebee colonies released to the wild, ranging from 0% in some trials to 79% in others. Parasitism rates were reduced by placing colonies in landscapes with intermediate rather than very high nectar and pollen availability, and releasing them late rather than early in the season.\n\n**Management Practices:**\nAction 54 showed that local solitary bee populations can increase up to six-fold in one year under management when good conditions and plentiful floral resources are provided. However, Action 54 also found high larval mortality when rearing bees on artificial diets, including honey bee-collected pollen.",

Three replicated trials demonstrated that agricultural forage plant mixes including legumes attracted greater numbers of bumblebees than perennial wildflower mixes, at least in the first year (Action 18). However, three UK trials found that margins sown with agricultural legume plants degraded in value to bumblebees and would need re-sowing every few years (Action 18). Fourteen trials in Europe and North America recorded substantial numbers of wild bees foraging on perennial or annual sown flowering plants in agricultural environments (Action 17). Ten trials monitoring bees foraging on patches with high proportions of phacelia found substantial numbers of foraging wild bees, particularly bumblebees, with species counts ranging from eight to 35 (Action 17). Five replicated UK trials showed that uncropped field margins sown with wild flowers supported higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees than cropped field edges, grassy margins, or naturally regenerated margins (Action 19). Two trials demonstrated that perennial leguminous herbs in seed mixtures were important forage sources for bumblebees, particularly long-tongued species (Action 19).

Distance from foraging resources is critical - nest boxes must be placed within 150-600 m of forage resources based on replicated experiments estimating the foraging range of four medium to large European solitary bee species (Action 47). Nest box design and materials significantly affect productivity - reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees per nest than other types, while nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, plastic or paper tubes were much less productive due to parasitism or mould (Action 47). Occupancy rates varied from 1-26% of available cavities in studies (Action 80). Twenty-three replicated trials showed cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees, while eleven trials demonstrated occupation of drilled wooden blocks (Action 47). Parasitism and predation significantly impact productivity - mortality rates range from 13% for cavity-nesting bees and wasps in Germany to 56% overall mortality for subtropical carpenter bees in India (Action 47). Temperature regimes are important for survival in rearing conditions (Action 54). Ant exclusion can increase offspring production, as demonstrated in one controlled trial with Australian bee Exonurea nigrescens (Action 46). Multiple years of nest box provision can increase occupancy - the number of occupied solitary bee nests almost doubled over three years in Germany (Actions 47, 80).

Mortality rates range from 13% for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany to 56% mortality overall for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India (Action 47). Competition from introduced species is another problem, as two replicated trials in California showed that introduced European earwigs and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes, with these introduced species more commonly occupying the boxes than native bees in one trial (Action 47). Nest box design significantly affects success, with plastic-lined holes or plastic/paper tubes being much less productive due to parasitism or mould compared to other materials (Action 47). Very low uptake rates are documented for bumblebee nest boxes, with three trials since 1989 in the UK showing 0-2.5% uptake rates for various designs not including underground boxes (Action 48). For certain bee species, complete failure to use nest boxes occurs, as one trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes, and a small trial with soil-filled nest boxes for mining bee Andrena flavipes in the UK found they were not occupied (Action 47).",

Diet composition significantly influences reproductive success in captive-reared bumblebees, with three replicated trials demonstrating that pollen diet affects reproductive outcomes (Action 50). Buff-tailed bumblebee colonies fed on freshly frozen pollen produced larger queens that survived better and produced larger colonies themselves compared to colonies fed on dried, frozen pollen, and workers can produce more offspring when fed pollen with higher protein content (Action 50). Social parasitism by cuckoo bees represents a major challenge, with variable rates of parasitism observed in reintroduced colonies ranging from zero to 79% across different trials (Action 52). Parasitism rates were reduced by placing colonies in landscapes with intermediate rather than very high nectar and pollen availability and releasing them late rather than early in the season (Action 52). Supplementary feeding showed mixed results, with one Canadian trial finding it improved reproductive success of captive-reared colonies but did not reduce parasite load, while a USA trial found no increase in colony productivity (Action 52). Artificial hibernation regimes affect colony establishment, with hibernation at 4-5°C for 45 days enhancing egg-laying and colony formation rates, though hibernated queens produced smaller colonies than non-hibernated queens (Action 50). Queens should weigh more than 0.6 g and be hibernated for four months or less for good survival chances (Action 50). Light regimes also influence development, with eight hours light and 16 hours darkness reducing the time for artificially reared queens to lay eggs compared to constant darkness (Action 50). Additionally, translocation can negatively impact colonies, with evidence showing queen death and lower colony productivity following movement (Action 53).",
