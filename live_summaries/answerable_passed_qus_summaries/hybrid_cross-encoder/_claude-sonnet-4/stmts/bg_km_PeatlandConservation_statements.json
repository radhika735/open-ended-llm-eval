      "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, cutting trees combined with rewetting peat appears more effective than cutting trees alone for peatland restoration. Action 1732 shows that cutting/removing forest plantations and rewetting peat increased the abundance of wetland-characteristic plants (2 studies), increased Sphagnum moss cover (2 paired studies in Sweden and Finland), increased cover of herbs including cottongrasses and sedges (7 studies), and increased plant species richness (2 controlled studies in rich fens in Sweden). In contrast, Action 1731 shows that cutting/removing forest plantations alone increased cover of some herb species including cottongrasses and sedges (3 studies), but had mixed effects on Sphagnum moss cover - one study reported Sphagnum cover decreased over three years following tree removal in a drained rich fen, though another study found Sphagnum cover increased in partly rewetted fens. Notably, Action 1731 indicates that tree removal had a much smaller effect on plant species richness in drained plots compared to rewetted plots. Action 1756 demonstrates that rewetting alone (without tree removal) typically reduced or had no effect on tree and shrub cover (10 studies), increased Sphagnum moss cover (12 studies), and increased cover of various herb groups including sedges, cottongrasses, and reeds/rushes. The combination approach (Action 1732) changed overall plant community composition to become less like sites that remained drained and forested, while tree removal alone (Action 1731) showed more limited effects on overall plant community composition.",

For moss cover, 12 studies reported that rewetting increased Sphagnum moss cover or abundance in bogs, fens or other peatlands, though three studies reported mixed responses by species (Action 1756). Rewetting typically increases herb cover, with 21 studies reporting increased cover of at least one group of herbs - specifically increasing sedge cover in 13 of 15 studies, cottongrass cover in 8 of 9 studies, and reed/rush cover in 5 of 7 studies (Action 1756).

This intervention can also increase total plant species richness, particularly in rich fens (Action 1731).\n\n**Combined Tree Removal and Rewetting**: The most comprehensive approach involves cutting/removing trees combined with rewetting peat, which has been evaluated in eleven studies across bogs and fens (Action 1732). This intervention increases abundance of wetland-characteristic plants, can increase Sphagnum moss cover, and increases cover of herbs including cottongrasses and sedges (Action 1732). Two replicated studies reported this intervention increased plant species richness in rich fens (Action 1732).\n\n**Rewetting Alone**: Rewetting peatland by raising the water table has been evaluated in thirty-six studies and typically replaces drier grassland communities with more wetland- or peatland-characteristic communities (Action 1756). Twelve studies reported that rewetting increased Sphagnum moss cover or abundance, and twenty-one studies reported increased cover of characteristic herbs including sedges, cottongrasses, and reeds/rushes (Action 1756).\n\n**Active Vegetation Establishment**: Direct planting of peatland trees/shrubs shows successful survival in most cases, with eight studies reporting majority survival over periods between 10 weeks and 13 years (Action 1820). Directly planting peatland mosses shows good survival and growth, with planted mosses establishing and spreading beyond introduction sites (Action 1818).

Mowing increased cover of fen- or wet meadow-characteristic plants in four studies in Switzerland, Germany, Czech Republic and Poland. Action 1759 also documented that mowing increased total moss or bryophyte cover in four studies in Belgium, Switzerland and Czech Republic. Mowing reduced cover or abundance of at least one group of herbs including bindweed, reeds, sedges, purple moor grass and grass-like plants in six studies. Action 3950 found that fens managed by mowing had greater species richness of butterflies than fens managed by cattle grazing in Switzerland.\n\n**Benefits of Grazing:**\nAction 3971 found that wet meadows managed by light grazing with cattle or horses had similar species richness and abundance of butterflies to those managed by mowing once per year in autumn in Germany. Action 696 documented that maintaining traditional water meadows resulted in increased population size or number of territories of northern lapwing, common redshank and black-tailed godwit and increased plant species richness. Action 1762 reported that grazing increased cover of some herb groups including cottongrasses, sedges or all grass-like plants in two studies in UK fens.\n\n**Trade-offs and Negative Effects:**\nAction 3950 found that recently cut fens had fewer large copper eggs than uncut fens in the Netherlands, and that large copper caterpillar survival was lower in recently cut fens and fens cut in autumn or winter than in uncut fens. Action 3971 documented that after cattle grazing began on wet grassland, the number of bog fritillaries which emerged and their use of grazed areas was lower than before grazing started in Belgium. Action 696 found that common snipe declined on all sites under management to maintain traditional water meadows. Action 1762 found that grazed fen meadows contained fewer fen-characteristic plant species and fewer overall plant species than mown meadows in Germany.\n\n**Timing Effects:**\nAction 1771 found that plant species richness increased more over two years in summer-mown plots than spring- or autumn-mown plots in UK fen meadows.

Similar payment approaches are used for other wetland types, with Action 3387 describing programs that pay stakeholders to protect marshes or swamps, including agri-environment rules for managing farmland ditches in the UK and micro-credits for sustainable development in Nigeria that led to 58 communities switching from practices that damaged mangrove forests to more sustainable practices.\n\nAgri-environment schemes represent a broader policy mechanism for conservation incentives. Actions 962 and 700 detail how these schemes pay farmers to cover the costs of conservation measures, though their effectiveness varies across different species and habitats. Action 700 notes that European agri-environment schemes have shown mixed results, with some studies finding increases in population size or density of birds and other wildlife on scheme sites compared to non-scheme sites, while other studies found negative or no effects.\n\nCampaign and advocacy approaches can also drive policy change without requiring direct legal protection.

However, mown plots contained more fen-characteristic plant species than unmown plots, and mowing typically increased Sphagnum moss cover while reducing purple moor grass cover (Action 1770). For maintaining/restoring disturbance in fens, cutting/mowing altered overall plant community composition and increased cover of fen- or wet meadow-characteristic plants (Action 1759). Six studies found that mowing reduced cover or abundance of at least one group of herbs including bindweed, reeds, sedges, purple moor grass and grass-like plants overall (Action 1759). Most studies showed that mowing/cutting increased plant species richness in fens and fen meadows compared to no mowing (Action 1759).\n\n**Cutting Large Trees/Shrubs:**\nStudies in fens found that cutting and removing trees/shrubs to maintain/restore disturbance resulted in plant community composition becoming more like target fen meadows and increased abundance of fen meadow plant species (Action 1761). Cutting and removing trees increased herb cover and biomass in forested fens (Action 1761). For controlling problematic large trees/shrubs, studies reported that plant community composition changed to become more like undegraded, open fen, with increased species richness and cover of fen-characteristic plants, and increased moss and vascular plant cover and species richness (Action 1772).\n\n**Complete Physical Removal:**\nPhysical removal of problematic plants in fens showed that removing mossy vegetation increased cover of fen-characteristic plants (Action 1768). However, moss removal had mixed effects on herb cover after 2-5 years, with results varying between species and sites (Action 1768). Removing moss carpet reduced total bryophyte and Sphagnum moss cover for three years, and moss removal increased plant species richness but only in drained areas (Action 1768).\n\n**Seasonal Timing Effects:**\nStudies found that plant species richness increased more over two years in summer-mown plots than spring- or autumn-mown plots in fen meadows (Action 1771).\n\n**Litter Removal:**\nRemoving plant litter in fens and fen meadows generally did not affect plant community composition or bryophyte cover, though one study found it increased plant species richness and diversity (Action 1760).",
