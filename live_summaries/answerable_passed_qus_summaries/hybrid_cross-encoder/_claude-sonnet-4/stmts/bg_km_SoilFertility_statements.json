Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA found higher soil organic carbon in soils under no-tillage or reduced tillage systems compared to conventionally tilled soil (action 906). Studies from Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Switzerland and the UK found positive effects on farmland wildlife, including increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms, greater abundance of some invertebrates, increased numbers of some weeds and/or weed species, higher Eurasian skylark nest density, and greater abundance of some birds including seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in late winter (action 126). Seven replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing (action 906). Studies from European countries found reduced tillage maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure, with higher nutrient retention (action 906).\n\nDocumented harms include increased soil compaction in some cases, with three replicated trials from Australia, Canada, and Europe finding higher compaction under reduced tillage (action 906). Some European studies found negative effects or no consistent effects on abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates and earthworms, number of different plant species found as seeds, and some bird species (action 126). Crop yield impacts varied by crop type: studies from Spain found lower cereal and legume yields in some comparisons with reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage, though other studies found higher or similar yields (action 1359). Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover (action 906). Three replicated trials from Europe and India found that conventional ploughing increased soil's ability to absorb water and soil water content compared to reduced tillage (action 906).",

Action 1351 showed mixed effects on cash crop yields - some studies found lower yields, some higher yields, and many found no differences between plots with or without winter cover crops.

Reduced tillage and no-tillage practices generally demonstrate benefits for soil organic matter, with multiple studies finding higher soil organic carbon and organic matter content compared to conventional tillage (actions 906, 1369, 1371). Benefits for soil organisms include increased microbial biomass, earthworm abundance, and improved biodiversity of soil fauna under reduced and no-tillage systems (actions 906, 126, 1369, 1371, 2306, 2307). For nutrient retention, reduced tillage shows mixed but generally positive effects, with studies finding higher nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium levels in some comparisons, though results vary by location and conditions (actions 1369, 1371). Soil structure benefits include improved water-stability of aggregates and reduced soil erosion under reduced tillage systems (actions 906, 1369, 1371). However, drawbacks include potential soil compaction issues, with studies showing higher compaction under reduced tillage in some cases (action 906). For drought conditions, conventional ploughing showed better soil water absorption and content compared to reduced tillage (action 906). Some studies found lower crop yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage (action 906).

Timing modifications, such as delaying ploughing until spring on sandy loam soils, can reduce soil loss and nitrate leaching (action 712).

Soil amendments are effective, including adding organic processing wastes or their composts which improve soil structure and reduce soil loss according to trials from Spain and the UK (Action 891). Fresh plant material or crop remains can be incorporated, with one study from India finding improved soil structure when straw was incorporated (Action 910). Manures and agricultural composts increase soil organic matter, create larger soil aggregations and have positive effects on soil physical properties according to studies from Denmark and Germany (Action 911). Mixed organic and inorganic amendments can be more effective than inorganic fertilizers alone, with one controlled trial from India finding mixed amendments more effective at reducing soil crack size in dry soil (Action 902). \n\nCover crops improve soil structure when fields are empty, with three randomized studies from Denmark, Turkey and the UK finding that growing cover crops improved soil structure, including higher soil porosity, interconnectivity and lower soil resistance (Action 898). Adding mulch to crops improves soil structure and increases soil organic matter according to trials from Canada, Poland and Spain (Action 887). Retaining crop residues increases soil organic carbon and nitrogen, with two randomized trials from Australia and China finding these benefits (Action 907).\n\nTillage modifications also improve soil structure. Changing tillage practices, specifically reducing tillage, increases soil organic carbon and organic matter with improved soil structure, as found in twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA (Action 906). Controlling traffic and timing reduces compaction and increases soil porosity, with five trials from Europe and Australia finding less compaction, reduced runoff and increased water filtration (Action 899). Soil can also be amended with bacteria or fungi, with one controlled trial from Turkey finding increased soil organic matter content under mycorrhizal-inoculated compost applications (Action 888).",

In terms of soil and fertilizer management, one replicated study from Denmark found that reducing the extent of grass pasture in leys reduced the undesirable uptake of nitrogen by grasses, therefore requiring lower rates of fertilizer for subsequent crops (Action ID 900). For pest management and biodiversity, a controlled study in Finland found that creating clover leys resulted in higher spider abundance and fewer pest insects than a barley control plot (Action ID 643). However, the duration of leys affects their ecological value, as a study in the UK found that one-year ley plots had significantly lower earthworm species richness and abundance than three-and-a-half-year leys (Action ID 643). In terms of plant diversity, a replicated study in the UK found that grass leys had fewer plant species than nine other conservation measures (Action ID 643). When arable land is converted to permanent grassland, several studies across Europe documented biodiversity benefits for butterflies and moths. Multiple studies in the UK, Finland, Switzerland and Taiwan found that restored grasslands developed butterfly communities increasingly similar to existing high-quality grasslands over time, with higher species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths compared to conventionally managed farmland (Action ID 3929). However, effects on birds are mixed, as all five studies looking at the effects of reverting arable land to grassland found no clear benefit to birds, with one controlled before-and-after study from the UK showing that grey partridge numbers fell significantly following the reversion of arable fields to grassland (Action ID 210). Grass buffer strips and margins around arable fields also provide biodiversity benefits, with multiple studies across Europe and the USA finding higher species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths in grass margins compared to cropped field edges, particularly when margins are wider or floristically enhanced (Action ID 3982).",

Higher barley yield and grain yields were found when external plant material was incorporated.\n\nExternal organic amendments like manures and composts (Action 911) showed additional benefits including higher microbial biomass and respiration, reduced nutrient loss, higher nitrogen levels, and higher crop yields.

Establishing hedgerows alongside arable land increased small mammal abundance (Action 2383). For tree planting on farmland, farm woodland supported higher small mammal abundance than arable land or similar abundance compared to uncultivated field margins and set-aside (Action 2386). Tree stands were used more by European hares compared to the wider farmed landscape, and trees planted on farmland were used by koalas (Action 2386). Tree plantations on agricultural land showed mixed effects on bats, with two of three studies finding no difference in bat activity in agricultural areas with and without plantations of native trees, though one study found higher bat activity in plantations next to remnant native vegetation than in isolated plantations or over grazing land (Action 958). However, in all three studies, bat activity was lower in plantations compared to original forest and woodland remnants (Action 958). Agricultural landscapes with smaller fields had higher activity of six of seven bat species than landscapes with larger fields (Action 1939). Related field margin practices also showed benefits, with grass buffer strips around fields supporting higher species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths compared to cropped field edges, with wider margins generally providing greater benefits (Action 3982).",

Soil organic matter consistently increases under reduced tillage systems, with twelve studies finding higher soil organic carbon in no-tillage compared to conventionally tilled soils (action 906). A meta-analysis from Mediterranean countries found more organic matter in soils with reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage, with eleven replicated studies supporting this finding (action 1371). Fourteen replicated studies found more organic matter in soils without tillage compared to soils with tillage (action 1369).\n\nSoil biological activity is enhanced when machinery disturbance is reduced. Eleven studies found more microbial biomass in soils with reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage (action 1371). Two replicated studies found more earthworms in soils without tillage compared to soils with tillage (action 1369). Additionally, four studies found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage (action 906).\n\nSoil structure improvements occur through reduced machinery traffic. Eight studies found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage (action 906). Seven replicated studies found that soils without tillage were more stable than tilled soils (action 1369). Three replicated studies found that soil aggregates had higher water-stability in plots with reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage (action 1371).\n\nControlled traffic systems provide additional benefits by minimizing compaction. Five trials found higher number of pores in soil, less compaction, reduced runoff and increased water filtration into soil under controlled traffic (action 899). Two replicated trials found that crop yields increased under controlled traffic systems (action 899).\n\nNutrient retention is generally improved under reduced disturbance systems. Four trials found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage (action 906). Seven replicated studies found more nitrogen in soils with reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage, while five replicated studies found more phosphorus in soils with reduced tillage (action 1371).",
