Long flexible habitats supported macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate or fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without flexible habitats (Action 3451). Long flexible habitats had mixed effects on fish species richness around structures, depending on fish presence when flexible habitats were created, and mixed effects on the abundance of fishes or seahorses depending on species and timing (Action 3451). For invertebrates, long flexible habitats had mixed effects on mobile and non-mobile invertebrate abundance depending on species group and survey week, with one study reporting that flexible habitats decreased mussel abundance on structure surfaces but the flexible habitats themselves supported higher biomass than structure surfaces (Action 3451). Short flexible habitats had mixed effects on mobile and non-mobile invertebrate community composition depending on density or length of flexible habitats (Action 3450). Short flexible habitats also had mixed effects on mobile and non-mobile invertebrate abundance depending on survey week, species group, and flexible habitat length, and mixed effects on seahorse abundance depending on survey week (Action 3450). Long flexible habitats were used by seahorses, while behavioral data was not available for short flexible habitats (Actions 3451, 3450).",

Rock pools also supported species that were absent from structure surfaces without pools.\n\n**Pit habitats (1-50 mm)** showed strong effectiveness, with eight of 12 replicated controlled studies finding that pit habitats increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness and/or diversity (Action ID: 3475). Pit habitats also supported macroalgae, invertebrate and/or fish species that were absent from surfaces without added habitats.\n\n**Hole habitats (>50 mm)** demonstrated consistent positive effects, with three replicated controlled studies finding that hole habitats increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species diversity and/or richness (Action ID: 3467). Hole habitats also supported species that were absent from structure surfaces without added habitat features.\n\n**Combinations of grooves and small ridges/ledges (1-50 mm)** showed effectiveness, with six of 11 replicated controlled studies finding that these combinations increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species diversity and/or richness (Action ID: 3474). These combinations also supported species that were absent from structure surfaces without grooves and ridges.\n\n**Moderately Effective Methods:**\n\n**Groove habitats (1-50 mm)** alone showed mixed results, with three of six replicated controlled studies finding increased species richness and/or diversity (Action ID: 3473). However, grooves consistently supported species that were absent from structure surfaces without grooves.\n\n**Small protrusions (1-50 mm)** when combined with other habitat types showed positive effects, with two replicated controlled studies finding increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness (Action ID: 3462).\n\n**Less Effective Methods:**\n\n**Small ridges or ledges (1-50 mm)** alone showed limited effectiveness, with mixed results and typically supporting lower species richness than grooves created between them (Action ID: 3464).\n\n**Large ridges or ledges (>50 mm)** showed inconsistent results, with only one of two studies finding increased species diversity (Action ID: 3465).\n\n**Textured surfaces (â‰¤1 mm)** had mixed effects on species richness depending on the type of texture and site (Action ID: 3466).\n\n**Short flexible habitats (1-50 mm)** actually decreased combined species richness in one study (Action ID: 3459).\n\nThe evidence suggests that creating water-retaining features (rock pools, holes, pits) and three-dimensional complexity through combinations of habitat types are most effective for enhancing species richness and diversity on intertidal artificial structures.",

The same studies found that creating textured surfaces, along with using environmentally-sensitive material, had mixed effects on barnacle and mobile invertebrate abundances, depending on the site, while one study found increased barnacle abundance regardless of texture type, though different textures supported different abundances (Action 3466). Creating textured surfaces did not increase macroalgal abundance on structure surfaces according to two studies in the Netherlands (Action 3466).\n\nFor larger-scale surface modifications, creating natural rocky reef topography on intertidal structures in the UK had mixed effects on barnacle and mobile invertebrate abundances depending on the site, and did not increase combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness (Action 3435). However, natural topography was colonized by macroalgae and limpets, with limpets using shaded grooves and water-retaining depressions (Action 3435).\n\nCreating groove habitats (1-50 mm) on intertidal structures showed varied outcomes across European studies. In the UK and Netherlands, creating groove habitats did not increase macroalgal abundance on structure surfaces according to two studies (Action 3473). For invertebrate responses, three of four studies from Australia, the Netherlands and the UK found that creating groove habitats did not increase invertebrate, limpet or chiton abundances (Action 3473). However, groove habitats were reported to be used by mussels and periwinkles in Netherlands studies (Action 3473).\n\nCreating pit habitats (1-50 mm) on intertidal structures also showed variable outcomes in European environments. Studies from the UK and Netherlands found that creating pit habitats did not increase macroalgal abundance on structure surfaces according to three of four studies (Action 3475). For invertebrates, studies in the Netherlands and UK found mixed results, with some showing no increase in invertebrate abundance while others found mixed effects on barnacle and mobile invertebrate abundances depending on site, species, animal size, and pit characteristics (Action 3475).\n\nCombined modifications involving grooves and small protrusions, ridges or ledges (1-50 mm) demonstrated varied outcomes depending on multiple factors. UK studies found mixed effects on mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate, limpet, mussel, juvenile oyster and barnacle abundances, with outcomes depending on the depth/height of grooves and ridges, the presence of large ledges or water-retaining and light-shading covers, the shore level, and the site (Action 3474).",

Creating structural habitat features shows promise, with long flexible habitats (>50 mm) supporting fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without flexible habitats and having mixed effects on fish abundance depending on species and fish presence when created (3451). Small adjoining cavities or 'swimthrough' habitats (â‰¤100 mm) supported six fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without swimthroughs and had mixed effects on juvenile fish community composition and abundance depending on site and survey conditions (3436). Large adjoining cavities or 'swimthrough' habitats (>100 mm) supported fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without swimthroughs, increased overall fish species richness and abundance, though individual species responses varied (3456). \n\nCreating hole habitats (>50 mm) combined with other features like grooves and pits supported fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without added habitat features, though effects on fish abundance were mixed depending on species group (3434). Similarly, groove habitats (1-50 mm) when combined with holes, pits and environmentally-sensitive material supported fish species that were absent from similar structures without added habitat features, but had mixed effects on fish abundances depending on species group (3448).\n\nManagement approaches also show benefits, with harvesting restrictions supporting fish species that were absent from unrestricted structures and higher fish species richness, though effects on total fish abundance were mixed (3457). Reducing maintenance activities can increase seahorse abundance on structure surfaces (3447). Using environmentally-sensitive materials such as ECOncreteâ„¢ combined with habitat features supported fish species that were absent from standard-concrete or fibreglass structure surfaces, though effects on fish abundances were mixed depending on species group (3470). Creating artificial reefs with different 3-D structures and materials showed no consistent differences in combined mobile invertebrate and fish richness or abundance between different reef designs (2259).",

Creating natural rocky reef topography on subtidal artificial structures did not increase the abundance of juvenile canopy macroalgae that settled onto structure surfaces, regardless of topography depth (Action 3446). Surface texture also influenced algae establishment, with textured surfaces having mixed effects on macroalgal abundance depending on the species group and site (Action 3449).

Twenty-two studies found that creating pit habitats altered community composition in four of six studies and increased species richness in eight of 12 studies (Action ID: 3475). These habitats supported macroalgae, invertebrate and fish species that were absent from unmodified surfaces.\n\n**Groove habitats (1-50 mm)** demonstrated consistent effectiveness across 14 studies.

Grooves, along with pits, supported species absent from surfaces without these modifications.\n\n**Flexible habitats** showed promise with both long (>50 mm) and short (1-50 mm) versions altering community composition. Long flexible habitats supported macroalgae, mobile and non-mobile invertebrates absent from unmodified surfaces (Action ID: 3460). Short flexible habitats altered combined macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate community composition (Action ID: 3459).\n\n**Hole habitats (>50 mm)** consistently increased species diversity and richness across three studies and altered community composition, supporting species absent from unmodified surfaces (Action ID: 3467).\n\n**Small protrusions (1-50 mm)** increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness in two studies conducted in Singapore (Action ID: 3462).\n\n**Environmentally-sensitive materials** showed mixed results, with hemp-concrete and ECOncreteâ„¢ (along with added habitat features) altering community composition and increasing species richness, while other materials like shell-concrete showed limited effects (Action ID: 3469).\n\n**Large protrusions (>50 mm)** supported species absent from unmodified surfaces but did not consistently increase species richness (Action ID: 3463).\n\nThe most consistently effective modifications across multiple studies were pit habitats, groove habitats, and flexible habitats, which reliably altered community composition and increased species diversity while supporting species not found on unmodified artificial structures.",

For subtidal structures, there is substantial evidence supporting swimthrough habitats. Four studies examined small swimthrough habitats (â‰¤100 mm) on subtidal structures in France, Morocco, Mayotte, and France, finding mixed effects on juvenile fish community composition, species richness, and abundance depending on site, survey month, and species (Action 3436). Two studies examined large swimthrough habitats (>100 mm) on subtidal structures in Mayotte and the USA, with one study finding that large swimthroughs increased overall fish species richness and abundance on structure surfaces, though effects varied by fish size class and species (Action 3456). Both small and large subtidal swimthroughs were reported to be used by various species including juvenile spiny lobsters, sea firs, adult fish, juvenile fish, and groupers (Actions 3436, 3456). For intertidal structures, the evidence is much more limited. Two studies examined small swimthrough habitats (â‰¤100 mm) on intertidal structures in the UK, Netherlands, and South Africa, finding that they did not alter mobile invertebrate community composition, increase species richness or diversity, but did increase mobile invertebrate abundance on structure surfaces (Action 3468).

One study found that this approach did not increase the combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness on structure surfaces, though it did have mixed effects on barnacle and mobile invertebrate abundances depending on the site. The natural topography was colonized by macroalgae and limpets, with limpets using shaded grooves and water-retaining depressions.\n\nIn contrast, creating 'rock pools' demonstrated significantly stronger biodiversity improvements (Action 3476). Across 18 studies, rock pools supported macroalgae, mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate and/or fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without pools. Nine of 12 studies found that rock pools supported higher combined macroalgae, invertebrate and/or fish species diversity and/or richness than structure surfaces without pools. Rock pools created different community compositions compared to surfaces without pools, and were used by sea slugs, urchins, octopuses, macroalgae, invertebrates and fishes.\n\nHowever, the effectiveness of rock pools varied depending on factors such as pool depth, shore level, wave exposure, and site conditions. Some studies found that created pools supported different communities compared to natural rock pools, and wave-sheltered pools could fill with sediment within two years. The evidence shows mixed effects for some measures like invertebrate and fish abundances, depending on specific conditions and species groups.",

In Japan, kelp recruit abundance on subtidal artificial structures varied depending on distance from transplanted kelp individuals and surface orientation (Action 3471). Survival of transplanted canopy algae varied depending on wave exposure, surrounding habitat, and presence of protective cages (Action 3471). For intertidal structures, macroalgae transplanted onto artificial structures were more likely to survive at mid- and highshore locations than at lowshore (Action 3472).\n\n**Creating Textured Surfaces:** Creating textured surfaces (â‰¤1 mm) on intertidal artificial structures did not increase macroalgal abundance on structure surfaces according to two studies in the Netherlands (Action 3466). Similarly, creating textured surfaces on subtidal artificial structures had mixed effects on macroalgal abundance depending on species group and site in Italy (Action 3449).\n\n**Creating Topographical Features:** Creating natural rocky reef topography on subtidal artificial structures did not increase abundance of juvenile canopy macroalgae in Italy (Action 3446). Creating small protrusions (1-50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures had mixed effects on macroalgal abundance depending on species in Japan (Action 3453). Creating large ridges or ledges (>50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures, combined with grooves and small protrusions, increased rockweed abundance in the USA (Action 3465).\n\n**Creating Flexible Habitats:** Creating short flexible habitats (1-50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures had mixed effects on macroalgal abundance depending on species group and site in Australia (Action 3459).\n\n**Modifying Structure Slope:** Reducing the slope of intertidal artificial structures did not increase macroalgal abundance on structure surfaces in Australia (Action 3461).",

However, biodiversity outcomes were mixed: two of three studies found increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness and/or diversity, while one study found no increase in combined mobile invertebrate and fish species richness or diversity. Population-level effects were generally limited, with one study showing no increase in combined mobile invertebrate and fish abundance, and mixed effects on species-specific abundances depending on the species group.\n\nIn intertidal zones in Australia and Europe (Action 3467), five studies examined hole habitats on artificial structures in southeast Australia, the UK, the Netherlands, and northern Israel. These studies consistently found that hole habitats altered the combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition on structure surfaces and supported macroalgae and/or non-mobile invertebrate species that were absent from structure surfaces without added habitat features. All three studies examining richness/diversity found that creating hole habitats increased the combined macroalgae and invertebrate species diversity and/or richness on structure surfaces. However, population-level effects were limited, with studies showing no increase in macroalgal abundance and mixed effects on invertebrate abundance. One study in Australia reported that hole habitats were used by sea slugs, urchins and octopuses.\n\nThe key difference appears to be that intertidal hole habitats showed more consistent positive effects on species diversity/richness across studies, while subtidal hole habitats showed more variable outcomes for diversity measures and generally limited population-level effects.",

Creating grooves and small protrusions, ridges or ledges (1â€“50 mm) altered community composition in one of two studies (3452). Creating long flexible habitats (>50 mm) resulted in these features supporting macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate or fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without flexible habitats in two studies (3451). Creating short flexible habitats (1â€“50 mm) had mixed effects on mobile and/or non-mobile invertebrate community composition in two studies (3450). Structural modifications: Different artificial reef structure and material types showed that scrap tyres developed similar sessile invertebrate community composition as concrete modules, while pyramids made of \"sea-friendly\" concrete developed different invertebrate community compositions compared to traditional concrete structures (2259). Management practices: Managing or restricting harvesting resulted in different fish community composition around structures with restrictions compared to unrestricted structures, with restricted structures supporting species absent from unrestricted ones (3457). However, reducing the frequency of cleaning on subtidal artificial structures did not alter combined invertebrate and fish community composition (3447).",

Two studies found mixed effects on juvenile fish abundances depending on species, site, survey month and development stage (Action 3436). Three studies reported that small swimthroughs were used by juvenile spiny lobsters, sea firs, adult fish and juvenile fish (Action 3436). For large swimthrough habitats (>100 mm) on subtidal structures, two studies showed more positive results - one study in the USA found that large swimthroughs supported fish species absent from surfaces without swimthroughs, increased overall fish species richness and abundance, though effects varied by fish size class and species (Action 3456). One study in Mayotte reported use by juvenile spiny lobsters, groupers, sea firs and adult fishes from five families (Action 3456).

Surface texture features significantly affect outcomes - transplanting oysters onto surfaces with grooves and small ridges (1-50 mm) shows mixed effects on species richness and diversity depending on the presence and size of these features and the site (action 3472). Studies in southeast Australia found that oyster survival was higher when transplanted into grooves compared with on ridges, while survival in grooves and on ledges varied depending on the site (action 3472). The presence of hole habitats (>50 mm) on structures, along with grooves and small ridges, supported macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate species that were absent from structure surfaces without added habitat features, and increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species diversity and richness on structure surfaces (action 3467). Material composition affects colonization success - environmentally-sensitive materials like hemp-concrete or reduced-pH-concrete can alter community composition and support species absent from standard-concrete surfaces (action 3469). Shore level positioning influences transplant success, with studies showing that survival and abundance effects vary depending on the intertidal zone where oysters are placed (action 3472). Site-specific conditions create variable outcomes, as multiple studies found that transplantation effects depend on the particular location within Australian estuaries (actions 3472, 3474). The effectiveness for enhancing wider biodiversity shows mixed results - while transplanted oysters supported additional macroalgae, mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate and fish species that were absent from surfaces without oysters, the actual increases in species richness and diversity varied depending on site and structural features (action 3472).",

      "relevant_summary": "Multiple studies conducted in Australian estuaries have documented diverse biodiversity outcomes from interventions on intertidal artificial structures. Transplanting or seeding organisms onto intertidal artificial structures (Action ID: 3472) showed that oysters transplanted onto structures supported macroalgae, mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate and fish species that were absent from surfaces without transplanted oysters, with increased mobile invertebrate species richness observed in some cases. However, effects on fish species richness were mixed depending on site and presence of grooves and ridges. Creating 'rock pools' on intertidal artificial structures (Action ID: 3476) demonstrated that pools supported macroalgae, mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate and fish species absent from structure surfaces without pools, with most studies showing higher combined species diversity and richness compared to surfaces without pools. Rock pools were documented to be used by sea slugs, urchins, octopuses, macroalgae, invertebrates and fishes. Creating hole habitats (Action ID: 3467) on structures along with other features like rock pools or grooves supported macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate species absent from surfaces without added habitat features, and increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species diversity and richness on structure surfaces. Creating short flexible habitats (Action ID: 3459) altered combined macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate community composition on structure surfaces, but decreased combined macroalgae, invertebrate and fish species richness during low tide. Creating small ridges or ledges (Action ID: 3464) showed mixed results, with some studies finding no increase in species richness and others showing that ridges supported lower species richness than grooves created between them. Creating pit habitats (Action ID: 3475) altered combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition and increased species richness in some studies, but results varied by site and arrangement of features. Using environmentally-sensitive materials (Action ID: 3469) such as hemp-concrete showed altered community composition and increased mobile invertebrate species richness compared to standard concrete. Reducing slope (Action ID: 3461) combined with creating rock pools increased combined macroalgae, invertebrate and fish species richness on structures.",

For small ridges or ledges (1-50 mm) on intertidal structures, one study found that small ledges supported lower mobile invertebrate abundances than grooves created between them (Action 3464). When grooves and small protrusions, ridges or ledges were created together on intertidal structures, studies showed mixed effects on mobile invertebrate abundance depending on factors such as the depth/height of grooves and ridges, the presence of large ledges or water-retaining covers, shore level, and site location (Action 3474). Two studies found that creating grooves and small ridges/ledges increased oyster but not mobile invertebrate abundance (Action 3474). For subtidal structures with grooves and small protrusions, ridges or ledges, one study found mixed effects on combined macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate abundance depending on the orientation of structure surfaces (Action 3452). For large ridges or ledges (>50 mm) on intertidal structures, studies found that they increased the abundance of mussels or limpets, but not barnacles (Action 3465). Large protrusions on intertidal structures were found to support mobile and non-mobile invertebrate species that were absent from structure surfaces without protrusions, and increased limpet but not barnacle abundance (Actions 3463). The effects varied considerably based on specific design features, environmental conditions, and the particular invertebrate species examined.",

Long flexible habitats (>50 mm) supported macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate or fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without flexible habitats, and altered non-mobile invertebrate community composition (Action 3451). Hole habitats (>50 mm) altered combined macroalgae and invertebrate or mobile invertebrate and fish community composition when combined with other features like grooves and pits, and supported species that were absent from surfaces without added habitat features (Action 3434). Groove habitats (1-50 mm) altered combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition and supported macroalgae, non-mobile invertebrate and fish species that were absent from structures without added habitat features (Action 3448). Pit habitats (1-50 mm) altered combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition and supported mobile and non-mobile invertebrate and fish species that were absent from structures without the added habitat features (Action 3455).

Short flexible habitats (1-50 mm) had mixed effects on mobile and/or non-mobile invertebrate community composition but did alter non-mobile invertebrate community composition in one study (Action 3450). Small adjoining cavities or 'swimthrough' habitats (â‰¤100 mm) had mixed effects on juvenile fish community composition but supported six species that were absent from structure surfaces without swimthroughs (Action 3436).
