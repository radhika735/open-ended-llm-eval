Threshold-based spraying regimes increased numbers of natural enemies in two of three years, though effects lasted for as little as three weeks (Action 750). Altering the timing of insecticide use resulted in more natural enemies when insecticides were sprayed earlier rather than later in the growing season (Action 723). Delaying herbicide use led to more natural enemies in two randomised, replicated, controlled trials, though some but not all natural enemy groups benefited and fewer groups benefitted early in the season (Action 774). Using chemicals to attract natural enemies showed mixed results, with five of 13 studies finding more natural enemies while eight found positive effects varied between enemy groups, sites or study dates (Action 754). Incorporating parasitism rates when setting thresholds for insecticide use resulted in acceptable levels of crop damage from pests, though effects on natural enemy populations were not monitored (Action 726). Converting to organic farming produced mixed effects, with eight of 12 studies finding more natural enemies under organic farming, though seven of these found effects varied over time or between natural enemy species or groups and/or crops or management practices (Action 717). Reducing fertilizer, pesticide or herbicide use generally showed positive effects, with eight studies finding greater species richness of butterflies and moths, and six studies finding higher abundance of these insects in areas with reduced chemical applications compared to conventional chemical applications (Action 3897). Threshold-based pesticide strategies also resulted in fewer pesticide applications being needed and lower production costs in multiple studies (Action 750).",

One replicated, randomised, controlled study found an increase in crop yield. The crops studied were lettuce, orange, safflower and sorghum (Action 724).\n\nFor planting new hedges, the evidence is more mixed (Action 752). One randomised, replicated, controlled study from China found no effect on spiders in crops. Studies from France and China found mixed results, with one finding more natural enemies in hedges than adjacent crops while another found effects varied between crop types, hedge species and years. Two randomised, replicated, controlled studies from France and Kenya found natural enemy abundance in hedges was affected by the type of hedge shrub/tree planted. One study from Kenya found effects on nematodes varied between groups. The crops studied were barley, beans, maize and wheat (Action 752).\n\nAdditional evidence for hedgerows shows that one study from the USA found higher parasitization of pest eggs in tomato fields with hedgerows compared to fields with weedy edges, but only up to 100m into the crop, though pest damage to tomatoes was no different between hedgerow and weedy edge fields (Action 1401). Studies also found more natural enemies in fields with hedgerows compared to fields with weedy edges in some comparisons (Actions 1401, 2314).\n\nThe evidence suggests that plants producing chemicals that attract natural enemies show more consistent positive effects across studies, while hedge effectiveness varies significantly depending on hedge species, crop type, and other factors.",

Two of three studies found that crop growth was inhibited by allelopathic plant remains (Action 728). The effectiveness and safety of this practice appears to depend heavily on timing, as one study found that residues applied too far in advance of crop planting had the reverse effect of what was intended (Action 728). Additionally, crop inhibition could be minimized by changing the timing of application (Action 728). When comparing yields in amended plots with weeded controls, studies found positive, negative and mixed effects, indicating variable outcomes for crop productivity (Action 728). The negative effects on weeds from allelopathic plant remains do not last beyond a few days or weeks after residue incorporation, which may limit their effectiveness while still potentially affecting crops (Action 728).",

      "relevant_summary": "Several non-herbicide methods can be used to control weeds on farmland. Growing competitive plants is effective, with nine studies from Australia, Slovakia, the UK and USA showing that planting species to compete with weeds reduced weed plant weight and ground cover, and five studies finding reduced weed reproduction and survival (Action 722). Cover crops in arable fields provide weed suppression, with four replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Israel and Italy finding fewer weeds in plots with cover crops compared to plots without them in some or all comparisons (Action 1394). Ground cover in orchards or vineyards also helps, with one study from Spain finding fewer weeds in plots with cover crops compared to bare soil (Action 1395). Allowing natural regeneration of ground cover beneath perennial crops can be beneficial for overall pest management including weeds (Action 720).\n\nTillage management offers another approach. Reducing tillage can affect weed populations, with 34 studies from nine European countries finding some positive effects including increased numbers of some weeds and/or weed species under reduced tillage compared to conventional management (Action 126). Different tillage practices can be strategically used for weed management (Action 906).\n\nPhysical and manual methods include mechanical or manual removal of weeds. Studies show this can be effective, with one replicated, controlled study in Hawaii finding that removal of invasive grass species increased understory plant biomass (Action 1228). Selective hand weeding is another option for managing vegetation (Action 3714). Adding mulch provides some weed control benefits, though one study found limited effectiveness in reducing grass cover (Action 1650).\n\nCrop diversification strategies help suppress weeds. Intercropping (planting more than one crop per field) can enhance beneficial insects that may help with pest management including weeds (Action 124). Crop rotation in potato farming systems reduces pest populations and diseases while potentially affecting weed dynamics (Action 719). Converting to organic farming systems eliminates herbicide use, though studies show mixed effects on weed abundance, with three randomized, replicated, controlled studies from the USA finding more weeds in organically farmed fields, but effects varied between crops and years (Action 717).",

Eight studies compared numbers of predatory invertebrates on beetle banks with other refuge habitats - two studies found more natural enemies on beetle banks (with one showing only seasonal effects), one review found similar or higher numbers of predators, and four studies found similar or lower numbers compared to other habitats. Action 729 also noted that six studies examined effects on predator numbers in adjacent crops, with a review finding that predators increased in adjacent crops, though one study found no effect and two studies found small or slow movements of predators from banks to crops.

Incorporating parasitism rates when setting thresholds for insecticide use is a management approach that one controlled study from New Zealand found resulted in acceptable levels of crop damage from pests (Action 726). Natural ground cover regeneration beneath perennial crops can support natural enemies, though effects on parasitism specifically were not directly measured in the available studies (Action 720).

For plant competition strategies, growing plants that compete with damaging weeds resulted in reduced weed plant weight or ground cover in all nine studies from Australia, Slovakia, the UK and the USA, although two studies found this effect only in some years or conditions (action 722). Additionally, five studies found that competition reduced weed reproduction, survival or both, with one study showing an effect only in one year (action 722). Mixed pasture systems showed effectiveness with two studies from the USA finding reduced weeds in mixed compared to monoculture pasture (action 721). Push-pull cropping systems demonstrated pest control benefits, with two studies finding fewer witchweeds and two of three studies finding fewer pests overall (action 753).\n\nFor chemical-based approaches using allelopathic plant remains, results were variable. Six studies from Asia, Europe and North America found three studies showing reduction in weed growth and three showing effects that varied between years, weed groups, or control methods when comparing amended soils with weeded controls (action 728). When comparing with unweeded controls, two of four studies found reduced weed growth, but one found that residues applied too far in advance had reverse effects (action 728). However, the weed control effects were temporary, with two studies finding the decrease in weeds did not last beyond a few days or weeks after residue incorporation (action 728). These chemical approaches also affected crop growth, with two of three studies finding crop growth was inhibited by allelopathic plant remains, though this could be minimized by changing application timing (action 728).",

Three studies found higher numbers of natural enemies in plots with plants that produce attractive chemicals, and one found that the attractive plant also attracted natural enemies in lab studies. One found no effect on parasitism but the plant used was found not to be attractive to natural enemies in lab studies. All four studies found a decrease in either pest population or pest damage in plots with plants that produce chemicals that attract natural enemies. One replicated, randomised, controlled study found an increase in crop yield in plots with plants that produce attractive chemicals. The manufactured chemical approach was tested across a broader range of crops including apple, banana, bean, broccoli, Chinese cabbage, cotton, cowpea, cranberry, grape, grapefruit, hop, maize, oilseed, orange, tomato, turnip and wheat, while the plant-based approach was tested on lettuce, orange, safflower and sorghum.",

According to action 774, delaying herbicide treatments increased natural enemies in two studies from Australia and Denmark, though benefits varied by natural enemy group and were less pronounced early in the season. However, delaying herbicides led to increased weed pressure and had mixed effects on insect pests, with one study finding more insect pests for some groups while another found fewer pests in specific experiments and crop varieties. Crop damage was reduced in some but not all varieties and study years, while yields either decreased or showed no effect. In contrast, altering insecticide timing shows different patterns. Action 723 indicates that applying insecticides earlier rather than later in the growing season increased natural enemies in one UK study. Early insecticide application reduced pests or disease damage in two of four studies, though effects varied with insecticide type, while two studies found no effect on pests or damage. Yield effects were mixed when insecticides were applied early, with one study finding higher yields when applications were timed to periods of suspected crop susceptibility. One study found higher profits and similar costs when insecticides were applied only during times of suspected crop susceptibility. The evidence suggests that both timing alterations affect natural enemies, pest control, and yields differently, with herbicide delays generally showing more consistent benefits for natural enemies but potential negative impacts on weed control and yields, while insecticide timing changes show more variable effects depending on application timing relative to crop growth stages.",

For specific weed control without damaging other plants, various methods are effective including cutting, infection with fungal pathogens, and lenient grazing for long-term control of creeping thistle, while grass-specific herbicide treatments can eliminate black grass and reduce grass diversity while increasing broadleaved plants (Action 123). Modifying grazing regimes in grassland and shrubland can affect vegetation management, with different grazing intensities showing various effects on plant and animal communities (Action 3490). Additionally, removing problematic vegetation can be effective for invasive species control in grassland areas (Action 432). Some studies also found that grazing herbivores on pasture instead of providing artificial foods can be beneficial for wildlife populations (Action 2398), and grassland restoration or creation can support various species while involving management practices like mowing and weeding or herbicide application (Action 3943).",
