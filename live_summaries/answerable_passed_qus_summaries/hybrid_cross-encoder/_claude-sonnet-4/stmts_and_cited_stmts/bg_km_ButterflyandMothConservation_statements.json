      "relevant_summary": "Forest canopy opening through clearing, coppicing, and thinning has differential effects on butterfly and moth communities. Thinning trees within forests generally increases butterfly species richness and abundance, with studies showing that coniferous woodland thinned along with prescribed burning, mulching or nearby felling had greater species richness of butterflies and higher abundance of all butterflies or specialist butterflies compared to unmanaged woodland (Action 3940). However, one study found that partially-cleared forest plots had higher butterfly but lower moth species richness than closed-canopy forest (Action 3940).\n\nClearing or opening patches in forests shows mixed effects depending on the taxa and patch characteristics. Cleared patches had greater species richness of butterflies but lower species richness of moths than unmanaged patches or closed canopy forest (Action 3938). Larger cleared patches supported higher species richness and abundance of butterflies than undisturbed forest, while smaller patches did not show this benefit (Action 3938). Studies found that cleared patches generally had higher abundance of butterflies, including specific species like chequered blue, woodland brown, high brown fritillary and small pearl-bordered fritillary, compared to before management or unmanaged areas (Action 3938). A review across Europe reported that clearing small patches in forests benefitted 19 out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern (Action 3938).\n\nCoppicing woodland creates varying effects based on the age of coppice. Coppiced woodland had greater species richness of butterflies than unmanaged woodland but lower species richness of macro-moths than mature forest (Action 3939). The abundance of butterflies was higher in woodland coppiced 2-4, 5-7 or 12-15 years ago than in woodland coppiced over 15 years ago (Action 3939). Heath fritillary populations were more likely to persist for up to 20 years in coppiced woodland than in mature conifer woodland (Action 3939).\n\nAlternative harvesting methods show different impacts compared to clearcutting. Thinning resulted in higher macro-moth species richness than patch-cutting or clearcutting, with richness similar to unharvested forest (Action 3868). Selective logging produced similar species richness of moths to group selection harvesting or clearcutting, but lower than unharvested forest (Action 3867). Selectively logged forests had higher abundance of exposed moth caterpillars but similar abundance of concealed moth caterpillars compared to clearcut forests (Action 3867).",

      "relevant_summary": "Based on studies from the USA, both rotational burning and leaving unburned patches during prescribed fires show benefits for butterfly populations in prairies, with some important differences:\n\n**Leaving Unburned Patches (Action 3879):** Studies show that the abundance of Karner blue butterflies increased over 2-3 years in oak savannas and prairies where unburned patches were left during prescribed burning. Six out of nine specialist butterfly species were more abundant at sites with unburned areas compared to sites without unburned areas, while one species was less abundant and two had similar abundance. Karner blue butterflies were recorded using all 11 unburned patches surveyed within oak savannas and prairies managed by burning.\n\n**Rotational Burning (Action 3883):** Multiple studies found that the total abundance of prairie specialist, grassland and all butterflies was higher on prairies burned more than one, two or four years ago than on prairies burned in the last one or two years under rotational burning management. The abundance of grassland and generalist butterflies was highest in the third year after burning, and migrant butterflies in the first year after burning. Two studies found that pine-oak barrens and prairies managed by rotational burning every 2-5 years had higher total abundance of butterflies than unmanaged sites. However, rotational burning showed mixed effects across different studies, with some finding lower abundance in rotationally burned prairies compared to unmanaged areas in certain regions.\n\n**Species-Specific Responses (Actions 3882, 3883):** Regal fritillary abundance was higher in grasslands managed by rotational burning every three years than on unmanaged sites, and abundance was higher in rotationally burned prairies four years after the last burn than one or eight years after. However, some studies found that regal fritillary and arogos skipper were less abundant in burned prairies compared to hayed prairies. Karner blue butterfly abundance was similar in rotationally burned and unmanaged oak savannas and prairies.\n\nBoth approaches provide refugia and recovery opportunities for butterfly populations, but timing since last burn appears critical for rotational burning effectiveness, while unburned patches provide immediate refugia during active burning periods.",

Using shielded \"full cut-off\" lights to remove outwards lighting was found to attract fewer individual moths and moth species compared to conventional lights without blinds or filters in a study in Slovenia (Action 3904). Using low intensity lighting reduced moth attraction compared to higher intensity lights, as demonstrated in a study in Germany where fewer moths were attracted to low intensity lights that also emitted a narrower range of yellow light with little UV compared to higher intensity lights with broader spectra including UV (Action 3902). Using 'warmer' red/yellow lighting rather than other lighting colors significantly reduced moth attraction, with four studies in Germany, the Netherlands, Slovenia and the UK finding that fewer individual moths and moth species were attracted to yellow, green, white or red lights compared to UV, actinic, blue or conventional metal halide lights (Action 3906). One study in the Netherlands found that four moth species spent more time feeding under red lights than under white or green lights, but less time feeding than when in complete darkness (Action 3906). Additional potentially beneficial actions include restricting use of polarized light (Action 3903), using glazing treatments to reduce light spill from inside lit buildings (Action 3905), restricting timing of lighting to conserve areas with natural light regimes (Action 3901), minimizing road lighting to reduce insect attraction (Action 3852), and removing or changing turbine lighting to reduce insect attraction (Action 3843), though no studies have yet evaluated these specific interventions for butterfly and moth conservation.",

For translocation programs within former range, eight studies reported that translocated populations persisted for 2-12 years and increased in abundance (Action 3909). However, three studies found that while some translocated populations persisted for 1-49 years and increased in abundance, other populations died out within 0-7 years (Action 3909). A review across the UK and Ireland found that only 25% of translocated and released captive-bred butterfly populations survived for at least three years, with 38% dying out within that timeframe, and only 8% surviving for more than 10 years (Action 3909). Another review reported that translocated large copper populations survived for up to 38 years but ultimately died out or required supplementation by further releases (Action 3909). For translocations outside known range, two of three studies reported populations persisting and increasing in abundance over 8 and 28 years, while one population died out within one year (Action 3911). For captive-bred releases, six studies reported populations persisting for 2-28 years and increasing in abundance, while two studies found populations died out after 1, 2, or 12 years or required further releases to survive (Action 3914). One study found that three of 10 captive-bred populations established, with at least one persisting for five years (Action 3914).

Wildlife gardening practices can also help, with studies showing that gardens where insecticides and herbicides were not used had higher butterfly abundance (action 3834). Stopping the use of pesticides as seed dressings and sprays in flower beds and greenspaces is beneficial, with research showing gardens where insecticides and herbicides were not used had higher abundance of butterflies (action 3900). Altering mowing regimes on greenspaces and road verges provides significant benefits, with less frequently mown or unmown urban greenspaces having higher species richness and diversity of butterflies and moths than more frequently mown areas, and unmown public parks having higher abundance of all adult butterflies than regularly mown areas (action 3841). Creating nectar flower mixture and wildflower strips is effective, with studies finding sown wildflower strips had higher species richness and diversity of butterflies and moths than conventional field margins, unsown margins, and cropped fields, as well as higher abundance of butterflies (action 3932).",

      "relevant_summary": "Management of linear features like road verges and power lines has various effects on butterflies and moths depending on the method used. Power line management through mechanical cutting increases butterfly species richness and abundance compared to unmanaged land, with highest species richness occurring 2-4 years after scrub and tree clearance (Action 3855). The timing of power line management matters, with areas cleared 2-4 years earlier supporting higher butterfly abundance than those cleared 1 year or 6-8 years earlier, and chequered skipper abundance being higher in areas cleared ≤2 years ago than in areas cut ≥4 years earlier (Action 3855).\n\nStopping herbicide use on road verges benefits butterflies and moths. Restored roadside prairies with restricted herbicide application show greater butterfly species richness, abundance, and lower mortality risk compared to verges dominated by non-native weeds with unrestricted herbicide use (Action 3899). Transmission lines neither sprayed nor mown have greater abundance of northern pearl crescent and pearl crescent butterflies compared to sprayed and mown areas (Action 3899).\n\nMowing regimes significantly affect butterfly and moth communities. Less frequently mown or unmown urban greenspaces and road verges have higher species richness and diversity of butterflies and moths than frequently mown areas (Action 3841). Road verges mown less frequently or later in summer have fewer dead butterflies killed by traffic than more frequently or earlier mown verges (Action 3841). Roadsides mown in late summer support more ringlet butterflies than those mown in mid-summer (Action 3841).\n\nRotational mowing provides substantial benefits. Grasslands managed by mowing strips in alternate years or mowing parts of sites at different times show greater species richness and diversity of butterflies than grasslands cut completely once per year (Action 3966). Rotationally mown grasslands support higher butterfly and burnet moth abundance than grasslands cut in full, and 29 out of 32 butterfly species prefer meadows half-mown in June and August to meadows cut completely twice per year (Action 3966).\n\nSpecies-rich grassland restoration along road verges enhances butterfly and moth communities. Restored roadside prairies and verges sown with native wildflowers, more butterfly larval food plants, and more plant species support higher species richness and diversity of butterflies, day-flying moths, burnet moths, and meadow-specialist moths compared to verges dominated by non-native vegetation (Action 3854). Wide road verges support higher butterfly species richness and abundance than narrow road verges (Action 3854).\n\nReducing cutting frequency generally benefits butterflies and moths. Meadows cut once per year have higher species richness of butterflies and moths than meadows cut two or more times per year in most studies, and meadows cut occasionally or once per year support higher abundance of certain species like Scotch argus compared to intensively mown grasslands (Action 3961).",

One study found that grassland plots fenced to exclude elk had similar species richness and abundance of butterflies to unfenced plots in all years (Action 3891). A global systematic review found that reducing or removing grazing or browsing by wild or domestic herbivores in temperate and boreal forests increased the abundance of butterflies and moths but did not affect species richness (Action 3891). For survival and condition measures, all Glanville fritillary caterpillar nests survived in grassland fenced to exclude sheep compared to 88% in grazed areas, and fewer caterpillar nests were damaged in fenced areas (Action 3891). For invertebrate herbivore exclusion, one study found higher density of pearl-bordered fritillary butterflies at sites fenced to exclude grazing animals than at unfenced sites (Action 3885).

Restored grasslands showed higher abundance of moths than conventional grassland and similar abundance to semi-natural grasslands. The effectiveness varied with establishment methods, with grasslands established by sowing grasses, legumes and forbs having higher species richness and abundance of butterflies than grass-only mixes.\n\nRegarding abandoned meadows, Actions 3957 and 3956 provide evidence on cessation of management (mowing and grazing). Action 3957 found that grasslands abandoned for various periods (3-13 years, 10-20 years) generally had similar species richness of butterflies and moths to grasslands managed by mowing, though some studies found abandoned grasslands had lower abundance of all butterflies than mowed grasslands. Action 3956 showed that grasslands abandoned from grazing for 1-25 years had mixed results - some had higher abundance of butterflies and moths than grazed grasslands, while others had lower abundance or similar levels depending on the butterfly species and time since abandonment.\n\nAction 3955 found that semi-natural grasslands restored by scrub clearance and reintroduction of grazing or mowing had different butterfly communities to existing species-rich grasslands and did not become more similar over time.

Bogs re-wetted by blocking drains showed higher abundance of rosy marsh moth caterpillars and mire specialist butterflies than before restoration (Action 3948). However, peatland restoration had some negative effects, with large heath butterfly caterpillars showing lower winter survival in areas where water levels had risen due to restoration, and wet heathland with recently raised water levels being less frequently occupied by Alcon large blue (Action 3948).\n\nFor floodplain restoration, three studies showed varied results: wetland prairie restored by seeding and seasonal flooding had higher abundance of great copper eggs than degraded prairie, and was used more by adult great copper than degraded prairie, but survival of great copper eggs and caterpillars was lower in restored wetland prairie than in degraded prairie (Action 3949). Wetland creation increased macroinvertebrate diversity including butterflies and moths, with species richness increasing with wetland age and reaching levels similar to mature ponds (Action 3949).\n\nManagement of wetlands through cutting or grazing showed species-specific effects: fens managed by mowing had greater butterfly species richness than those managed by cattle grazing, but recently cut fens had fewer large copper eggs and lower caterpillar survival than uncut fens (Action 3950). Semi-natural wetland habitats managed by grazing showed positive effects for some species, with fenland managed by cattle grazing having higher abundance of large copper eggs than unmanaged land (Action 3944).",

Benefits include: Three of four studies found that coniferous forest restored 1-2 years ago by burning (in combination with thinning) or burned once within the last 20 years had higher species richness of butterflies than unburned forest (action 3877). Two studies found that pine forest restored 1-2 years ago by burning (in combination with thinning) had higher abundance of butterflies than unburned forest (action 3877). The abundance of Karner blue butterflies increased over 2-3 years in oak savannas and prairies where unburned patches were left during prescribed burning (action 3879). Six out of nine specialist butterfly species were more abundant in pine barrens and prairies where unburned areas were left during prescribed burning compared to sites without unburned areas (action 3879). Negative impacts include: One study found that mixed forest and shrubland sites which had been burned the year before had similar butterfly species richness to unburned sites (action 3877). One study reported that in the spring after selective burning of eucalyptus forest there were fewer Eltham copper caterpillars than before (action 3877). The timing of prescribed burning affects outcomes, with one study finding that management of tropical savanna and floodplain with early season burning or no burning for 2-5 years increased caterpillar abundance, but management with late season burning did not (action 3878).

Protecting greenfield sites or undeveloped land in urban areas is effective, with studies showing protected native forest and grassland in urban areas had higher species richness of butterflies than urban parks or non-native plantations (action 3836). \n\nPlanting parks, gardens and road verges with appropriate native species significantly benefits butterfly and moth populations. Three of five studies found that gardens and road verges planted with native species had greater species richness of butterfly and moth adults and caterpillars than areas with mixed or exclusively non-native plant species. Two of three studies also found higher abundance of butterfly and moth caterpillars in gardens planted with native species (action 3842).\n\nWildlife gardening practices can provide benefits, with one study finding that gardens where insecticides and herbicides were not used had higher abundance of butterflies (action 3834). Similarly, stopping the use of pesticides as seed dressings and sprays in flower beds and greenspaces resulted in higher butterfly abundance when insecticides and herbicides were not used (action 3900).\n\nStopping herbicide use on pavements and road verges showed positive effects. One study found that restored roadside prairies where herbicide application was restricted had greater species richness and abundance of butterflies than verges with no restrictions on herbicide application (action 3899).\n\nAltering mowing regimes on greenspaces and road verges benefits butterfly and moth populations. Two studies found that less frequently mown or unmown urban greenspaces had higher species richness and diversity of butterflies and moths than more frequently mown areas. Additionally, unmown public parks and road verges had higher abundance of butterflies than regularly mown areas (action 3841).\n\nPlanting nectar flower mixtures/wildflower strips is effective for urban conservation. Eight of thirteen studies found that sown wildflower strips had higher species richness and diversity of butterflies and moths than conventional field margins, unsown margins, or cropped fields. Ten studies found that sown wildflower strips had higher abundance of butterflies than conventional field margins or unsown margins (action 3932).\n\nRestoring or maintaining species-rich grassland along road/railway verges provides significant benefits. Four studies found that restored roadside prairies and verges sown with native wildflowers had higher species richness and diversity of butterflies and moths than verges dominated by non-native vegetation.

      "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, several alternatives to prescribed fire exist for maintaining disturbance in forest habitats that benefit butterflies and moths:\n\n**Mechanical vegetation management:** Mechanically removing mid-storey or ground vegetation to create fire breaks has been shown to benefit butterflies, with cork oak woodlands having greater butterfly species richness and abundance when woody understorey vegetation was cleared more recently or regularly (Action 3881). Cutting heathland has demonstrated positive effects, with one study showing pine barrens managed by mechanical cutting had higher abundance of Karner blue butterflies than those managed by rotational burning (Action 3947).\n\n**Coppicing woodland:** This traditional management practice creates beneficial disturbance for butterflies and moths. Coppiced woodland supported different communities of moths and butterflies compared to unmanaged areas, with some studies showing greater species richness of butterflies in coppiced woodland than unmanaged woodland. The abundance of heath fritillary was higher in coppiced woodland than unmanaged woodland, and pearl-bordered fritillary populations were more likely to persist in coppiced woodland than mature conifer woodland (Action 3939).\n\n**Forest thinning:** Thinning trees within forests has proven effective for butterflies and moths. Coniferous woodland that had been thinned showed greater species richness and higher abundance of butterflies compared to unmanaged woodland. Partially-cleared forest plots had higher butterfly species richness than closed-canopy forest plots (Action 3940).\n\n**Creating forest openings:** Clearing or opening patches in forests benefits butterflies specifically. Cleared patches in forests had greater species richness of butterflies than unmanaged patches or closed canopy forest. Larger cleared patches supported higher species richness and abundance of butterflies than undisturbed forest. Various species including chequered blue, woodland brown, high brown fritillary, and small pearl-bordered fritillary showed higher abundance in cleared patches (Action 3938).\n\n**Selective logging practices:** Using selective or reduced impact logging instead of conventional logging provides benefits. Forests harvested by single tree selection maintained similar species richness of moths to other management approaches. Selectively logged forests had higher abundance of exposed moth caterpillars compared to clearcut forests (Action 3867). Group harvesting or thinning instead of clearcutting showed that thinned forests had higher species richness of macro-moths than patch-cutting or clearcutting (Action 3868).\n\n**Herbivore management:** Removing, controlling or excluding vertebrate herbivores can create beneficial conditions. Forest plots fenced to exclude non-native pigs and deer had greater species richness of butterflies and macro-moths than unfenced plots. Multiple studies showed higher abundance of butterflies, moths, and caterpillars in areas where herbivores were excluded or controlled (Action 3891).",

      "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from multiple studies, the most effective methods for reducing grazing intensity on grasslands to benefit butterfly populations include:\n\n**Seasonal removal of livestock**: Studies show that removing cattle or sheep during critical periods (summer, winter, or during peak flowering) increases butterfly abundance and diversity. Three controlled studies found grasslands where cattle or cattle and sheep were removed in summer, or sheep removed in winter, had higher abundance of butterflies and caterpillars than continuously grazed grasslands (Action 3960). However, effectiveness varies, with some studies showing similar species richness between seasonally managed and continuously grazed areas.\n\n**Reducing stocking density**: Eight replicated studies found that grasslands grazed with lower stocking densities of sheep, cattle, or mixed livestock had greater abundance of butterflies, moths, and their caterpillars than grasslands grazed at higher stocking densities (Action 3959). Five of eight studies also found greater species richness of adult butterflies, moths, and burnet moths at lower stocking densities. A European review reported that reducing grazing intensity benefitted 41 out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern.\n\n**Multiple low-intensity interventions**: Six of ten studies found that less intensively managed grasslands (combining reduced grazing, reduced fertilizer use, and modified cutting regimes) had higher species richness of butterflies and moths than conventionally managed grasslands (Action 3958). Three of four studies showed higher abundance of butterflies, micro-moths, and declining macro-moths in low-input grasslands.\n\n**Rotational grazing**: Mixed evidence exists for rotational grazing systems. Two of four studies found rotationally grazed grasslands had greater species richness and abundance of butterflies and burnet moths than continuously grazed grassland, though effectiveness varied by stocking density and year (Action 3965).\n\n**Complete grazing cessation**: Results are variable for completely stopping grazing. Six of twenty studies found grasslands abandoned for 1-25 years had higher abundance of butterflies and moths than grazed grasslands, but four studies found lower abundance in abandoned areas. The timing matters - butterfly density was highest in grasslands where grazing ceased 2-9 years ago compared to those abandoned longer or currently grazed (Action 3956).\n\nThe evidence indicates that moderate reductions in grazing intensity through seasonal removal and reduced stocking density are generally more effective for butterfly conservation than complete abandonment or very intensive management.",

Light sheep grazing on saltmarsh for 15-18 years increased species richness of micro-moths compared to moderately or heavily grazed marsh, while also increasing total abundance of micro-moths compared to ungrazed marsh (action 3944). Cattle or pony grazing on calcareous coastal dunes for 4-13 years maintained similar species richness of butterflies compared to unmanaged land or areas managed by cutting, while also increasing abundance of four out of 13 butterfly species and improving site occupancy by brown argus and Alcon large blue butterflies (action 3944). Upland rough grassland managed by livestock grazing had greater species richness and higher abundance of butterflies than improved grassland (action 3944).\n\nPrescribed fire management shows more variable effects on butterfly and moth populations. Four out of nine studies found that burning increased abundance of certain species including heath fritillary adults, marsh fritillary caterpillar webs, and Fender's blue caterpillars and eggs on heathland, fen meadows and prairies, while three studies found decreased abundance of other species including Brenton blue butterfly, rosy marsh moth caterpillars and regal fritillary adults (action 3882). Burning typically had neutral effects on species richness, with prairies and grasslands showing similar richness compared to unburned areas (action 3882). A European review found occasional burning benefitted 10 out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern (action 3882).\n\nRotational burning provided more consistent benefits than single burns, with prairies burned more than one to four years ago showing higher species richness and abundance of butterflies than recently burned areas (action 3883). Similarly, rotational grazing showed advantages over continuous grazing, with rotationally grazed grasslands having greater species richness and higher abundance of butterflies and burnet moths than continuously grazed areas (action 3965).

Two studies found that sites where invasive plants were removed by weeding or cutting and applying herbicide had greater species richness of butterflies than untreated sites (Action 3890). Four of six studies found that sites where trees and shrubs were removed or invasive plants were cut had greater abundance of Apollo butterflies, higher density of Fender's blue eggs, or higher total abundance of butterflies compared to untreated sites (Action 3890). Two studies found that sites where invasive plants were removed were used more by Fender's blue and frosted elfin butterflies than untreated sites (Action 3890). Additionally, removal of invasive plants allowed adults from two previously separated populations of Apollo butterflies to mix (Action 3890).\n\nExcluding vertebrate herbivores also benefits butterfly and moth populations. Two of four studies found that forest plots fenced to exclude non-native pigs and deer had greater species richness of butterflies and macro-moths than unfenced plots (Action 3891). Five of eight studies found that plots fenced to exclude deer, sheep, pigs and large herbivores had higher abundance of butterflies, moths, caterpillars, rare macro-moths and New Forest burnet moths than unfenced plots (Action 3891). A global systematic review found that reducing or removing grazing or browsing by wild or domestic herbivores in temperate and boreal forests increased the abundance of butterflies and moths (Action 3891). One study found that all Glanville fritillary caterpillar nests survived in grassland fenced to exclude sheep, compared to 88% in a grazed area (Action 3891).\n\nExcluding invertebrate herbivores shows similar benefits, with one study finding higher density of pearl-bordered fritillary butterflies at sites fenced to exclude grazing animals than at unfenced sites (Action 3885).\n\nExcluding native predators has mixed results for butterfly and moth survival. Three of five studies found that using mesh cages, net sleeves and sticky resin to exclude predators including birds, mammals, spiders and ants increased survival of large copper caterpillars, Boisduval silkworm eggs and caterpillars, and Appalachian brown eggs and juveniles, while two studies found no increase in monarch caterpillar survival (Action 3889).",

Density is critical - caterpillars have higher survival rates when reared at lower rather than higher density (Action 3916). The physical environment for overwintering also matters, as caterpillars kept in refrigerators had lower survival than those kept in environmental chambers or outside (Action 3916). \n\n**Host Plants and Food Sources**: The type and quality of host plants significantly impact success. Caterpillars fed different species of milkweed showed varying survival rates (Action 3916). Some species require specific plant combinations - Brenton blue butterfly caterpillars given only one plant species died, while those provided with multiple plant types survived (Action 3916).\n\n**Genetic and Population Factors**: Genetic diversity is crucial for long-term success. Populations kept in captivity for longer periods showed different characteristics - large white butterflies from populations kept in captivity for >25 years were heavier and had smaller wings than those from newer captive populations (Action 3916). Captive breeding can lead to potentially deleterious physiological or genetic changes, with evidence of reduced brain volume in captive birds and lower genetic diversity in captive populations compared to wild ones (Action 599).\n\n**Species-Specific Requirements**: Some species have complex ecological needs involving other organisms. Large blue and mountain Alcon blue caterpillars require specific ant species, with survival differing when reared in nests of different ant species (Action 3916). The presence or absence of ant queens affects caterpillar survival rates (Action 3916).\n\n**Release and Establishment Success**: Long-term persistence varies significantly - only 25% of captive-bred and translocated butterfly populations survived for >3 years, 38% died out within that time, and only 8% survived for >10 years (Action 3914). Success rates differ by life stage released, with releases as eggs, caterpillars, pupae and adults all showing different outcomes (Action 3914). Released populations sometimes require continued support through habitat management or supplementary releases to persist (Action 3914).",

Eight studies found that grasslands grazed with lower stocking densities had greater abundance of all butterflies, butterflies with grass host plants, moths, burnet moths, their caterpillars, or specific species than grasslands grazed at higher stocking densities (Action 3959). A European review reported that reducing grazing intensity benefitted 41 out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern (Action 3959).\n\nSeasonal livestock removal shows mixed results.

Three studies found that grasslands where livestock were removed seasonally had higher abundance of butterflies and caterpillars than grasslands grazed continuously, but three other studies found similar abundance between seasonal removal and continuous grazing (Action 3960).\n\nReducing mowing frequency demonstrates positive but variable effects.

Grasslands abandoned for 4-5 years had higher species richness of butterflies and day-flying moths than extensively grazed or commercially grazed grasslands (Action 3956). Grasslands abandoned for 1-25 years showed higher abundance of Scotch argus, butterflies and day-flying moths, nocturnal moths, and caterpillars compared to grazed grasslands (Action 3956). Abandonment increased abundance of woodland and hedgerow butterflies and burnet moths compared to managed grasslands (Actions 3956, 3957). Some grasslands abandoned for 2-9 years had higher butterfly density than those currently grazed (Action 3956). Temporarily abandoned grasslands or those uncut all summer showed higher abundance of all butterflies, 11 species of butterfly, Scotch argus adults and meadow neb moth caterpillars than annually mown grasslands (Action 3957).\n\n**Negative consequences of abandoning grassland management:**\nExtended abandonment periods showed negative effects. Grasslands abandoned for more than 10 years had lower butterfly species richness than those abandoned for 2-9 years or currently grazed (Action 3956). Grasslands abandoned for more than 20 years or many years had lower species richness of butterflies than grazed grasslands (Action 3956). Over 6 years of abandonment, butterfly communities became dominated by generalist species and species with fewer generations per year (Actions 3956, 3957).

Another study found that cleared patches had greater abundance of heath fritillary when assessed 2-4 years after clearance compared to patches cleared 7-11 years ago or patches in their first year after clearance (action 3938). A translocated baton blue butterfly population increased in number over two years following selective clearance of pines (action 3938).\n\nFor coppicing interventions, the timeframes show different patterns depending on species and management age. Studies found higher butterfly abundance in woodland coppiced 2-4 years ago compared to woodland coppiced 5-11 years or >15 years ago (action 3939). Heath fritillary abundance was higher in woodland coppiced 2, 5-7, or 12-15 years ago than in woodland coppiced >15 years ago (action 3939). Pearl-bordered fritillary and small pearl-bordered fritillary populations were more likely to persist for up to 20 years in coppiced woodland than in mature conifer woodland (action 3939). Moth abundance was found to be similar in woodland coppiced 1-4, 5-8 and 12-20 years ago (action 3939).\n\nFor thinning operations, positive responses were recorded one, two, and four years after management, with coniferous woodland having greater species richness and abundance of butterflies than before management or unmanaged woodland (action 3940). Recovery rates after different harvesting methods showed that moth species richness recovered at similar rates after group selection harvesting or clearcutting, but recovery in both was slower than after shelterwood harvesting (action 3868).\n\nNatural regeneration studies showed that butterfly abundance and species richness were highest 12-25 years after felling (action 3876), while forest restoration showed that 5-60-year-old restored forests had greater butterfly species richness than newly restored forests less than 3 years old (action 3936).",

      "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from 14 studies on clearing patches and 10 studies on coppicing in European forests and other regions:\n\nButterfly Communities: Both management practices generally benefit butterflies compared to unmanaged forests, but with different patterns. Cleared patches in forests had greater species richness of butterflies than coppiced woodland or closed canopy forest (Action 3938). However, coppiced woodland showed variable effects - one study found greater butterfly species richness in coppiced woodland than unmanaged woodland, while another found coppiced woodland had greater species richness than woodland coppiced over 15 years ago (Action 3939). For abundance, cleared patches managed with coppicing and grazing showed higher butterfly abundance than before management or unmanaged areas, with specific benefits for chequered blue, woodland brown, high brown fritillary and small pearl-bordered fritillary (Action 3938). Coppiced woodland also showed higher butterfly abundance than unmanaged woodland, with particular benefits for heath fritillary, and better persistence rates for pearl-bordered and small pearl-bordered fritillaries compared to mature conifer woodland (Action 3939).\n\nMoth Communities: The effects differ markedly between the two practices. Cleared patches in forests had lower species richness of moths than unmanaged patches or coppiced woodland (Action 3938). Additionally, wider rides in cleared areas had lower macro-moth abundance than standard width rides or mature forest (Action 3938). In contrast, coppiced woodland contained more unique macro-moth species than mature forest, though it had lower overall species richness and abundance than mature forest, with no change in abundance related to coppice age (Action 3939). Coppiced woodland of different ages supported different communities of moths and butterflies (Action 3939).\n\nTemporal Effects: Both practices show time-dependent effects. For cleared patches, butterfly species richness and abundance declined over the first three years after clearing, with patches cleared 2-4 years ago having greater heath fritillary abundance than patches cleared 7-11 years ago (Action 3938). For coppicing, the optimal timing appears to be 2-7 years post-coppicing for maximum butterfly abundance, with effectiveness declining after 15 years (Action 3939).",

      "relevant_summary": "Evidence for the success of re-establishing butterfly populations through translocation and captive-breeding programs shows mixed but promising results. For translocation within former range areas, 16 studies found that eight studies reported translocated populations of adult butterflies and Fisher's estuarine moth eggs persisted for 2-12 years and increased in abundance. However, one review across the UK and Ireland found that only 25% of translocated and released captive-bred butterfly populations survived for at least three years, 38% died out in that time, and only 8% were known to have survived for more than 10 years. The review also reported that translocated populations of large copper adults and/or caterpillars survived for up to 38 years but ultimately died out or had to be supplemented by further releases. For translocation outside known range, two of three studies reported that populations of Gillette's checkerspot, small skipper and marbled white persisted and increased in abundance over eight and 28 years respectively. For captive-breeding programs, six studies reported that captive-bred butterfly populations released as eggs, caterpillars, pupae and adults persisted for 2-28 years and increased in abundance. However, two studies reported that captive-bred large copper and belted beauty moth populations died out one, two or 12 years after release, or required further releases to survive. One replicated study found that three of 10 captive-bred barberry carpet moth populations established, and at least one persisted for five years. The same UK and Ireland review found identical survival rates for captive-bred populations as for translocated ones (25% survived >3 years, 8% survived >10 years). Studies also showed that large copper, large white and monarch butterflies were successfully reared in captivity for 12 generations or >25 years, and that survival rates in captivity varied significantly based on rearing conditions including temperature, ant species presence, and host plant species.",

      "relevant_summary": "The most effective field margin management strategies for increasing butterfly abundance in arable landscapes include several key approaches. Planting grass buffer strips around arable fields consistently increases butterfly abundance, with wider margins (up to 6 m wide) supporting higher abundance of habitat-sensitive butterflies than narrower margins (action 3982). Floristically enhanced grass buffers or wildflower strips have higher abundance of butterflies than standard grass margins (action 3982). Creating uncultivated margins around intensive arable fields also increases butterfly abundance compared to cropped field edges, with wider uncultivated margins supporting higher butterfly abundance than conventional margins (action 3981). Margins that are not cut, or only cut in spring and autumn, have higher butterfly abundance than margins cut in summer (action 3981). Sowing uncropped field margins with native wildflower seed mixes supports higher butterfly abundance than cropped field edges, grassy margins, or naturally regenerated margins, with perennial leguminous herbs being particularly important (action 19). Planting nectar flower mixture and wildflower strips consistently increases butterfly abundance compared to conventional field margins, unsown margins, cropped fields, and conventional grassland (action 3932). Field margins sown with wildflowers support higher butterfly abundance than grass-only margins (action 3932). Leaving headlands in fields unsprayed increases butterfly abundance compared to headlands sprayed with herbicide and insecticide (action 3898). Agricultural nectar and pollen mixes, particularly those containing perennial leguminous flowering plants, attract significantly more butterflies than naturally regenerated, grassy, or cropped field margins, though their value may degrade over time requiring re-sowing every few years (action 18). Natural regeneration of uncropped field margins also increases butterfly abundance compared to cropped margins, though effectiveness varies year to year (action 20).",

Regarding field size, four replicated site comparison studies found that arable and mixed farms and landscapes with smaller fields had a higher abundance of butterflies and burnet moths than areas with larger fields (Action 3974). Two of four studies found that arable farms in more diverse landscapes and landscapes with smaller fields had higher species richness of butterflies and burnet moths than areas with larger fields, while the other two found similar species richness between smaller and larger fields (Action 3974). One before-and-after study found that reducing field size by increasing the length of field edges on a farm, along with increasing meadow and field margin areas, increased the species richness of butterflies and burnet moths (Action 3974).\n\nFor margin width effects, five replicated site comparison studies found that wider grass margins up to 6 meters wide had greater species richness or diversity of butterflies, macro-moths and micro-moths than narrower or conventional width margins, although one study found similar species richness of macro-moths in wide and conventional grass margins (Action 3982). Three of seven replicated site comparison studies found that wider grass margins had higher abundance of habitat-sensitive butterflies, macro-moths and micro-moths than narrower or conventional width margins (Action 3982).
