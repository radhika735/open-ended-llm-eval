Using herbicide alone: Three randomized, controlled studies in the UK found that the application of herbicide reduced the biomass or cover of bracken, though one controlled study found that applying herbicide did not change the abundance of bracken (Action 1652). One systematic review found that the herbicide asulam reduced bracken abundance if applied repeatedly (Action 105). Cutting alone: Two randomized, controlled studies in the UK found that cutting bracken reduced bracken cover or biomass, while one controlled study found that cutting bracken did not decrease the abundance of bracken (Action 1653). The systematic review noted that cutting may be equally effective to herbicide application (Action 105). Combination of cutting and herbicide: Three randomized, controlled studies in the UK and Norway found that cutting and applying herbicide reduced bracken biomass or cover (Action 1654). One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK found that cutting bracken followed by applying herbicide increased plant species richness when compared with applying herbicide followed by cutting, suggesting the order of treatment matters (Action 1654). The evidence indicates that while all three approaches can reduce bracken, the combination method and the sequence of treatments may provide additional benefits for plant diversity.",

Two controlled studies in Denmark and the UK found that heather presence or cover was higher in fenced areas compared to unfenced areas (Action 1545). However, one site comparison study in the USA found that using fences led to decreased cover of woody plants, while three replicated, controlled studies in the USA and the UK found that fencing either had mixed effects on shrub cover or did not alter shrub cover (Action 1545). Additional effectiveness variations were observed in grass cover responses across countries: studies in the UK and USA found that fencing led to a decline in grass cover, while studies in the USA, UK, and Finland found that fencing did not alter grass cover, and studies in the USA and UK recorded an increase in grass cover (Action 1545). For forest sections, eight studies across Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Israel, New Zealand, Spain, West Africa and the USA showed that four studies found livestock exclusion using wire fences increased understory plant biomass, species richness, density and cover, while the other four studies found mixed effects or no effect (Action 1205).",

Adding mulch followed by seeding with shrub seeds increased the seedling abundance of one of seven shrub species in one randomized, controlled study in the USA, though it did not reduce grass cover (Action 1650).

Cutting bracken has been extensively studied, with one randomized, controlled, before-and-after trial in Norway and one randomized, controlled study in the UK finding that cutting bracken increased the cover or biomass of heather, though two randomized, replicated, controlled studies in the UK found that cutting bracken did not increase heather cover or abundance of heather seedlings (Action 1653). Cutting also showed mixed effects on plant diversity, with one study finding increased species richness of heathland plant species and another finding no change in species richness but increased species diversity (Action 1653). One systematic review found that cutting may be equally effective as herbicides (Action 105). Cut and burn methods have been identified as a potential intervention, though no studies have yet been found that evaluated this approach (Action 1655). Cutting followed by rotovating has been tested, with one controlled study in the UK finding that this combination did not increase total plant biomass or biomass of heather (Action 1656). The use of a 'bracken bruiser' mechanical device has been trialled, with one randomized, replicated, controlled, before-and-after, paired study in the UK finding that bracken bruising actually increased bracken cover and had no effect on the number of plant species or plant diversity (Action 1726).

While fencing has been extensively studied for livestock exclusion in shrublands, with multiple controlled studies showing that fences generally increased shrub cover, abundance, and biomass (Action 1545), these studies focus on livestock rather than human disturbance. Signs and access restrictions have been studied primarily for mammal conservation rather than vegetation protection, with studies showing increased use of areas by wildlife when human access was restricted (Action 2325, Action 2330). One study from Turkey found that fencing sea turtle nests combined with signs resulted in higher hatching success compared to areas with no protection measures (Action 3642).

Studies on reptiles found that forest fragments connected by corridors and isolated forest fragments had similar species composition, richness, and abundance in Brazil, while in Madagascar an area with hedges connecting different habitat types had more unique reptile species and reptile communities were more similar across habitat types compared to areas without hedges (Action 3663).

In Namibia, topsoil addition increased plant cover and number of plant species, though these remained lower than at undisturbed sites (Action 1686). When topsoil was added alongside seeding in the USA, it increased grass biomass but reduced forb biomass compared to topsoil alone (Action 1857). Organic matter addition showed mixed results: leaf litter addition in Brazil increased tree species richness, while in Costa Rica it decreased young tree density in forest gaps, with no effects under intact forest canopy (Action 1250). In Portugal, adding plant material to soil surface increased total plant cover (Action 1250). Various soil amendment approaches using composts and wastes were studied: Municipal waste composts in Spain greatly reduced soil loss and water runoff in semi-arid soils (Action 890). Organic processing waste composts applied at high rates improved soil structure and reduced soil loss but increased nutrient loss (Action 891). Manures and agricultural composts showed consistent benefits including higher microbial biomass, reduced soil loss and water runoff when combined with other treatments, higher soil carbon levels, and increased crop yields (Action 911). Mixed organic and inorganic amendments resulted in higher microbial biomass and activity, increased soil organic carbon, and improved crop yields (Action 902). Fresh plant material incorporation increased microbial biomass, reduced soil loss, increased soil nitrogen levels and carbon content, and improved yields (Action 910). Fertilizer application showed generally positive outcomes, increasing total plant cover, understory plant biomass, young tree size, and cover of artificially seeded species (Action 1248).",

In contrast, some interventions showed limited benefits: sowing seeds and planting individual plants together did not increase cover of native plant species compared to either method alone (Action 1700), and adding mulch to soil alongside planting/seeding did not increase shrub numbers or height of California sagebrush, though it did increase seedling numbers but not survival in one study (Action 1706). Adding mulch and fertilizer together showed no significant effects on seedling abundance or grass cover in most cases (Actions 1694, 1707).",
