Seed-eating birds were more abundant on uncut and ungrazed plots than on uncut and grazed plots (224). A replicated, controlled, randomized UK study found no difference in ground beetle abundance and diversity between cut and uncut headlands in the first two years, but higher species diversity in uncut plots in the third year; no studies were found assessing effects on mammals (132, 2400). Raising mowing/cutting height: A replicated, controlled study and a review from the UK found raised mowing heights benefited Eurasian skylark, including increased productivity, and a review reported raised cutting heights were less damaging to amphibians and invertebrates (138). However, a randomized, replicated, controlled UK trial found no effect of raised mowing height on numbers of foraging birds or invertebrates, and one replicated controlled study found no difference in invertebrate abundance (138). A UK review found raised mowing height may have increased skylark productivity but not enough to maintain the local population (222). On intensively managed UK grassland, plots cut to 10 cm had similar butterfly species richness and abundance to plots cut to 5 cm (3968).",

One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon.

    "relevant_summary": "Set-aside: Across 34 comparative studies, many found higher use or benefits for wildlife on set‑aside than cropped fields, including a UK systematic review showing significantly higher farmland bird densities on set‑aside in both winter and summer; however, some studies found mixed, no, or adverse effects, and skylark nesting success was higher in two UK studies but lower in one (156). Additional syntheses report that some species occur at higher densities or use set‑aside more than other habitats while some occur at lower densities; species richness was often higher on set‑aside than crops; waders and skylarks had higher productivity in three of four studies, though one found lower skylark productivity on set‑aside; naturally regenerated set‑aside tended to hold more birds and species than sown set‑aside; evidence on rotational vs non‑rotational set‑aside was mixed (175). For mammals, set‑aside did not increase small mammal or brown hare numbers relative to cropland or other non‑crop habitats, though wood mice used uncut set‑aside more after harvest (2377). For butterflies and moths, several studies found higher species richness and, in some cases, higher abundance on sown or naturally regenerating set‑aside versus cereal fields—especially with less competitive grasses—though other studies found similar richness or abundance to arable, pasture, or uncultivated habitats (3980). Conversion/reversion of arable to permanent grassland: Syntheses of multiple replicated studies found no clear benefits to birds, with one controlled before‑and‑after UK study reporting significant declines in grey partridge after reversion (561; 210). For butterflies and moths, 10 studies show restored grasslands can develop communities increasingly similar to high‑quality grasslands over the first decade; species richness was often higher than on conventional grassland or cultivated farms; abundance was sometimes higher than on conventional grassland or crop fields, though not always increasing with time since restoration; sowing with diverse mixes or with forbs/perennial mixes often increased richness or abundance compared with grass‑only mixes; some taxa increased while others decreased following schemes including grassland reversion (3929).",

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes. In one trial, these introduced species more commonly occupied the boxes than native bees.\\nA small trial tested three soil-filled nest boxes for the mining bee Andrena flavipes in the UK, but they were not occupied.\"\n}"

In grasslands restored from arable/bare soil, butterfly communities became increasingly similar to high‑quality grasslands over the first 10 years, species richness was higher on grasslands created <10 years ago than on those >20 years old, and in some cases the number of butterfly species on seeded grassland remained similar each year over a 10‑year period; some studies found moth abundance did not increase with time since restoration [3929]. For created/restored prairies, abundance of Fender’s blue eggs was greater 5–10 years after restoration than at 1–2 years, and similar to remnant prairies [3943]. Following tree and shrub removal on wet meadows, marsh fritillary caterpillar webs increased the next year [3971].",

For plants, several studies found AES maintained or had little/no effect on richness or diversity, some found increases, and some found decreases; Environmentally Sensitive Areas in England helped halt loss of semi-natural grasslands but were less effective at enhancing/restoring biodiversity, and flower abundance increased in some Estonian areas (Action 700). For invertebrates, results were mixed: some studies found maintenance or little/no effect and others found increases; bee responses were local rather than landscape-scale in a UK study (Action 700), with additional bee-focused trials across Europe showing both enhanced diversity/abundance under AES and cases with no enhancement, and two UK landscape-scale trials finding no enhancement of bumblebee populations (Action 24). For mammals, UK evidence showed one positive study and three with mixed effects depending on region or species (Action 700). For bats, UK studies reported no significant differences between AES and conventional farms in most cases, with some instances of lower activity on AES farms (Action 962). For amphibians, European evidence includes creation of breeding habitat or increased frog/toad populations in Denmark and Sweden, and higher amphibian species numbers and abundance in Dutch ditches under AES than in conventional management (Action 818). Baseline comparisons noted that some wildlife numbers were higher before AES implementation in certain studies, while two baseline datasets found no overall differences in birds or soil biota between AES and non-AES areas (Action 700).",

Six studies (including two replicated site comparisons) showed agri-environment schemes maintained or had little or no effect on some invertebrates in terms of diversity, abundance, species richness or bee colony growth. Five studies found increases in abundance or species richness of some invertebrates. A UK study found agri-environment scheme prescriptions had a local but not a landscape-scale effect on bee numbers.\\nFour studies (including two replicated site comparisons and a review) from the UK looked at the effects of agri-environment schemes on mammals.

For butterflies and moths under hedgerow management, 17 studies (mostly UK) showed that more structurally complex or tree-containing hedgerows and certain cutting regimes were associated with higher species richness/diversity and, in multiple cases, higher abundance of butterflies, moths, caterpillars, pupae, and brown hairstreak eggs, though several studies found similar richness or abundance under agri-environment or conventional management and some reported lower caterpillar abundance in managed versus remnant hedgerows [3975]. For planting new hedges, seven studies (UK, Ireland, Canada) on butterflies and moths found that established hedgerows often had higher species richness and abundance than beetle banks, crops, pasture, grass margins or field interiors, with one study reporting similar richness to grass banks and one behavior study showing moths tended to fly parallel to hedgerows [3976]. For bats, two UK studies on hedgerow management found more bat species and higher activity for some species along hedges trimmed ≥3 years prior compared to those trimmed the previous winter, while pipistrelle activity did not differ between hedges managed for wildlife on agri-environment scheme farms and conventional farms; no studies were found on planting new hedges for bats [1943, 1942]. For mammals under planting or maintaining hedgerows, three studies (UK, Switzerland) reported that retaining/enhancing hedgerows with other boundary features was associated with higher brown hare density in arable but not grassland sites, Irish hare numbers did not increase, and establishing hedgerows alongside arable land increased small mammal abundance [2383].",

    "relevant_summary": "Across Europe, many studies report higher densities, population sizes or more favorable trends of some birds on agri-environment scheme (AES) sites than on non-AES sites, though other studies found mixed or no effects; higher-tier management sometimes had higher bird numbers and siting of agreements influenced effectiveness [700, 172]. For bees, one UK study reported AES prescriptions had local but not landscape-scale effects on bee numbers, and two UK landscape-scale trials found bumblebee populations were not enhanced on farmland with AES compared to without [700, 24]. For butterflies and moths, farms managed under AES (including options such as uncropped cultivated margins and wild bird seed plots) sometimes had higher abundance of butterflies and micro-moths than conventionally managed farms, yet comparisons of farms with larger versus smaller areas of in-field AES options often showed similar butterfly richness or abundance; wider field margins increased butterfly richness or abundance in some years [3923, 3930, 3926]. For bats, replicated paired-site studies in the UK found overall bat activity or occurrence often did not differ between AES and conventional farms, and in some cases was lower on AES farms; hedges trimmed ≥3 years prior had more bat species recorded and higher activity for some species than hedges trimmed the previous winter [962, 1943]. In wetland-focused options, raising water levels in ditches or grassland was associated with increased bird numbers (including breeding birds), plant species favoring wet conditions, and invertebrate numbers or biomass, with a UK review indicating that more expensive options like water-level control were more effective for providing habitat for wading birds than easier options [121]. Overall, evidence indicates that while several farm-level AES options can produce local gains, landscape-scale responses vary by taxon and implementation extent or placement [700, 24, 3923, 3926, 3930, 962, 1943, 121, 172].",

Six studies (including three replicated controlled trials of which two randomized) found that excluding or delaying summer grazing increased plant species diversity, invertebrate abundance and benefited breeding Eurasian skylark. A review found a study that showed that removing autumn grazing after a silage cut increased the winter abundance of seed-eating birds. A review and a replicated controlled study from the UK\\u00a0found that reduced grazing intensity or seasonal removal of livestock increased the number of invertebrates, plant seed heads and foraging skylark, and that some bird species preferred plots with seasonal removal of livestock.\\nThree studies (including one randomized, replicated, controlled trial) from the Netherlands and the UK found no benefit to plants or invertebrates from reduced grazing intensity. One randomized, replicated controlled trial excluded grazing in autumn/winter and another study excluded grazing in the summer. A further study found that reducing grazing intensity throughout the year did not increase plant diversity.\\nNine studies from France, Germany and the UK reported mixed results for some or all species or wildlife groups considered (including one randomized, replicated, controlled trial and two reviews and a systematic review). Of these, eight studies found that reduced grazing intensity throughout the year benefited some species but not others, one found that the impact depended on the type of vegetation grazed, and one found benefits to bee and wasp abundance but not species richness. One study found that the response of birds to removal of summer grazing varied between functional groups and depended on time of year.

Raising water levels in ditches or grassland was associated with increased bird numbers in agricultural landscapes, and a Netherlands randomized, controlled study found water‑level raising accelerated establishment of vegetation typical of wet grassland, although one Netherlands study reported no effect on lapwing foraging rate and some studies found net plant species losses (ID: 121). Delaying mowing or first grazing dates increased breeding wading bird densities in studies that included the Netherlands, alongside other taxa benefits (ID: 131). Direct per‑clutch payments on Dutch farms showed limited evidence for population increases (no population effect in one study; slightly higher breeding densities but not higher overall numbers in another), yet were associated with higher hatching success of lapwing and black‑tailed godwit; combined with postponed agricultural activities, more birds bred on 12.5 ha plots compared to controls (ID: 146). Restoration or creation of traditional water meadows using techniques such as raising water levels, grazing, mowing, topsoil removal and species introductions had successes reported in multiple European countries including the Netherlands, though some studies noted reduced or limited success and incomplete restoration even after several years (ID: 119).",
