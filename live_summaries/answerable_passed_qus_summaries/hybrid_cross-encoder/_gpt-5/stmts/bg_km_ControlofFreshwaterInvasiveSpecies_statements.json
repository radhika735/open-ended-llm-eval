For water primrose, triclopyr TEA at 0.25% killed 100% of young cultivated plants within two months; glyphosate achieved 97–100% mortality when mixed with specific sticking agents (non‑oil based or TopFilm); halosulfuron‑methyl reduced coverage without apparent rice toxicity, indicating adjuvants, concentration, plant age, and crop selectivity considerations affect outcomes [1139]. Combining herbicides with mechanical removal improved control, with glyphosate plus a surfactant (Cygnet‑Plus) followed by mechanical removal yielding a 75% kill, and integrated programs reducing coverage by 85–90% [1140]. For skunk cabbage, outcomes differed by active ingredient and dose: one UK study reported both glyphosate and 2,4‑D amine killed all plants, while another found 2,4‑D amine at 9 L/ha eradicated plants but glyphosate was unsuccessful beyond limited growth reduction [1102].",
