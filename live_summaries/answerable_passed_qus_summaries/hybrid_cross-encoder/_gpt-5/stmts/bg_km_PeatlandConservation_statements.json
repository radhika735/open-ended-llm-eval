Programmes using multiple restoration interventions (excluding moss layer transfer) increased total moss/bryophyte cover, herb cover (including cottongrass and other graminoids), overall vegetation cover, and shifted communities toward those of natural bogs in some comparisons [1803]. Adding organic mulch after planting often improved outcomes, including higher survival of planted mosses or sedges, increased growth of transplanted sedges, greater vegetation cover (total, mosses/Sphagnum, or vascular plants) after 1–3 seasons, and higher germination for some species, though several studies reported no cover effects [1828]. Mulching without planting had limited effects on cover (no change in fen-characteristic plant cover or Sphagnum in two studies) but increased the number of fen-characteristic species present in one study [1813]. Disturbing the peat surface without planting altered community development, led to colonization by wetland/fen-characteristic species, but also promoted weedy species from the seed bank and did not lead to colonization by peat-forming species in one fen [1811].

Reducing grazing intensity: One replicated, paired, controlled study in UK bogs found greater total vegetation and shrub cover where grazing intensity was lower, with cottongrass cover greater for one species and unaffected for another, and higher vegetation biomass where grazing intensity was lower [1735]. Changing season/timing: No studies were found that evaluated effects on peatland vegetation of changing the season or timing of grazing [1737]. For comparison, excluding or removing livestock: Across ten studies (mostly in bogs, plus fens and an unspecified peatland), plant community composition showed no effect in one UK study and no effect in wetter areas but a shift toward dry moorland plants in drier areas in another UK study; herb cover typically showed no effect on key groups including cottongrasses (five of five studies) and sedges (two of two), with one poor fen in Spain reporting increased rush cover after cattle exclusion alongside other interventions and one Chilean site comparison reporting increased overall herb cover alongside other interventions; Sphagnum moss cover typically showed no effect in replicated studies in the UK and Australia, with one poor fen in Spain reporting Sphagnum appearing after exclusion and rewetting; shrub cover showed no effect in several replicated UK and Australian studies, increased heather cover in drier areas in one UK study, and increased shrub cover in three studies including UK bogs, USA fens, and a Chilean peatland; total vegetation, shrub, and bryophyte biomass increased while grass-like herb biomass did not change in one replicated, paired, controlled UK bog study [1734].",
