Using humans to assist migrating amphibians moved large numbers across roads, but studies reported 64–70% population declines over 6–10 years and over 500 toads still killed at 7% of sites [784]. Installing barrier fencing along roads, especially with culverts, decreased road deaths in seven of eight studies; at least 0.6 m height was required to prevent some frog species climbing over, though some species still climbed fences [756].

Culverts/tunnels were used by amphibians in 15 of 24 studies (15–85% of individuals or 3–15 species, or 23–100% of structures used), with usage influenced by factors such as diameter, length, lighting, substrate, water presence, and tunnel climate; many sites had barrier fencing guiding animals to entrances [884]. Some species can climb barriers: barriers ≥0.6 m were needed to prevent green and leopard frogs climbing, and treefrogs and 10% of common toads climbed over fences in some studies [756]. \n\nEvidence on road closures shows: Two studies in Germany reported that large numbers of amphibians were protected from death at road closure sites, including sites with assisted crossings and barrier fences [842]. Patrol-based assistance during migrations moved large numbers of amphibians (thousands to hundreds of thousands), but some monitored populations still declined by 64–70% over 6–10 years, and at 7% of UK sites >500 toads were still killed despite assistance [784].",
