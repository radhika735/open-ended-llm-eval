In the North Sea, fixed temporary closures had little effect on cod fishing effort, whereas real-time area closures reduced the annual amount of cod caught (retained and discarded) (2664). In targeted fisheries, catch rates of red mullet and total catch (fish and invertebrates combined) increased after temporary closures over 10 years, but not European hake (2664); another Atlantic before-and-after, site comparison found no change in cod catches over nine years (2664). During a grouper closure, spear-fisher catches of herbivores increased, indicating a shift in targeting (2664). Long-term closures: Across five studies, replicated before-and-after work in the Norwegian Sea found higher weights of young salmon (but similar or lower weights of older salmon) after long-term closure of a commercial coastal fishery, and more young salmon (but similar older salmon) returning to rivers compared to before (2655). Site comparisons found mixed abundance responses: higher abundance for only one of seven species and lower monkfish abundance inside year-round groundfish closures of six–eight years (2655). In the North Sea, lesser sandeel biomass and density peaked but did not show an overall increase three years after long-term closure, and annual sandeel catches varied after an indefinite closure (2655). Inside an area closed to customary fishing for eight years, six of seven species had reduced flight response distance (2655).

Protecting spawning fish from capture via seasonal or permanent closures shows mixed population outcomes: a North Atlantic before‑after comparison found no increase in cod spawning stock biomass, survival, or size and no change in commercial catches over nine years, while tracking showed substantial use of closed spawning/nursery areas by cod and juvenile sharks, and a seasonal grouper closure shifted spear‑fishing effort toward herbivores [2938]. Establishing temporary fishery closures similarly showed no cod biomass, survival, or size increase over nine years in one Atlantic study, but tagged cod spent about one‑third of time inside a seasonal spawning closure during implementation, real‑time area closures reduced annual cod caught, some targeted fisheries showed increased catch rates after closures, and spear‑fishers targeted herbivores more during a grouper closure [2664]. Areas allowing only periodic fishing had greater fish biomass than openly fished areas and similar biomass to permanently closed areas, with higher catch rates than open areas over 18 months to six years [2679].",
