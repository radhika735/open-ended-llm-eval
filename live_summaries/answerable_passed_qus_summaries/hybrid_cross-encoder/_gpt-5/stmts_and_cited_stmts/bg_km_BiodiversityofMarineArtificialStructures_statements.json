One study in Australia reported increased mobile invertebrate species richness on treated surfaces [3472]. For fishes, two of three Australian studies found no increase in species richness, while one found mixed effects depending on surface features and site [3472]. For abundance, one Australian study found no increase in combined macroalgae and invertebrates, and another found mixed effects depending on surface micro‑features [3472]. Invertebrate abundance responses were mixed; findings included increased non‑mobile invertebrate and oyster recruit abundance and decreased barnacle abundance in one study, and increased oyster and mobile invertebrate abundance in another [3472]. Fish abundance generally did not increase in two of three Australian studies, and in one study was similar regardless of groove/ridge size [3472]. Survival of transplanted invertebrates (including oysters) varied with species, site, and microhabitat features; oyster survival was higher in grooves than on ridges in one study, and survival in grooves/ledges varied by site in another [3472]. A behavioral study in Australia found no increase in time fishes interacted with surfaces or number of bites after transplanting oysters and/or coralline algae, though benthic fishes took more bites from surfaces with transplanted oysters than from those with algae plus oysters; these results held regardless of grooves/ridges [3472].",

Creating small adjoining cavities (‘swimthroughs’ ≤100 mm) had mixed effects on juvenile fish community composition, richness and abundance depending on site, month and development stage, but supported six species absent from structures without swimthroughs and were used by adult and juvenile fishes [3436]. Creating hole habitats (>50 mm), often combined with grooves, pits and environmentally-sensitive material, altered mobile invertebrate and fish community composition and supported fish species absent from plain surfaces; fish abundances showed mixed or no increases depending on study [3434]. Creating groove habitats (1–50 mm), often with other features, altered community composition and supported fish species absent from plain surfaces; fish abundances showed mixed effects [3448]. Creating pit habitats (1–50 mm), with other features, altered community composition and supported fish species absent from plain surfaces; fish abundances showed mixed effects [3455]. Creating long flexible habitats (>50 mm) had mixed effects on fish species richness and fish/seahorse abundance and were used by seahorses [3451]. Creating short flexible habitats (1–50 mm) had mixed effects on seahorse abundance [3450]. Using environmentally-sensitive material (e.g., ECOncrete or rock), often alongside added habitat features, supported fish species absent from standard surfaces and had mixed effects on fish abundance depending on species [3470]. Transplanting or seeding organisms (e.g., oysters) onto structures increased combined invertebrate and fish species richness and diversity and altered community composition; overall combined abundance did not increase, with effects varying among species [3471]. Managing or restricting harvesting around structures was associated with higher fish species richness, different fish community composition including species absent from unrestricted sites, and higher seabream abundance; total fish abundance responses varied and access restrictions did not fully prevent harvesting [3457]. Creating artificial reefs of different 3‑D structure/material often showed no differences in combined mobile invertebrate and fish richness or abundance between designs/materials [2259]. For several actions on subtidal structures—creating large/small ridges or ledges, crevice habitats, large protrusions, and reducing slope—no studies were found evaluating effects on biodiversity [3445; 3444; 3454; 3443; 3442].",

Creating pit habitats also shows broad support: several studies found altered combined macroalgae–invertebrate composition and many reported increases in richness/diversity, though responses of abundance were mixed and context dependent [3475]. Creating grooves yielded mixed outcomes: some studies recorded higher richness/diversity and increased combined abundance (often when combined with pits), while others found no change in community composition or richness [3473]. Creating hole habitats (>50 mm) increased combined macroalgae–invertebrate richness/diversity in all three studies that tested it (typically alongside pools or other microhabitats) and altered community composition when combined with grooves/ridges and modified materials; effects on abundance were mixed or null [3467]. Adding long or short flexible habitats altered surface community composition, but short flexible habitats reduced overall species richness and did not increase fish richness or abundance; effects on algal and invertebrate abundances were mixed [3460, 3459]. Creating small adjoining ‘swimthrough’ cavities (≤100 mm) did not increase richness or diversity and typically did not alter community composition, though abundance responses varied [3468]. Creating natural rocky reef topography did not increase combined macroalgae–invertebrate richness and produced mixed abundance effects [3435]. Reducing structure slope increased overall richness only when implemented together with created pools; algal and invertebrate abundances did not increase in controlled tests [3461]. Using environmentally-sensitive materials produced mixed results: some configurations (e.g., ECOncrete with added microhabitats) altered community composition and increased richness/diversity, while other material substitutions did not [3469].

For large swimthroughs (>100 mm), two studies found that adding them increased overall fish species richness and abundance on and around structures, supported fish species absent from structures without swimthroughs, and were used by juvenile spiny lobsters and groupers, sea firs, and adult fishes from five families [3456]. Intertidal: For small swimthroughs (≤100 mm), two studies found no change in mobile invertebrate community composition and no increase in combined macroalgae–invertebrate richness, while mobile invertebrate abundance increased in one study and invertebrate abundance varied with swimthrough size/arrangement in another [3468]. For large swimthroughs (>100 mm), no studies were found evaluating effects on intertidal structures [3438]. Overall, evidence shows fish-focused responses and some positive richness/abundance outcomes in subtidal settings, contrasted with limited or no richness/community effects and mixed abundance responses for intertidal invertebrates, and a lack of intertidal evidence for large swimthroughs [3436, 3456, 3468, 3438].",

(2) Creating grooves (sometimes with pits) increased combined macroalgae–invertebrate species richness and, in some cases, overall abundance; fish richness, abundance, and feeding bites increased when grooves were paired with pits; other studies found no increase in richness or abundance, and responses varied by site and configuration (3473). (3) Creating small protrusions increased combined macroalgae–invertebrate species richness, but did not alter community composition in one study; effects on overall abundance were mixed and sometimes non-significant (3462). (4) Creating small ridges/ledges showed mixed outcomes: one Singapore study found no change in community composition or richness with ridges alone, while another study that combined ridges with grooves, protrusions, and pits reported increased richness but site- and configuration-dependent composition and abundance; studies elsewhere reported grooves between ledges often outperform ledges themselves (3464). (5) Combining grooves with small ridges/ledges (and sometimes holes or pits) altered community composition in some Singapore studies, supported species absent from plain concrete, increased species richness in several cases, and yielded mixed effects on overall and group-specific abundances depending on groove/ridge size, shore level, covers, and site; some studies detected no increase in overall abundance (3474). (6) Using environmentally-sensitive materials (e.g., ECOncrete with added grooves/ledges/holes; reduced-pH or alternative concretes) in Singapore and the UK altered community composition and supported species absent from standard concrete and increased richness/diversity in one ECOncrete study, but other material trials showed no increase in richness and mixed or non-significant effects on algal and invertebrate abundances (3469). (7) Transplanting or seeding organisms on structures in Singapore found macroalgae had higher survival at mid- and high-shore than low-shore, coral and sponge growth varied by species, and broader studies reported mixed effects of transplanted oysters/algae on fish and invertebrate richness and abundance depending on grooves/ledges and site (3472).",

Creating groove habitats (1–50 mm) sometimes increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate richness/diversity, though several studies found no increase or mixed, site-dependent effects; grooves supported higher species richness than small ridges/ledges in some comparisons (3473). Creating small ridges or ledges (1–50 mm) did not generally increase combined richness and, in comparative studies, supported lower species richness than grooves; one study with multiple habitat types reported increased richness with mixed effects by size/arrangement and shore level (3464). Creating short flexible habitats (1–50 mm) decreased combined macroalgae, invertebrate and fish species richness during low tide in one study, with mixed effects on mobile invertebrates at high tide (3459). Using environmentally-sensitive materials showed mixed outcomes: ECOncrete with added grooves, small ledges and holes increased species richness and diversity in one study, while hemp-, shell-, or reduced-pH concrete alone did not increase combined richness; limestone-cement with pits, grooves, small ridges and texture had mixed, site-dependent effects (3469).",

      "relevant_summary": "In Australian estuaries, reducing the slope of intertidal artificial structures, alongside creating rock pools, increased combined macroalgae, invertebrate and fish species richness, but did not increase macroalgal, oyster or mobile invertebrate abundance on surfaces [3461]. Transplanting or seeding (e.g., oysters, coralline algae) supported species absent from untreated surfaces, produced mixed effects on combined macroalgae/invertebrate richness/diversity depending on site and surface features, increased mobile invertebrate species richness, and generally did not increase fish richness or abundance in two of three studies; fish interaction time did not increase, though benthic fishes took more bites from oyster-only transplants than from combined algae–oyster transplants [3472]. Creating hole habitats (often with rock pools or grooves/ridges) supported species absent from controls, increased combined macroalgae/invertebrate richness/diversity, did not increase invertebrate abundance in one study, had shore- and site-dependent effects on limpet abundance, and was used by sea slugs, urchins and octopuses [3467]. Creating short flexible habitats altered community composition, decreased combined macroalgae–invertebrate–fish richness at low tide, did not increase combined mobile invertebrate and fish abundance at low tide, and had mixed effects on macroalgal and invertebrate abundances; fish biting rates did not increase [3459]. Creating pit habitats altered community composition in some studies, increased combined macroalgae/invertebrate richness/diversity in several studies but not others, increased limpet and periwinkle richness with effects varying by pit arrangement, and produced mixed invertebrate abundance responses including increases for some barnacles and mobile invertebrates [3475]. Evidence gaps remain: no studies were found on creating crevice habitats or on controlling/removing non-native or nuisance species on intertidal artificial structures [3437, 3439].",
