Across additional studies that included shrublands among other habitats in the USA, Israel, Chile, Spain, and Australia, excluding grazers sometimes increased plant biomass, cover, or abundance, but some Australian studies found decreases under exclusion, and several US grassland studies found no differences; for diversity, some studies in Israel, Spain, and the USA found more species or fewer non-natives with exclusion, while other studies across Australia, Israel, Spain, and the USA found fewer species under exclusion, and some studies reported no differences or only changes in community composition [2292].",

Adding manure increased soil organic matter in several studies but showed mixed results in others; increased nitrogen and potassium in some comparisons with mixed effects on phosphorus; had mixed effects on soil pH; reduced erosion and increased soil stability in some studies; and increased carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions in individual studies (ID 1363). Mixing organic and inorganic amendments (e.g., manure with inorganic fertilizers) increased soil microbial biomass and activity, increased soil organic carbon and nutrient levels, improved dry-soil crack reduction relative to inorganic-only or no fertilizer, and increased maize yield in trials; manure alone also increased microbial biomass and organic carbon (ID 902). Green manures increased soil organic carbon and raised grain yields in controlled, randomized, replicated studies (ID 908). Incorporating fresh plant material or crop remains increased microbial biomass, improved soil structure in one study, reduced soil loss in one study with mixed erosion results elsewhere, increased soil nitrogen and sometimes reduced nitrate leaching when straw was incorporated, increased soil organic carbon and aggregation across multiple studies, and increased yields in individual trials (ID 910). Incorporating allelopathic plant residues sometimes reduced weeds but effects varied by timing, species and residue type; weed suppression often lasted only days to weeks; crop growth could be inhibited depending on timing; and yield responses ranged from positive to negative or mixed across studies (ID 728).",

Cutting followed by herbicide reduced bracken cover/biomass and increased heather cover in Norway, but a UK study found no change in heather biomass; one UK study reported no significant effect on cover of several plant species (1654). Cutting then rotovating did not increase total plant biomass or heather biomass in a UK study (1656). Using herbicide with leaf litter removal did not increase total plant biomass after eight years, but in three of six years heather biomass was higher than with herbicide alone (1660).
