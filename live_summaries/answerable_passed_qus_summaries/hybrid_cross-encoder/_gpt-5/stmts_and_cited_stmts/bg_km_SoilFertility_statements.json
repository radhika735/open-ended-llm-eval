Reduced tillage frequently maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure, with some studies finding higher nutrient retention; however, one controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till (while conventionally tilled soil lost more) and effects on soil nitrogen were mixed (906). For erosion, multiple replicated trials (including in Europe) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage, but no-tillage increased soil loss when crop cover was absent; delaying ploughing until spring in Denmark and Norway reduced soil loss and nitrate leaching (906, 712). Regarding soil water and drought-related properties, conventional ploughing and sub-soiling decreased soil crack size and increased infiltration and water content in replicated European and Indian trials (906). Compaction responses were mixed: some trials found reduced compaction under controlled traffic and reduced tillage, while others found higher compaction under reduced tillage (906). Yield responses varied: one Canadian study reported lower yields under minimum/no-tillage, a U.S. study found higher yields with subsoiling, and a Portuguese study found no yield effect of tillage treatment (906).

Including legumes in rotations increased the number of microbes and diversity of soil animals, including in Canadian trials; including forage crops reduced rainwater runoff and soil loss; crop rotation increased soil organic carbon, particularly with legumes; and several trials found increased soil organic matter, particularly when legumes were included (ID 857). Documented drawbacks or limitations include a study where pest populations increased under rotation, studies showing pest and yield responses that varied depending on the rotation used and other treatments, and a study reporting no effect in some cases (ID 719). One trial found lower soil organic matter with longer rotations (ID 857).",

Incorporating fresh plant material or crop remains (e.g., straw) increased soil nitrogen in multiple studies and one study found reduced nitrate leaching with straw incorporation, with soils tested including sandy loam [910]. Growing cover crops when fields are empty improved nutrient retention and one trial reported reduced nitrate leaching, with sandy-loam among the soil types covered [898]. Delaying ploughing until spring reduced nitrate leaching in site comparison studies that included sandy-loam soils [712]. Using a mix of organic and inorganic amendments increased nutrients present in soils in controlled, randomized, replicated trials, with sandy-loam among the soil types covered [902]. Adding mulch increased nutrient levels in one replicated study, with sandy loam among the soils studied [887]. Incorporating leys into crop rotation reduced undesirable nitrogen uptake by grasses on sandy-loam soils [900]. In contrast, a study on generally reducing fertilizer, pesticide or herbicide use found lower nutrient levels and yields in low-input systems on soils including sandy-loam [904].",

Planting or maintaining hedgerows was associated with higher brown hare density in arable sites but not grassland sites in one study, Irish hare numbers did not increase in another, and establishing hedgerows alongside arable land increased small mammal abundance (2383). Intercropping with tree lines (alley cropping) increased the diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in a sandy-loam context (903). One study found no difference in the number of flower species in hedgerows compared to weedy field edges, while implementation comparisons reported more plant species in narrow than wide hedgerows, higher plant cover in younger than older hedgerows, and higher cover of exotic plants than native plants in young hedgerows but not in old hedgerows (1415).",
