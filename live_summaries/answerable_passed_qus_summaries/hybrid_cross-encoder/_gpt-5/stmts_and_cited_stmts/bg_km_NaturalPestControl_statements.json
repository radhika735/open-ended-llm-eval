Delaying herbicide applications increased natural enemies in two randomized, replicated, controlled trials, though benefits differed among enemy groups and were fewer early in the season [774]. Broad reductions in chemical inputs often benefited invertebrates, but multiple studies also reported mixed, minimal or no effects [139]; specifically for butterflies and moths, reduced or less frequent chemical inputs were frequently linked to higher richness and/or abundance, with some studies finding similar levels to conventional management [3897]. Incorporating parasitism rates into insecticide thresholds produced acceptable pest damage levels, but effects on natural enemy populations were not monitored [726]. Experimental conversions to organic farming often increased natural enemies in 8 of 12 studies, but several studies found no, inconsistent or negative effects, and responses varied by enemy group and over time [717].",

Alley cropping: Across four replicated/controlled studies, effects on parasitism varied by site, date, pest stage or alley width, with two studies finding no effect; fungal infection effects were mixed and egg predation was lower in one study; natural enemies included more wasps and spiders but fewer ladybirds in one trial, with hedge tree types influencing some groups; pest numbers increased in two studies, decreased in one, and varied by group/year in another; crop damage increased in one study and showed no effect in another; weeds showed mixed responses; yields were lower in a USA study and similar or lower in a Philippines study; costs were lower but profits also lower in a USA study [718]. Hedges: Two studies (France, UK) found newly planted hedges had higher beetle/spider abundance, richness or diversity than crop fields or field margins, and vascular plant diversity was higher than in recently established grass margins; a review reported newly established hedges supported more ground beetles than older hedges; a literature review reported lower pest outbreaks with new hedges; arthropod diversity varied among seven hedge plant species; an unreplicated German study found 2/85 ground beetle species used new hedges as dispersal stepping stones and passive movers (e.g., snails) benefited most; local hawthorn provenance grew better and was more stock-proof than eight other provenances [538]. Additional hedge evidence: One RCT in China found no effect of hedges on spiders in crops; studies from France/China reported more natural enemies in hedges than adjacent crops or context-dependent effects by crop, hedge species and year; two RCTs (France, Kenya) found natural enemy abundance in hedges depended on shrub/tree species and varied among enemy groups; nematode responses to hedges in Kenya varied among groups; crops included barley, beans, maize and wheat [752]. Beetle banks: For adjacent crops, a review found predator increases, while individual studies showed time-dependent or no effects; two studies observed small/slow predator movements from banks to crops; greater beetle activity in fields did not improve predation in one study; on banks, four studies and a review found more invertebrate predators than in crops, though effects sometimes varied seasonally; compared with other refuge habitats, results ranged from more predators on banks (sometimes seasonally) to similar or lower numbers; pest reductions were greatest nearest banks or on banks in one RCT and a review, and a review found fewer pests in fields with banks; an RCT and a review indicated potential economic savings if banks prevent pests reaching spray thresholds or causing 5% yield loss; certain grass species supported higher predator numbers [729]. Beetle banks and Lepidoptera: compared to hedgerows, butterfly richness and adult abundance were lower on beetle banks, while beetle banks and agri-environment field margins had higher richness and abundance of micro-moths than conventionally managed margins; caterpillar abundance on beetle banks was similar to margins, crop fields and other edge habitats [3927]. Beetle banks and mammals: harvest mouse nest densities were higher on beetle banks than on field margins [2393]. Hedges and Lepidoptera: established hedgerows had higher butterfly and macro‑moth species richness than in‑field beetle banks, crops or pasture in three of four studies; butterfly/moth abundance was higher along hedgerows than beetle banks, grass margins without hedgerows, field interiors, or 5–10 m away from hedgerows in five of six studies; gorse, oak and blackthorn planted within hedgerows supported more arthropod species, including caterpillars, than commonly planted hawthorn; moths near hedgerows were more likely to fly parallel to them [3976].",

Manufactured attractive chemicals: Across a review and multiple studies from Africa, Asia, Australasia, Europe and North America, effects were mixed; parasitism increased in a review and two of five studies, while two studies found increases only for some chemicals, crops, sites or years, and one found no effect; one study showed faster pest location by parasites; one study found lower egg predation by natural predators; five of 13 studies found more natural enemies, while eight studies (including seven randomised, replicated, controlled trials) reported effects varied among enemy groups, sites or dates; four of 13 studies (including a meta-analysis) found increases for some but not all chemicals; dose–response findings were inconsistent across studies; pests were fewer in three of nine studies (one only at the egg stage), more in two studies and unchanged in four; crop damage was reduced by some chemicals in one study and unchanged in another; one study found higher wheat yields; crops included apple, banana, bean, broccoli, Chinese cabbage, cotton, cowpea, cranberry, grape, grapefruit, hop, maize, oilseed, orange, tomato, turnip and wheat (754). Related evidence on planting flower strips (non-crop plants): Three replicated studies found greater pest reduction or higher parasitism in fields/farms with planted flower strips; effects on crop damage and pest numbers were inconsistent across studies; several replicated/controlled studies found more natural enemies in fields with flower strips or within strips, and species attractiveness and flower diversity influenced responses (1400).",
