Predator control targeting mammals showed no significant effect on Hochstetter’s frog when rats were controlled, but survival of Maud Island frogs was significantly higher in a predator‑proof enclosure, and 58% of translocated Hamilton’s frogs survived their first year in a predator‑proof enclosure (839). Removing fish by catching increased abundance of salamanders or frogs and improved recruitment, survival and population growth rate of cascades frog in multiple studies, but had no significant effect on great crested newts in one UK case and did not increase green toad breeding success in Sweden, with fish persisting or being reintroduced (827).

Releasing captive-bred amphibians is another approach: one review found 41% of programmes showed breeding in the wild for multiple generations, 29% showed some breeding and 12% showed survival following release [871]; captive-bred frogs released as tadpoles, juveniles or adults established populations or stable breeding populations at 88–100% of sites in several studies (with some failures), and sometimes colonized new sites [870]; captive-bred salamanders/newts released at various life-stages established stable breeding populations in one study [874]. Head-starting (rearing eggs/larvae to later stages before release) has established breeding populations or increased populations in several cases, though results are mixed; many studies report successful metamorphosis, seasonal survival and breeding after release [881].
