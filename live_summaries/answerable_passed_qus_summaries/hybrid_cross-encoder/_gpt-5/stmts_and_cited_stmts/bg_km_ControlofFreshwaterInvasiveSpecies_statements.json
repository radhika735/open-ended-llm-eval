For parrot’s feather, lab and field results show differing efficacy by chemical and over time: endothall reduced growth in lab but field cover decreased only shortly after treatment before returning toward pre-treatment levels [1681]; dichlobenil reduced growth but was less effective than a 2,4‑D+MCPA mix at 8 days and early cover reductions often rebounded by 45 days [1699]; 2,4‑D reduced growth more than diquat, glyphosate, or imazapyr in lab, 2,4‑D amine reduced biomass in field, and combinations (2,4‑D+MCPA; 2,4‑D+carfentrazone‑ethyl) achieved higher short‑term reductions or elimination, though some advantages diminished by 45 days [1606, 1699]. Some herbicides (fluridone, clopyralid, copper chelate) did not reduce growth, while others (imazamox, imazapyr, flumioxazin, florpyrauxifen‑benzyl, glufosinate‑ammonium, glyphosate) reduced growth or biomass in certain studies [1699]. For water primrose, triclopyr TEA at 0.25% killed 100% of young cultivated plants within two months; glyphosate achieved 97–100% mortality when mixed with specific sticking agents (non‑oil based or TopFilm); halosulfuron‑methyl reduced coverage without apparent rice toxicity, indicating adjuvants, concentration, plant age, and crop selectivity considerations affect outcomes [1139]. Combining herbicides with mechanical removal improved control, with glyphosate plus a surfactant (Cygnet‑Plus) followed by mechanical removal yielding a 75% kill, and integrated programs reducing coverage by 85–90% [1140]. For skunk cabbage, outcomes differed by active ingredient and dose: one UK study reported both glyphosate and 2,4‑D amine killed all plants, while another found 2,4‑D amine at 9 L/ha eradicated plants but glyphosate was unsuccessful beyond limited growth reduction [1102].",

Heating water to above 36°C killed all shrimps after 15 minutes of exposure, and at above 43°C all shrimps died immediately (1092). For Asian clams, exposure to high salinities (18–34‰) caused 100% mortality in a controlled, replicated laboratory study (1115). Raising water temperature to 36°C or higher killed Asian clams within or after four days in a controlled laboratory study (1116).",

For water primrose, a controlled, replicated field study in China found a flea beetle caused heavy feeding damage in cages and was specific to prostrate water primrose and Indian toothcup [1135]; a replicated, before‑and‑after field study in the USA found that introducing flea beetles to a pond significantly reduced large‑flower primrose‑willow abundance [1135].",
