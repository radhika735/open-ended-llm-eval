On road verges and pavements, restricting or stopping herbicide use in restored roadside prairies was linked to greater butterfly richness and abundance and lower mortality risk than verges dominated by non-native grasses without restrictions; on transmission lines, unsprayed and unmown sites had similar butterfly richness but higher abundance of northern/pearl crescents than sprayed and mown sites, with similar total abundance [3899]. Altering mowing on greenspaces/road verges showed that less frequent or no mowing increased butterfly/moth richness and diversity; unmown parks and road verges/under power lines had higher abundance for all adult butterflies or for pearl/northern pearl crescents, while other species showed similar abundance; late-summer roadside mowing had more ringlets than mid-summer; less frequent or later mowing reduced numbers of butterflies killed by traffic; butterflies were recorded on verges mown once or twice a year and on unmown verges, but on mown verges they were only recorded where hay was removed [3841]. Restoring or maintaining species-rich grassland along verges (e.g., sowing native wildflowers, increasing larval host plants, plant species richness, and flowering plants) increased richness and sometimes abundance of butterflies, day-flying and burnet moths compared to non-native dominated verges; wider verges had higher richness and abundance; in Canada, mown or unmown verges and power-line sites had similar richness and abundance to remnant prairies; mortality risk was lower on restored prairie verges than non-native grass verges, but more dead butterflies/moths occurred on roads with tall meadow verges and with habitat in the central reservation; less frequent or later mowing reduced roadkill; monarch parasite loads on mown verge milkweed were similar to prairies [3854].

After stopping grazing, six of nine studies reported similar richness to grazed sites, one found greater richness than sheep-grazed grassland, two found lower richness after >5–20 years or many years, one found higher richness where grazing ceased 2–9 years ago than in >10-year abandonments or currently grazed, and three studies reported higher richness in grasslands abandoned 4, 5–10 or >10 years compared to extensively or commercially grazed, with similarity to lightly grazed in two cases (3956). For abundance, stopping mowing led to lower abundance in some studies, higher abundance in others, species-specific or habitat-shifted responses (woodland/hedgerow species increasing, grassland/farmland species decreasing), local extinctions in some cases (e.g., silver-studded blue), mixed species responses across regions, and time-since-abandonment effects (e.g., similar abundance after ~6 years but lower after >25 years with no caterpillars) (3957). After stopping grazing, six of 20 studies found higher abundance than grazed (sometimes only vs intensive grazing), four found lower, four found similar, four reported species-specific mixed responses, one found density higher 2–9 years post-cessation than in >10-year abandonments or currently grazed, local extinctions occurred for large blue and silver-studded blue in some meadows, species-specific responses included clouded Apollo being lower than lightly grazed but higher than heavily grazed, and one European review reported benefits for six of 67 species of conservation concern (3956).",

(2) Seasonally removing livestock (e.g., removing cattle in summer, not grazing silage fields in September, removing sheep in winter or during peak flowering) increased butterfly and caterpillar abundance in several replicated, controlled UK studies, while other studies found similar richness or abundance compared to continuous grazing (3960). (3) Using rotational grazing sometimes resulted in greater butterfly and burnet moth species richness and/or abundance than continuous grazing, including cases where rotational systems outperformed continuous grazing at higher stocking densities, though other studies found similar or mixed responses among species (3965). (4) Delaying cutting or first grazing dates (e.g., grazing commencing after mid‑June, cutting in July/September rather than May/June) was associated with higher abundance of butterflies, burnet moths and caterpillars in several studies, and one study reported higher abundance of clouded Apollo where grazing started after 15 June alongside lower stocking density (3967).

Abundance responses were mixed: higher abundance for large copper eggs and some butterfly species under cattle/pony grazing in fens and dunes, similar abundance to ungrazed in shrubsteppe, lower abundance in meadow steppe under livestock, and on saltmarsh light grazing increased total micro-moth abundance and some caterpillars compared to moderate/heavy grazing or ungrazed, though other caterpillars were lower under grazing than ungrazed; upland rough grassland had higher butterfly abundance than improved grassland (3944). Occupancy/use: brown argus and Alcon large blue were more likely to occupy grazed calcareous dunes and heathland than unmanaged or differently managed sites (3944). Prescribed fire in open habitats: Species richness of butterflies was often similar between burned and unburned shrubland plots and field margins; patch-burning in pastures yielded lower richness than rotational grazing, similar to some grazed/mown pastures, and higher than continuous grazing (3882). Abundance responses were mixed: increased abundance for heath fritillary adults, marsh fritillary caterpillar webs, and Fender’s blue caterpillars/eggs one or more years after burning compared to before or to unburned/grazed land, but decreased abundance for Brenton blue eggs/adults, rosy marsh moth caterpillars, and regal fritillary on burned sites versus unburned; some species (e.g., regal fritillary, arogos skipper) were less abundant on burned prairies than hayed/grazed, while generalists and some species (e.g., purplish copper) were more abundant on burned than hayed/grazed; one review reported occasional grassland burning benefitted 10/67 species of conservation concern (3882).

(2) Population persistence often required continued interventions such as captive-rearing of wild-laid caterpillars or supplementation by further releases (3914). (3) Survival and persistence varied with source and approach: translocated large copper caterpillars had higher survival than released, captive-bred caterpillars (3909), and released captive-bred large copper caterpillars had lower survival than captive, wild or translocated caterpillars (3914). (4) Life stage and context of release varied (eggs, caterpillars, pupae, adults), with reports of populations persisting 2–28 years in some cases, while others died out within 0–12 years or required further releases (3914; 3909). (5) Captive-rearing conditions affected survival and condition, including lower density improving survival, temperature (20 °C higher survival than 25 °C), ant colony context for myrmecophilous species (higher survival without queens or with winged females present), differences among ant species and among host plant species, and the origin of ants (from sites where parasitic butterfly species occur) influencing survival (3916). (6) Overwintering method during captive rearing influenced survival (lower in refrigerators than in environmental chambers or outside) (3916). (7) Diet and symbiont availability during captive rearing affected development and adult condition, including plant species provided and access to appropriate ant colonies (3916). (8) Long-term captivity influenced traits, with captive lines showing differences in body size and wing size, and differences in fecundity relative to more recently captive lines (3916). (9) Placement of parasitic blue butterflies into specific ant nests without queens improved caterpillar survival during translocation (3909). (10) Genetic considerations were noted, with a translocated population showing similar genetic diversity to its source after 19 years (3909). (11) There is no direct evidence evaluating the introduction of mated females to increase genetic diversity for butterflies and moths (3912).",

Moths recorded close to hedgerows were more likely to fly parallel to them than moths further away [3976]. Within planted hedgerows, gorse, oak and blackthorn hosted more species of arthropods, including caterpillars, than commonly planted hawthorn [3976]. Managing existing hedgerows to increase structural complexity or include trees was linked to higher species richness or diversity of butterflies and macro‑moths than simpler hedgerows without trees [3975]. Cutting regimes that allow incremental growth, cutting once every 2–3 years, or autumn cutting were associated with higher abundance of adult butterflies and moths, moth caterpillars and pupae, and more brown hairstreak eggs than annual, same‑size cutting, although in some cases caterpillar/pupa abundance was similar between regimes [3975]. Hedgerows kept 1–2 m tall had higher butterfly species richness than those kept below 1 m, while one study reported more adult butterflies in hedgerows maintained below 1 m; fields with larger‑volume hedgerows showed higher butterfly richness and abundance in one of two years [3975]. Hedgerows with trees or more complex structure had higher abundance of butterflies and pale shining brown moths, though some studies found similar total macro‑moth abundance with or without trees [3975]. Scalloped hedgerow edges supported more brown hairstreak eggs than straight edges, and field margins next to hedgerow trees had higher abundance of most shrub‑/tree‑feeding moth species than margins away from trees [3975].

Abundances in set-asides were sometimes higher than in cereal fields (especially in second-year or less-competitive grass mixes) but were frequently similar to arable fields, pasture, uncultivated field boundaries, or extensively farmed land; in one USA study, abundance was similar to native prairie in year one but lower thereafter [3980].

Species richness frequently remained similar to managed grasslands, sometimes increased after 4–10 years of abandonment or when meadows were left uncut for a summer, but was often lower after longer periods (e.g., >10–20 years or >50 years) or compared to traditional rotational mowing and burning [3956][3957]. Abundance responses were mixed: in some cases abandonment (from weeks to 25 years) increased total butterflies, day‑flying or nocturnal moths, Scotch argus, caterpillars, and small insects, and uncut or temporarily abandoned meadows had higher abundances than annually or frequently mown sites [3956][3957]. In other cases, abandonment for 1–20 years reduced overall butterflies or some species and caterpillars relative to mowing once or twice per year, with some time‑since‑abandonment effects (e.g., higher densities 2–9 years after cessation than >10 years or currently grazed) and species‑specific mixed responses [3956][3957]. Abandonment tended to increase woodland and hedgerow butterflies and burnet moths, but decrease grassland or farmland species, and extinctions of large blue and silver‑studded blue occurred in some abandoned meadows; heath fritillary abundance was similar around six years post‑abandonment but lower with no caterpillars after >25 years [3956][3957]. Behavioural/use responses included similar occurrence of hoary bell moth caterpillars and similar frequency of marsh fritillary webs in abandoned vs managed sites, but reduced occurrence of grizzled skipper and painted lady and increased occurrence of small pearl‑bordered fritillary in abandoned meadows [3956][3957].",
