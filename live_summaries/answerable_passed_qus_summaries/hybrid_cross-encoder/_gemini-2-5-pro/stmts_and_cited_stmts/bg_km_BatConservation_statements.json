Two before-and-after studies found more bats within two caves after the size of the gated entrances were increased (999). One replicated, before-and-after study found that installing cave gates resulted in population increases or decreased rates of decline for 13 of 20 colonies of Indiana bat (999). However, one site comparison study found that bats hibernating in a cave with a wall and gate over the entrance lost more body mass than bats in a nearby unmodified cave (999). In terms of behavioural changes, one study found that bats at cave entrances circled more and entered caves less after gates were installed (999). Another study found that fewer bats flew through cave gates when the spacing between horizontal bars was reduced (999). A further study found that significantly fewer bats emerged from a cave with a gate installed compared with a cave with a fence (999). One replicated, site comparison study in Spain found no difference in the population growth rates or occupancy of bats roosting in caves with and without cave gates (999). One study did find fewer bats in caves after gates were installed (999).

One study indicated that larger bat boxes had higher occupancy rates (1024). The material of the box also matters, with one study finding that resin boxes were occupied more quickly than wooden ones, and another showing higher occupancy in concrete boxes compared to wood (1024). Specific designs like rocket boxes, two-compartment boxes, and those mimicking tree trunks have proven effective, and different bat species may prefer different designs (1024).\n\nPlacement is also critical. The orientation of the box and its exposure to sunlight can affect occupancy (1024). While the effect of height is debated, with some studies showing it matters and others finding no effect, boxes on buildings were found to have higher occupancy than those on trees (1024). The surrounding habitat is a factor, with higher occupancy observed in farm forestry over native forest and in pine stands over mixed deciduous stands (1024). Additionally, higher success rates are seen when boxes are installed in areas where bats were already known to roost, and installing a greater number of boxes across a site increases the likelihood of occupation (1024).\n\nHowever, when creating alternative roosts as part of a development, bat boxes or bat lofts that were built to replace destroyed roosts were four times less likely to be used by returning bats than roosts that were retained during development (949).

In one instance, a bat gantry was not used at all, and in another case, a temporary gantry was used by three bat species or species groups, but almost half of the bats crossed the road at other locations (978).\n\nThe effectiveness of overpasses has been found to vary. In Australia, one study recorded the same number of bat species at an overpass as in the surrounding forest and bushland (977). However, studies in Ireland and France indicated that up to 75% of bats crossed the road at traffic level or other locations, despite the presence of overpasses (977). The design of the overpass appears to be a key factor, as a UK study found that an overpass with planters was used by two-thirds of crossing bats, whereas an unvegetated overpass was completely unused (977).\n\nUnderpasses and culverts are also used by bats for crossing roads, although the proportion of use varies, with some bats still choosing to fly over the road (976). The use of these structures is influenced by their type and height, the width of the road, and the composition of the surrounding landscape, such as the presence of forests and hedgerows (976).

      "relevant_summary": "Eight studies evaluated the effects of breeding bats in captivity. Six of these studies found that between 6% and 100% of female bats captured in the wild successfully conceived, gave birth, and reared young in captivity (2053). Two studies found that some bats born in captivity also successfully gave birth to live young (2053). Seven studies found that between 20% and 100% of bat pups born in captivity survived from 10 days to adulthood (2053). Four studies evaluated the effects of rehabilitating injured or orphaned bats. Two of these studies found that 70-90% of hand-reared pipistrelle bats survived for at least 4-14 days after release, and one study found that 13% of ringed, hand-reared bats were found alive in bat boxes 38 days to almost four years after release (2054). Another study found that two hand-reared orphaned bats survived for over three months in captivity and reached normal size after 60 days (2054). No studies were found that evaluated the effects of releasing captive-bred bats on bat populations (2039).",
