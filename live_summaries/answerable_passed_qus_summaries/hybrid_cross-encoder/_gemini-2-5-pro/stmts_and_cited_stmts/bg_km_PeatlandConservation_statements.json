In terms of benefits, studies have shown that burning can increase moss, lichen, and bare ground cover in the short term (1774). It can also increase cottongrass cover after 8-18 years and lead to a higher biomass of grass-like plants in frequently burned areas (1774). Prescribed fire can also be used to reduce the cover of heather and other shrubs or trees (1774, 1763). Some studies found it increased plant species richness and diversity (1763) and sedge/rush cover (1763). Additionally, leaving some areas unburned during prescribed burning was found to increase the abundance of Karner blue butterflies and other specialist butterfly species (3879).\n\nHowever, there are also negative impacts associated with this practice. Some studies found that burning reduced or limited plant species richness (1774) and resulted in lower total vegetation, shrub, and bryophyte biomass (1774). The effects on herbaceous plants can be mixed; burning was found to reduce purple moor grass and forb cover in some instances, while having varied effects on other grass-like plants (1774, 1763). In one study, burning had no effect on the cover of fen-characteristic mosses or herbs (1763). Another study reported that six out of nine specialist butterfly species were more abundant when unburned areas were left, suggesting a negative impact if the entire area is burned (3879).",

In a forested fen in the USA, cutting and removing trees was found to increase herb cover, biomass, and height, with no effect on shrub cover [1761].\n\nGrazing has been studied as an alternative, with varied outcomes. In Germany, one study found that grazed fen meadows had fewer fen-characteristic plant species and lower overall plant species richness compared to mown meadows, though another study reported similar abundance of characteristic plants between grazed and ungrazed areas [1762]. UK-based studies showed that grazing increased the cover of some herb groups, but could also reduce Sphagnum moss and shrub cover, although effects on shrubs were not consistent [1762].\n\nThe removal of plant litter is another option. However, two studies in Germany and the Czech Republic found that this action did not affect plant community composition [1760].

However, the use of inorganic fertilizers has been associated with increased growth of planted mosses, herbs, and trees, as well as an increase in vegetation cover in some cases (1826).\n\nLiming in peatlands without planting has been found to increase overall vegetation biomass, primarily of grass (1790). In planted areas, the effects of lime are varied. It has been reported to decrease the survival of fen herbs but increase the survival of fen mosses (1825). Similarly, while some studies have found that liming does not enhance the growth of planted vegetation and can even have a negative impact on certain moss and tree species, another study noted increased growth in planted fen mosses (1825).

However, the effect on mosses is variable, with one study reporting a reduction in forest-characteristic mosses, another a decrease in Sphagnum moss cover, and a third an increase in Sphagnum cover (1731). Tree removal was also found to increase total plant species richness in rich fens in two studies (1731).\n\nCombining tree removal with rewetting the peat can change the plant community to be less like drained, forested sites (1732) and increase the abundance of wetland-characteristic plants (1732). This combined approach has also been found to increase Sphagnum moss cover in some studies (1732) and reduce the cover of non-Sphagnum or forest-characteristic mosses (1732). The cover of herbs like cottongrasses and sedges was reported to increase in seven studies (1732). The impact on overall plant species richness from this combined intervention is mixed, with some studies reporting an increase and others no effect (1732).\n\nDisturbing the peat surface without planting can also influence the plant community. Two studies reported that this led to the colonization of wetland- or fen-characteristic plant species (1811).

In Germany, one study found that grazed fen meadows had fewer plant species and characteristic fen plant species than mown meadows, and the overall plant community differed between the two management types (1762). However, studies in the UK showed that grazing could increase plant species richness and the cover of some herb groups, while reducing the cover of purple moor grass and shrubs (1762). Conversely, some UK studies also reported that grazing had no effect on species richness, shrub cover, or the cover of fen-characteristic mosses, and that it could reduce Sphagnum moss cover (1762). Mowing has been shown to alter the plant community composition in fens and fen meadows (1759). Multiple studies found that mowing increased plant species richness and the cover of fen- or wet meadow-characteristic plants and mosses (1759). Mowing also generally reduced the cover of herbs like reeds and purple moor grass, though one study found it had no effect on overall herb cover (1759). The effect of mowing on vegetation structure and biomass has shown mixed results (1759). A single mow was found, in some cases, to have no effect on plant richness or the cover of characteristic plants and mosses (1759). The removal of plant litter, another management practice, was reported in one study to increase plant species richness and diversity in a fen meadow, while other studies found it had no effect on plant community composition, bryophyte cover, or vascular plant diversity (1760).",

The impact on vegetation cover also varies, with one study reporting no effect on vascular plant or bryophyte cover, while another observed an increase in Sphagnum moss cover and a reduction in purple moor grass (1770).\n\nThe timing of mowing can also be a factor. While one study in a UK fen meadow found similar changes in plant community composition regardless of the season, a study in the Netherlands reported that summer and winter mowing resulted in different plant community types (1771). In terms of species richness, summer-mown plots showed a greater increase compared to those mown in spring or autumn in one UK study (1771).\n\nWhen used to maintain or restore disturbance in fens with a history of such practices, mowing has been found to alter the plant community composition in six studies (1759).
