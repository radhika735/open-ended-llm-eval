For birds, benefits can include higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying dates, and shorter foraging distances (126). Some studies also found a greater abundance of birds like the Eurasian skylark, seed-eating songbirds, and gamebirds in late winter (126), as well as higher species richness or diversity for some bird groups in certain areas (211).

Specifically, research in Germany has shown that with consistent provision, the count of occupied nests can double in a span of three years (47, 80). For these measures to be effective, it is crucial that foraging resources are located within a 150 to 600-meter radius of the nests (47, 80). The design of the nest box is also a factor in its success; reed stem and wooden grooved-board boxes have been found to be more productive than options with plastic-lined holes or tubes made of plastic or paper (47). Conversely, the uptake of nest boxes by bumblebees is significantly lower, at a rate of 2% or less (80). There is a lack of evidence regarding the impact of introducing pre-stocked solitary bee nest boxes on farmland wildlife (81). For birds, providing nest boxes on agricultural land has been shown to boost the breeding numbers and clutches of species like the Eurasian kestrel and tree sparrow (155). These nest boxes on farmland have been observed to be inhabited by a variety of bird species, including the long-eared owl, common starling, tits, stock dove, jackdaw, Eurasian wryneck, and Eurasian hoopoe (155). The effectiveness of these bird nest boxes can be affected by their height and the availability of nearby pasture (155). Furthermore, a study focusing on European rollers in Spain noted a progressive increase in nest box use over time (494).",

These include increased species richness of plants (562), bumblebees (562), spiders (562), and rare arable plants (562). Studies have also reported an increase in the abundance of ground-dwelling invertebrates (562), ground beetles (562), and spiders (562). For birds, observed benefits include increased breeding population size for the stone curlew (562), hatching success for the northern lapwing (562), and nesting success for the Eurasian skylark (562). Lapwing plots have been found to be used for breeding by northern lapwing, Eurasian skylark, grey partridge, and yellow wagtail (562). Some studies also found an increase in the numbers of Eurasian thick-knee (213), and a higher abundance of butterflies and micro-moths (3923).\n\nHowever, there are also several observed drawbacks and neutral effects. Some studies found no effect on 11 out of 12 farmland bird species (562) or ground beetles (562), and no effect on grey partridge density (213). A lower number of seed-eating birds were found on fallow plots in two out of three regions in one study (562), and another study found fewer birds using plots than cropland in two out of three regions (213). For butterflies and moths, some studies found a similar species richness on farms with uncropped cultivated margins compared to conventional farms (3923), while another found a lower abundance of some butterfly species (3923). Additionally, pernicious weeds were found to be more common on uncropped cultivated margins than on other headlands (562), and a lower proportion of young grey partridges was found in areas with a high proportion of these margins (562, 213).",

These areas can provide benefits to farmland birds, plants, invertebrates, and mammals, including increased species richness of plants, bumblebees, and spiders, and an increased abundance of ground-dwelling invertebrates and ground beetles (562). Specifically for birds, benefits include increased stone curlew breeding population size, northern lapwing hatching success, and Eurasian skylark nesting success (562). Uncropped margins, whether naturally regenerated or sown with wildflowers, have been shown to support a higher abundance and, in some cases, higher species richness of foraging bumblebees compared to cropped edges (19, 20, 562). Sown wildflower margins with perennial leguminous herbs are particularly beneficial for long-tongued bumblebees (19).\n\nHowever, there are also limitations. The value of naturally regenerated margins for bees can be inconsistent from year to year and may rely on the presence of thistle species, which are often considered pernicious weeds (20). Some studies found no effect on 11 out of 12 farmland bird species or ground beetles, and one study found fewer seed-eating birds on fallow plots in two out of three regions (562). Pernicious weeds can also be more common on uncropped cultivated margins (562).
