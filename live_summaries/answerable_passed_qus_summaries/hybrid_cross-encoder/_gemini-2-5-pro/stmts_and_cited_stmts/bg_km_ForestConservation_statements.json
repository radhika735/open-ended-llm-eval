One study in a coastal swamp in Brazil indicated that adding manure to plots with planted tree seedlings had varied effects on survival and growth over three years, depending on the tree species and the amount of manure used (3311). Another study reports that the impact of soaking black willow cuttings before planting on their survival depended on the post-planting water regime; however, all cuttings soaked for 15 days died within 42 days of planting (3361). Seven replicated studies in peat swamp forests in Southeast Asia and bogs in Canada have shown that a majority of planted trees and shrubs survived over periods ranging from 10 weeks to 13 years (1820). Two studies in Canadian bogs reported conflicting results regarding fertilizer use: one found that it increased the survival of two tree species, while the other found it had no effect on three species and reduced the survival of one (1826). In the UK, Germany, and Canada, five studies in bogs indicated that fertilizer generally enhanced the growth of planted vegetation, including trees. However, in some cases, it had no impact on growth (1826). Another study in the Netherlands showed that liming typically lowered the survival of planted fen herbs after two growing seasons (1825).",
