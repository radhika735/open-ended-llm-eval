In contrast, for small ridges or ledges (1–50 mm), one of two studies found no increase in combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness [3464]. Furthermore, two studies revealed that small ridges or ledges supported lower species richness compared to the grooves created between them [3464].\n\nRegarding population abundance, creating large ledges with grooves and small protrusions was shown to increase the combined abundance of macroalgae, microalgae, and invertebrates in one study. Two studies also found that creating large ledges or ridges with other features increased the abundance of mussels or limpets, but not barnacles [3465]. For small ridges or ledges, one of two studies found no increase in the combined macroalgae and invertebrate abundance, and another study noted they supported lower mobile invertebrate and oyster abundances than the grooves between them [3464]. When small protrusions, ridges, or ledges were created along with grooves, the effects on combined species richness and diversity were mixed, with some studies showing an increase and others showing mixed effects depending on factors like depth, height, shore level, and location [3474]. Similarly, the impact on the abundance of invertebrates was also mixed under these conditions [3474]. One study reported that creating large ledges along with grooves and small protrusions increased the feeding activity of juvenile salmon [3465].",

Transplanting oysters has been found to support macroalgae, mobile invertebrates, non-mobile invertebrates, and fish species that were not present on surfaces without the transplanted oysters (3472). However, the effect of transplanting oysters on combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness and diversity is mixed, depending on the site and other physical characteristics of the structures (3472). While transplanting oysters was found to increase mobile invertebrate species richness, it did not increase fish species richness or abundance in most cases studied (3472). Creating hole habitats on these structures, in conjunction with other features like rock pools or grooves, has been shown to alter the overall community composition and support macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate species that were absent from surfaces without these features (3467). This creation of habitats also led to an increase in the combined macroalgae and invertebrate species diversity and richness (3467). However, creating hole habitats did not increase macroalgal or invertebrate abundance in some studies, though the holes were used by sea slugs, urchins, and octopuses (3467). In one study, reducing the slope of an intertidal artificial structure, along with creating rock pools, increased the combined macroalgae, invertebrate, and fish species richness on the structure (3461). However, reducing the slope did not lead to an increase in the abundance of macroalgae, oysters, or mobile invertebrates (3461).",

In contrast, another study revealed that the introduction of grooves and small ledges enhanced the richness of mobile invertebrate species (3474). However, a separate study indicated that creating grooves and small ridges had inconsistent impacts on the species richness of mobile and non-mobile invertebrates, with the effects varying based on the size of the grooves and ridges, as well as the specific location (3474). Furthermore, five out of seven replicated, randomized, and controlled studies reported that the creation of groove habitats and small protrusions, ridges, or ledges on intertidal artificial structures produced mixed effects on the abundance of mobile invertebrates. These effects were contingent upon various factors, including the depth and height of the grooves and ridges, the existence of large ledges or water-retaining and light-shading covers, the shore level, and the specific site (3474). Additionally, two studies observed that while the creation of grooves and small ridges or ledges boosted oyster abundance, it did not have the same effect on the abundance of mobile invertebrates (3474).",

These features also supported non-mobile invertebrate species that were absent from surfaces without added habitat features (3452). A separate study found that creating grooves and small protrusions had mixed effects on community composition, depending on the orientation of the structure's surfaces (3452). One replicated study in Spain reported that groove habitats and small protrusions on subtidal artificial structures were colonized by macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrates (3452). A study of a sunken oil rig in the Mediterranean Sea recorded that at least 53 invertebrate species had colonized the structure after 30 years, including 14 species of molluscs, 14 species of worms, and 11 species of crustaceans (2262). In contrast, a replicated, randomized, controlled study in Italy discovered that creating natural rocky reef topography on subtidal artificial structures did not increase the abundance of juvenile canopy macroalgae that settled onto the structure's surfaces (3446).",
