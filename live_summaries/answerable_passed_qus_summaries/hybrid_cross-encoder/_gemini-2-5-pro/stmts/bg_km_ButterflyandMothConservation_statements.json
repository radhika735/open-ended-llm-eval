      "relevant_summary": "Ten studies evaluated the effects of coppicing on butterflies and moths, eight in the UK, one in France, and one in Germany [3939]. Fourteen studies assessed the impact of clearing or opening patches in forests on butterflies and moths, with five in the UK, two in Finland, two in Japan, one in Sweden, one in the USA, one in Canada, one in the Czech Republic, and one review across Europe [3938]. Six studies investigated the effects of thinning trees on butterflies and moths, with three in the USA and one in each of Côte d’Ivoire, Finland, and the Czech Republic [3940].\n\nThree replicated studies in the UK, Japan, and the Czech Republic found that cleared forest patches had a higher species richness of butterflies but a lower species richness of moths than unmanaged areas or closed-canopy forests [3938]. Similarly, a study in the Czech Republic showed that partially-cleared forest plots had more butterfly species but fewer moth species than closed-canopy forests [3940]. One study in the UK discovered that wider woodland rides and coppiced woodland hosted more unique macro-moth species than standard-width rides or mature forest [3938, 3939]. Another UK study found that coppiced woodland had a greater butterfly species richness than unmanaged woodland, while a separate study noted lower macro-moth species richness in coppiced woodland compared to mature forest [3939]. The species richness and diversity of fruit-feeding butterflies were similar between a thinned forest and an unmanaged one in Côte d’Ivoire, although rarer species were less common in the thinned forest [3940]. In the UK and France, moth and butterfly communities differed in coppiced woodlands of varying ages [3939].\n\nFive studies in the UK, Finland, Sweden, and Japan revealed that cleared forest patches had a higher abundance of butterflies, including species like the chequered blue, woodland brown, high brown fritillary, and small pearl-bordered fritillary, compared to unmanaged or coppiced areas [3938]. Conversely, a UK study indicated that wider rides had a lower abundance of macro-moths than standard-width rides or mature forest [3938]. Four studies in the USA and Finland found that thinned coniferous woodland, sometimes combined with other management like prescribed burning, had a higher abundance of all or specialist butterflies than unmanaged woodland [3940]. Two UK studies reported a higher abundance of butterflies in general, and the heath fritillary in particular, in coppiced woodland versus unmanaged woodland [3939]. However, another UK study observed lower macro-moth abundance in coppiced woodland compared to mature forest, with no change based on the age of the coppice [3939]. The timing of management is also a factor, with one UK study showing that patches cleared 2–4 years prior had a greater abundance of heath fritillary than patches cleared 7–11 years ago or within the first year of clearance [3938]. Similarly, studies in the UK, France, and Germany found butterfly abundance to be higher in woodland coppiced 2, 2–4, 5–7, or 12–15 years ago than in areas coppiced 5–11 or more than 15 years ago [3939]. A review across Europe reported that clearing small forest patches benefited 19 out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern [3938]. Finally, a UK study reported an increase in breeding sites for the pearl-bordered fritillary and Duke of Burgundy in cleared forest patches that were also managed with cutting, grazing, and ride widening [3938].",

Two studies found that less frequently mown or unmown urban greenspaces had a higher species richness and diversity of butterflies and moths than more frequently mown areas (3841). Unmown public parks and road verges also had a higher abundance of all adult butterflies (3841). One study reported that roadsides mown in late summer had more ringlet butterflies than those mown in mid-summer (3841). Furthermore, road verges mown less frequently or later in the summer had fewer dead butterflies killed by traffic (3841). One study found that scarce copper butterflies more frequently occupied less frequently mown urban grasslands (3841). However, one study found that the management of road verges and land under power lines did not affect butterfly species richness (3841). In the Netherlands, one study noted that butterflies were only recorded on mowed verges where hay was removed (3841).\n\nRegarding herbicide use, one study in the USA found that restored roadside prairies with restricted herbicide application had greater butterfly species richness and abundance and a lower butterfly mortality risk compared to verges dominated by non-native weeds and grasses with no herbicide restrictions (3899).

Releasing captive-bred individuals has led to populations persisting for 2-28 years and increasing in abundance (3914). However, other studies show populations dying out within 1-12 years, with one review indicating that only 25% of released populations survive for more than three years, and only 8% for more than ten years (3914). Similarly, translocated populations have been reported to persist for between 2 and 49 years, while others have died out in as little as 0-7 years (3909). The success of these programs can be dependent on continued releases to supplement the population (3914, 3909). \n\nHabitat management at the release site is a significant factor. Practices such as coppicing, selective felling, planting, fencing, host plant translocation, invasive plant removal, sheep grazing, and scrub clearance have been associated with the persistence and increased abundance of translocated populations (3909). For example, captive-bred pearl-bordered fritillaries released into coppiced woodland successfully bred at least once (3914). The life stage at which individuals are released varies, with releases of eggs, caterpillars, pupae, and adults all being recorded (3914). The specific conditions of the release site are also important; for instance, the survival of large blue caterpillars was higher when they were translocated into nests of the ant Myrmica sabuleti that did not have a queen present (3909). Comparative studies have found that translocated large copper caterpillars had a higher survival rate than captive-bred ones (3909), and that released, captive-bred large copper caterpillars had lower survival rates than their captive, wild, or translocated counterparts (3914). Nineteen years after translocation, a population of large blue butterflies in the UK showed similar genetic diversity to its Swedish source population (3909). Following a release of captive-bred large coppers, the number of eggs laid per female increased over the first three years (3914).",

Hedgerows with a more complex structure, such as those with trees, have a higher diversity of butterflies and moths (3975). Management practices like cutting hedgerows less frequently (every 2-3 years), cutting in autumn, or allowing for incremental growth can increase the abundance of butterflies, moths, and their caterpillars (3975).

Different aged coppiced woodlands supported different communities of butterflies and moths (3939).\n\nFor species richness and diversity, cleared patches in forests showed a greater species richness of butterflies but a lower species richness of moths when compared to unmanaged patches, coppiced woodland, or closed-canopy forests (3938). One study noted a decline in butterfly species richness over the first three years after clearing (3938). In contrast, coppiced woodland was found to have a greater species richness of butterflies than unmanaged woodland (3939). However, it also had a lower species richness of macro-moths than mature forest, and the age of the coppice did not affect this (3939). Another study found that woodland coppiced two years prior had a greater butterfly species richness than woodland coppiced more than 15 years prior (3939). The species richness of moths was similar in woodland that was coppiced 1-4, 5-8 and 12-20 years ago (3939).\n\nRegarding population abundance, cleared forest patches that were also coppiced and grazed had a higher abundance of butterflies in general, including species like the chequered blue, woodland brown, high brown fritillary, and small pearl-bordered fritillary, compared to unmanaged or solely coppiced areas (3938). However, the abundance of butterflies in these cleared patches declined over the first three years after clearing (3938). Larger cleared patches supported a higher abundance of butterflies than undisturbed forest (3938), while wider rides had a lower abundance of macro-moths than standard width rides or mature forest (3938). In coppiced woodlands, a higher abundance of butterflies, particularly the heath fritillary, was observed compared to unmanaged woodland (3939). Populations of pearl-bordered fritillary and small pearl-bordered fritillary were also more likely to persist in coppiced woodland (3939). Conversely, the abundance of macro-moths was lower in coppiced woodland than in mature forest, with no change in abundance based on the age of the coppice (3939). The timing of coppicing was also a factor, with higher butterfly abundance found in woodlands coppiced 2, 2-4, 5-7, or 12-15 years ago compared to those coppiced 5-11 or over 15 years ago (3939). After coppicing along with other management like scrub control and grazing, the abundance of high brown fritillary and small pearl-bordered fritillary increased (3939). Across Europe, clearing small patches in forests was reported to benefit 19 out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern (3938).",
