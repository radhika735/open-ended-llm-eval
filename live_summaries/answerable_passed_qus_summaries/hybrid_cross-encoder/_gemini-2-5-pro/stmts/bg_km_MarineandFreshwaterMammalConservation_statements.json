Four of these studies, conducted in the North Atlantic Ocean, the Reloncav√≠ fjord, and the Mediterranean Sea, found that using acoustic devices at salmon farms reduced predation on caged salmon by grey seals, harbour seals, and South American sea lions, or decreased the number of harbour seals approaching a fish cage. However, two other studies reported that acoustic devices did not lessen harbour seal predation at salmon farms, nor did they affect the presence, approach distances, group sizes, or time that common bottlenose dolphins spent around fin-fish farms [2775].\n\nIn comparison, thirty-three studies have examined the effects of acoustic devices on fishing gear [2808]. Within this body of research, twelve of sixteen controlled studies on behaviour change showed that these devices led to harbour porpoises, common bottlenose dolphins, tuxuci dolphins, finless porpoises, and seals approaching nets less, having fewer interactions with them, or showing reduced activity in the vicinity. Four studies, however, found no significant behavioural effect on common bottlenose dolphins, harbour porpoises, Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins, or dugongs [2808]. Additionally, nine of fourteen studies on bycatch found that acoustic devices on fishing nets or traps resulted in fewer collisions of humpback whales or entanglements of harbour porpoises, Franciscana dolphins, beaked whales, and small cetaceans [2808]. On the topic of human-wildlife conflict, five of six studies found that acoustic devices reduced damage to fish catches and fishing nets caused by common bottlenose dolphins and seals [2808]. One study showed no reduction in damage to swordfish catches by California sea lions [2808].",

Nine studies also found that using acoustic devices on fishing nets or traps resulted in fewer entanglements or collisions of various marine mammals, including whales, porpoises, and dolphins. However, three other studies found that the devices led to fewer entanglements for some species but not others, and one study found a reduction in one fishing area but not another (2808). In terms of behavior, twelve of sixteen studies found that acoustic devices on nets caused porpoises, dolphins, and seals to avoid the gear, while four studies found no significant effect (2808).\n\nRegarding vessels, one controlled study found that common bottlenose dolphins avoided a boat more frequently when acoustic devices were deployed. Another found that killer whales were recorded further from a fishing vessel using an acoustic device, but this effect diminished over time. However, a randomized, controlled study in the North Atlantic found that using two types of acoustic devices did not reduce predation of squid catches by Risso‚Äôs dolphins (2815).\n\nFor moorings, one randomized controlled study in the Puntledge River found that deploying an acoustic device on a mooring reduced the number of harbour seals feeding on migrating juvenile salmon (2816). Other studies found mixed results on behavior, with some showing reduced activity of seals, porpoises and dolphins, while others found no effect on humpback whales. One study also noted that porpoises' probability of approaching a device increased over a period of 10-11 days (2816).",
