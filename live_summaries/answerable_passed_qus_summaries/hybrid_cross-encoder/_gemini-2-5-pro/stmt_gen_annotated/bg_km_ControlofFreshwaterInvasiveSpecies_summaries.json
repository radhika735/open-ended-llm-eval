A study in the Netherlands found that manual removal of mature skunk cabbage plants was effective for a small outbreak of a small-growing plant [1101]. However, a study in Germany reported that after the first four years of a twice-yearly full removal programme of skunk cabbage, a large number of plants still needed to be removed each year [1101]. In contrast, a study in Western Australia found that following a two-week program of physical removal of floating pennywort, the rate of growth exceeded the rate of removal [1126]. A study in the UK, found that removal using a mechanical digger and monthly picking by hand greatly reduced the cover of floating pennywort but did not completely eradicate it [1126].\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"1101\",\n    \"1126\"\n  ]\n}"

Another study in Australia showed that combining herbicide application, physical removal, and other actions like promoting native plants and mulching, led to an 85-90% reduction in Peruvian primrose-willow coverage (1140). In brackish/salt marshes in the USA, physically removing pepperweed from plots that had been sprayed with herbicide increased the cover of native plants over two years when compared to only spraying with herbicide (3092). For crayfish control, a study in a Swiss pond demonstrated that introducing predators combined with trapping significantly reduced red swamp crayfish populations (1031).

Other herbicides, such as dichlobenil, imazamox, imazapyr, flumioxazin, and florpyrauxifen-benzyl, have been found to reduce the growth of parrot's feather in laboratory studies (1699). In field studies, glyphosate and gluphosinate-ammonium reduced parrot's feather biomass (1699). However, fluridone, clopyralid, and copper chelate did not reduce growth in laboratory studies (1699). For water primrose, a combination of glyphosate, a surface active agent, and subsequent mechanical removal resulted in a 75% kill rate (1140). Another study found that a combination of herbicide application, physical removal, and other methods like promoting native plants and mulching, reduced Peruvian primrose-willow coverage by 85-90% (1140).

In the UK, using a mechanical digger and monthly hand-picking significantly reduced the cover of floating pennywort, but did not lead to complete eradication (1126). A combination of cutting and glyphosate chemical treatment was successful in removing floating pennywort in one before-and-after study (1128).\n\nFor water primrose, a study in the USA found that hand pulling and raking did not reduce its abundance in a large population, but hand-pulling did eradicate a smaller population from the margins of a pond (1138). A combination of glyphosate application and mechanical removal resulted in a 75% kill rate (1140). Another study showed that a combination of herbicide, physical removal, promoting native plants, and mulching reduced Peruvian primrose-willow coverage by 85-90% (1140).",

A repeat treatment of 3 seconds after 11 days proved fatal to the plant (1131). In Western Australia, a combination of cutting followed by glyphosate chemical treatment was successful in removing floating pennywort (1128). Several studies in the UK on Crassula helmsii found that applying glyphosate reduced the plant. A combination of glyphosate and diquat reduced C. helmsii by 98%, and covering the plant with a carpet before glyphosate treatment resulted in an 80% reduction (1279). Applying diquat or diquat alginate was found to reduce or eradicate submerged C. helmsii (1279). Other herbicides such as dichlobenil, terbutryne, asulam, 2,4-D amine and dalapon also showed some success in reducing C. helmsii (1279). For skunk cabbage, one UK study found that both glyphosate and 2, 4-D Amine killed all plants in test areas. However, another UK study found that while 2,4-D amine was successful in eradicating skunk cabbage, glyphosate was unsuccessful, with only a limited reduction in plant growth (1102).",

When the temperature was increased to over 43°C, all the shrimp died instantly [1092]. Regarding the use of salinity, one of two replicated laboratory studies, one of which was controlled, in Canada and the UK, showed that an increase in water salinity led to the death of the majority of invasive shrimp within five hours.
