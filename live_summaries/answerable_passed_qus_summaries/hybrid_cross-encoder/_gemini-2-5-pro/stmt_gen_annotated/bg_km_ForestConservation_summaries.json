In contrast, a replicated, before-and-after trial in Finland revealed that ploughing reduced the coverage of plants on wood surfaces [1251]. Furthermore, two replicated, controlled studies in Ethiopia and Sweden showed varied effects of tilling on different tree species [1251]. A replicated, randomized, controlled study in the USA demonstrated that mulching the ground after planting boosted total plant cover [1240]. Five of six studies, including two replicated, randomized, controlled studies, in Brazil, Canada, Finland, France, and the USA showed that thinning trees after planting improved the survival and size of the planted trees [1261]. Finally, a replicated study in the USA indicated that the survival rate of red oak seedlings rose with the size of the thinned area [1261].\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"1251\",\n    \"1240\",\n    \"1261\"\n  ]\n}"

Additionally, a study in Hong Kong noted that tree guards led to increased tree height after 37 months, but this effect was not observed at 44 months (1268). In Panama, a replicated, controlled study demonstrated that shading improved the survival rate of planted native tree seedlings (1269). One study in a coastal swamp in Brazil indicated that adding manure to plots with planted tree seedlings had varied effects on survival and growth over three years, depending on the tree species and the amount of manure used (3311). Another study reports that the impact of soaking black willow cuttings before planting on their survival depended on the post-planting water regime; however, all cuttings soaked for 15 days died within 42 days of planting (3361). Seven replicated studies in peat swamp forests in Southeast Asia and bogs in Canada have shown that a majority of planted trees and shrubs survived over periods ranging from 10 weeks to 13 years (1820). Two studies in Canadian bogs reported conflicting results regarding fertilizer use: one found that it increased the survival of two tree species, while the other found it had no effect on three species and reduced the survival of one (1826). In the UK, Germany, and Canada, five studies in bogs indicated that fertilizer generally enhanced the growth of planted vegetation, including trees. However, in some cases, it had no impact on growth (1826). Another study in the Netherlands showed that liming typically lowered the survival of planted fen herbs after two growing seasons (1825).",
