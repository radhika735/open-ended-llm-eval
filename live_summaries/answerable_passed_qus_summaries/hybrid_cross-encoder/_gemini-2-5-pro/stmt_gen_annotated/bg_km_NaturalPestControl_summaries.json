Two studies found mixed effects of organic farming and two randomised, replicated, controlled studies found no effect. Natural enemies: Eight of 12 studies (including six randomised, replicated, controlled tests) from Europe, North America Asia and Australasia found more natural enemies under organic farming, although seven of these found effects varied over time or between natural enemy species or groups and/or crops or management practices. Three studies (one randomised, replicated, controlled) found no or inconsistent effects on natural enemies and one study found a negative effect. Pests and diseases: One of eight studies (including five randomised, replicated, controlled tests) found that organic farming reduced pests or disease, but two studies found more pests. Three studies found mixed effects and two studies found no effect. Crop damage: One of seven studies (including five randomised, replicated, controlled tests) found less crop damage in organic fields but two studies found more. One study found a mixed response and three studies found no or inconsistent effects. Weed seed predation and weed abundance: One randomised, replicated, controlled study from the USA found mixed effects of organic farming on weed seed predation by natural enemies. Three randomised, replicated, controlled studies from the USA found more weeds in organically farmed fields, but in one of these studies this effect varied between crops and years. One study found no effect. Yield and profit: Six randomised, replicated, controlled studies measured yields and found one positive effect, one negative effect and one mixed effect, plus no or inconsistent effects in three studies.

Four studies were conducted, with two indicating varied outcomes, one reporting no change, and another finding higher yields when insecticides were applied during periods of anticipated crop vulnerability (723). When pesticides are used only after pest or crop damage reaches a certain threshold, two out of four studies found yields to be comparable to conventional spraying methods, while the other two noted mixed results depending on factors like location, year, and pest type (750). In contrast, a study on isolating beneficial ant colonies reported an increase in cashew yields (773). Delaying herbicide application resulted in lower yields in one study, and no effect in another (774). The use of push-pull cropping systems, which combine trap and repellent crops, was found to increase yields in four out of five studies (753).\n\nThe impact on pests and their natural enemies also varies. Earlier insecticide application was linked to a higher presence of natural enemies and, in two of four studies, a reduction in pests or disease-related damage (723). Threshold-based pesticide use was found to boost the populations of natural enemies in two out of three years, though these effects were sometimes short-lived (750). Isolating beneficial ant colonies led to more trees being occupied by these predatory ants and a decrease in pest-related damage (773). Delayed herbicide use was associated with an increase in natural enemies, but also more weeds (774). Push-pull systems were found to have more natural predators and increased parasitism of stem borer larvae (753).",

    "model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro",

    "relevant_summary": "Several studies have documented the financial impacts of various natural pest control strategies, primarily focusing on crop yield. The use of crop rotations has been found to result in higher crop yields in some instances when compared to monocultures (1354). Similarly, adding compost to the soil has led to higher crop yields in some comparisons (1346), and in one case, fewer dead tomato plants (1392). The addition of pig slurry to the soil has also been associated with higher crop yields in some studies (1349).\n\nThe effects of other strategies have been more varied. For example, while planting flowers has been shown to increase crop yields in certain situations (1360) and lead to greater pest reduction (1400), it has also been linked to increased pest numbers and crop damage in other cases (1400), and smaller lettuces in one study (1360). The use of organic fertilizer has an inconsistent effect on yields, with some studies reporting higher, lower, or similar yields compared to inorganic fertilizers (1350).\n\nDifferent tillage practices also show mixed results. Reduced tillage has been found to lead to higher, lower, or similar yields depending on the type of crop (1359). Similarly, studies on no-tillage systems have reported a range of outcomes, with yields being higher, lower, or the same as conventional tillage depending on the specific circumstances (1355, 1358).\n\nThe use of ground cover has also shown variable results. While allowing natural ground cover to regenerate can have mixed effects on pest populations (720), planting or maintaining ground cover in orchards and vineyards has been found to decrease grape and avocado yields in some studies, while increasing chestnut and mushroom yields in others (1352). Furthermore, growing cover crops in arable fields has been found to result in lower, inconsistent, or no difference in cash crop yields in a number of studies (1351).",

One study from the UK found that new populations of rare arable plants established following the control of perennial weeds in a nature conservation area. A replicated, controlled and randomized study in the UK found that using grass-specific herbicide reduced grass diversity and resulted in increases in broadleaved plants. \\nEleven studies investigated different methods of controlling plants. A review found that specific management regimes can reduce the abundance of pernicious weeds in nature conservation areas. Four replicated controlled studies (one also randomized) from Denmark and Germany found cutting and infection with fungal pathogens were effective methods for controlling creeping thistle and one replicated, randomized, controlled trial from the UK found long-term control was achieved by lenient grazing. A replicated, controlled and randomized study in Germany found weevils could be used to infect creeping thistle with systemic rust. One study found a non-native beetle was unsuitable for controlling creeping thistle because it had poor survival in the UK climate. A replicated controlled study found that spraying a high concentration of herbicide killed less than half of broad-leaved dock plants. A replicated, controlled, randomized study found black grass was eliminated with a December treatment of grass-specific herbicide. A small replicated study found that Hebridean sheep grazed more purple moor grass than Swaledale sheep.\\nTwo\\u00a0replicated controlled laboratory and grassland studies found negative impacts of the herbicide asulam on green dock beetles.\"\n}"
