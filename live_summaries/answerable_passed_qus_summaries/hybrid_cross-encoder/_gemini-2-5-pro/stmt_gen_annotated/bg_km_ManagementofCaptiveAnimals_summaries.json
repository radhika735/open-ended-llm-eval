For cheetahs, a commercial diet resulted in a similar likelihood of developing gastritis as those fed horse meat, but with lower levels of blood protein urea and higher levels of creatine (1900). Also for cheetahs, a commercial meat diet or whole chicken carcasses resulted in plasma a-tocopherol, retinol and taurine concentrations within the ranges recommended for domestic cats (1900). For leopards, providing Jerusalem artichoke as a supplement increased two types of gut microbiota, faecal scores and faecal moisture content (1905).

For female amphibians, hormone treatment has had mixed results, with some studies showing that it stimulated egg production or successful breeding, while others found it did not (883). In addition to hormone treatment, environmental manipulations have also been found to be effective. The reproductive success of frogs in captivity has been found to depend on temperature or a simulated wet and dry season (835).
