Allowing natural regeneration of ground cover beneath perennial crops (action ID 720) showed mixed results with some studies finding more natural enemies in natural ground cover. Retaining or creating hedgerows (action ID 2314) was found to increase the ratio of natural enemies to pests and provide more natural enemies in fields.

Converting to organic farming (action 717) decreased profit unless premium prices were received, with one study finding net profit increased only if produce received a premium, but otherwise profit decreased. Using pesticides only when pests reach threshold levels (action 750) showed mixed profit effects, with two of three studies finding similar profits compared to conventional spraying, but effects varied between sites and years. Incorporating allelopathic plant remains for weed control (action 728) showed negative effects on crop growth, with two of three studies finding crop growth was inhibited by allelopathic plant remains, though this could be minimized by changing timing of application. Delayed herbicide use (action 774) resulted in lower yields in one randomized, replicated, controlled study, while another study found no effect. Using organic fertilizer instead of inorganic (action 1393) led to more aphids in some comparisons, potentially increasing pest pressure.",

Growing cover crops in arable fields can help reduce weed numbers, with studies showing fewer weeds in plots with cover crops compared to plots without them, though effects can vary between different cover crop types and conditions. Crop rotations have been shown to reduce weed biomass, particularly when using sequences like canola-wheat compared to wheat-wheat sequences. Farmers can also grow competitive plants such as clovers, fescues, ryegrass, and turnip to reduce weed weight, ground cover, reproduction, and survival. Converting to organic farming generally results in more weeds, but this system promotes natural weed seed predation by beneficial organisms. For specific weed problems like creeping thistle, biological control methods including cutting, infection with fungal pathogens, and use of weevils to infect plants with systemic rust have proven effective. Cultural practices like lenient grazing can also provide long-term control of certain weed species.",

Planting flower strips increased natural enemy numbers in fields compared to fields without flower strips, with studies from Italy and the USA showing more natural enemies and more species of natural enemies in planted flower strips than on bare ground. Creating beetle banks resulted in more invertebrate predators on beetle banks than in surrounding crops, with some studies also finding increased predator numbers in adjacent crop areas. Leaving parts of crops unharvested or uncut led to increased abundance of predatory insects or spiders in crop fields, with three studies (including one replicated, controlled trial) finding this effect. Planting hedgerows resulted in more natural enemies in fields with hedgerows compared to fields with weedy edges, with one study also finding a higher proportion of pest eggs were parasitized in fields with hedgerows. Maintaining ground cover in orchards or vineyards through cover crops led to more natural enemies in plots with ground cover compared to plots without ground cover in four replicated, controlled studies from Spain and the USA. Additionally, growing non-crop plants that produce chemicals attractive to natural enemies resulted in higher numbers of natural enemies in three out of four studies, and allowing natural regeneration of ground cover beneath perennial crops showed mixed but generally positive effects on natural enemy populations in five studies.",

Push-pull systems, which combine trap and repellent crops, increased parasitism of stem borer larvae and resulted in more natural predators overall, according to studies from Kenya and South Africa (Action ID: 753). Creating beetle banks led to more invertebrate predators and the largest pest reductions in areas closest to beetle banks, with studies showing economic savings when pest control prevented reaching spray thresholds (Action ID: 729). Using chemicals to attract natural enemies showed positive effects in multiple studies, with some chemicals increasing parasitism rates and attracting more natural enemies, though results varied by chemical type, crop, and location (Action ID: 754). Genetically modified maize expressing Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki (Btk) toxin targeted European corn borer (Action ID: 3895). Altering the timing of insecticide use showed mixed results, with one study reporting more natural enemies when insecticides were applied earlier rather than later in the growing season (Action ID: 723).

    "relevant_summary": "The evidence base for actions that increase pest parasitism rates in perennial crops includes several key approaches. Studies show that excluding ants from trees resulted in greater parasitism of pests in some trials, as ants can protect pest insects from natural enemies (Action 886). Leaving parts of the crop or pasture unharvested or uncut has demonstrated increased predation and parasitism rates of pest eggs in unharvested strips, with one replicated, controlled study from Australia showing these benefits (Action 725). Incorporating parasitism rates when making insecticide spraying decisions has been shown to maintain acceptable levels of crop damage while reducing unnecessary pesticide applications, as demonstrated in a controlled study from New Zealand on tomatoes (Action 726). Growing non-crop plants that produce chemicals that attract natural enemies has proven effective, with four studies from China, Germany, India, and Kenya finding decreased pest populations or damage when such plants were present, though effects on parasitism specifically varied (Action 724). Planting hedgerows has shown promise, with one replicated, paired site comparison from the USA finding that a higher proportion of pest eggs were parasitized in fields with hedgerows compared to fields with weedy edges, though this effect was only observed up to 100 meters into the crop (Action 1401). Using mass-emergence devices to increase natural enemy populations showed mixed results, with one randomized, replicated, controlled study in Switzerland finding higher parasitism at one site but no effect at another site (Action 775).",

    "relevant_summary": "Allowing areas of natural or unmanaged vegetation to persist within perennial crops or pastures has multiple documented effects. Natural regeneration of ground cover beneath perennial crops can provide habitat for natural enemies (predatory insects and spiders), with some studies finding more natural enemies in natural ground cover compared to bare ground, though effects vary between different groups of natural enemies (Action 720). Planting flowers or maintaining flowering strips within agricultural areas increases the abundance and species richness of butterflies and moths (Actions 3932, 442), with 23 studies showing that sown wildflower strips had higher species richness and abundance of butterflies compared to conventional field margins or cropped fields. \n\nFor pest regulation, maintaining ground cover in orchards and vineyards can increase natural enemy numbers, with four studies finding more natural enemies in plots with ground cover compared to bare plots (Action 1395). However, effects on pests are mixed - some studies found fewer pests in areas with natural vegetation while others found variable effects depending on pest species (Action 720). Planting flower strips can enhance pest regulation, with three studies showing greater pest reduction or higher proportions of parasitized pests in fields with planted flowers (Action 1400).\n\nLeaving part of crops or pastures unharvested or uncut provides important habitat, with three studies finding increased abundance of predatory insects or spiders, and five studies finding more predators in the unharvested areas themselves (Action 725). Growing native trees within perennial crop plantations can increase butterfly diversity, with one study in Costa Rica finding higher diversity in coffee farms with both native and non-native tree species compared to farms with only non-native trees (Action 3920).",

While push-pull systems (Action 753) showed promising results, they had higher production costs in the first year of implementation. Planting flowers for pest regulation (Action 1400) showed mixed effects on crop damage, with one study finding more caterpillar damage in tomatoes next to planted flower strips compared to bare ground, and another study finding more pests on tomatoes next to planted flower strips.

Planting flower strips and wildflower margins increases natural enemy numbers, with studies finding more natural enemies in fields with planted flower strips compared to fields without them, and more species of natural enemies in flower strips than on bare ground (2313, 3932). Leaving part of the crop or pasture unharvested or uncut can increase natural enemy abundance, with studies finding more predatory insects or spiders in the unharvested or unmown areas themselves (725). Planting nettle strips in field margins can provide refuge for aphid predators, with studies finding higher numbers of aphid predator species on nettle strips, including green lacewings which were only found on nettles (118). Grass buffer strips and margins planted around fields can also serve as refuge habitat (246). Conservation headlands, where field margins are left unsprayed within crops, provide alternative refuge habitat, though specific effects on natural enemies were not documented in the available evidence (29, 2540).",

    "relevant_summary": "In perennial crop systems like orchards, several interventions have shown effectiveness for reducing pest populations. Planting or maintaining ground cover in orchards and vineyards has been extensively studied, with research showing that plots with cover crops can increase natural enemy numbers, with four studies finding more natural enemies in plots with ground cover compared to plots without ground cover. Ground cover management can also reduce pest numbers, with two studies finding fewer leafhoppers in plots with cover crops, and fewer pests found in plots with mown ground cover compared to unmown ground cover. Managing ant populations is another effective strategy. Excluding ants that protect pests can enhance biological control, with one study finding greater parasitism of pests by natural enemies when ants were excluded from trees, and three of seven studies found fewer pests when ants were excluded. Additionally, isolating colonies of beneficial ants can increase predatory ant occupation of crop trees and result in lower pest damage and higher yields, as demonstrated in cashew orchards. Incorporating parasitism rates when setting thresholds for insecticide use provides a method for making pest management decisions based on natural enemy activity. Planting flowers to enhance beneficial insect populations has shown promising results, with three studies finding greater pest reduction or higher proportions of parasitized pests in fields and farms with planted flower strips. Allowing natural regeneration of ground cover beneath perennial crops can enhance natural enemy populations, with some studies finding more natural enemies in natural ground cover compared to bare ground, though effects can vary between different groups of natural enemies and some effects may be short-term.",

Planting flowers (1400) provides pest regulation benefits, with studies from Italy and USA finding greater pest reduction and higher proportions of parasitized pests in fields with planted flower strips, plus increased natural enemy numbers. Planting hedgerows (1401) results in a higher proportion of pest eggs being parasitized in adjacent tomato fields compared to fields with weedy edges, with more natural enemies found in hedgerow fields. Creating nettle strips (118) increases the number of aphid predator species, with three insect families including green lacewings found exclusively on nettles. Planting nectar flower mixtures or wildflower strips (3932) creates habitat for beneficial insects.

Crop rotation systems serve as an effective alternative, with nine studies demonstrating reduced pest populations and diseases while sometimes increasing yields and profits. Push-pull systems combining trap and repellent crops have shown success in reducing pest numbers and increasing yields. Planting flower strips to enhance natural enemy populations has been found effective for pest regulation. Timing modifications of insecticide applications rather than routine spraying can maintain pest control effectiveness. Leaving portions of crops unharvested provides habitat for natural enemies that help control pest populations. Incorporating parasitism rates into spray decisions and converting to organic farming systems are additional alternatives to preventative spraying programs.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence reviewed, several actions show effectiveness for controlling pests in orchards and perennial tree crops. Planting or maintaining ground cover in orchards or vineyards (action 1395) has shown mixed but generally positive results, with four studies finding more natural enemies in plots with ground cover compared to bare plots, though effects on pest numbers were inconsistent. Some studies found fewer leafhoppers in cover crop plots, while others found more pests in certain comparisons. Allowing natural regeneration of ground cover beneath perennial crops (action 720) showed varied results, with some studies finding fewer pests and others finding effects varied between different pest groups. Two studies found more natural enemies in natural ground cover compared to bare ground, though effects were sometimes short-term.\n\nExcluding ants that protect pests (action 886) proved effective in several contexts, with studies finding greater parasitism of pests by natural enemies when ants were excluded, and most studies reporting fewer pests when ants were kept out of trees. Isolating colonies of beneficial ants (action 773) also showed positive results, with one study finding lower pest damage to cashews and higher yields when predatory ant colonies were isolated.\n\nPlanting flowers (action 1400) to attract beneficial insects showed promise, with three studies finding greater pest reduction or higher proportions of parasitized pests in fields with planted flower strips, and four studies finding more natural enemies in fields with flower strips. Using pesticides only when pests or crop damage reach threshold levels (action 750) generally maintained pest control effectiveness while reducing pesticide applications, with most studies finding similar pest control, crop damage, and yields compared to conventional spraying regimes, along with reduced costs.",
