    "relevant_summary": "The most effective farmland management practices for increasing butterfly and moth abundance include converting to organic farming, planting nectar flower mixtures or wildflower strips, managing hedgerows for wildlife, reducing pesticide and fertilizer use, creating uncultivated field margins, planting grass buffer strips, and maintaining species-rich grasslands. Converting to organic farming increases butterfly and moth species richness and abundance compared to conventional farming, especially in intensive landscapes and on farms managed organically for less than 6 years. Planting wildflower strips significantly increases both species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths compared to conventional field margins and cropped fields. Managing hedgerows by cutting less frequently (every 2-3 years), cutting in autumn rather than winter, and allowing incremental growth increases butterfly and moth abundance. Reducing pesticide and fertilizer use generally benefits butterfly and moth communities, with farms using fewer chemicals showing higher species richness and abundance. Creating uncultivated margins and grass buffer strips around fields supports higher butterfly and moth populations than cropped field edges, especially when these margins are wider, cut less frequently, and located closer to existing grassland. Maintaining species-rich semi-natural grasslands through appropriate grazing or mowing regimes provides important habitat for butterflies and moths, with management type (grazing vs. mowing) affecting different species differently.",

            "args": "{\"summary\": \"The most effective farmland management practices for increasing butterfly and moth abundance include converting to organic farming, planting nectar flower mixtures or wildflower strips, managing hedgerows for wildlife, reducing pesticide and fertilizer use, creating uncultivated field margins, planting grass buffer strips, and maintaining species-rich grasslands. Converting to organic farming increases butterfly and moth species richness and abundance compared to conventional farming, especially in intensive landscapes and on farms managed organically for less than 6 years. Planting wildflower strips significantly increases both species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths compared to conventional field margins and cropped fields.

These alternatives provide options for maintaining grassland habitats without using prescribed fire, with different strategies showing varying effectiveness for different butterfly species and communities.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on evidence from conservation research, several grassland management techniques have been shown to benefit butterfly and moth abundance in agricultural settings:\n\nReducing management intensity on permanent grasslands has shown strong benefits, with studies finding higher abundance of butterflies, micro-moths and declining macro-moths on low-input or unfertilized, ungrazed grassland managed with a single cut compared to intensively managed grassland. Species richness also increased after reducing grazing and stopping chemical applications.\n\nRotational mowing techniques, including mowing strips in alternate years or leaving rotational areas uncut, demonstrated greater species richness and abundance of butterflies compared to grasslands cut in full once or twice per year. This approach provides habitat heterogeneity and refuge areas.\n\nChanging mowing regimes, specifically delaying cutting dates, has proven beneficial. Grasslands cut once per year in July showed higher species richness and abundance of butterflies and caterpillars compared to those cut in May or June. This timing allows butterfly larvae to complete their development.\n\nReducing cutting frequency from multiple cuts per year to a single annual cut showed higher species richness of butterflies and moths in several studies, though results were not universally consistent across all species.\n\nConverting to organic farming practices, which eliminate synthetic pesticide and fertilizer use, demonstrated higher species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths on organic farms compared to conventionally managed farms.\n\nReducing fertilizer, pesticide and herbicide applications generally showed beneficial effects, with greater species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths found on grasslands with reduced or eliminated chemical inputs.\n\nMaintaining or restoring species-rich, semi-natural grasslands through appropriate management (grazing or hay cutting) provided suitable habitat for specialist butterfly and moth species that depend on these habitats.",

    "relevant_summary": "Evidence-based alternatives to prescribed burning for managing forest disturbance to benefit butterflies include: (1) Tree thinning and selective harvesting - Six studies found that thinned forests, often combined with other management practices, had greater butterfly species richness and abundance compared to unmanaged forests (Action 3940). (2) Creating forest canopy gaps by clearing or opening patches - Fourteen studies showed that cleared patches increased butterfly richness and abundance, with larger cleared patches showing more positive effects than smaller ones, though moth richness often decreased (Action 3938). (3) Woodland coppicing - Ten studies demonstrated that coppiced woodland supported higher butterfly abundance and maintained populations of specialist species like pearl-bordered fritillary better than mature woodland over 20-year periods (Action 3939). (4) Managing woodland edges through felling and thinning - Two studies found that managed edges increased specialist butterfly abundance and species richness compared to unmanaged edges (Action 3942). (5) Creating young plantations within mature woodland - One study showed butterfly populations persisted better in areas with young plantations than in mature coniferous or deciduous woodland alone (Action 3941). (6) Selective or reduced impact logging instead of clearcutting - Studies found this maintained similar butterfly and moth richness to primary forest while often increasing abundance compared to conventional logging (Action 3867). (7) Using shelterwood or group selection harvesting instead of clearcutting - This maintained higher moth species richness compared to clearcutting while providing structural diversity (Action 3868). These mechanical and silvicultural approaches create the heterogeneous forest structure and canopy openings that many butterfly species require without using fire.",

Thirty-two studies from the UK, Switzerland, Finland, Sweden, Czech Republic and Germany evaluated AES effectiveness, with 18 of 27 population studies finding higher abundance of butterflies and moths on AES-managed land compared to conventional management. Twelve of 15 studies found higher species richness or diversity on AES sites. Specific AES measures showed varying effectiveness: planting nectar flower mixtures/wildflower strips demonstrated consistently positive results with 8 of 13 studies showing higher butterfly and moth species richness and 10 of 17 studies showing higher abundance compared to conventional margins or fields. Maintaining species-rich semi-natural grasslands showed mixed results with some studies finding positive effects on species richness and abundance compared to intensive management, while others found similar or lower effectiveness. Reducing pesticide and fertilizer use generally showed positive effects with 8 of 10 studies finding higher species richness in areas with reduced chemical inputs. Rotational management practices (grazing and mowing) demonstrated benefits with studies showing higher species richness and abundance in rotationally managed grasslands compared to continuous grazing or annual mowing. However, some studies found neutral or negative effects, particularly when comparing AES sites to abandoned or unmanaged habitats.",

    "relevant_summary": "Research has studied several management actions for traditional orchards and vineyards in the USA and Germany for their effects on butterflies and moths. In traditional orchards, studies from both countries found that maintaining unmanaged or partially managed orchards resulted in greater species richness and diversity of leaf-eating arthropods (including caterpillars) compared to commercially managed orchards. A German study found that managed orchards had similar species richness but lower abundance of butterflies and burnet moths compared to abandoned orchards.\n\nFor vineyard management, studies show that management practices to encourage native plants and reduce insecticide use lead to greater abundance of butterflies compared to conventionally managed vineyards. One US study found that grass strips between vine rows had greater species richness of butterflies than the vine rows themselves, and vineyards managed with fewer chemicals had greater species richness than conventionally managed vineyards. Another study found that vineyards managed to encourage native plants with rare insecticide use had similar species richness but greater abundance of butterflies compared to conventional vineyards.\n\nAdditionally, reducing general chemical inputs (pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers) has been studied extensively across multiple countries including the USA and Germany. Research shows that orchards, crop edges, farms, and vineyards managed with less frequent, reduced, or no chemical input had greater species richness and abundance of adult butterflies and moths, or caterpillars, compared to areas with more frequent or conventional chemical applications.",
