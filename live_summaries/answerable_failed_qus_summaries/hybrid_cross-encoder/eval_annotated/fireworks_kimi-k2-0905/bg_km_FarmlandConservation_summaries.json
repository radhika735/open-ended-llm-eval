    "relevant_summary": "The most beneficial actions for creating field margins to support wildlife on arable farms include: Sowing uncropped margins with native wildflower seed mixes which support higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees compared to cropped edges, grassy margins, or naturally regenerated margins (Action 19). Sowing field margins with agricultural nectar and pollen seed mixes containing perennial leguminous flowering plants attracts significantly more foraging bumblebees than other margin types, though these mixes may need re-sowing every few years (Action 18). Creating uncultivated margins around intensive fields has shown benefits for invertebrates including bees, with 19 studies finding higher plant diversity and species richness compared to conventionally managed margins, though 6 studies found no difference (Action 63). Leaving uncropped, cultivated margins or plots provides benefits to farmland birds, plants, invertebrates and mammals including increased species richness of plants and bumblebees, abundance of spiders and ground beetles, and improved breeding success for birds like northern lapwing and Eurasian skylark (Action 562). Planting field margins with diverse plant species has been shown to increase activity of certain bat species like soprano pipistrelles and barbastelle bats (Action 1941).",

One review found the grey partridge population increased substantially on farms where conservation measures including cover crops were in place. Nine replicated studies from France and the UK reported mixed or negative effects of wild bird cover on birds compared to other farmland habitats. Six studies found that mixtures including kale or a mixture of kale and/or other species attracted the largest number of bird species or highest bird abundance. \\nTwelve studies from the UK looked at the effects of wild bird cover strips on invertebrates. Seven studies from the UK (including one review and four replicated controlled studies of which two were also randomized) found positive effects. Farmland habitats sown with wild bird cover mix were used more by butterflies, and had a higher abundance or species richness of butterflies and/or bees than other farmland habitats. One review found wild bird cover benefited invertebrates. Four studies (including one review and two replicated trials) reported mixed or negative effects of wild bird cover on invertebrate numbers compared with other farmland habitats. One study found that bees and butterflies showed preferences for particular plant species. \\nEight studies from the UK looked at plants and wild bird cover. Six studies (including two reviews and two replicated controlled trials) found that planting wild bird cover mix was one of the three best options for conservation of annual herbaceous plant communities, benefited plants and resulted in increased plant diversity and species richness. However two replicated studies (of which one a site comparison) found mixed/negative effects for plant species richness.\\nOne replicated trial from the UK found that small mammal activity was higher in wild bird cover than in the crop in winter but not in summer.\"\n}"

Managing ditches to benefit wildlife showed that some farmland birds responded positively to the presence of ditches managed for wildlife, with bunded ditches visited by more birds than non-bunded ditches (Action 180). Maintaining traditional water meadows resulted in increased population sizes or territories of northern lapwing, common redshank and black-tailed godwit and increased plant species richness (Action 696).\n\nDrawbacks: Raising water levels resulted in a net loss of plant species in one study and did not affect lapwing foraging rate, while another study found common snipe declined on sites under management to maintain water meadows (Actions 121, 696). Some farmland bird species did not respond positively or responded negatively to ditch management (Action 180). Studies found that managing traditional water meadows by grazing had mixed impacts on wildlife and the productivity of northern lapwings was too low to sustain populations on three of the four water meadows managed for waders (Action 696).",

Nest protection through exclosures can benefit species including northern lapwing and southern dunlin by increasing hatching success compared to unprotected nests. Creating uncropped cultivated margins or plots (including specific 'lapwing plots') provides nesting habitat where northern lapwing, Eurasian skylark, grey partridge and yellow wagtail have been observed breeding. Spring planting of crops rather than autumn planting creates more suitable nesting conditions, with northern lapwings selecting spring-sown crops for nesting more than expected based on availability. Creating dedicated skylark plots specifically increases both Eurasian skylark population density and productivity compared to fields without plots.

Beetle banks also acted as nest sites for harvest mice and had higher densities of harvest mouse nests than field margins. For hedgerow management, ten studies found managing hedges for wildlife increased berry yields, species diversity or richness of plants and invertebrates, and diversity or abundance of farmland birds. However, five studies found no effect on plant species richness, bumblebee queens or farmland birds.

    "relevant_summary": "Raising mowing height on grasslands has shown mixed effects on farmland wildlife. A UK replicated controlled study found it increased productivity of Eurasian skylark and reduced damage to amphibians and invertebrates, but other studies found no effects on foraging birds or invertebrates, and shorter grass actually improved foraging success of northern lapwing and common starling chicks.\n\nDifferent mowing techniques significantly affect wildlife mortality. Studies from Germany, Ireland, Switzerland and the UK found that specific techniques can reduce bird, mammal, amphibian and invertebrate mortality. Corncrake Friendly Mowing schemes increased the UK corncrake population, with 68% of chicks escaping when fields were mown from center outwards versus 45% with conventional edge-in mowing. Bar mowers caused less damage to amphibians and invertebrates than other types. Wider mowing machinery increased skylark chick survival fourfold, while mower-conditioners resulted in higher skylark nest survival than tedders.\n\nRotational mowing strategies benefit many butterfly and moth species. Ten studies found rotational mowing (mowing strips in alternate years, leaving some areas uncut) increased butterfly species richness and abundance compared to complete annual mowing. This benefited 27 out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern in Europe, with some heath fritillary populations surviving on rotationally mown grasslands while others went extinct on unmanaged sites.\n\nTiming of cutting significantly impacts butterfly and moth populations. Studies from seven countries found delayed cutting (July-September vs May-June) generally increased abundance and richness of butterflies, burnet moths and caterpillars, though results varied between years. Some species like short-tailed blue preferred late-mown meadows, while others such as marbled white and meadow brown preferred early-mown areas.\n\nSpecific wildlife protection techniques during mowing include marking nests and caterpillar locations. Marking northern lapwing nests reduced their destruction probability. Marking marsh fritillary caterpillar webs before mowing led to increased web numbers the following year.",

For invasive non-native plants such as Himalayan balsam and Japanese knotweed, control methods involve removing all flower heads at peak flowering time, which dramatically reduced seed production in giant hogweed according to studies in the Czech Republic. For bracken management specifically, multiple techniques are available: herbicide application using asulam can reduce bracken abundance if applied repeatedly, though cutting may be equally effective; cutting bracken alone has been shown to increase heather cover and biomass while reducing bracken cover; a combination of cutting followed by herbicide application can effectively reduce bracken biomass and cover; and cutting followed by rotovating is another option, though it showed no effect on total plant biomass. Additional actions include general removal or control of non-native or problematic plants, with studies showing that such removal can increase plant species richness and benefit butterfly populations. For managing overabundant native species more broadly, reducing numbers of large herbivores like red deer can increase cover and height of common heather, and removing feral livestock can shift vegetation composition from grass to shrub dominance.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from action documents, several agri-environment options are available for creating linear features on farmland with documented effects on biodiversity:\n\n**Hedgerows:**\n- Providing or maintaining hedgerows on farmland was found to make reptile communities more similar to forest communities, with more reptile species found exclusively in areas with hedges than without hedges (action 3519).\n- Managing hedges for bats by trimming them less frequently (\u22653 years prior) resulted in more bat species recorded and higher activity for some species compared to recently trimmed hedges (action 1943).\n\n**Buffer Strips:**\n- Planting grass buffer strips/margins around arable or pasture fields showed positive effects across multiple taxa: increased arthropod abundance, species richness and diversity (19 studies); benefits to birds including increased numbers, densities, species richness and foraging time (9 studies); increased plant cover and species richness (7 studies); and benefits to small mammals including increased activity and numbers (5 studies). However, 6 studies found no clear effects on some insect and bird groups (action 246).\n- Providing buffer strips alongside water courses had mixed results: 3 studies reported positive influence on plant, invertebrate and bird diversity or abundance, while 2 studies found no increase in plant species numbers compared to farms without buffer strips (action 120).\n- Buffer strips managed with restrictions on fertilizer and pesticide use showed greater abundance of moths compared to conventionally managed margins, though species richness was similar (action 3894).\n\n**Beetle Banks:**\n- Creating beetle banks showed benefits for farmland biodiversity with 14 reports from 8 studies finding positive effects. For invertebrates, beetle banks provided higher ground beetle density and species diversity in spring and summer, though effects varied between grass species sown and between invertebrate groups. For birds, 2 reviews and 1 study found positive effects on bird numbers or evidence of use, while 2 studies found mixed effects and 1 study found no farmland bird species were associated with beetle banks. Beetle banks also acted as nest sites for harvest mice (action 651) and had higher densities of harvest mouse nests than field margins (action 2393).",

Planting cereals for whole crop silage, particularly barley, provides food resources for seed-eating birds in both summer and winter (Action ID 225). Creating skylark plots through undrilled patches within cereal fields increases Eurasian skylark breeding density, duration and success (Action ID 540).

Planting nectar flower mixtures or wildflower strips has been found to increase butterfly and moth species richness and diversity compared to conventional field margins, unsown margins, cropped fields, or conventional grassland. These habitats also support higher abundance of butterflies, including generalist and specialist species. Field margins sown with wildflowers attract significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated, grassy, or cropped field margins. Planting nettle strips in field margins has been shown to increase the number of aphid predator species, with some insect families like green lacewings found exclusively on nettles. The evidence comes from multiple replicated studies across Europe, with 23 studies evaluating wildflower strips and 5 replicated trials examining nectar and pollen mixes.",

One of these studies also found that the species richness of specialist butterflies was similar in sown wildflower strips, cropped fields and conventional grassland. Four studies found that the species richness\\u00a0of butterflies was similar between sown wildflower strips and cropped fields, cropped margins, unsown strips\\u00a0or extensively managed meadows. The other study found that, five years after sowing wildflower strips, butterfly species richness, but not diversity had increased at one of two study sites. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the UK\\u00a0found that the species richness of butterflies and moths was similar on farms managed under agri-environment schemes, including with sown wildflower strips, and on conventionally managed farms. Two replicated studies (including one randomized, controlled study and one site comparison study) in the UK\\u00a0and Sweden\\u00a0found that field margins sown with wildflowers had a greater species richness of butterflies than grass-only field margins.\\u00a0One of two replicated, paired, controlled studies (including one randomized study) in the USA\\u00a0and the UK\\u00a0found that plots sown with a mix of wildflowers had a greater species richness of caterpillars than plots sown with a single flower species. The other study found that plots sown with either complex or simpler flower mixes had a similar species richness of butterflies.

However, one of these studies only found this effect in one of two study years. Two of these studies also found that the abundance of specialist butterflies\\u00a0and meadow brown caterpillars\\u00a0was similar in sown wildflower strips and unsown margins, cropped fields\\u00a0and conventional grassland, and one found that the abundance of caterpillars was lower in sown wildflower strips than in conventional grassland. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the UK\\u00a0found that the abundance of butterflies and micro-moths was higher on farms managed under agri-environment schemes, including with sown wildflower strips, than on conventionally managed farms, but the abundance of other moths was similar. Two replicated studies (including one randomized, controlled study and one site comparison study) in the UK\\u00a0and Sweden\\u00a0found that field margins sown with wildflowers had a higher abundance of butterflies than grass-only field margins. One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK\\u00a0found that farms with wildflower strips (along with other enhanced agri-environment scheme options) had a higher abundance of some butterflies, but a lower abundance of other butterflies, than farms with simpler agri-environment scheme management such as grass-only margins. One of two replicated, paired, controlled studies (including one randomized study) in the USA\\u00a0and the UK\\u00a0found that plots sown with one of three wildflower mixes had a higher abundance of moths than plots sown with two other mixes or a single flower species.
