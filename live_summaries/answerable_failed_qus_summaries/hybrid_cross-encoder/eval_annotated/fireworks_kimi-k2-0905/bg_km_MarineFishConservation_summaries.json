    "relevant_summary": "The most effective gear modifications for reducing unwanted fish catch in trawl fisheries include: (1) Size-sorting escape grids/systems - 17 studies found these reduced unwanted catches of most fish species assessed, though effectiveness varied by species, light conditions, and trawl type (Action 2728). (2) Topless (coverless) trawls - 2 of 4 studies showed these reduced unwanted Atlantic cod catch and commercial fish discards compared to conventional trawls (Action 2712). (3) Mesh size-sorting funnels (sieve nets) on shrimp trawls - all 3 studies found these reduced unwanted non-commercial or discarded fish catches (Action 2722). (4) Raising parts of bottom trawls off the seabed - 2 studies found this reduced unwanted sharks, elasmobranchs, and fish species compared to conventional trawls (Action 2708). (5) Various trawl gear design modifications - 12 of 16 studies found changes to trawl wires, nets, codends, footropes, panels, or overall design reduced unwanted non-target and discarded fish catches (Action 2704). (6) Decreasing codend circumference/diameter - 2 of 6 studies found this reduced discarded fish catch in some cases (Action 2706). (7) Modified mesh escape panels/windows - 3 of 5 studies found these reduced unwanted catches of certain species like whiting, haddock, and boarfish (Action 2717).",

One before-and-after study in the Pacific Ocean found that involving fishers and stakeholders in co-management did not decrease overall fishing effort after five years (Action ID: 2910). Similarly, territorial fishing use rights also showed no decrease in fishing effort over five years (Action ID: 2677). However, overall catch limits (quota caps) showed some success, with a North Sea study finding that when annual total allowable catch limits were changed, half of the otter trawl fleet had corresponding changes in fishing effort (Action ID: 3811). Long-term fishery closures showed more positive results, with a replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the North Sea finding that long-term closure of a commercial fishery reduced overall fishing effort for lesser sandeel (Action ID: 2655). Temporary closures showed limited effectiveness, with one North Sea study finding that fixed temporary closures had little effect on fishing effort for cod, though real-time area closures reduced the annual amount of cod caught (Action ID: 2664). Limiting fishing activity by vessel size and engine power did not specifically assess fishing effort reduction but was associated with higher abundance of commercially targeted fish (Action ID: 3809).",

Long-term fishery closures showed more positive results, with a replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the North Sea finding that long-term closure of a commercial fishery reduced overall fishing effort for lesser sandeel (Action ID: 2655). Temporary closures showed limited effectiveness, with one North Sea study finding that fixed temporary closures had little effect on fishing effort for cod, though real-time area closures reduced the annual amount of cod caught (Action ID: 2664). Limiting fishing activity by vessel size and engine power did not specifically assess fishing effort reduction but was associated with higher abundance of commercially targeted fish (Action ID: 3809).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"2910\",\n    \"2677\",\n    \"3811\",\n    \"2655\",\n    \"2664\",\n    \"3809\"\n  ]\n}"

Setting minimum landing sizes (Action 2735) allows fish to reach maturity and spawn before being caught, though evidence shows mixed effectiveness - one study reported only one of five swordfish fisheries showed increased recruitment after minimum sizes were set, while another found most landed fish were still immature despite established minimum sizes. Protecting spawning fish from capture through seasonal closures (Action 2938) and temporary fishery closures (Action 2664) can provide protection during critical reproductive periods, with evidence showing cod spent nearly a third of their time in closed spawning areas during implementation. Marine protected areas that prohibit harvesting of specific species like conch (Action 2237) have shown increased abundance compared to fished areas.

Six studies\\u00a0found similar fish species/richness between one and 20 years after all fishing was banned in protected areas, compared to fished areas. One systematic review in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans\\u00a0found no difference in species richness between unfished protected areas and fished areas. One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that the effects of prohibiting all fishing on fish species richness/diversity after 15 years varied with the sampling method used.\\n\\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (66 STUDIES)\\n\\nAbundance (64 studies): Thirty of 54 site comparison studies (18 replicated, eight replicated and paired, two before-and-after, one paired and before-and-after, and one replicated and before-and-after) in the Indian Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, Pacific Ocean, Tasman Sea, Coral Sea, Philippine Sea, Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and the Sulu Sea, found that marine protected areas that had been prohibiting all fishing for up to 25 years or more, had higher abundances (density and/or biomass) of all fish (total fish biomass, total fish density), fishery targeted fish species, non-fishery targeted fish species\\u00a0and all or most of the individual fish species/groups monitored, except fish densities (all or most)\\u00a0and non-fishery targeted species, compared to unprotected fished areas and/or partly-fished protected areas. The studies also found that in some cases where the total fish biomass or densities were higher in no-fished areas, the effect varied between individual groups of fish based on species family\\u00a0and/or position in the food chain, commercial target and non-target species, fish sizes, depth\\u00a0and habitat types. Eight studies found that inside protected areas prohibiting all fishing there were similar abundances of all fish, and all or most of the individual fish species/groups monitored, compared to fished areas between one and 20 years after implementation. The other sixteen studies\\u00a0found that the effect of prohibiting fishing in protected areas for three to 20 years on fish abundance varied between fish species or groups and on their fished status (fishery target or non-target)\\u00a0and/or position in the food chain. One also found that the effect varied with size or age of the protected areas. Five of six reviews (three systematic) across the world, in the Pacific and/or Atlantic Oceans\\u00a0and in unreported regions\\u00a0found that non-fished marine reserves with one to 27 years of protection had higher abundances of all fish, all fish and invertebrates combined\\u00a0and blue cod\\u00a0compared to fished areas, but there were differences between species/groups and fishing intensity outside reserves. The other review\\u00a0found that fish abundance varied between species in no-take marine reserves between one and 25 years old, and was affected by food chain position, level of exploitation and duration of protection. One replicated study in the Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found a long-term decline in the abundance/presence of eight of 12 shark and ray species inside an established (&gt;15 years) no-fishing protected area, however enforcement was poor. One before-and after, site comparison study in the Pacific Ocean, found no differences in overall fish abundance between a marine reserve closed permanently to fishing for five years and a closed area that was harvested for two years during the same period. One site comparison study in the Coral Sea\\u00a0found that in a no-take zone of an area protected for at least 10 years, fish abundance of four of six fish groups were similar to no-entry and fished zones, but two had lower abundance than the no-entry zone. One replicated, paired, site comparison study in the Tasman Sea\\u00a0found that in a non-fished marine park zone abundance of commercially targeted fish was higher than partly fished zones but lower than unprotected areas after four to eight years.\\nReproductive success (1 study): One site comparison study in the Mediterranean Sea\\u00a0found more eggs of four commercially targeted fish species inside a non-fished marine reserve enforced for three years than in fished areas outside the reserve.\\nSurvival (1 study): One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that prohibiting all fishing in a marine protected area for three years resulted in similar survival of red hind grouper, compared to fished areas.\\nCondition (20 studies): Two global review studies\\u00a0(one systematic) and two systematic reviews in the Pacific Ocean\\u00a0and the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans\\u00a0found that prohibiting all fishing in marine protected areas for one to 27 years resulted in larger fish overall\\u00a0and larger blue cod\\u00a0compared to fished areas, but there were differences between individual fish families or species. Eight of 11 site comparison studies (four replicated, one before-and-after, one paired, and one replicated and paired) in the Tasman Sea, Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, Atlantic Ocean, Java Sea\\u00a0and the Philippine Sea, found that non-fished protected areas had larger fish overall\\u00a0and larger individuals of all or most of the fish species/groups monitored, compared to fished areas, after one to 22 years. The other three studies\\u00a0found similar fish sizes of all or all but one species, compared to fished areas one to 16 years after all fishing was prohibited. Three site comparison studies (one replicated) in the Coral Sea, Caribbean Sea\\u00a0and the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that fish size in protected areas that had not been fished for six to more than 20 years, varied between fish species or food chain groups. One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that red hind grouper were larger, but had similar growth, in an area protected from fishing for three years compared to fished areas. One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that young lemon sharks in areas protected from fishing for 20 years had similar growth rates, but lower condition, than sharks in unprotected fished areas.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)\\u00a0\\n\\nBehaviour change (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in the Pacific and Indian Oceans\\u00a0found that surgeonfish and parrotfish inside established protected areas where fishing was prohibited, showed a similar avoidance response to fishing gears as in fished areas, and this increased with increasing fishing intensity outside the protected areas. One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that in non-fished areas protected for one and 24 years, fish grazing rates were higher compared to fished areas.\\n\\n\\u00a0OTHER (15 STUDIES)\\n\\nUse (7 studies): Four of six site comparison studies in the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0and the Tasman Sea\\u00a0found that marine protected areas where all fishing had been prohibited for at least five to 15 years, were used for a large proportion of time by shark and ray species\\u00a0and commercially important reef fish species, compared to fished areas, thus were provided protection from fishing. Two other studies\\u00a0found that time spent inside areas closed to all fishing for 20 years\\u00a0and over 30 years, varied between species and with size for three shark species\\u00a0and with size for giant trevally. One replicated study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that most individuals of five fish species remained inside a marine reserve zone closed to fishing over a nine-year period.\\n\\n\\nCatch abundance (2 studies): One of two site comparison studies in the Mediterranean Sea\\u00a0and Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found that commercial fish catch rates in small-scale traditional fisheries were highest closest to a marine reserve closed to all fishing for 22 years, and decreased with increasing distance from the reserve. The other study\\u00a0found that there was no increase in fish catch rates in commercially landed catch in the five years after a no-fishing zone was implemented in a co-managed protected area.\\nStock biomass (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that the stock biomass (the harvested portion of the population) of reef fish species was highest in enforced protected areas closed to all fishing, compared to various other area management regimes.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\nFishing mortality (2 studies): Two site comparison studies in the North Sea\\u00a0and Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found that prohibiting fishing in protected areas resulted in reduced commercial fishing mortality of corkwing wrasse tagged inside non-fished marine reserves compared to fished areas, and that the overall fishing mortality of grey reef sharks tagged inside protected areas was low.\"\n}"

Prohibiting all mobile and static fishing gears that catch bottom (demersal) species (Action 2654) showed mixed results: one study found higher numbers of larger and older cod after 15 years of closure, while another found no effect on fish densities after 2-7 years. Fish densities varied between species and were influenced by depth and temperature. Cod showed better growth in closed areas after 5-15 years compared to openly fished areas.\n\nProhibiting mobile fishing gears dragged across the seafloor (Action 2673) demonstrated more consistent positive effects across 10 studies. These included higher total fish biomass after 15 years, increased adult red mullet biomass after 14 years, improved recruitment of young red mullet, and larger sizes of adult red mullet. However, effects varied between individual fish groups and with habitat type. One study showed increased catch rates after 3-6 years of prohibiting beach and seine nets.\n\nProhibiting shellfish dredging (Action 2668) showed no effect on bottom-dwelling fish abundance or species richness after 10 years of closure. Designated Marine Protected Areas that prohibit all towed fishing gear (Actions 2229, 2102) showed positive effects on invertebrate populations rather than fish, including greater invertebrate abundance and biomass, more scallops, and higher proportions of older, larger scallops compared to fished areas.",

Spatial management measures include marine protected areas that prohibit fishing (increased cod survival) and move-on rules that trigger temporary closures (reduced cod discards and fishing effort). Gear-based controls involve prohibiting certain gear types (higher fish density, reduced unwanted cod catch), modifying gear with escape frames (reduced undersized crab catch), and using alternative fishing methods (reduced unwanted fish, more mature specimens). Effort controls include limiting vessel size/power (higher commercial fish abundance), though permit limitations lacked direct evidence. Size-based management through minimum landing sizes showed mixed results on reducing unwanted catches, while maximum size limits lacked evidence.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on evidence from action documents, the effects of prohibiting commercial fishing on fish abundance vary considerably across different ocean basins. In the Atlantic Ocean/Gulf of Mexico, studies showed mixed results with some commercially targeted species showing higher abundance after protection while others showed no change. The Mediterranean Sea demonstrated varied responses with some species groups showing higher abundance after five years while others like white seabream showed no biomass increase. The Indian Ocean showed mixed effects with some fish groups having higher abundance and larger overall fish size in protected areas. The Tasman Sea region was notable for showing mostly decreased abundance or mixed results after fishing prohibition. The South China Sea showed conflicting results with decreased species richness but increased overall fish density in the wider region. The South Atlantic Ocean showed no significant differences in species composition or diversity after 40 years of protection. These findings demonstrate that fish abundance responses to commercial fishing prohibition are highly variable between ocean basins, with no consistent global pattern of positive or negative effects.",

Ten studies were in the Pacific Ocean\\u00a0(New Zealand, USA, Hawaii, New Caledonia, Costa Rica, Tonga, Vanuatu, Solomon Islands). Seven studies were in each of the Coral Sea\\u00a0(Australia, Vanuatu), the Tasman Sea\\u00a0(New Zealand, Australia) and the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0(Brazil, USA, Puerto Rico, Argentina, South Africa, UK, Canary Islands, Portugal, Turks and Caicos Islands). Four studies were in the Philippine Sea\\u00a0(Philippines). Three studies were in the Caribbean Sea\\u00a0(Belize, Puerto Rico). One study was in each of the Gulf of Mexico\\u00a0(USA), the Java Sea\\u00a0(Indonesia), the Pacific and Indian Oceans\\u00a0(multiple countries), the Sulu Sea\\u00a0(Malaysia) and the North Sea\\u00a0(Norway). Six studies were reviews of marine reserves (New Zealand, Latin America/Caribbean, regions unspecified\\u00a0and across the world).\\n\\n\\u00a0COMMUNITY RESPONSE (26 STUDIES)\\u00a0\\n\\nCommunity composition (7 studies): Seven site comparison studies (two replicated, and one before-and-after) in the Mediterranean Sea,\\u00a0Indian Ocean, Philippine Sea\\u00a0and the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that protected areas where all fishing had been prohibited for between three and 16 years, had a different fish community composition, compared to fished areas.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\nRichness/diversity (22 studies): Fourteen of 20 site comparison studies (eight replicated, one replicated and paired, and one before-and-after) in the Indian Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, Philippine Sea, Tasman Sea, Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, Coral Sea\\u00a0and the Pacific Ocean, found that marine protected areas that had prohibited all fishing for between one to more than 25 years, had higher fish species/richness compared to fished areas. Six studies\\u00a0found similar fish species/richness between one and 20 years after all fishing was banned in protected areas, compared to fished areas. One systematic review in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans\\u00a0found no difference in species richness between unfished protected areas and fished areas. One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that the effects of prohibiting all fishing on fish species richness/diversity after 15 years varied with the sampling method used.\\n\\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (66 STUDIES)\\n\\nAbundance (64 studies): Thirty of 54 site comparison studies (18 replicated, eight replicated and paired, two before-and-after, one paired and before-and-after, and one replicated and before-and-after) in the Indian Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, Pacific Ocean, Tasman Sea, Coral Sea, Philippine Sea, Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and the Sulu Sea, found that marine protected areas that had been prohibiting all fishing for up to 25 years or more, had higher abundances (density and/or biomass) of all fish (total fish biomass, total fish density), fishery targeted fish species, non-fishery targeted fish species\\u00a0and all or most of the individual fish species/groups monitored, except fish densities (all or most)\\u00a0and non-fishery targeted species, compared to unprotected fished areas and/or partly-fished protected areas. The studies also found that in some cases where the total fish biomass or densities were higher in no-fished areas, the effect varied between individual groups of fish based on species family\\u00a0and/or position in the food chain, commercial target and non-target species, fish sizes, depth\\u00a0and habitat types. Eight studies found that inside protected areas prohibiting all fishing there were similar abundances of all fish, and all or most of the individual fish species/groups monitored, compared to fished areas between one and 20 years after implementation. The other sixteen studies\\u00a0found that the effect of prohibiting fishing in protected areas for three to 20 years on fish abundance varied between fish species or groups and on their fished status (fishery target or non-target)\\u00a0and/or position in the food chain. One also found that the effect varied with size or age of the protected areas. Five of six reviews (three systematic) across the world, in the Pacific and/or Atlantic Oceans\\u00a0and in unreported regions\\u00a0found that non-fished marine reserves with one to 27 years of protection had higher abundances of all fish, all fish and invertebrates combined\\u00a0and blue cod\\u00a0compared to fished areas, but there were differences between species/groups and fishing intensity outside reserves. The other review\\u00a0found that fish abundance varied between species in no-take marine reserves between one and 25 years old, and was affected by food chain position, level of exploitation and duration of protection. One replicated study in the Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found a long-term decline in the abundance/presence of eight of 12 shark and ray species inside an established (&gt;15 years) no-fishing protected area, however enforcement was poor. One before-and after, site comparison study in the Pacific Ocean, found no differences in overall fish abundance between a marine reserve closed permanently to fishing for five years and a closed area that was harvested for two years during the same period. One site comparison study in the Coral Sea\\u00a0found that in a no-take zone of an area protected for at least 10 years, fish abundance of four of six fish groups were similar to no-entry and fished zones, but two had lower abundance than the no-entry zone. One replicated, paired, site comparison study in the Tasman Sea\\u00a0found that in a non-fished marine park zone abundance of commercially targeted fish was higher than partly fished zones but lower than unprotected areas after four to eight years.\\nReproductive success (1 study): One site comparison study in the Mediterranean Sea\\u00a0found more eggs of four commercially targeted fish species inside a non-fished marine reserve enforced for three years than in fished areas outside the reserve.\\nSurvival (1 study): One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that prohibiting all fishing in a marine protected area for three years resulted in similar survival of red hind grouper, compared to fished areas.\\nCondition (20 studies): Two global review studies\\u00a0(one systematic) and two systematic reviews in the Pacific Ocean\\u00a0and the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans\\u00a0found that prohibiting all fishing in marine protected areas for one to 27 years resulted in larger fish overall\\u00a0and larger blue cod\\u00a0compared to fished areas, but there were differences between individual fish families or species. Eight of 11 site comparison studies (four replicated, one before-and-after, one paired, and one replicated and paired) in the Tasman Sea, Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, Atlantic Ocean, Java Sea\\u00a0and the Philippine Sea, found that non-fished protected areas had larger fish overall\\u00a0and larger individuals of all or most of the fish species/groups monitored, compared to fished areas, after one to 22 years. The other three studies\\u00a0found similar fish sizes of all or all but one species, compared to fished areas one to 16 years after all fishing was prohibited. Three site comparison studies (one replicated) in the Coral Sea, Caribbean Sea\\u00a0and the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that fish size in protected areas that had not been fished for six to more than 20 years, varied between fish species or food chain groups. One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that red hind grouper were larger, but had similar growth, in an area protected from fishing for three years compared to fished areas. One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that young lemon sharks in areas protected from fishing for 20 years had similar growth rates, but lower condition, than sharks in unprotected fished areas.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)\\u00a0\\n\\nBehaviour change (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in the Pacific and Indian Oceans\\u00a0found that surgeonfish and parrotfish inside established protected areas where fishing was prohibited, showed a similar avoidance response to fishing gears as in fished areas, and this increased with increasing fishing intensity outside the protected areas. One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that in non-fished areas protected for one and 24 years, fish grazing rates were higher compared to fished areas.\\n\\n\\u00a0OTHER (15 STUDIES)\\n\\nUse (7 studies): Four of six site comparison studies in the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0and the Tasman Sea\\u00a0found that marine protected areas where all fishing had been prohibited for at least five to 15 years, were used for a large proportion of time by shark and ray species\\u00a0and commercially important reef fish species, compared to fished areas, thus were provided protection from fishing. Two other studies\\u00a0found that time spent inside areas closed to all fishing for 20 years\\u00a0and over 30 years, varied between species and with size for three shark species\\u00a0and with size for giant trevally. One replicated study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that most individuals of five fish species remained inside a marine reserve zone closed to fishing over a nine-year period.\\n\\n\\nCatch abundance (2 studies): One of two site comparison studies in the Mediterranean Sea\\u00a0and Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found that commercial fish catch rates in small-scale traditional fisheries were highest closest to a marine reserve closed to all fishing for 22 years, and decreased with increasing distance from the reserve. The other study\\u00a0found that there was no increase in fish catch rates in commercially landed catch in the five years after a no-fishing zone was implemented in a co-managed protected area.\\nStock biomass (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that the stock biomass (the harvested portion of the population) of reef fish species was highest in enforced protected areas closed to all fishing, compared to various other area management regimes.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\nFishing mortality (2 studies): Two site comparison studies in the North Sea\\u00a0and Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found that prohibiting fishing in protected areas resulted in reduced commercial fishing mortality of corkwing wrasse tagged inside non-fished marine reserves compared to fished areas, and that the overall fishing mortality of grey reef sharks tagged inside protected areas was low.\"\n}"

However, a co-management study in the Pacific Ocean found no decrease in overall fishing effort and no increase in total fish catch rates after five years, with catch rates decreasing for half of the six species groups studied (Action ID: 2910). No studies were found evaluating the effects of engaging fishers in scientific data collection (Action ID: 2813), including fishers in marine protected area management groups (Action ID: 2809), engaging stakeholders when designing marine protected areas (Action ID: 2243), involving stakeholders in harvest rights allocation (Action ID: 2812), involving fishers in gear design (Action ID: 2810), or promoting knowledge exchange between fishers for marine fish populations (Action ID: 2814).",

    "relevant_summary": "Several actions are available for managing fishing activity within marine protected areas without imposing complete bans on all fishing. Zonation systems allow different levels of fishing restrictions across different zones within the protected area, ranging from no-take zones to zones with partial fishing restrictions. Fishing activity can be restricted through various unspecified limitations rather than complete prohibition. Gear restrictions can be implemented, including limiting trap density, modifying trawl net configurations (such as mesh size, escape panels, twine types, and codend circumference), and restricting vessel size or engine power. Catch management tools include setting catch limits or quotas for targeted and non-targeted species, establishing minimum or maximum landing sizes, and creating move-on rules that trigger temporary area closures when catch thresholds are reached. Temporal restrictions can be applied such as establishing temporary fishery closures, allowing periodic fishing only during specific time periods, or implementing seasonal fishing restrictions. Recreational fishing and harvesting can be specifically limited or prohibited while allowing commercial fishing to continue. These management approaches have been shown to result in larger fish sizes, greater abundance and biomass of fish populations, and different age and sex structures compared to heavily fished areas, while still maintaining some level of fishing activity.",

The other one found similar abundance of purple sea urchins inside fully protected sites, sites where some restricted urchin harvest occurs, and unprotected fished sites outside the protected area after five years.\\nEchinoderm condition (2 studies): Two site comparison studies in the Mediterranean Sea\\u00a0found that inside a marine protected area with a zonation system, sites prohibiting all fishing had bigger sea urchins compared to sites where some restricted urchin harvest occurs\\u00a0and compared to unprotected fished sites outside the protected area, after either four years\\u00a0or 17 to 18 years.\\nMollusc abundance (3 studies): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that inside a marine protected area with a zonation system, abundance of blacklip abalone was higher in sites that had been prohibiting all fishing for five years compared to those prohibiting commercial fishing only. Two site comparison studies in the Caribbean Sea found that inside marine protected areas with a zonation system, abundances of adult queen conch increased over time in a zone closed to all fishing and were greater than in zones with fewer restrictions, but abundances of juvenile conch did not differ or vary differently between zones, after either five to eight years\\u00a0or 14 to 20 years.\\nMollusc condition (1 study): One site comparison study in the Caribbean Sea\\u00a0found that inside a marine protected area with a zonation system, the size of queen conch decreased similarly in the area prohibiting all fishing and in the area with fewer restrictions, after 14 to 20 years.\\nSponge abundance (1 study): One site comparison study in the Mediterranean Sea\\u00a0found that inside a marine protected area with a zonation system, the cover of sponges Cliona was higher at a site prohibiting all fishing for six years compared to sites where some fishing occurred.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\\n\\nCrustacean behaviour (1 study): One site comparison study in the Caribbean Sea\\u00a0found that, inside a marine protected area with a zonation system (year of designation unspecified), 80% of the lobster population occurring in the unfished area remained in the protected unfished area, and thus remained protected.\"\n}"

Modifying longline configuration showed mixed effects on unwanted catch reduction. Four studies found that modifications such as using nylon instead of wire hook attachments or increasing lead weight on mid-water longlines reduced catches of unwanted sharks and rays in some cases, but did not reduce catches of undersized haddock. Using different bait types showed varying effectiveness, with six of eight studies finding that different bait types reduced unwanted catches of undersized haddock, Atlantic cod, and other non-target fish, though two studies found no reduction in unwanted catches of pelagic stingray or overall unwanted fish. Prohibiting certain gear types was found to increase fish density and reduce unwanted catch. One study in the Indian Ocean found higher fish density in areas where all but one gear type was prohibited, and a study in Kattegat found prohibiting non-selective gear types reduced unwanted cod catch. Comprehensive fishing prohibitions in marine protected areas showed mixed results on fish populations, with some areas showing similar or lower fish abundance compared to unprotected areas, while one study found increased cod survival after prohibiting almost all fishing.",

Size-sorting escape grids (rigid or flexible) fitted to prawn/shrimp trawl nets are the most extensively studied modification, with 30 studies showing they reduce unwanted fish catches by allowing escape of non-commercial species and discarded commercial species. Sieve nets (size-sorting mesh funnels) fitted to prawn/shrimp trawl nets have been shown in three North Sea studies to reduce catches of unwanted fish compared to standard trawls. Large, supported escape openings such as Fisheyes, Bigeyes and radial escape sections can reduce overall catches of unwanted fish and undersized individuals. Mesh escape panels/windows combined with square mesh codends instead of diamond mesh can reduce discarded finfish numbers. The combination of size-sorting escape grids with large, supported escape openings has shown effectiveness in reducing unwanted fish and shark/ray catches. Moving devices (stimulator devices) that trigger fish escape responses can increase escape of certain species. These modifications work by providing escape routes for fish while retaining the target prawn/shrimp catch.",

Rotating diamond mesh orientation by 90\u00b0 in trawl codends improved size selection for cod, red mullet and round-bodied fish species (Action 2715). The combination of square mesh escape panels with size-sorting grids increased size-selectivity for whiting (Action 2727). Size-sorting escape grids, when fitted to fish trawl nets, improved size-selection of haddock in some cases (Action 2720), while grids on prawn/shrimp trawls reduced unwanted undersized fish catches (Action 2721).
