Providing live invertebrates reduced inactivity and increased foraging in captive loris to levels seen in wild loris (Action 1333). Providing cut branches (browse) allows captive gorillas to use the same processing skills as wild gorillas to forage (Action 1332). Live vegetation in planters for foraging increased time spent foraging in chimpanzees compared to normal browse and grass (Action 1327). Changing feeding times to unpredictable schedules decreased inactivity in chimpanzees (Action 1338). Feeding individuals in social groups allows monkeys to complete enrichment tasks faster than when feeding alone and encourages them to eat more unfamiliar foods (Action 1343).",

For primates, puzzle feeders decreased food sharing, increased foraging behavior and tool use, but also increased aggression levels in some cases. Puzzle feeders also increased time spent feeding and reduced inactive time in primates. For carnivores, prey simulation devices including lures, pulleys and bungees increased activity levels and behavioral diversity in felids, while decreasing pacing behavior and increasing walking in cougars, though tigers initially showed increased pacing when presented with carcasses on bungees. Alternative feeding methods like scattering food throughout enclosures increased exploratory behaviors and reduced abnormal behaviors and aggression in various primate species including chimpanzees and lemurs, while frozen food in ice decreased stereotypic behaviors and increased activity levels in bears and felids. These complex feeding interventions appear to generally enhance natural foraging behaviors and reduce inactivity, though some implementations may initially increase stress behaviors like pacing or aggression in certain individuals.",

However, effects vary by species, as one study found that unpredictable feeding increased territorial behavior in coyotes but did not affect traveling or foraging (Action 1904). Regarding feeding frequency, one study found that large felids fed once every three days paced more frequently on non-feeding days (Action 1906).

Providing fresh produce instead of pellet feed increased feeding time and reduced inactivity in rhesus macaques (Action ID: 1335). Presenting food items whole rather than processed increased consumption and feeding time in macaques (Action ID: 1323). Formulating diets to reflect the nutritional composition of wild foods, including removing domestic fruits, decreased regurgitation and reingestion in gorillas and reduced aggression and self-directed behavior in lemurs (Action ID: 1329). Providing cut branches (browse) allowed captive gorillas to use the same processing skills as wild gorillas when foraging on stinging nettles (Action ID: 1332). Scattering food throughout enclosures increased feeding and exploratory behaviors while reducing abnormal behaviors and aggression across multiple primate species including rhesus macaques, chimpanzees, lemurs, and gorillas (Action ID: 1315). Hiding food in containers combined with browse increased activity levels and foraging behaviors in lemurs and gibbons (Action ID: 1316). Providing live vegetation in planters led chimpanzees to spend more time foraging compared to normal feeding methods (Action ID: 1327). While providing food at natural wild feeding times, seasonal ingredient modification, nectar provision, and continuous food access are suggested approaches, no evidence was captured regarding their effectiveness (Action IDs: 1339, 1336, 1331, 1340).",

    "relevant_summary": "Research shows that several dietary modifications effectively encourage naturalistic behaviors in captive lemurs and macaques. For lemurs, a fruit-free diet was found to reduce aggression and self-directed behavior. Both species benefit from scattered feeding throughout the enclosure, which increases exploratory and feeding behaviors while reducing abnormal behaviors and aggression. Presenting whole foods instead of processed items increases food consumption and feeding time in macaques. Providing fresh produce instead of pellet feed results in more time spent feeding and less inactive time in rhesus macaques. The inclusion of cut branches (browse) allows for natural processing skills, as seen when captive gorillas used the same techniques as wild gorillas to handle stinging nettles. Live vegetation in planters can enhance foraging behavior, with chimpanzees spending more time foraging when provided with planted grass. Formulating diets to reflect the nutritional composition of wild foods, including the removal of domestic fruits, represents a comprehensive approach to dietary naturalism in captive primates.",

Providing food on a random temporal schedule (Action ID 1904) reduced stereotypic pacing behaviors in tigers and cheetahs across multiple studies, while also increasing behavioral diversity in red foxes and alertness in black-footed cats. Using devices to simulate live prey including lure and pulley systems (Action ID 1927) increased activity levels and behavioral diversity in felids, though tigers initially showed increased pacing before behavior improved. Presenting food frozen in ice (Action ID 1923) decreased abnormal or stereotypic behaviors while increasing activity levels in felids. Presenting food inside objects like Boomer balls (Action ID 1924) also increased exploratory behaviors while decreasing stereotypic behaviors in bears. However, allocating fast days (Action ID 1906) was found to increase pacing behavior in large felids on non-feeding days, making it counterproductive for reducing stereotypic behaviors.",

    "relevant_summary": "Beyond dietary changes, several environmental and social husbandry actions can promote amphibian breeding success in captive settings. These include providing specific enclosure furniture such as rotting logs, hollow bamboo pipes, and varied substrates to create calling sites and breeding areas [1876]. Simulating seasonal changes through temperature variation (dropping from 20-24\u00b0C to 17\u00b0C) has been shown to stimulate breeding [1864], as has varying artificial rainfall to simulate wet and dry seasons [1872]. Managing social dynamics through allowing female mate choice [1882], separating sexes during non-breeding periods [1880], and playing recorded breeding calls to simulate the breeding season [1881] are also effective strategies. Using surrogate species to refine husbandry techniques before working with target critically endangered species has proven beneficial [1862]. Hormonal treatments can also be used to induce sperm and egg release, with 30-71% of females producing viable eggs following treatment [883]. A combined approach incorporating multiple factors - such as pre-breeding cooling periods, allowing females to gain weight before breeding, providing mate choice, playing recorded calls, and using enclosures with proper furniture and flowing water - has shown increased breeding success and larger clutch sizes [1864, 1882, 1880, 1881].",

Four found that the amount and viability of sperm produced was affected by the type, amount or number of doses of hormone.\\nOne review and nine of 14 replicated studies (including six randomized and/or controlled studies) in Australia, Canada, China, Ecuador, Latvia and the USA\\u00a0found that hormone treatment of female amphibians had mixed results, with 30\\u201371% of females producing viable eggs following treatment, or with egg production depending on the combination, amount or number of doses of hormones. Three found that hormone treatment stimulated egg production or successful breeding in captivity. Two found that hormone treatment did not stimulate or increase egg production.\\nFive replicated studies (including one controlled study) in Canada, Latvia and the USA found that eggs induced by hormone treatment were raised successfully to tadpoles, toadlets or froglets in captivity. Two replicated studies, one of which was small, in Ecuador and the USA found that most toads died before or soon after hatching.\"\n}"

A combined approach incorporating multiple factors - such as pre-breeding cooling periods, allowing females to gain weight before breeding, providing mate choice, playing recorded calls, and using enclosures with proper furniture and flowing water - has shown increased breeding success and larger clutch sizes [1864, 1882, 1880, 1881].\", \"action_ids\": [\"1862\", \"1876\", \"1865\", \"1864\", \"1863\", \"1872\", \"1882\", \"1880\", \"1881\", \"883\"]}",
