One study found that the species richness of butterflies was higher in grassland managed by sheep and cattle grazing than in grassland mown annually for hay in June. One study found that the species richness of moths was higher in grassland managed by annual mowing than grassland managed by grazing, and the species richness of butterflies was highest in grasslands where mowing was staggered throughout the year, with some areas left uncut. The sixth study found that in some areas, the species richness of specialist and grassland butterflies was higher in prairies managed by two-year rotational haying, and in other areas it was higher in prairies managed by grazing, but in all cases richness was higher at sites longer after they were last managed.

One of three replicated, site comparison studies in Germany\\u00a0and Switzerland\\u00a0found that traditional hay meadows mown once/year in June or July had a higher abundance of heath fritillary adults and caterpillars than old, abandoned meadows. One study found that summer-grazed or mown grasslands had a higher abundance of farmland butterflies and burnet moths, but a lower abundance of woodland butterflies and burnet moths, than abandoned grasslands. The third study found that mown grasslands had a lower abundance of moths than unmown grasslands, but grazed grasslands had a similar abundance of moths to ungrazed grasslands. Two replicated, site comparison studies in China\\u00a0and Switzerland\\u00a0found that semi-natural grasslands managed by grazing\\u00a0or cutting twice/year after mid-June\\u00a0had a lower abundance of marsh fritillary eggs and caterpillars\\u00a0and adult butterflies\\u00a0than ungrazed margins and intercrops\\u00a0or sown wildflower strips. One replicated, site comparison study in Hungary\\u00a0found that semi-natural grasslands managed by either light grazing or mowing once/year in May or June had a higher abundance of butterflies than conventional wheat fields.\\nSurvival (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in China\\u00a0found that marsh fritillary eggs had a similar survival rate in uncultivated, grazed meadows and cultivated, ungrazed field margins and intercrops, but the survival of caterpillars was higher in the grazed meadows.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (5 STUDIES)\\nUse (5 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies in Austria\\u00a0and Germany\\u00a0found that 14 species of moth\\u00a0preferred grazed pastures while 24 others avoided them, and three species of butterfly\\u00a0and ten nocturnal moths\\u00a0preferred mown meadows, while 19 nocturnal moth species avoided them. One replicated, site comparison study in Spain\\u00a0found that meadows managed by summer-grazing or hay-mowing were more likely to be occupied by grizzled skipper and painted lady than unmanaged meadows, but small pearl-bordered fritillary occurred less frequently in grazed meadows than in hay meadows or abandoned meadows.

    "relevant_summary": "Across multiple study types and farm systems, reducing or eliminating fertilizers, pesticides or herbicides was associated with higher species richness and/or abundance of butterflies, moths or their caterpillars compared to conventional or more frequent chemical applications, though some studies reported similar values in certain contexts. Studies reported greater species richness in orchards, crop edges, farms, vineyards, replanted forest stands, coffee plantations and agricultural landscapes with reduced or no chemical inputs, and higher richness of specialist moths on unfertilized grassland, while some sites showed similar richness to conventional management (3897). On permanent grasslands, lower-input management and stopping chemical applications were linked to higher species richness of butterflies and moths, more specialist moths and species of conservation concern, and increases in large moth species richness after grazing was reduced and chemicals stopped (3958). Abundance responses included higher abundance of adult butterflies and moths, and caterpillars under reduced or no chemical inputs in several settings, with some studies reporting similar or mixed results (3897). On low-input or unfertilized, ungrazed grasslands managed with a single cut, abundance of butterflies, micro‑moths and declining macro‑moths was higher than on intensively managed grassland, and after reducing grazing and stopping chemicals, total abundance of large moths and several butterfly species increased (3958). In vineyards, fewer chemical inputs were linked to greater butterfly species richness in Spain and greater abundance in the USA, while one USA study found similar species richness where insecticide was rarely used (3919). In orchards, unmanaged or partially managed sites had higher richness and diversity of leaf‑eating arthropods (including caterpillars) than commercially managed sites, and managed orchards had lower abundance of butterflies and burnet moths than abandoned orchards (3917). Conversion to organic farming was associated in several studies with greater species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths than on conventional farms, sometimes varying with landscape context and time since conversion; a before‑and‑after study reported increases in large moth abundance and some butterfly species after conversion alongside other management changes (3907).",

    "relevant_summary": "Evidence-based, non-burning disturbance options in forests include: (1) Thinning trees: studies reported higher butterfly richness and/or abundance one to four years after thinning (often alongside mulching or nearby felling) compared to unmanaged woodland, though one study found similar richness/abundance and rarer fruit-feeding species were less frequent in thinned forest; partially-cleared plots had higher butterfly but lower moth richness than closed-canopy forest [3940]. (2) Coppicing woodland: multiple studies found higher abundance of butterflies generally and of species such as heath fritillary in recently coppiced stands; coppice age influenced communities and richness; some studies reported lower macro-moth richness/abundance than mature forest; fritillary populations were more likely to persist for up to 20 years in coppiced or young-plantation woodlands; increases were also reported after coppicing combined with scrub control, felling, and grazing [3939]. (3) Clearing or opening patches (including widening rides): cleared patches often had greater butterfly richness and abundance than unmanaged or closed-canopy forest, with larger patches performing better; benefits were shown for species such as chequered blue, woodland brown, high brown fritillary, and small pearl-bordered fritillary; some studies noted declines over three years post-clearing and lower macro-moth abundance in wider rides; a European review reported benefits for 19 of 67 species of conservation concern; selected pine clearance supported increases and survival of a translocated baton blue population [3938]. (4) Creating young plantations within mature woodland: larger areas of young plantations (or coppicing) were associated with higher persistence of pearl-bordered and small pearl-bordered fritillaries over 20 years compared to mature conifer (both species) and mature deciduous (pearl-bordered fritillary) woodland [3941]. (5) Forest restoration with structural interventions (coppicing, felling, ride management/widening): studies reported that populations of high brown fritillary, pearl-bordered fritillary, wood white and grizzled skipper stayed the same or increased; butterflies such as heath fritillary occupied greater areas post-restoration and were more likely to fly into restored than unrestored areas; high brown fritillary presence was maintained or higher, with associations to brash/bracken litter coverage after restoration [3936]. Additionally, reducing planting density to create warmer woodlands has been proposed, but no studies were found evaluating effects on butterflies or moths [3875].",

Abundance: Across 19 studies in the UK, Sweden, Switzerland and Germany, 17 reported higher abundance of butterflies/moths (overall or for specific species) in woodland, grassland, field margins, wildflower strips or whole farms under AES than in unmanaged or conventional sites, while two found similar abundance on margins; three of four UK/Swiss studies found higher butterfly abundance on farms or in landscapes with a higher proportion of AES land, while one found species‑specific mixed responses; in Finland and the Czech Republic, three studies reported lower abundance on grazed or restored AES grasslands than on unmanaged grassland, and one case showed a decline in Danube clouded yellow after AES mowing began on abandoned grasslands [3915]. Behaviour: no studies [3915]. Specific AES options: Undersowing spring cereals showed mixed results—one UK randomized, controlled study found higher butterfly richness and abundance but lower caterpillar abundance than on extensively or conventionally managed grassland, whereas a Swiss site comparison found similar butterfly richness and abundance on farms with more in‑field AES options (including undersown cereals) compared to farms with fewer such options [3926].",

Following management by haying, prairie specialist abundance differed between the first and second year after haying [3945]. After restoration actions in wet meadows (tree and shrub removal), marsh fritillary caterpillar webs increased the following year [3971]. Over 1–6 years after abandonment of mowing and grazing, the butterfly community shifted toward generalists and species with fewer generations per year [3957][3956]. Species- or group-specific responses were reported around six years since abandonment (e.g., similar heath fritillary abundance to annually mown sites) and contrasts beyond 25 years (lower adults, no caterpillars) [3957]. Comparative studies assessed communities and populations across 3–13, 5–15, 5–20, and >10 years since abandonment, showing differing richness and abundance patterns depending on duration and taxa [3957][3956]. Butterfly density was higher where grazing ceased 2–9 years earlier than in sites abandoned >10 years or still grazed [3956]. Very long-term comparisons (>50 years since abandonment) also recorded lower species richness than more recently mown sites [3957].",

Creating uncultivated margins and adjusting cutting to avoid summer cuts (no cutting or spring/autumn only) increased butterfly species richness and abundance compared to summer-cut margins, wider uncultivated margins had higher butterfly abundance than conventional-width margins, and uncultivated margins supported more butterflies than cropped field edges in the UK [3981]. Establishing grass buffer strips/margins increased butterfly abundance over cropped field edges in several UK studies, and in some cases 2‑m margins had higher butterfly species richness than cropped edges; wider grass margins supported higher richness or abundance of some butterfly and moth groups in the UK [3982]. Along water bodies, buffer strips with restrictions on fertilizer and pesticide use (and reduced mowing/grazing) increased moth abundance compared to conventional margins, although species richness was similar [3894].",

    "relevant_summary": "Across US prairies, prairies managed by haying had higher abundance of prairie specialist butterflies than prairies managed by burning, while generalist and migrant butterflies were less abundant under haying than burning; specialist abundance after haying was higher in the first year than the second (3945). Under prescribed burning, some prairie specialists (including regal fritillary and arogos skipper) and several individual species were less abundant in burned prairies or pastures than in hayed prairies or grazed pastures, whereas generalist and migrant species (and purplish copper) were more abundant in burned than in hayed or grazed sites; other studies reported species increasing one or more years after burning, species decreasing five years after burning, and responses depending on site vegetation, indicating mixed effects on abundance (3882). Under rotational burning, butterfly abundance tended to be higher on prairies burned more than 1–4 years ago than on recently burned prairies; some studies found total butterfly abundance higher than unmanaged sites (and higher than grazing alone) under rotational burning, but comparisons with haying or grazing showed mixed results, with some fritillary species unaffected and others lower under rotational burning than with haying or grazing; for regal fritillary, abundance was higher four years after the last burn than one or eight years, and varied seasonally within the first year post-burn (3883). For grazing, rotationally cattle-grazed US grasslands had similar butterfly communities to continuously grazed or patch-burned grasslands, and species-level abundance responses were mixed (two higher, two lower, five similar vs continuous grazing or patch-burning); rotationally managed grasslands (including rotationally grazed) had higher butterfly abundance when more time had passed since last management (3965).",

Four of these studies found that grasslands managed by cattle, sheep\\u00a0or livestock\\u00a0grazing had a higher abundance of butterflies generally, and individual species of butterflies\\u00a0and moth caterpillars, than grasslands managed by annual mowing, rotational burning\\u00a0or unmanaged grasslands. Three of these studies found that grasslands managed by haying had a higher abundance of individual butterfly species\\u00a0than grasslands managed by grazing\\u00a0or burning\\u00a0or unmanaged grasslands. Four of these studies found that specific butterfly species\\u00a0and all butterflies\\u00a0were less abundant in mown, grazed\\u00a0or rotationally burned\\u00a0grassland than in unmanaged, rotationally burned\\u00a0or grazed and burned grassland.\\u00a0The ninth study found that in some areas, the abundance of specialist and grassland butterflies was higher in prairies managed by two-year rotational haying or by grazing, but in all cases abundance was higher at sites longer after they were last managed. One of three replicated, site comparison studies in Germany\\u00a0and Switzerland\\u00a0found that traditional hay meadows mown once/year in June or July had a higher abundance of heath fritillary adults and caterpillars than old, abandoned meadows. One study found that summer-grazed or mown grasslands had a higher abundance of farmland butterflies and burnet moths, but a lower abundance of woodland butterflies and burnet moths, than abandoned grasslands. The third study found that mown grasslands had a lower abundance of moths than unmown grasslands, but grazed grasslands had a similar abundance of moths to ungrazed grasslands. Two replicated, site comparison studies in China\\u00a0and Switzerland\\u00a0found that semi-natural grasslands managed by grazing\\u00a0or cutting twice/year after mid-June\\u00a0had a lower abundance of marsh fritillary eggs and caterpillars\\u00a0and adult butterflies\\u00a0than ungrazed margins and intercrops\\u00a0or sown wildflower strips. One replicated, site comparison study in Hungary\\u00a0found that semi-natural grasslands managed by either light grazing or mowing once/year in May or June had a higher abundance of butterflies than conventional wheat fields.\\nSurvival (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in China\\u00a0found that marsh fritillary eggs had a similar survival rate in uncultivated, grazed meadows and cultivated, ungrazed field margins and intercrops, but the survival of caterpillars was higher in the grazed meadows.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (5 STUDIES)\\nUse (5 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies in Austria\\u00a0and Germany\\u00a0found that 14 species of moth\\u00a0preferred grazed pastures while 24 others avoided them, and three species of butterfly\\u00a0and ten nocturnal moths\\u00a0preferred mown meadows, while 19 nocturnal moth species avoided them. One replicated, site comparison study in Spain\\u00a0found that meadows managed by summer-grazing or hay-mowing were more likely to be occupied by grizzled skipper and painted lady than unmanaged meadows, but small pearl-bordered fritillary occurred less frequently in grazed meadows than in hay meadows or abandoned meadows. One replicated, site comparison study in Finland and Russia\\u00a0found that three of 37 butterfly species preferred meadows which were mown annually in July or August to cattle-grazed pasture, but the other 34 species showed no preference.

Floristically enhanced margins (wildflower-enriched buffers) also frequently increase butterfly abundance: four replicated studies found higher abundance than standard grass margins or uncultivated margins, and three of four replicated, controlled studies found grass margins had higher abundance than cropped edges, though effects of margin width were mixed (positive in three of seven studies for habitat-sensitive taxa) [3982]. Evidence for other habitat-creation options is less consistent: uncropped, cultivated margins/plots produced mixed outcomes, with some studies reporting higher butterfly and micro‑moth abundance under AES or with wider margins, while others found similar abundance to simpler AES or conventional management [3923]; undersown spring cereals increased butterfly abundance in a UK trial but showed similar abundance to other farms in Switzerland [3926]; wild bird seed/cover plots yielded higher butterfly abundance than wheat or grassland in two UK studies but farm‑scale results were mixed across taxa [3930]; beetle banks generally showed similar caterpillar abundance to other field-edge habitats and lower adult butterfly abundance than hedgerows, with higher micro‑moth but not macro‑moth abundance compared to conventional margins [3927]. Broadly, many studies report higher lepidopteran abundance on farms or habitats managed under AES compared to conventional management across woodland, grassland, margins and wildflower strips [3915].",

Coffee plantations: Three studies (Mexico, Puerto Rico) reported that shaded systems can benefit Lepidoptera—fruit‑eating butterfly richness was highest where the original canopy was retained and the understory replaced with coffee compared to alternative shade configurations, shaded coffee had higher caterpillar species richness than sun monoculture, and caterpillar abundance was greater in shade‑grown than sun‑grown coffee, while one study found similar abundance of coffee leaf miner between shade and sun systems [3931]. Trees within perennial crop plantations: In Costa Rican coffee farms, having both a native and a non‑native tree species increased butterfly diversity compared to a single non‑native shade species, but was similar to two non‑native species; butterfly richness and abundance were similar across farm types [3920]. Orchards: In Germany, managed orchards had similar butterfly/burnet moth species richness and community composition to abandoned orchards but lower abundance; in the USA, unmanaged and partially managed orchards had greater richness and diversity of leaf‑eating arthropods (including caterpillars) than a commercially managed orchard [3917].",

In UK waterbody margins with restrictions on fertiliser and pesticide use (plus restricted mowing/grazing), moth abundance increased while moth species richness was similar to conventional margins [3894]. On permanent grasslands managed with lower inputs (including reduced or stopped chemical applications), butterfly and moth species richness was often higher (though sometimes similar), and a UK before-and-after study reported increased large moth species richness after grazing reduction and stopping chemical applications; abundance of several groups also increased, with some species-specific decreases reported [3958]. Leaving arable headlands unsprayed increased butterfly species richness and often increased abundances of butterflies and caterpillars compared to sprayed headlands [3898]. Stopping herbicide use on pavements/road verges led to greater butterfly species richness and abundance in restored roadside prairies in the USA, while Canadian transmission lines without spraying/mowing had higher abundances of certain butterfly species but similar total richness and abundance [3899]. In gardens, not using insecticides and herbicides was associated with higher butterfly abundance, whereas not using fungicides and snail pellets was associated with lower butterfly abundance [3900]. Converting farms to organic management (which avoids synthetic pesticides and fertilisers) often increased butterfly and moth species richness and abundance compared to conventional farms, though several studies found similar richness or abundance, and increases were sometimes context-dependent (e.g., more evident in intensively managed landscapes or within a few years post-conversion) [3907].",

Mechanical cutting of heathland or barrens can maintain open conditions and, in some cases, support higher or unchanged butterfly abundances compared to burning or previous burn-based management—for example, Karner blue abundance was higher where pine barrens were mechanically cut than where they were rotationally burned or left as unburned refuges, and switching from rotational burning to unintensive cutting did not change abundance of five other species; in UK heathland, scrub cutting with other interventions coincided with increases of high brown fritillary and small pearl-bordered fritillary (3947). Changing mowing regimes shows mixed outcomes: haying increased prairie specialist butterflies but decreased generalist and migrant butterflies compared to burning; Karner blue abundance under mowing was similar to unmanaged or burned sites; season of mowing mattered for a moth, with August mowing reducing caterpillars while November mowing did not (3945). Across species-rich grasslands, comparisons of mowing/haying versus grazing or burning show variable responses: some studies found similar butterfly richness or abundance between mown and grazed sites, others found higher richness or abundance under grazing or under haying depending on region, species group, or time since management; in several cases, staggered mowing increased butterfly richness, while mowing reduced nocturnal moth richness compared to unmown grasslands (3908). Rotational burning produced diverse effects: butterfly richness was sometimes higher than on unmanaged or annually burned/mown sites but could be lower than unmanaged in some regions; abundance often peaked several years post-burn and was higher under burn-plus-graze than either alone in some studies, though certain taxa (e.g., grass-skippers) declined more strongly under rotational burning; species-specific responses varied, with regal fritillary often benefiting, especially several years after the last burn (3883). Overall, mowing/haying, mechanical cutting, and rotational burning are principal alternatives to grazing, with community and population responses varying by taxa, timing, and management combinations as documented in the cited studies (3947; 3945; 3908; 3883).",

Overall, mowing/haying, mechanical cutting, and rotational burning are principal alternatives to grazing, with community and population responses varying by taxa, timing, and management combinations as documented in the cited studies (3947; 3945; 3908; 3883).\",\"action_ids\":[\"3947\",\"3945\",\"3908\",\"3883\"]}",

Mechanical cutting of heathland or barrens can maintain open conditions and, in some cases, support higher or unchanged butterfly abundances compared to burning or previous burn-based management\\u2014for example, Karner blue abundance was higher where pine barrens were mechanically cut than where they were rotationally burned or left as unburned refuges, and switching from rotational burning to unintensive cutting did not change abundance of five other species; in UK heathland, scrub cutting with other interventions coincided with increases of high brown fritillary and small pearl-bordered fritillary (3947). Changing mowing regimes shows mixed outcomes: haying increased prairie specialist butterflies but decreased generalist and migrant butterflies compared to burning; Karner blue abundance under mowing was similar to unmanaged or burned sites; season of mowing mattered for a moth, with August mowing reducing caterpillars while November mowing did not (3945).
