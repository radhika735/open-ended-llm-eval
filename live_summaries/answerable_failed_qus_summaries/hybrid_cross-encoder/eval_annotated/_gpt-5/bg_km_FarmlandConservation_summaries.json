However, some studies found negative or no clear effects on certain farmland bird species or plants, a net loss of plant species after raising water levels, and no effect on lapwing foraging; re-wetting old arable soils was not effective for reducing nutrients or restoring species-rich grassland, and unflooded pastures held high macroinvertebrate biomass important to wading birds [135][121]. Creating ponds is widely used by amphibians, with many studies reporting similar or higher species numbers than natural ponds, stable populations in a substantial fraction of created ponds, and population increases; yet some studies reported differing species composition, lower species numbers depending on water permanence, and less stable populations in created ponds [869]. Restoring ponds by deepening, de-silting or re-profiling has been associated with establishment or increases of populations of several amphibians, including great crested newts, common frogs, tree frogs, European fire-bellied toads, natterjack toads, and translocated garlic toads [817].

Establishing wildflower areas on farmland resulted in higher abundances of wood mice, small mammals and common hamsters than in grass/clover set-aside, grasslands, crop and uncultivated margins, agricultural areas and crop fields (2359). Providing or retaining set-aside did not enhance small mammal numbers relative to cropland or to uncultivated field margins and farm woodland, though use of uncut set-aside by wood mice increased after crop harvest (2377). Providing supplementary food was used by field voles (on unmown plots) (648). Planting crops to provide supplementary food increased small mammal abundance in winter (UK) and increased European rabbit abundance (Spain) (2394). Reducing livestock grazing intensity was associated with increases in abundances of small mammals in several European studies, but did not increase European or Irish hare numbers (2408). Fencing to exclude predators or other problematic species increased abundances of small mammals in some studies and increased rabbit abundance when both terrestrial carnivores and raptors were excluded in Spain (2497). Prescribed burning showed mixed effects on small mammals, with some studies reporting increases in European rabbits and others finding no increase (2388). No studies were found evaluating maintaining/restoring/creating habitat connectivity for mammals on farmland (2381).",

One replicated, controlled study from Sweden found no effect of supplementary food provision on common starling clutch size or nestling weight, and lower fledging rates in nests which received supplementary food compared to nests without supplementary food in one year.\\nFour studies from the UK (two replicated of which one was also randomized and controlled) found that the use of supplementary food by farmland birds varied between species and region, depended upon the time of year and proximity to other feeding stations and natural feeding areas.\"\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "• Hedgerows: In Madagascar, reptile communities in cultivated areas with hedges were more similar to forest communities than those without hedges, and more reptile species were found only where hedges were present [3519]. For butterflies and moths, studies from the UK, Ireland and Canada reported higher species richness and/or abundance along hedgerows than on beetle banks, non-hedgerow grass margins, field interiors or 5–10 m away, with one study finding similar richness to grass banks; planting gorse, oak and blackthorn within hedgerows supported more arthropod species (including caterpillars) than hawthorn, and moths near hedgerows were more likely to fly parallel to them [3976]. For bats, hedges trimmed ≥3 years prior had more bat species recorded and higher activity for two of eight species/species groups than hedges trimmed the previous winter, while pipistrelle activity did not differ between hedges managed for wildlife under agri‑environment schemes and hedges on conventional farms; no studies were found assessing planting new hedges for bats [1943, 1942]. For mammals, establishing or retaining/enhancing hedgerows alongside arable land increased small mammal abundance, brown hare density was higher in arable sites but not grassland sites, and Irish hare numbers did not increase [2383].\n• Beetle banks (general biodiversity): Reviews and replicated studies from the UK and Denmark reported mixed outcomes: some positive effects on invertebrate densities, distributions, ground beetle density and diversity (often season‑dependent), variation among grass species, group‑specific responses, several findings of lower or no differences relative to other habitats, bird use or increases when combined with other measures with mixed/no associations in other cases, lower plant species richness on banks in summer or limited benefits relative to other margins, and evidence that beetle banks act as nest sites for harvest mice [651]. For butterflies and moths in the UK, beetle banks had lower butterfly richness and adult abundance than hedgerows, similar caterpillar abundance to margins and crops, and higher micro‑moth richness and abundance than conventionally managed margins, with similar macro‑moth richness/abundance [3927]. For mammals, beetle banks had higher densities of harvest mouse nests than field margins [2393]. For natural enemies and pests, multiple studies and reviews from Canada, the UK and USA found more invertebrate predators on beetle banks than crops in several cases (with temporal/seasonal variability), mixed comparisons versus other refuges, variable or limited spillover into crops, largest pest reductions closest to or on banks, fewer pests in fields with a bank in one review, potential economic savings if pest thresholds are avoided, and higher predator numbers on certain sown grass species [729].\n• Other linear features: No evidence was found on managing stone‑faced hedge banks to benefit farmland wildlife [73].",

Excluding livestock benefited plants and invertebrates in some studies [150], and, for mammals, increased small mammal species richness in two studies and higher abundances for some small mammals, mule deer, and (with water provision) European rabbits in several studies [2407].

Documented negative or neutral impacts include studies finding no benefits to plants, birds, or invertebrates when grazing was reduced or excluded [150, 704], mixed or neutral effects when exclusion was used as a restoration tool [150], and cases where grazing exclusion did not increase abundances of black-tailed hares, California ground squirrel burrows, or several small mammal species [2407]. On fenland, excluding cattle reduced the number of plant species, while reviews indicate low–medium grazing can have positive effects on fen biodiversity, sometimes needing additional management [697].

    "relevant_summary": "Technique: Across Germany, Ireland, Switzerland and the UK, specific wildlife‑friendly mowing techniques reduced mortality or injury in birds, mammals, amphibians and invertebrates, and UK corncrake populations increased during periods when Corncrake Friendly Mowing schemes were introduced [698]; UK evidence also reports lower mortality of corncrakes and Eurasian skylarks with wildlife‑friendly mowing, alongside population increases following schemes that delayed mowing and promoted corncrake‑friendly techniques [192]. Mowing from the centre outwards allowed 68% of corncrake chicks to escape vs 45% with conventional edge‑in mowing [698]. Machinery choice affected outcomes: bar mowers and double‑chop mowers caused less damage or lower mortality for amphibians/invertebrates than alternatives, rotary disc mowers with conditioners killed about twice as many small mammals as double‑blade mowers, using a conditioner increased invertebrate injury/mortality in some studies, mower‑conditioners yielded higher Eurasian skylark nest survival than using a tedder, wider mowing machinery was associated with fourfold higher skylark chick survival, and swather mowers/forage harvesters had the highest skylark nest survival [698].\n\nTiming: Delaying mowing or first grazing often benefited some plants, invertebrates and birds (e.g., higher plant richness, more flower‑visiting insects, greater abundance of some spiders/ground beetles, increased breeding wader densities, and increased Eurasian skylark productivity), and UK corncrake populations increased after measures including delayed mowing were introduced, though several studies found no clear effects for some taxa or metrics [131]. In arable/grass systems, delayed cutting produced mixed to neutral effects on predatory insects and pests, with outcomes varying among groups and studies [727]. Changing mowing date/regime altered Lepidoptera responses: August mowing reduced Fisher’s estuarine moth caterpillars whereas November mowing or no mowing did not; haying yielded higher prairie specialist butterfly abundance but lower generalist/migrant abundance than burning; mowing produced Karner blue abundances similar to unmanaged or burned sites [3945].\n\nHeight: Raising cutting height (around 9–10 cm vs 5–6 cm) resulted in similar butterfly richness and abundance, similar caterpillar abundance and survival, and similar damage rates to wax model caterpillars in replicated randomized/controlled studies in the UK and Switzerland [3968].",

For some linear features there is currently no direct evidence: restoring or maintaining dry stone walls (74); managing stone‑faced hedge banks to benefit wildlife or birds (73, 179); and managing ditches to benefit bats has no studies (1944).",

Field margins sown with agricultural nectar and pollen mixes attracted significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated, grassy or cropped margins; mixes of agricultural forage plants (including legumes) attracted more bumblebees than perennial wildflower mixes in the first year, but margins with agricultural legumes degraded in value over time and required re-sowing every few years (18). Uncropped margins sown with native wild flower seed mixes supported higher abundance (and in several trials higher species richness) of foraging bumblebees than cropped edges, grassy margins or naturally regenerated margins; perennial leguminous herbs were important forage, and some long‑tongued bumblebees preferred perennial wildflower mixes over annual forage mixes (19). Planting nettle strips in arable margins increased the number of aphid predator species relative to crops, with some predator families only found on nettles, although nettle strips had fewer predators than crops and natural nettle patches had more predators than crops (118). For birds, some studies found more birds used nectar/wildflower strips than crops or other managements, while others found no winter increase; skylarks were more likely to nest, and less likely to abandon nests, in patches sown with annual weeds than in crops, and margin management influenced bird use more than seed mix (189).",

The other study found that, five years after sowing wildflower strips, butterfly species richness, but not diversity had increased at one of two study sites. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the UK\\u00a0found that the species richness of butterflies and moths was similar on farms managed under agri-environment schemes, including with sown wildflower strips, and on conventionally managed farms.

Two of these studies also found that the abundance of specialist butterflies\\u00a0and meadow brown caterpillars\\u00a0was similar in sown wildflower strips and unsown margins, cropped fields\\u00a0and conventional grassland, and one found that the abundance of caterpillars was lower in sown wildflower strips than in conventional grassland.
