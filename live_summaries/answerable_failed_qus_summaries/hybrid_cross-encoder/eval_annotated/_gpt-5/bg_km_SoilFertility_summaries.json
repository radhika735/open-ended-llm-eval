    "relevant_summary": "Across studies, adding organic materials to soil commonly increased microbial biomass and activity when manure was mixed with inorganic fertilizers, with manure alone also increasing microbial biomass; one trial found increased microbial diversity [902], and microbial biomass also rose when crop remains or straw were added [910] and when residues were retained [907]. Mixed organic\u2013inorganic amendments raised soil organic carbon and nutrients in several trials, with manure alone also boosting carbon; one trial found inconsistent nutrient effects [902]; incorporating plant material increased soil carbon across multiple studies and sometimes increased aggregate size, and straw combined with NPK raised carbon [910]; retaining residues increased soil organic carbon and nitrogen, sometimes only when fertilizer was applied [907]. Straw addition reduced soil loss in one study, with mixed erosion effects depending on soil type [910]; residue retention reduced water runoff, increased water storage and reduced erosion, though some soil physical properties showed mixed responses and tillage influenced erosion when residues were removed [907]; mixed amendments reduced the size of cracks in dry soil compared to inorganic fertilizer alone or no fertilizer [902]. Nitrogen levels rose with compost or straw in several studies, and straw incorporation reduced nitrate leaching, although processed wastes showed mixed nutrient results and site effects were mixed in some comparisons [910]. Yields increased with mixed manure\u2013inorganic amendments for maize [902]; barley yield rose with straw, and earlier incorporation of crop remains increased grain yields in one trial [910]; retaining residues increased yields, sometimes only with fertilizer and no-tillage [907]. Incorporating allelopathic plant remains sometimes reduced weeds relative to weeded or unweeded controls but effects varied by year, weed group or residue; suppression could be short-lived; crop growth was sometimes inhibited but could be mitigated by timing; yield effects were positive, negative or mixed, and profit exceeded unweeded but not weeded controls in one study [728]. In a salt marsh, adding organic alginate increased smooth cordgrass density and later plant height, while biomass after 52 weeks was similar to unamended plots [3244].",

Using a mix of organic and inorganic amendments reduced the size of cracks in dry soil compared to inorganic fertilizers alone or no fertilizer (902).
