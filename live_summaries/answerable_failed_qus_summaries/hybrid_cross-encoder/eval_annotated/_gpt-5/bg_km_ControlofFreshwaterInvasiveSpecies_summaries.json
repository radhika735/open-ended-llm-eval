For water primrose, triclopyr TEA at 0.25% killed 100% of young cultivated plants in a lab study, glyphosate achieved 97% mortality with a non\\u2011oil sticking agent and 100% with TopFilm in a UK field study, and halosulfuron\\u2011methyl significantly reduced coverage without apparent toxicity to rice (IDs: 1139). Adjuvants and formulation influence efficacy: adding specific sticking agents (non\\u2011oil vs TopFilm) altered water primrose mortality from 97% to 100% (ID: 1139). Application context matters: plant age (young plants) and setting (laboratory vs field; presence of rice crop) were linked to different effectiveness and selectivity outcomes (ID: 1139). Integrating chemical applications with other methods can affect results: glyphosate plus the surfactant Cygnet\\u2011Plus followed by mechanical removal achieved a 75% kill rate of water primrose in California, and a broader program combining herbicide, physical removal, native plant promotion, and mulching reduced Peruvian primrose\\u2011willow coverage by 85\\u201390% in Australia (ID: 1140).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"1102\",\n    \"1139\",\n    \"1140\"\n  ]\n}"

Trapping efficiency can be increased by baiting: a controlled, replicated study in Italy found that traps baited with food (tinned meat) captured the most crayfish, with over half of all captures occurring in food-baited traps compared to pheromone-baited or unbaited controls (1029).
