For parrot’s feather, multiple herbicides reduced growth in lab or field: 2,4‑D (often outperforming diquat, glyphosate or imazapyr in one lab study) and reducing biomass in field [1606]; triclopyr reduced growth and cover but cover later rebounded in one field study [1689]; endothall reduced growth but cover later returned to pre‑treatment levels in one field study [1681]; diquat reduced growth in lab but not in one field study [1680]; imazamox and imazapyr reduced growth in lab, glyphosate and glufosinate‑ammonium reduced biomass in field, but fluridone, clopyralid and copper chelate did not reduce growth, while flumioxazin and florpyrauxifen‑benzyl reduced growth [1699]; carfentrazone‑ethyl reduced growth in multiple lab studies [1676]. Combination treatments can improve outcomes: 2,4‑D plus MCPA completely eliminated parrot’s feather in one field study [1606], and 2,4‑D plus carfentrazone‑ethyl gave greater short‑term cover reduction than dichlobenil, though not at 45 days [1606]. Adjuvants influenced success for water primrose (glyphosate efficacy increased with a sticking agent or TopFilm) [1139]. Persistence of control varies, with some treatments showing initial reduction followed by regrowth (endothall, triclopyr, dichlobenil) [1681, 1689, 1699]. Concentration and exposure time mattered in at least one case (triclopyr TEA 0.25% over two months achieved complete kill of young water primrose in lab) [1139].",

Cleaning equipment to prevent transfer of Ponto-Caspian gammarids has been proposed but no studies directly evaluated this action [1096]. Exchanging ballast water to limit transfer of Ponto-Caspian gammarids has been proposed but no studies directly evaluated this action [1097]. Cleaning hulls, anchors and chains of vessels has been proposed to limit invertebrate transfer, but no studies directly evaluated effects on subtidal invertebrate populations [2166]. Implementing biosecurity measures to prevent introductions of problematic species has been proposed, but no studies directly evaluated their effects in the evidence base cited [1767].

Replicated, controlled studies in Italy found that eels preyed on red swamp crayfish and reduced their population size, and a study in France reported pike predation on red swamp crayfish (1030). Trapping efficiency can be increased by baiting: a controlled, replicated study in Italy found that traps baited with food (tinned meat) captured the most crayfish, with over half of all captures occurring in food-baited traps compared to pheromone-baited or unbaited controls (1029). To limit spread, concrete dams designed to prevent crayfish climbing were effective at containing upstream expansion in Spain (1037). Additionally, in a replicated laboratory study in Italy, X-ray sterilization of males reduced offspring production by 43% (1032).",
