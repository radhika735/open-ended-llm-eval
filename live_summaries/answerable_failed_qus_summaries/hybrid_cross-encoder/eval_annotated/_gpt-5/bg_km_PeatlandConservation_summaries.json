Fifteen studies were in bogs (two\\u00a0being restored as fens). Fifteen studies were in fens or fen meadows\\u00a0(two\\u00a0were naturally forested). Six studies were in general or unspecified peatlands. Some studies were based on the same experimental set-up or sites as each other: two studies in Germany, three studies in Sweden, two studies in west Finland\\u00a0and two studies in south Finland.\\nPlant community composition (13 studies):\\u00a0Six before-and-after studies (four also replicated) in peatlands in Finland, Hungary, Sweden, Poland\\u00a0and Germany\\u00a0reported changes in the overall plant community composition following rewetting. Typically, drier grassland communities were replaced by more wetland- or peatland-characteristic communities.\\u00a0One replicated, paired, controlled study in a bog in the Czech Republic\\u00a0found that rewetted plots developed a different plant community to drained plots. Three site comparison studies in Finland\\u00a0and Canada\\u00a0reported that rewetted peatlands contained a different plant community to natural peatlands. Three replicated studies in peatlands in the UK\\u00a0and fens in Germany\\u00a0reported that rewetting typically had no effect, or insignificant effects, on the plant community.\\nCharacteristic plants (11 studies): Five studies (including one replicated site comparison) in peatlands in Canada, the UK, China\\u00a0and Poland\\u00a0reported that rewetting (sometimes\\u00a0along with other interventions) increased the abundance of wetland- or peatland-characteristic plants. Two replicated site comparison studies in fens or fen meadows in central Europe\\u00a0found that rewetting reduced the number of fen-characteristic plant species. Two studies (one replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after) in fens in Sweden\\u00a0reported that rewetting had no effect on cover of fen-characteristic plants.\\u00a0Two before-and-after studies in fens in the USA\\u00a0and New Zealand\\u00a0reported that upland plant cover decreased following rewetting.\\u00a0\\nMoss cover (19 studies):\\u00a0Twelve studies (five replicated, two also paired and controlled) in the UK, Ireland, Germany,\\u00a0Sweden, Latvia, Canada\\u00a0and Spain\\u00a0reported that rewetting bogs, fens or other peatlands (sometimes\\u00a0along with other interventions) increased Sphagnum moss cover or abundance. Three of these studies\\u00a0reported mixed responses by species. Two additional replicated studies, in bogs in Latvia\\u00a0and forested fens in Finland, reported that rewetting had no effect on Sphagnum\\u00a0cover. Five studies (one paired, controlled, before-and-after) in Finland, Sweden\\u00a0and Canada\\u00a0reported that rewetting bogs or fens had no effect on cover of non-Sphagnum mosses (or mosses/lichens). However, two controlled studies in bogs in Ireland\\u00a0and the UK\\u00a0reported that rewetting reduced cover of non-Sphagnum mosses\\u00a0or bryophytes. One site comparison study in Finland\\u00a0reported that a rewetted peatland had similar moss cover (Sphagnum and total) to a natural peatland, but another site comparison study in Canada\\u00a0reported that a rewetted bog had lower moss cover (Sphagnum and other) than nearby target peatlands.\\nHerb cover (25 studies): Twenty-one studies (including four replicated, paired, controlled) reported that rewetting (sometimes\\u00a0along with other interventions) increased cover of at least one group of herbs. These studies were in bogs, fens or other peatlands in the UK, Finland, Ireland, the Czech Republic, the USA, the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, China, Latvia, Poland, Canada\\u00a0and Spain. Specifically, rewetting increased other/total sedge cover in 13 of 15 studies, increased cottongrass cover in eight of nine studies, and increased reed/rush cover in five of seven studies. Three\\u00a0of four before-and-after studies in peatlands in the UK and Sweden reported that rewetting reduced purple moor grass cover; the other study\\u00a0reported no effect. One replicated site comparison study in forested fens in Finland\\u00a0reported that rewetting had no effect on total herb cover. Two site comparison studies in Europe\\u00a0reported greater herb cover in rewetted than natural peatlands (overall\\u00a0and sedges/rushes, but not forbs).\\nTree/shrub cover (13 studies):\\u00a0Ten\\u00a0studies (including two paired and controlled) in peatlands in Finland, the UK,\\u00a0Germany, Latvia\\u00a0and Canada\\u00a0reported that rewetting typically reduced (seven studies)\\u00a0or had no effect (six studies)\\u00a0on tree and/or shrub cover. Two before-and-after studies in fens in Sweden\\u00a0and Germany\\u00a0reported that rewetting increased tree/shrub cover. One before-and-after study in a bog in the UK\\u00a0reported mixed effects of rewetting on different tree/shrub species.\\nOverall vegetation cover (4 studies): Of four before-and-after studies (three also controlled) that examined the effect of rewetting on overall vegetation cover, two in bogs in Ireland\\u00a0and Sweden\\u00a0reported that rewetting increased it. One study in a fen in New Zealand\\u00a0reported that rewetting reduced vegetation cover. One study in a peatland in Finland\\u00a0reported no effect.\\nOverall plant richness/diversity (14 studies): Six studies (including one replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after) in Sweden, Germany\\u00a0and the UK\\u00a0reported that rewetting increased total plant species richness or diversity in bogs, fens or other peatlands. However, five studies found no effect: in bogs in the Czech Republic\\u00a0and Latvia, fens in Sweden\\u00a0and Germany, and forested fens in Finland. One study in fen meadows in the Netherlands\\u00a0found scale-dependent effects. One paired, controlled, before-and-after study in a peatland in Finland\\u00a0reported that rewetting reduced plant diversity. Of four studies that compared rewetted and natural peatlands, two in Finland\\u00a0and Germany\\u00a0reported lower species richness in rewetted peatlands, one in Sweden\\u00a0found higher species richness in rewetted fens, and one in Europe\\u00a0found similar richness in rewetted and natural fens.\\nGrowth (1 study):\\u00a0One replicated site comparison study in forested fens in Finland\\u00a0found that rewetting increased Sphagnum moss growth to natural levels.\"\n}"

Other mosses/bryophytes were present after 2–3 growing seasons with cover from negligible to 76%, but in fen sites cover was <1% unless plots were mulched, shaded, or limed (1821). \n- Spreading mixed peatland vegetation fragments led to Sphagnum presence after 1–6 growing seasons with cover from <1% to 73%, with controlled studies showing higher Sphagnum cover in sown than unsown plots; five studies reported Sphagnum cover remained very low (<1%) unless plots were mulched after spreading (1822). Other mosses/bryophytes were present with cover <1–65% (1822). Vascular plants appeared after spreading, with one controlled study finding significantly higher vascular plant cover in sown plots and another finding no effect on herb cover; adding fen vegetation increased the number and cover of fen-characteristic species in one study (1822). \n- Direct planting of peatland trees/shrubs showed that the majority of planted individuals survived over 10 weeks to 13 years in several sites, though some species had <50% survival; most planted willow cuttings died within two years in one fen, and <5% survival was reported after unusually deep flooding in one peat swamp forest.

The moss layer transfer technique in cutover Canadian bogs is supported by four studies showing restored areas developed bog‑characteristic plant communities over time; had greater moss/bryophyte (including Sphagnum) and herb (including cottongrass) cover but less shrub cover than unrestored areas after 4–8 years; became more similar to natural bogs; and had higher plant species richness than unrestored areas, with many sites showing bog‑characteristic communities within 11 years [1804].

Disturbing the peat surface (without planting) in fens is supported by two studies showing altered community development with increased cover of weedy seed\\u2011bank species, divergence from undisturbed plots over time, colonization by wetland/fen\\u2011characteristic species alongside other interventions, and lack of colonization by peat\\u2011forming species [1811].\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"1738\",\n    \"1804\",\n    \"1831\",\n    \"1756\",\n    \"1811\"\n  ]\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "Introducing whole plants: Planting trees/shrubs frequently resulted in a majority of individuals surviving over periods of weeks to years, with some species and sites showing low survival; growth of planted trees/shrubs was reported (1820). Planting herbs showed survival for several species over 2–3 years and growth of planted individuals, but in one study planting herbs did not change moss, herb or shrub cover compared to natural colonization (1819). Introducing seeds: Sowing shrub/tree seeds led to germination in some cases, mixed early survival (including complete mortality of germinated willow seedlings in one study), greater cover of some shrubs in some sites but similar shrub cover in others, increased total vegetation cover in some cases but not all, and mixed effects on plant species richness (1824). Sowing herb seeds led to some germination, colonization by peatland- or wetland-characteristic plants in some sites, development of herb cover (sometimes greater than in unsown plots) but in one study similar herb cover to unsown plots, increased total vegetation cover in one study but no effect in others, and inconsistent or no effects on plant richness (1823). Adding vegetation fragments: Adding Sphagnum or other moss fragments typically resulted in presence of Sphagnum within 1–4 growing seasons and higher Sphagnum cover than in unsown plots in controlled comparisons, though cover ranged from negligible to high and in some studies survival/cover was very low unless mulched or otherwise protected; non-Sphagnum moss cover established in some cases but was often low without mulch, shade or lime (1821). Spreading mixed peatland vegetation fragments resulted in Sphagnum presence (often higher than in unsown plots) with cover ranging from <1% to >70%, presence of other mosses, appearance of vascular plants with higher cover than in unsown plots in one study but no effect on herb cover in another, and an increase in fen-characteristic species in one study (1822). Encapsulating moss fragments in beads/gel has no direct comparative evidence on effectiveness relative to loose fragments (1838).",

The season/timing of mowing influenced outcomes: one study found similar community change across spring, summer and autumn mowing, but another reported different plant community types after summer vs winter mowing; plant species richness increased more over two years in summer-mown plots than spring- or autumn-mown plots (1771). Introducing grazing: resulted in plant communities that differed from mown meadows; grazed fen meadows had fewer fen-characteristic species and fewer plant species overall than mown meadows; grazing increased cover of some herb groups (cottongrasses, sedges or all grass-like plants), reduced purple moor grass in one study but typically had no effect in another; cover of fen-characteristic mosses sometimes did not change, while Sphagnum cover was reduced in one study; shrub cover was reduced in one study but typically unaffected in another; and overall plant species richness increased after reinstating grazing in one study but typically showed no effect in another (1762). For invertebrates, fens managed by mowing had greater butterfly species richness than those managed by cattle grazing; recently cut fens had fewer large copper eggs than uncut fens, and large copper caterpillar survival was lower in recently cut fens and in fens cut in autumn or winter than in uncut fens (3950).",
