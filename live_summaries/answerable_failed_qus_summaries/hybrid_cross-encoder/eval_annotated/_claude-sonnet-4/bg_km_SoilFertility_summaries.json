    "relevant_summary": "Several agricultural practices can effectively increase soil organic matter. Cover crops grown in arable fields when fields are empty consistently increase soil organic matter and carbon content, with studies from Mediterranean climates and the USA finding more organic carbon in soils with winter cover crops compared to soils without them (Action 1345, 898). Changing tillage practices, particularly using no-tillage or reduced tillage systems, increases soil organic carbon levels according to 12 studies from multiple countries including Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA (Action 906, 1355). Soil amendments with manures and agricultural composts increase soil organic carbon and organic matter levels, with studies from India, Japan and the UK finding higher carbon levels when manures were applied (Action 911). Retaining crop residues on fields increases soil organic carbon and nitrogen, with randomized controlled trials from Australia and China finding higher levels when residues were retained (Action 907). Converting to organic farming increases soil carbon levels, with replicated trials in Italy and the USA showing organically managed orchards had higher soil carbon compared to conventionally managed orchards (Action 895). Crop rotation systems, particularly when legumes are included, increase soil organic carbon and matter according to studies from Australia, Canada, and Denmark (Action 857). Adding fresh plant material or crop remains to soil increases soil organic carbon levels, with six studies from China, Denmark and India all finding higher carbon levels when plant material was added (Action 910). Adding mulch to crops increases soil organic matter, with studies showing mulch improved soil structure and increased soil organic matter (Action 887). Mixed organic and inorganic soil amendments increase soil organic carbon, with four controlled trials from China and India finding more organic carbon in soils with mixed fertilizers (Action 902). Amending soil with bacteria or fungi can increase soil organic matter content, with one controlled trial from Turkey finding increased soil organic matter under mycorrhizal-inoculated compost applications (Action 888). Alley cropping systems result in higher diversity of beneficial soil fungi that contribute to soil health (Action 903).",

Four studies found higher numbers, diversity, functional diversity or activity of soil organisms under organic management (Action 895).\n\nReducing fertilizer, pesticide or herbicide use generally is highly beneficial, with two site comparison studies finding higher diversity of soil invertebrates and microorganisms in low-input systems (Action 904).\n\nAdding mulch to crops significantly increases soil organism diversity. Three replicated trials showed that adding mulch increased soil animal and fungal numbers, diversity and activity (Action 887).\n\nGrowing cover crops when fields are empty enhances soil biodiversity. One controlled experiment found more diverse nematode communities, and one trial found greater microbial biomass under cover crops (Action 898).\n\nNo-tillage as the main cultivation method benefits soil fauna. Five studies found more microbial biomass in soils without tillage, and two studies found more earthworms in soils without tillage. One study found different communities of nematodes and mites in soils without tillage (Action 2306).\n\nReducing tillage practices generally supports soil organism diversity. Four studies found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage, and one trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms (Actions 906, 126).\n\nUsing crop rotations has mixed effects on soil organisms. One study found more microbial biomass and more fungi in soils with crop rotations, though results varied across different studies (Action 1368).",

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done.

Thirty-four studies (of which 21 were replicated and controlled and seven also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found some positive effects on earthworms, some invertebrates (other than earthworms), weeds or farmland birds, of reducing tillage compared to conventional management. Positive effects included increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms, greater abundance of some invertebrates other than earthworms, increased numbers of some weeds and/or weed species, higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying date and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields, and greater abundance of some birds - including Eurasian skylark, seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in late winter on non-inversion or conservation tillage. A review found tillage had negative effects on invertebrate numbers and no-till systems had more invertebrate bird food resources.\\nTwenty-six studies (of which 13 replicated and controlled and three also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found reducing tillage had either negative, no effect or no consistent effects on abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates (other than earthworms), earthworm abundance, biomass, or species richness, number of different plant species found as seeds, number of some weed species, mammal abundance, some bird species, and one study found bird preferences for conservation tillage fields decreased over time.

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, different types of organic soil amendments show various effects on soil properties and crop performance. Compost amendments increase soil organic matter levels, microbial biomass and fruit yield (action 889). Mixed organic and inorganic amendments result in higher microbial biomass and activity, increased microbial diversity, and more effective reduction of cracks in dry soil compared to inorganic fertilizers alone (action 902). These mixed amendments also increase soil organic carbon levels and nutrients, and can increase maize yield (action 902).\n\nManure amendments show varied effects on soil properties. They increase organic matter content in some studies while showing similar amounts in others, with mixed results for nitrogen content, increased phosphorus and potassium levels, and varied pH effects (action 1363). Manure reduces soil erosion, increases soil stability, but leads to higher greenhouse gas emissions including carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide (action 1363). When combined with agricultural composts, manures increase microbial biomass and respiration, reduce soil loss and water runoff, increase carbon levels and organic matter, improve soil physical properties including larger soil aggregations, and increase crop yields (action 911).\n\nMunicipal waste composts greatly reduce soil loss and water runoff in semi-arid soils, though show mixed results in other contexts (action 890). In wetland environments, large amounts of compost can alter plant community composition toward drier conditions, reduce plant species richness and diversity, but increase individual plant size such as birch saplings while maintaining similar overall vegetation biomass (action 3310). Charcoal additions to soil increase legume cover but do not alter overall plant biomass or grass cover (action 3422).",

Crop rotation including legumes reduces rainwater runoff and soil loss while increasing water infiltration (Action 857). Adding mulch to crops increases soil stability and reduces soil erosion and runoff, with some mulches being more effective than others (Action 887). Changing tillage practices through reduced tillage reduces soil loss and runoff compared to conventional ploughing, though mixed results occur and no-tillage can increase soil loss in the absence of crop cover (Action 906). Growing cover crops beneath main crops or between crop rows reduces erosion, with soil stability being highest under grass cover and cover crops reducing soil loss (Action 897). Controlled traffic and traffic timing reduces runoff and increases water filtration into the soil while reducing compaction (Action 899). Planting new hedges with grass or shrub hedgerows reduces soil erosion and improves soil organic matter levels (Action 744). Amending soil with fresh plant material or crop remains reduces soil loss, though effects vary depending on soil type (Action 910). Adding organic and inorganic soil amendments together is more effective at reducing cracks in dry soil than inorganic fertilizers alone (Action 902). Reducing grazing intensity decreases sediment erosion when grazing time in forage crops is reduced (Action 901). Cover crops grown in arable fields show less erosion compared to soils with fallows or bare soils and create more water-stable soil aggregates (Action 1345).",

Manures and agricultural composts showed positive results, with four controlled, replicated studies from India, Spain and Turkey finding higher crop yields when manures or compost were applied, and one study finding higher yields when manure was applied in combination with cover crops (Action 911). Green manures also proved effective, with two controlled, randomized, replicated studies from India and Pakistan finding increased grain yields when green manures were grown (Action 908). Fresh plant material and crop remains showed benefits in Asian contexts, with one trial from the Philippines finding higher grain yields when crop remains were incorporated earlier in the season, and one replicated trial finding higher barley yield when straw was incorporated (Action 910). The evidence indicates that these amendments also provide additional soil benefits including higher soil organic carbon levels, improved microbial biomass and activity, and better soil structure across various soil types including clay, clay loam, sandy-loam, silt clay loam, and silty-loam soils.",

Applying nitrification inhibitors to soil has been shown to reduce nitrate losses and nitrous oxide emissions (action 909). Using organic fertilizers instead of inorganic fertilizers can result in less nitrate loss compared to inorganic fertilizers in some comparisons (action 1381). Adding manures and agricultural composts to soil has been found to reduce nutrient loss and result in higher nitrogen levels (action 911), with farmyard manure showing lower nutrient loss when applied in winter rather than autumn. Growing cover crops beneath the main crop or between crop rows can help retain nutrients in the soil system (action 897). Winter cover crops in arable fields have been found to increase nitrogen in soils in some comparisons (action 1345), with legume cover crops showing more nitrogen retention than non-legumes. Retaining crop residues has been shown to increase soil organic carbon and nitrogen (action 907). Changing the timing of ploughing, specifically delaying until spring, has been found to reduce nitrate leaching (action 712). Reducing tillage practices can help improve nutrient retention, with no-tillage systems showing more nitrogen in soils compared to reduced tillage in some comparisons (actions 126, 1370).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, several practices are consistently beneficial for both increasing soil organic carbon and improving biodiversity. Converting to organic farming (action 895) shows higher numbers, diversity, functional diversity or activity of soil organisms and higher soil carbon levels compared to conventional management. Using crop rotation (action 857) increases soil organic carbon, particularly when legumes are included, while also increasing the number of microbes and diversity of soil animals. Growing cover crops when the field is empty (action 898) increases soil carbon levels and results in more diverse nematode communities and greater microbial biomass. Similarly, growing cover crops in arable fields (action 1345) increases organic matter in soils and improves microbial biomass, nematode populations, earthworm numbers, and beneficial fungi. Reduced tillage practices show consistent benefits, with changing tillage practices (action 906) resulting in higher soil organic carbon in no-tillage systems and increased numbers of microbes, earthworm species, and soil animals. Using reduced tillage in arable fields (action 1371) increases organic matter in soils and microbial biomass. Amending soil with mixed organic and inorganic amendments (action 902) increases organic carbon and leads to higher microbial biomass, activity, and diversity. Green manures (action 908) increase soil organic carbon. Agroforestry systems that retain or plant native trees and shrubs among crops (action 963) support diverse bat communities, though specific soil benefits are not detailed in the action document.",

Fresh plant material or crop remains can be incorporated, with one study from India finding improved soil structure when straw was incorporated, and studies showing increased microbial biomass and larger soil aggregates (Action 910). Non-chemical minerals and mineral wastes can be used as soil amendments, with studies from Australia and New Zealand showing reduced nutrient loss and erosion when these materials are added (Action 892). Changing tillage practices offers another approach - reduced tillage and no-tillage systems have been shown to increase soil organic carbon and improve soil structure compared to conventional tillage, with multiple studies finding higher organic carbon in soils under reduced tillage systems (Action 906). Mixed organic and inorganic amendments can be effective, with controlled trials from China and India finding that combinations of manure and inorganic fertilizers were more effective at reducing soil cracking than inorganic fertilizers alone (Action 902). Gypsum can be added to soils as a mineral amendment, though evidence is limited to specific applications (Action 1708). These methods specifically cover silty-clay soil types and provide alternatives to traditional compost applications for soil structure improvement.",

Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done. One randomized, replicated study from Portugal found no effect of tillage treatment on yield.\\n\\u00a0\\nSOIL TYPES COVERED: anthrosol, calcareous silt loam, chalky, clay, clay loam, fine sandy loam, loam, loamy-clay, loam - sandy loam, loam \\u2013 silt-loam, loamy sand, loamy silt, non-chalky clay, sandy, sandy clay loam, sandy loam, sandy silt-loam, silt loam, silty, silty-clay, silty clay loam, silty loam.\"\n}"
