    "relevant_summary": "Several techniques have been identified for increasing plant species richness during grassland habitat restoration. Action 133 found that restoring species-rich grassland resulted in higher plant species richness compared to other types of grassland, with effective techniques including grazing, introducing plant species, hay spreading and mowing. \n\nAction 3406 showed that increasing the number of species in a seed mix increased the species richness of target plants when seeds from local sources were used, and increased the species richness of sown plants. Action 3399 demonstrated that planting grassland plants increased overall plant species richness compared to seeding alone, with particular success in increasing forb species richness in 83% of cases and grass species richness in 50% of cases.\n\nSeeding techniques can enhance establishment success. Action 3409 found that sowing seeds in larger prepared gaps within vegetation led to greater cover of sown target plant species than sowing in smaller gaps. Action 129 showed that adding yellow rattle seed to hay meadows helped other sown target meadow species to colonize and resulted in more plant species being found when yellow rattle was present.\n\nAction 3426 found mixed results for transferring plant material from intact grassland alongside seeding, with one study showing increased target plant species richness while two others found no effect. Action 3405 indicated that sowing seeds at higher density increased forb species richness. Action 3418 demonstrated that applying herbicide before sowing seeds increased sown species richness and improved seedling emergence for five of eight wildflower species.",

Three replicated studies from Sweden and the UK (one also controlled and two site comparisons) found that restored grassland had a lower diversity and frequency of certain plant species, and attracted fewer foraging queen bumblebees than continuously grazed or unmanaged grasslands.\\nWe captured 40 studies (including 19 replicated and controlled studies of which six were also randomized, and six reviews) from nine European countries that found ten different techniques used alone or in combinations were effective for restoring species-rich grassland. Effective techniques included: grazing, introducing plant species, hay spreading and mowing.\\nWe found 22 studies from seven European countries that included information on the length of time taken to restore grassland communities (including 16 replicated trials of which nine also controlled and three reviews). Six studies saw positive signs of restoration in less than five years, 11 studies within 10 years and two studies found restoration took more than 10 years. Six studies found limited or slow changes in plant communities following restoration. Two studies from Germany and the UK (one replicated controlled trial) found differences in vegetation between restored and existing species-rich grasslands nine or 60 years after restoration.\"\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available action documents, several potential negative impacts of different seeding strategies on existing native vegetation in North American grasslands have been identified:\n\n**Competitive Effects on Native Species**: Sowing grass seeds can reduce the abundance of native grassland species (action 3397). One study found that sowing grass seeds reduced the abundance of grassland species, while another found that it either reduced native grass cover or did not alter native grass density (action 3397). Additionally, sowing grass seeds reduced the abundance of native forb species and shrub species in some cases (action 3397).\n\n**Temporary vs. Long-term Outcomes**: Some seeding strategies show initial positive effects that diminish over time. Three studies found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased plant species richness during the first year, but after 3-13 years, species richness did not differ between sown and unsown areas or was lower in sown areas (action 3432). Similarly, one study found that after two years grass cover was higher in areas where grass seeds were sown, but after seven years there was no longer a difference (action 3397).\n\n**Fertilizer Application Concerns**: Adding fertilizer after planting native prairie plants reduced the diameter of prairie lupine plants and did not alter the growth of six other plant species (action 3427). This suggests potential negative growth effects on certain native species when fertilizer is combined with seeding strategies.\n\n**Carbon Addition Effects**: Adding carbon to soil after sowing seeds either reduced or did not alter the density of sown forb species (action 3433), indicating potential suppressive effects on establishing vegetation.\n\n**Community Composition Changes**: Plant communities in sown areas were found to be different from those of ancient grasslands or sites where natural regeneration was allowed (action 3397), suggesting that seeding can alter natural community development patterns compared to allowing natural succession.",

Hydroseeding, which involves spraying a slurry of seed, mulch and water, has shown promise with one study finding that hydroseeding with non-native seeds increased overall plant cover in most cases (Action 3412). Sowing seeds at a higher density can increase grass and forb cover, with one study finding that higher seeding density increased grass cover and forb cover (Action 3405). Adding mulch before or after seeding has shown mixed results, with one study finding that adding mulch before sowing seeds increased the cover of target plant species and increased the number of seedlings in most cases (Action 3425). Inoculating soil with mycorrhizal fungi before seeding initially increased vegetation cover in one study, though after three years the effect diminished (Action 3429). Adding soil microbes and nutrients when planting grass plugs increased the cover of three of 38 native prairie species in one study (Action 3429). Using erosion blankets after seeding has shown variable results, with one study finding increased plant species richness and another finding increased plant density (Action 3431). Irrigation after seeding increased vegetation cover in six of 10 cases when using non-native seeds (Action 3430). Increasing the number of species in seed mixes showed that higher species diversity increased the cover of sown plant species in one study and increased the species richness of target plants when combined with local seed sources (Action 3406).",

Action 3432 indicates that some studies found positive effects of sowing native grass and forb seeds lasting 3-13 years, with one study showing species richness did not differ between sown and unsown areas after 3-13 years, though another study found after eight years species richness was higher than in unsown areas. \n\nAction 133 provides the most comprehensive evidence on restoration timeframes, showing that six studies saw positive signs of restoration in less than five years, 11 studies within 10 years, and two studies found restoration took more than 10 years. However, six studies found limited or slow changes in plant communities following restoration. Two studies found differences in vegetation between restored and existing species-rich grasslands persisted nine or 60 years after restoration.\n\nFor community composition specifically, Action 3397 shows one study found that over time, plant communities in seeded areas became more similar to intact grasslands, while another found seeded communities were different from ancient grasslands. Action 3432 found that over time, communities became more similar to intact grasslands in some cases, but three studies found species richness was lower in sown areas than in nearby intact grasslands.\n\nFor vegetation cover, Action 3397 found two of three studies showed seeding increased vegetation cover, while Action 3432 found three of eight studies showed seeding increased overall vegetation cover, biomass or density.

    "relevant_summary": "Several interventions have been studied to enhance seed germination and emergence during grassland restoration. Soil preparation methods include disturbing soil before seeding/planting, which increased plant emergence in most cases compared to sowing alone according to four of five studies (action 3413). Soil scarification or ploughing to enhance germination increased the cover and diversity of understory plants according to two studies (action 1251). Removing vegetation before seeding/planting increased the germination rate of sown species according to one of two studies, with one study finding that removing vegetation along with removing leaf litter increased the number of seedlings for one of three species (action 3416). Applying herbicide before seeding/planting increased seedling emergence for five of eight wildflower species in one study (action 3418). Site preparation also includes removing leaf litter before seeding/planting, though this had mixed effects on the number of seedlings of sown plant species according to two of three studies (action 3414). Adding topsoil before seeding/planting increased the biomass of sown species in most cases according to one study (action 3420). Seeding techniques include sowing seeds at a higher density, which increased the number of purple needlegrass seedlings according to one study (action 3405). Drill seeding rather than seeding by hand increased the density of two sown grass species compared to sowing by hand in one of three studies (action 3410). Hydroseeding (spraying slurry of seed, mulch and water) increased the abundance of half of the sown plant species compared to drill seeding in one study (action 3412). Timing matters, as sowing seeds at the start of growing season in spring led to similar emergence of forb seedlings compared to sowing in winter according to one study (action 3407). Post-seeding interventions include irrigating before or after seeding/planting, which increased vegetation cover in six of 10 cases when irrigating after sowing non-native seeds (action 3430). However, soaking seeds of non-woody plants before sowing typically had no significant effect on their germination rate according to one greenhouse study (action 3363).",

However, soaking seeds of non-woody plants before sowing typically had no significant effect on their germination rate according to one greenhouse study (action 3363).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"3413\",\n    \"1251\",\n    \"3416\",\n    \"3418\",\n    \"3414\",\n    \"3420\",\n    \"3405\",\n    \"3410\",\n    \"3412\",\n    \"3407\",\n    \"3430\",\n    \"3363\"\n  ]\n}"

Additionally, one study found that sowing seeds at a higher density increased forb cover, and another found increased number of purple needlegrass seedlings.\n\n**Spring Seeding Timing (Action 3407)**: One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the USA found that sowing seeds in spring increased plant diversity compared to sowing in autumn.\n\n**Soil Disturbance Before Seeding (Action 3413)**: One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the USA found that disturbing soil before sowing forb seeds increased the cover of forb species. Additionally, studies found that disturbing soil before sowing seeds increased plant emergence compared to sowing alone.\n\n**Drill Seeding Results Were Mixed (Action 3410)**: Three studies in the USA found that sowing seeds with a seed drill showed mixed results - one study found increased density of two sown grass species and increased abundance of warm-season grass species compared to hand sowing, while two other studies found no change or reduction in abundance of sown plants compared to other methods.\n\n**Increasing Species Diversity in Seed Mix (Action 3406)**: Two replicated, controlled studies in the USA found that increasing the number of species in a seed mix increased the species richness of sown plants, with one study also finding increased cover of sown plant species.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, several different methods can be used to introduce seeds into a site for grassland vegetation restoration:\n\n1. **Drill seeding**: Seeds can be sown using a seed drill rather than by hand (Action 3410). Studies found that drill seeding increased the density of two sown grass species and the abundance of warm-season grass species compared to hand sowing, though in most cases it led to no change or reduction in abundance of sown plants compared to other methods.\n\n2. **Hand seeding**: Seeds can be sown by hand as an alternative to mechanical methods (Action 3410). One study found higher plant diversity in areas where seeds were sown by hand compared to areas where they were sown using a seed drill (Action 1698).\n\n3. **Hydroseeding**: This involves spraying a slurry of seed, mulch and water (Action 3412). Studies found that hydroseeding increased plant species richness in some cases and increased the abundance of half of the sown plant species compared to drill seeding in one study.\n\n4. **Strip/slot seeding**: This method involves seeding in strips or slots (Action 3411). One study found that strip seeding increased both grass and forb species richness, though a review found that in the majority of cases strip seeding resulted in failed introductions of sown species.\n\n5. **Seed balls**: Seeds can be planted in the form of seed balls (Action 1712), though one study found this resulted in lower seedling numbers than sowing seed.\n\n6. **Direct seeding**: Seeds can be sown directly onto the site (Action 1698). Studies found this method increased shrub cover in most cases and resulted in increased plant cover.\n\n7. **Planting seedlings**: As an alternative or supplement to seeding, grassland plants can be planted as seedlings (Action 3399). One study found that planting seedlings in addition to sowing seeds increased the number of plant species compared to sowing seeds alone.\n\n8. **Transfer of plant material with seeding**: Plant material from intact grassland can be transferred alongside seeding/planting (Action 3426). Studies showed mixed results, with some finding increased species richness and cover of target plants, while others found no effect.",

Vegetation removal before seeding showed positive effects in some cases, with one of two replicated, controlled studies in the UK and Belgium finding that removing vegetation before sowing seeds increased the germination rate of sown species, while the other study found that removing vegetation, along with removing leaf litter, before sowing seeds increased the number of seedlings for one of three species (Action 3416). In contrast, leaf litter removal in forest settings showed negative effects, with one replicated, controlled study in Costa Rica finding that leaf litter removal decreased the density of new tree seedlings (Action 1246). Soil surface disturbance in peatlands (without planting) led to colonization by wetland-characteristic plant species in two replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after studies in Germany and Sweden, though the study in Germany noted that peat-forming species did not colonize the fen (Action 1811).",

For sowing native grass and forb seeds, twelve studies from North America were included in the research.

Three of four replicated, randomized, controlled studies found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased the cover or density of forb species, with one study showing that forb cover increased one year after sowing but did not differ from unsown areas after 10 years (Action 3432). One study in the USA found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased the cover of native plant species (Action 3432).\n\nFor sowing grass seeds generally, six studies were conducted in North America. Three of four replicated studies in the USA and Canada found that sowing grass seeds either reduced native grass cover or did not alter native grass density, while one study found that grass cover was higher after two years but showed no difference after seven years (Action 3397). One of two replicated studies found that sowing grass seeds reduced the abundance of native forb species, while the other study found no change in native forb density (Action 3397).

    "relevant_summary": "Based on documented research findings, mechanical vegetation removal and soil disturbance techniques used prior to seeding in grassland restoration show several documented outcomes:\n\n**Vegetation Removal Combined with Soil Disturbance:** Studies in Portugal and France found that vegetation removal together with mechanical disturbance of the soil increased the cover and diversity of understory plants and decreased understory shrub cover (Action 1274). The same technique also increased the density of young trees in France (Action 1274).\n\n**Soil Disturbance Before Seeding:** Multiple studies showed that disturbing soil before seeding increased plant emergence in most cases compared to sowing alone, based on replicated controlled studies in the USA, Germany, China and Spain (Action 3413). Soil disturbance also increased plant and seedling species richness in studies from the UK and Germany (Action 3413). Specifically, rotovating soil before sowing seeds increased both grass and forb species richness in most cases compared to harrowing before sowing in the UK (Action 3413). One study found that disturbing soil before sowing forb seeds increased the cover of forb species in the USA (Action 3413).\n\n**Soil Scarification/Ploughing:** Studies in Portugal and the USA found that ploughing increased the cover and diversity of understory plants (Action 1251). However, effects on tree establishment were mixed, with studies in Canada and Brazil showing that ploughing increased tree density in two of three studies but decreased it in one (Action 1251).\n\n**Topsoil/Turf Removal:** Studies in France, UK and USA demonstrated several positive outcomes. Removing topsoil before sowing seeds increased plant species richness (Action 3415), increased plant community similarity to intact steppe (Action 3415), and increased the species richness of sown plants (Action 3415). Removing turf before sowing seeds increased both grass and forb species richness compared to soil disturbance alone (Action 3415). Studies also found that removing topsoil before planting increased the survival of seedlings and plants in the USA (Action 3415).\n\n**Vegetation Removal Alone:** Studies in the UK and Belgium found that removing vegetation before sowing seeds increased the germination rate of sown species, and when combined with leaf litter removal, increased the number of seedlings for some species (Action 3416).",

Increasing the number of species in a seed mix shows positive effects, with studies finding that it increased the species richness of sown plants and, in some cases, increased cover of sown plant species, though results varied between studies (Action 3406). Using local seed sources can enhance restoration success, with studies showing that sowing grassland seeds from a local source increased plant species richness compared to commercial seed mixes and increased the abundance of characteristic plant species (Action 3400). Higher seeding density has shown benefits, with studies finding that sowing seeds at a higher density increased forb species richness, grass cover, and forb cover, and increased the number of seedlings for certain species (Action 3405). Including native grass and forb species in seed mixes demonstrates strong positive effects, with studies showing increased plant species richness, increased cover of characteristic grassland plants, increased abundance of sown species, and increased species richness of both grasses and forbs in most cases (Action 3432). The use of nurse plants alongside grassland species shows mixed results, with some studies finding increased seed germination and seedling survival, though effects on community composition and long-term establishment vary (Actions 3402, 3401).",

In the short term (first year), sowing native grass and forb seeds increased plant species richness during the first year, but after 3-13 years, species richness did not differ between sown and unsown areas or was lower in sown areas (Action 3432). However, one study found that after one year, sowing did not alter plant species richness but after eight years, species richness was higher than in unsown areas (Action 3432). Over time, plant communities became more similar to those of intact grasslands (Action 3432). For forb species specifically, one study found that one year after sowing, the cover of forb species increased, but after 10 years it did not differ between sown and unsown areas (Action 3432). For overall vegetation abundance, one study found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased plant species richness during the first 2-7 years, but after eight years, species richness did not differ between sown and unsown areas (Action 3432). In terms of restoration timelines, six studies saw positive signs of restoration in less than five years, 11 studies within 10 years and two studies found restoration took more than 10 years, while six studies found limited or slow changes in plant communities following restoration (Action 133). Two studies found differences in vegetation between restored and existing species-rich grasslands nine or 60 years after restoration (Action 133). For grasslands restored from arable land, butterfly communities developed to become increasingly similar to existing high-quality grasslands over the first 10 years after establishment (Action 3929), and species richness was higher on grasslands created less than 10 years ago than on grasslands created more than 20 years ago (Action 3929).",

In terms of restoration timelines, six studies saw positive signs of restoration in less than five years, 11 studies within 10 years and two studies found restoration took more than 10 years, while six studies found limited or slow changes in plant communities following restoration (Action 133). Two studies found differences in vegetation between restored and existing species-rich grasslands nine or 60 years after restoration (Action 133). For grasslands restored from arable land, butterfly communities developed to become increasingly similar to existing high-quality grasslands over the first 10 years after establishment (Action 3929), and species richness was higher on grasslands created less than 10 years ago than on grasslands created more than 20 years ago (Action 3929).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"3432\",\n    \"133\",\n    \"3929\"\n  ]\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, several site preparation methods are available to improve conditions for grassland seed germination or seedling survival:\n\nSoil disturbance methods: Disturbing soil before seeding/planting increased plant emergence in most cases and increased seedling survival (action 3413). Four of five studies found this method increased plant emergence compared to sowing alone.\n\nSoil and vegetation removal: Removing topsoil or turf before seeding/planting increased plant species richness and the species richness of sown plants (action 3415). Two studies found that removing topsoil before planting increased seedling and plant survival. Removing vegetation before seeding/planting increased germination rate of sown species and increased the number of seedlings for one of three species (action 3416).\n\nHerbicide application: Applying herbicide before seeding/planting increased sown species richness and the cover of sown grass species (action 3418). One study found spraying with herbicide before sowing seeds increased seedling emergence for five of eight wildflower species.\n\nLeaf litter and debris management: Removing leaf litter before seeding/planting had mixed effects on the number of seedlings of sown plant species in two of three studies (action 3414). Mowing before or after seeding/planting increased sown species richness and abundance of sown forb species, and increased germination of four grassland plant species in one of three studies (action 3419).\n\nSoil amendments: Adding topsoil before seeding/planting increased plant species richness and biomass of sown species in most cases (action 3420). Adding sulphur to soil before seeding/planting increased the cover of three of six sown species when low amounts were used (action 3428).\n\nProtective measures: Adding mulch before or after seeding/planting increased the number of seedlings in most cases and increased the cover of target plant species (action 3425). Sowing or planting nurse plants alongside grassland species increased seed germination and survival of planted plants in one of two studies (action 3402). Sowing seeds in prepared gaps within vegetation led to greater cover of sown target plant species when large gaps were used (action 3409).",

    "relevant_summary": "Post-seeding treatments show varied effects on vegetation abundance. For erosion blankets, two of three studies found that using erosion blankets after seeding and planting did not alter vegetation cover, while one study found that using an organic blanket after sowing seeds increased plant density (action 3431). One study in China found that erosion control blankets increased plant biomass and cover (action 1692).\n\nRegarding mulch treatments, one study found that adding mulch before sowing seeds did not increase plant cover (action 3425). However, the same action showed that adding mulch before sowing seeds increased the cover of target plant species in one study and increased the number of seedlings in most cases. Another study found that adding mulch before planting seedlings reduced the cover of planted species (action 3425).\n\nFor fertilizer treatments, six of nine studies found that adding fertilizer alongside sowing or planting increased vegetation cover in all or some cases, while three studies found no change in vegetation cover or plant density (action 3427). Studies show that fertilizer increased total plant cover, understory plant biomass, and cover of plant species that were seeded artificially, though five studies found no effect on plant biomass, plant cover, or seedling abundance (action 1248). Adding fertilizer and sowing seeds increased the biomass of three native grass species in one study (action 3427), and increased cover of shrubs and trees in a majority of cases while increasing vegetation cover in two of three cases (action 1704).\n\nCombined treatments show mixed results: adding mulch and fertilizer did not increase seedling abundance of seven shrub species or change grass cover in one study (action 1694), but increased seedling abundance for a minority of shrub species in another study (action 1707). Hydroseeding (combining seed, mulch and water) increased overall plant cover in most cases in one study, though another study found no alteration in vegetation cover (action 3412).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence from grassland restoration studies, there are several documented benefits and drawbacks of different seed sourcing approaches:\n\nBenefits of local source seeds: One replicated, controlled study in Italy found that sowing grassland seeds from a local source increased plant species richness compared to sowing a commercial seed mix (Action 3400). A replicated, controlled study in Germany found that sowing grassland seeds from a local source, along with increasing the number of species in a seed mix, led to an increase in the species richness of target plants and increased cover of target plant species (Action 3400). One replicated study in the USA found that after sowing grassland seeds from a local source, vegetation cover increased over time compared to areas sown with non-native seeds (Action 3400).\n\nDrawbacks of local source seeds: The same USA study found that while vegetation cover increased with local seeds, the density of individual plants declined compared to non-native seeds (Action 3400). A replicated, randomized, controlled experiment in the USA found that sowing Sandberg bluegrass seeds from a local source did not change the survival of sown plants compared to sowing non-local varieties (Action 3400).\n\nNeutral outcomes: One replicated, controlled study in Germany found that vegetation cover did not differ between areas sown with local source seeds and those sown with commercial grass seed (Action 3400). Two replicated studies in the USA and Italy found that sowing grassland seeds from a local source did not alter vegetation height compared to sowing non-native grass seeds or a commercial seed mix (Action 3400).\n\nContext from native species studies: Studies examining native grass and forb seeding found that sixteen of 28 controlled studies in Europe, North America and New Zealand found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased overall plant species richness, though seven studies found no change and three found initial increases followed by later declines (Action 3432). European studies showed that grasslands established by sowing grasses, legumes and forbs had higher species richness and abundance of butterflies than grasslands established with grass-only mixes or less competitive species (Action 3929).",

    "relevant_summary": "Several alternative and additional actions can be taken to increase plant species richness in grassland restoration beyond simply sowing a standard seed mix. Increasing the number of species in seed mixes has been shown to increase the species richness of sown plants and target plant species (Action 3406). Transfer of plant material from intact grassland alongside seeding/planting, such as hay transfer, has been shown in some studies to increase the species richness and cover of target plants (Action 3426). Inoculating soil with mycorrhizal fungi before seeding/planting can increase the abundance of target species that are considered a local conservation priority (Action 3429). Adding yellow rattle seed (Rhinanthus minor) to hay meadows helps other sown target meadow species to colonize and results in more plant species being found when yellow rattle is present (Action 129). Effective restoration techniques identified include grazing, introducing plant species, hay spreading and mowing, with various studies showing that these techniques can be effective for restoring species-rich grassland when used alone or in combinations (Action 133). Restoration success can vary by timeframe, with six studies showing positive signs of restoration in less than five years, eleven studies within 10 years, and two studies finding restoration took more than 10 years (Action 133). Changing mowing regimes on grassland has been shown to affect different species groups, with haying management resulting in higher abundance of prairie specialist butterflies compared to burning management (Action 3945).",
