Chemical treatments include dosing with biocides such as chlorine, potassium and copper which killed Asian clams in laboratory studies (Action 1118). Higher concentrations of chlorine and bromine, delivered at higher temperatures, shortened the time required to kill the Asian clams (Action 1118). Fat-coated particles called BioBullets could kill 100% of the Asian clams within pipes in Spanish irrigation systems (Action 1118). Temperature manipulation is effective, with temperatures of 36°C or higher killing Asian clams within or after four days (Action 1116). Mechanical approaches include regular cleaning of industrial pipes which was found to be an effective method of permanently removing Asian clams in Portugal (Action 1119). The addition of a sand filter was effective at reducing numbers of Asian clams (Action 1119). Suction dredging reduced Asian clam densities by 96% over two weeks with the reduction persisting for a year (Action 1120). Three types of dredges were equally effective at removing Asian clams, resulting in biomass reductions ranging from 74% to greater than 95% and density reductions ranging from 65% to 95% (Action 1120). High salinity exposure (18-34‰) killed 100% of Asian clams in laboratory conditions (Action 1115).

Glyphosate controlled water primrose with 97% mortality when mixed with a non-oil based sticking agent and 100% mortality when combined with TopFilm (action 1139).

      "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from action documents, several non-chemical management strategies for controlling invasive red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) in European ponds have been studied. Creating barriers has shown effectiveness, with a study from Spain (2007-2010) finding that concrete dams designed with features to prevent red swamp crayfish from crawling over them were effective at containing population spread upstream (Action 1037). Trapping and removal methods have been tested, with an Italian study finding that traps baited with food (tinned meat) were most effective at capturing red swamp crayfish compared to pheromone baits or no bait, with over half of all crayfish caught in food-baited traps (Action 1029). Encouraging predators shows promise, with studies from Italy demonstrating that eels can reduce red swamp crayfish population size by feeding on them, and a French study showing that pike also predate on red swamp crayfish (Action 1030). The combination of trapping with predator encouragement appears particularly effective, with a Swiss study showing significant population reduction when introducing predators combined with trapping, and an Italian study demonstrating this combination was more effective than predation alone (Action 1031). Male sterilization represents another potential approach, with an Italian laboratory study finding that X-ray exposure of male red swamp crayfish reduced offspring production by 43% (Action 1032). However, several strategies including draining waterways (Action 1034), electrofishing (Action 1035), and food source removal (Action 1033) currently lack sufficient research evidence to assess their effectiveness.",

For crayfish control, one before-and-after study conducted between 2007 and 2010 in Spain found that concrete dams across a stream, specifically designed with features to prevent red swamp crayfish from crawling over them, were effective at containing spread of the population upstream (action 1037). For aquatic plant control, evidence exists for lightproof barriers. Five before-and-after studies in the UK found that covering Crassula helmsii with black sheeting or carpet strips eradicated or severely reduced the cover of the plant, however C. helmsii was reported to have progressively recolonized two of the sites where it had been initially reported as eradicated (action 1294). One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in iris-invaded lakeshore marshes in Canada reported that covering plots with rubber sheeting after cutting back yellow iris prevented most vegetation regrowth in an intermittently flooded marsh, but had no clear effect in a permanently flooded marsh (action 3124). For parrot's feather control, no evidence was found for the use of lightproof barriers (action 1576). Barriers are also used to protect planted vegetation from interference, with studies showing that fences or barriers protecting freshwater wetlands planted with non-woody plants increased plant survival rates over 12-18 months after planting and affected plant community composition (action 3328).",

Bullfrog adults can be captured overnight using a single trap floating on the water surface (Action 1045).

For red-eared terrapins, direct removal techniques include: Aranzadi turtle traps which were effective in trapping red-eared terrapins from a river but did not eradicate the population (Action 1055).
