All 28 studies investigating colonization found that amphibians used some or all created ponds, with created ponds supporting up to 15 naturally colonizing species and up to 10 species that reproduced (Action ID: 869). Five studies found that numbers of species or breeding species were similar or higher in created ponds compared to natural ponds (Action ID: 869).\n\nWetland creation also proves effective, with five site comparison studies showing that created wetlands had similar numbers of amphibian species, amphibian abundance or communities to natural wetlands (Action ID: 880). Studies found that four to 15 amphibian species used or colonized created wetlands (Action ID: 880). A global review found that numbers of amphibian species and abundance were higher or similar in 54% of studies and similar in 35% of studies reviewed compared to natural wetlands (Action ID: 880).\n\nPond restoration demonstrates mixed but generally positive results, with six replicated studies showing that pond restoration and creation increased numbers of amphibian species, maintained or increased populations, or increased pond occupancy and breeding success (Action ID: 878). Restored and created ponds were colonized by 1-7 species, with 6-65% of ponds colonized and 35% used for breeding (Action ID: 878).\n\nFish removal through pond drying significantly enhances amphibian habitat quality, with one study showing that draining ponds to eliminate fish increased numbers of amphibian species (Action ID: 826). Studies found that pond drying to eliminate fish increased breeding success of frog or newt species (Action ID: 826).\n\nDitch management in agricultural landscapes also provides benefits, with one study finding that numbers of amphibian species and abundance was significantly higher in ditches managed under agri-environment schemes compared to those managed conventionally (Action ID: 749). Another study found that managing ditches increased common toad numbers (Action ID: 749).\n\nWater level regulation can support amphibian populations, with studies showing that maintaining pond water levels increased natterjack toad populations or maintained newt populations and enabled successful breeding by dusky gopher frogs (Action ID: 833). Retaining connectivity between habitat patches maintained populations of eight of 13 frog species over 20 years (Action ID: 853).",

      "relevant_summary": "Several key factors and interventions have influenced the success of natterjack toad conservation projects in the UK. Translocation efforts have shown that re-establishing toads on dune or saltmarsh habitat was more successful than on heathland (Action 859). Translocations resulted in breeding populations established at 30-70% of sites, with particular success from replicated translocations of wild rather than captive-bred toads (Action 859). Pond creation has been a crucial intervention, with studies showing that created ponds, along with other interventions, significantly increased natterjack toad populations or maintained/increased populations at 75% of sites (Action 866). However, created ponds had lower tadpole mortality from desiccation compared to natural ponds, but higher mortality from predation by invertebrates (Action 866). Habitat management through vegetation clearance has been effective, with studies showing that vegetation clearance along with other habitat management increased, stabilized or maintained natterjack toad populations, and resulted in increased occupancy by natterjack toads (Action 761). Water chemistry management through adding limestone to ponds has shown mixed results - it resulted in establishment of one of three translocated populations and increased natterjack toad populations when combined with species-specific habitat management, and temporarily increased breeding, but also resulted in high tadpole mortality and pond abandonment in some cases (Action 748). Grazing management has been incorporated into successful conservation strategies, with habitat management that included reintroduction of grazing helping to maintain or increase natterjack toad populations (Action 780). The combination of multiple interventions appears important, as studies consistently show success when translocation, habitat management, and pond creation are implemented together.",

Seven studies found mixed results with some species or 17-50% of captive populations reproducing successfully, while other species were difficult to maintain or raise to adults (Action 835). Seventeen studies found that captive-bred frogs were raised successfully to hatching, tadpoles, froglets or adults, though one found low froglet survival and another found three species could not be successfully raised to adulthood (Action 835). Specific success rates included 30-88% of eggs hatching or 75% survival to metamorphosis, 17-51% survival as froglets, and 50-90% survival to adults (Action 835).\n\nFor salamanders and newts, four of six studies found that eggs were produced successfully in captivity, with one case involving captive-bred females (Action 838). Two studies found that egg production depended on tank habitat or was more successful in semi-natural compared to laboratory conditions (Action 838). One study found 60% of Japanese giant salamander eggs survived to hatching in captivity (Action 838). However, one review noted that slimy salamanders produced eggs that did not hatch (Action 838).\n\nHead-starting programs, which involve captive rearing from eggs for later release, showed that six of 10 studies found released head-started tadpoles, metamorphs or juveniles established breeding populations or increased frog and toad populations (Action 881). Nine of 10 studies found that head-started amphibians released at various life stages metamorphosed successfully and tended to survive the first season, winter or year, or bred successfully (Action 881).\n\nKey challenges include the need for specific environmental conditions, as reproductive success depended on temperature or simulated wet and dry seasons (Action 835). Hormone treatment to induce breeding showed mixed results, with 30-71% of females producing viable eggs following treatment, depending on hormone combinations and dosages (Action 883). Some programs required working with surrogate species first to establish husbandry techniques before working with target species (Action 1862).\n\nOverall success of captive breeding for conservation purposes shows that 41% of release programs of captive-bred or head-started amphibians showed evidence of breeding in the wild for multiple generations, 29% showed some evidence of breeding, and 12% showed evidence of survival following release (Action 871).",

For riparian buffers, studies focusing on amphibians found that five out of six studies comparing harvesting with and without riparian buffers showed mixed effects on abundance depending on species and buffer width, while one found significantly higher amphibian abundance with buffers (Action 747). When comparing riparian buffers to unharvested forest, six studies found mixed effects depending on species or volume of existing downed wood, four found similar abundance and species composition to unharvested forest, and two found lower numbers of species and abundance than unharvested forest (Action 747). Buffer width matters, with two out of four studies finding greater amphibian species numbers and abundance in wider riparian buffer strips (Action 747).\n\nFor coarse woody debris retention, leaving woody debris in forests after logging showed predominantly neutral effects on reptiles, with four out of five studies finding no effect on reptile species richness and abundance, while one study found higher reptile species richness and abundance when debris was left in place compared to areas where debris was cleared and burned (Action 3632). Adding woody debris to landscapes showed positive results, with four out of five studies finding similar or higher reptile species richness in areas with added woody debris compared to areas without (Action 3718). For mammals, one study found more small mammal species groups in felled forest areas with woody debris than without (Action 2647).\n\nRegarding snags (standing deadwood), the evidence shows more limited benefits. For amphibians, studies found that leaving dead or wildlife trees during clearcutting did not result in higher salamander abundances compared to total clearcutting or prevent decreases compared to no harvesting (Action 845). For reptiles, two studies found mixed effects or no effect on reptile diversity, species richness, and abundance when adding snags and woody debris (Action 3631). However, for mammals, one study found that increasing standing deadwood increased the abundance of one of three shrew species compared to removing deadwood (Action 2646).\n\nVariable retention management and patch retention harvesting showed positive effects for birds. Variable retention management resulted in nine bird species occurring at higher densities compared to control stands, though five species were found at lower densities (Action 332). Patch retention harvesting contained more birds of more species than clearcut areas and retained similar numbers to unharvested areas, with forest specialist species found with greater frequency in patch retention plots (Action 330).\n\nNegative impacts of woody debris removal include one study finding that debris removal increased young tree density while another found it decreased young tree density, with mixed effects on understory vegetation cover and species richness (Action 1213).",

Regarding benefits, twelve of 16 studies found that antifungal treatment cured or increased survival of amphibians with chytridiomycosis, while four studies found that treatments reduced infection levels or had mixed results (Action 882). Specifically, six of eight studies testing itraconazole found it effective at curing amphibians of chytridiomycosis, with one study finding it reduced infection levels (Action 882). One study found that adding salt to a pond resulted in a population of green and golden bell frogs remaining free of chytridiomycosis for at least six months (Action 762). Pond drying and fungicidal treatment of midwife toads reduced infection levels, though did not eradicate chytridiomycosis (Actions 766, 767). Regarding antifungal bacteria treatments, three studies found that adding antifungal skin bacteria to chytrid infected amphibians reduced weight loss (Action 764). However, there are documented negative impacts: six studies found that specific fungicides caused death or other negative side effects in amphibians (Action 882). Additionally, three of four studies found that adding antifungal bacteria to salamanders or frogs did not reduce chytridiomycosis infection rate or death, and treatment with antimicrobial skin peptides did not significantly increase survival of common toads (Action 764).",

Adding salt to ponds has shown promise, with one study in Australia finding that following addition of salt to a pond containing the chytrid fungus, a population of green and golden bell frogs remained free of chytridiomycosis for at least six months (Action 762). Direct removal of chytrid fungus from ponds through pond drying and fungicidal treatment has been tested, with one before-and-after study in Mallorca finding that this approach reduced levels of infection in resident midwife toads but did not eradicate chytridiomycosis (Action 766). Temperature treatment represents another environmental approach, with four of five studies in Australia, Switzerland and the USA finding that increasing enclosure or water temperature to 30-37°C for over 16 hours cured frogs and toads of chytridiomycosis (Action 770). Prevention strategies include sterilizing equipment when moving between amphibian sites to prevent disease spread, though no direct evidence was found for effects on disease transmission between populations (Action 768). Additional approaches that lack direct evidence include using zooplankton to remove chytrid zoospores (Action 800) and preventing heavy usage or excluding wildfowl from aquatic habitat (Action 799).",
