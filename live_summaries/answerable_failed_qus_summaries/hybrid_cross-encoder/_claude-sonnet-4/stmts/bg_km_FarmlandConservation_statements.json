Leaving cultivated, uncropped margins or plots provides benefits to target farmland bird species, plants, invertebrates, and mammals, with increased species richness of plants, bumblebees, spiders, abundance of ground-dwelling invertebrates and ground beetles, increased stone curlew breeding population size, northern lapwing hatching success, and Eurasian skylark nesting success (Action 562). Creating uncultivated margins around intensive arable fields supports more invertebrates and higher plant diversity than conventionally managed field margins, with 19 studies finding they support more invertebrates (including bees) and/or higher plant diversity or species richness than conventional margins (Action 63). Sowing uncropped arable field margins with agricultural nectar and pollen mix, particularly with perennial leguminous flowering plants, attracts significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated, grassy or cropped field margins (Action 18). Planting grass buffer strips around arable fields increases butterfly species richness and abundance, with wider grass margins (up to 6m wide) having greater species richness of butterflies, macro-moths and micro-moths than narrower margins (Action 3982). Leaving headlands in fields unsprayed (conservation headlands) results in greater species richness and abundance of butterflies than sprayed headlands (Action 3898). Taking field corners out of management is positively correlated with grey partridge overwinter survival (Action 128). Reducing field size or maintaining smaller fields leads to higher species richness and abundance of butterflies and burnet moths compared to areas with larger fields (Action 3974).",

For supplementary feeding, nine studies from France, Sweden and the UK found that provision of supplementary food increased farmland bird abundance, breeding population size, density, body mass, hatching, nestling growth and fledging rates, and increased overwinter survival of a declining house sparrow population (Action 648). Four studies found that farmland songbirds used supplementary food when provided, including targeted species such as tree sparrow, yellowhammer and corn bunting (Action 648). However, five studies found no clear effect of supplementary food provision on farmland bird breeding abundance, reproductive success, territory size, overwinter survival of stable house sparrow populations, or tree sparrow nest box use (Action 648). For cover provision, fourteen studies from the UK found that fields sown with wild bird cover mix had higher abundance, density, species diversity and species richness of birds than other farmland habitats (Action 594). Six studies found that birds showed a preference for wild bird cover and used it significantly more than other habitats, with one review finding grey partridge population increased substantially on farms where conservation measures including cover crops were in place (Action 594). Regarding overwinter stubbles specifically, eight studies found that at least some species or groups of farmland birds were positively associated with over-winter stubbles, with two studies reporting that seed-eating birds in particular were more abundant on stubbles (Action 203). However, mixed results were also reported, with some studies finding no preferential use of stubbles compared to cover crops, and effectiveness varying by species and management type (Actions 203, 695).",

Managing the agricultural landscape to enhance floral resources shows promise, with one large replicated controlled trial demonstrating that long-tongued bumblebee abundance on field margins was positively correlated with the number of pollen and nectar agri-environment agreements in a 10 km grid square (Action ID: 362).\n\nReducing chemical inputs supports invertebrate populations, with studies on restricting certain pesticides showing that using specific fungicides reduced chick food insect abundance less than others (Action ID: 565). Reducing pesticide or fertilizer use through organic farming methods has shown some benefits, with studies finding increased wood mouse abundance when pesticides were reduced, though effects varied by species (Action ID: 2539). Managing grassland through reduced cutting frequency benefits pollinators, with studies finding that meadows cut once per year had higher species richness of butterflies and other pollinators compared to meadows cut two or more times per year (Action ID: 3961).

Mechanical and manual removal of invasive plants showed mixed results - one study in Hawaii found that removal of invasive grass species increased understory plant biomass, while a study in Ghana found that removal of invasive weed species increased tree seedling height, though a study in the USA found no effect of invasive shrub removal on understory plant diversity and a Hawaii study found no effect on native species growth rate (Action 1228).

Raising water levels in ditches or grassland was associated with increased bird numbers, breeding bird numbers, plant species that favour wet conditions, and invertebrate numbers or biomass in agricultural landscapes (Action 121). Additionally, higher plant diversity was found on ditch banks along unsprayed edges compared to those sprayed with pesticides (Action 135). For pond management, maintaining pond water levels increased natterjack toad populations or maintained newt populations (Action 833) and enabled successful breeding by dusky gopher frogs (Action 833). However, drawbacks were also identified. Some studies found that ditch management had negative or no clear effects on some farmland bird species or plants (Action 135). Raising water levels resulted in a net loss of plant species and did not affect lapwing foraging rate (Action 121). Unflooded pastures contained a high biomass of soil macroinvertebrates of importance to breeding wading birds (Action 121). Additionally, re-wetting soils on old arable fields was not an effective method of reducing nutrient levels and restoring species-rich grassland (Action 121).

Planting trees on farmland provides benefits, with two studies in the UK finding that farm woodland supported higher small mammal abundance than arable land or similar abundance compared to uncultivated field margins and set-aside (2386). Planting new or maintaining existing hedgerows shows promise, with a study in the UK finding that establishing hedgerows alongside arable land increased small mammal abundance (2383). Planting crops to provide supplementary food for mammals has demonstrated effectiveness, with studies in the UK and Spain finding that crops grown to provide food for wildlife resulted in higher abundance of small mammals in winter (2394). Reducing pesticide or fertilizer use can be beneficial, with one study in the UK finding that organic farming increased wood mouse abundance (2539). Reducing the intensity of grazing by domestic livestock has shown positive results, with six of nine studies in the USA, Denmark, the UK, China, Netherlands, and Norway finding that reductions in livestock grazing intensity were associated with increases in abundances of small mammals (2408). However, some interventions showed mixed or no effects: providing or retaining set-aside areas showed three studies in the UK and Switzerland finding that set-aside did not enhance small mammal numbers relative to cropland or to uncultivated field margins and farm woodland (2377).",

Regarding mowing height, raised mowing heights benefit some species including Eurasian skylark with increased productivity and are less damaging to amphibians and invertebrates (Action 138). However, northern lapwing and common starling chicks had greater foraging success in shorter grass (Action 138). For mowing techniques, specific techniques can reduce mortality or injury in birds, mammals, amphibians, and invertebrates (Action 698). Changing mowing patterns reduces chick mortality - 68% of corncrake chicks escaped when fields were mown from center outwards compared to 45% during conventional edge-inward mowing (Action 698). Different machinery types have varying impacts: bar mowers and double chop mowers cause less damage to amphibians and invertebrates than other types, while rotary disc mowers with conditioners kill twice as many small mammals compared to double blade mowers. Skylark chick survival was four times higher when wider mowing machinery was used (Action 698). Regarding timing, delayed mowing benefits various species groups. The UK corncrake population increased following initiatives to delay mowing (Action 223, 131, 192). Delaying mowing dates resulted in higher plant species richness, more insect species and individuals visiting flowers, greater abundance of some spiders and ground beetles, increased breeding wading bird densities, and increased Eurasian skylark productivity (Action 131). However, some studies found no clear effects on plant species richness, ground beetle communities, or abundance of some insects and spiders (Action 131). Rotational mowing strategies also show benefits: grasslands managed by mowing strips in alternate years or leaving rotational areas uncut had greater species richness and diversity of butterflies than grasslands cut in full once per year (Action 3966). Reducing cutting frequency can be beneficial, with meadows cut once per year having higher species richness of butterflies and moths than meadows cut multiple times per year (Action 3961). Seasonal timing effects vary, with cutting in different seasons having different impacts on individual plant species abundance in freshwater marshes (Action 3070).",

For invasive non-native plants, mechanical control includes removing all flower heads at peak flowering time, which dramatically reduces seed production in giant hogweed (action 104). Physical removal methods include cutting invasive plants to similar heights as native plants, weeding, cutting and applying herbicide, with some studies showing these methods increase butterfly species richness and abundance (action 3890). Hand weeding and selective vegetation management are also effective approaches (action 3714).\n\nFor bracken control specifically, multiple methods are available. Herbicide application using asulam reduces bracken abundance if applied repeatedly, with studies showing it increases heather seedlings and biomass, plant species number, and cover of wavy hair-grass and sheep's fescue while reducing bracken biomass and cover (action 1652). Cutting bracken increases heather cover or biomass and species richness of heathland plants, while also increasing cover of wavy hair-grass and sheep's fescue and reducing bracken cover or biomass (action 1653). A combined approach of cutting and applying herbicide reduces bracken biomass or cover and increases plant species richness when cutting is followed by herbicide application compared to herbicide followed by cutting (action 1654). However, cutting may be equally effective to repeated herbicide application according to systematic review findings (action 105).\n\nAdditional control methods include using grass-specific herbicides that reduce grass diversity while increasing broadleaved plants, cutting and infection with fungal pathogens for controlling creeping thistle, and lenient grazing for long-term control (action 123). The herbicide asulam is noted to reduce bracken abundance but may affect associated moss species when exposed over three weeks (action 105).",

Effects include positive impacts on invertebrate densities and ground beetle diversity, evidence of bird usage, and provision of nest sites for harvest mice (action 651). One study found higher densities of harvest mouse nests on beetle banks than field margins (action 2393).\n\n**Conservation Headlands**: Leave headlands unsprayed (actions 3898, 29), with studies showing increased butterfly species richness and abundance in unsprayed headlands compared to sprayed ones (action 3898).

Creating skylark plots within cereal fields shows positive effects, with studies finding increases in skylark population size, breeding density, duration or success, and benefits to plants and invertebrates (Action 540). Undersowing spring cereals with clover benefits some birds, plants, insects, spiders and earthworms, including increases in Eurasian skylark density and nesting dunnock, arthropod abundance and species richness, and bumblebee, butterfly, earthworm, ground beetle, spider or springtail abundances (Action 136). Planting wild bird seed or cover mixture shows strong evidence of effectiveness, with studies finding higher bird diversity, densities, abundances, nesting densities, and higher productivities for some species compared to other habitats (Action 187). Sowing crops in spring rather than autumn provides benefits, with studies finding more bird species on areas with spring sown cereals compared with winter cereals, and population increases after the start of spring sowing (Action 207). Conservation headlands (leaving headlands unsprayed) are frequently used by bird species and show higher grey partridge chick and adult survival, with larger broods on farms with conservation headlands (Action 461). Creating beetle banks provides habitat that holds more invertebrate predators than surrounding crops, which can benefit the wider food web (Action 729). However, evidence for some options is limited - no evidence was found for the effects of leaving unharvested cereal headlands on bird populations (Actions 206, 646), and planting cereals in wide-spaced rows showed mixed results with lower invertebrate abundances and fewer skylark nests but increased nestling body condition (Action 564).",

For butterflies and moths, 23 studies showed that nectar flower mixtures and wildflower strips had higher species richness and diversity than conventional field margins, unsown margins, and cropped fields (Action 3932). Ten studies found higher abundance of butterflies including generalist, specialist, and meadow brown butterflies in sown wildflower strips compared to conventional margins and cropped fields (Action 3932). For bees, five replicated trials demonstrated that uncropped field margins sown with wild flowers support higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees than cropped field edges, grassy margins, or naturally regenerated margins (Action 19). Four trials showed that field margins sown with agricultural nectar and pollen mixes attract significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated, grassy, or cropped field margins (Action 18). Perennial leguminous herbs in seed mixtures are particularly important forage sources for bumblebees, especially long-tongued species (Action 19). For birds, four replicated controlled studies found that plots sown with wildflower or legume seed mix attracted more birds or bird species, with Eurasian skylarks preferentially foraging and nesting in sown weed patches (Action 442). All five studies investigating wildflower strips effects on small mammals found increases in abundance, density and species richness (Action 442). For nettle strips specifically, a study from Belgium found that planting nettle strips in arable field margins resulted in a higher number of aphid predator species, with three insect families including green lacewings found only on nettles (Action 118). Overall, 80 individual studies investigating flowering strips showed that 64 demonstrated some benefits to one or more wildlife groups, with 50 of 65 studies on invertebrates reporting positive effects (Action 442).",
