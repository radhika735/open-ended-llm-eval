Mesh escape panels/windows showed positive results, with 15 of 30 studies finding reduced unwanted catches of various fish species compared to standard diamond mesh trawl nets (Action 2716). Size-sorting mesh funnels in shrimp trawls were effective in all 3 studies, reducing catches of unwanted non-commercial or discarded fish compared to standard trawls (Action 2722).\n\nPhysical gear modifications: Topless (coverless) trawls showed effectiveness in 2 of 4 studies, reducing catch of unwanted Atlantic cod and discards of commercial fish species compared to conventional trawl types (Action 2712). Bottom trawls with parts raised off the seabed were effective in both studies examined, catching fewer unwanted sharks, elasmobranchs and fish compared to conventional trawls (Action 2708). Removing tickler chains showed effectiveness in 1 of 2 studies, reducing catches of non-commercial target skates/rays and sharks while keeping commercial target species catches typically unaffected (Action 2709).\n\nArtificial lighting: Artificial lights on fishing gear showed limited effectiveness, with only 1 study finding that shrimp trawl nets with lights caught fewer unwanted fish when fitted to the fishing line compared to conventional trawl (Action 2695).",

Protecting spawning fish from capture can safeguard reproduction directly, with studies showing that spawning and nursery areas closed seasonally or permanently to fishing were used by tagged adult Atlantic cod for nearly a third of time during spawning (Action ID: 2938). Setting a minimum landing size for commercially fished species can protect immature fish before they have the opportunity to reproduce, though one global review found that only one of five swordfish fisheries showed increased recruitment after setting recommended minimum landing sizes, while one study reported that most fish in commercial catches were still immature despite established minimum sizes (Action ID: 2735). \n\nTemporal restrictions include establishing temporary fishery closures, where tagged adult cod spent nearly a third of time inside a seasonally closed spawning area, providing increased protection during the spawning period (Action ID: 2664). Long-term fishery closures can also protect fish populations, with studies showing higher abundance of young salmon and improved weights of young salmon returning to rivers in the five years after closure of a commercial coastal fishery (Action ID: 2655). Establishing territorial user rights for fisheries demonstrated benefits for reproductive success, with one study finding larger-sized and more numerous egg capsules, and more larvae of Chilean abalone up to 21 months after establishing fishing restrictions compared to open-access areas (Action ID: 2104).\n\nGear modifications can reduce capture of juvenile fish before they reach reproductive maturity. Using larger mesh sizes in fishing nets improved size-selectivity and reduced catches of unwanted small/undersized fish in 15 of 20 studies across multiple marine regions, allowing juvenile fish to escape and reach reproductive age (Action ID: 2697).

Two studies in the Mediterranean Sea (France, Corsica) found that prohibiting spearfishing and line fishing in protected areas increased the abundances of European seabass and gilthead seabream compared to protected and unprotected fished areas after two to seven years (action 2672). The same studies found that European seabass were larger in size in areas where spearfishing was prohibited compared to protected and unprotected fished areas after two to seven years (action 2672). Additionally, one study in the Mediterranean Sea found that prohibiting spearfishing in specific zones of a marine reserve resulted in higher commercial and recreational fishery catches of targeted common dentex compared to zones that allowed spearfishing and areas outside the reserve after one to three years (action 2672). More broadly, studies from the Mediterranean Sea showed that marine protected areas prohibiting all types of fishing for between three and 16 years had different fish community composition compared to fished areas (action 2682). Several Mediterranean studies found that marine protected areas that had prohibited all fishing for between one to more than 25 years had higher fish species richness compared to fished areas (action 2682). Mediterranean studies also found higher abundances and biomasses of all fish, fishery targeted fish species, and individual fish species in marine protected areas that had been prohibiting all fishing for up to 25 years compared to unprotected fished areas (action 2682). Fish in non-fished Mediterranean marine reserves were found to be larger overall and had larger individuals of monitored fish species compared to fished areas after one to 22 years (action 2682). One Mediterranean study found more eggs of four commercially targeted fish species inside a non-fished marine reserve enforced for three years than in fished areas outside the reserve (action 2682).",

Prohibiting line fishing altogether has shown positive effects on fish populations - one study found that prohibiting offshore line fishing and all other boat-based fishing in a marine protected area resulted in higher abundances of four of four fish species over-exploited by line fishing, and these species were also larger in size compared to areas where fishing was permitted (Action 2671). Prohibiting certain gear types generally reduces unwanted catch - a study in the Kattegat found that prohibiting non-selective gear types combined with fishery closures reduced unwanted catch of cod, and another study in the Indian Ocean found higher fish density in areas where all but one gear type was prohibited compared to areas with fewer restrictions (Action 3810).\n\nRegarding gear modifications, longline configuration changes show mixed results for unwanted catch reduction. Modifying longline configuration such as increasing lead weights or using nylon instead of wire hook attachments reduced unwanted shark and ray catches in some cases but not others, with one review finding reductions in one of two cases examined. Survival rates of unwanted sharks and rays varied depending on the modification - nylon hook attachments showed higher survival for two of three species but lower survival for one species compared to wire attachments (Action 2699). Different bait types had inconsistent effects - six of eight studies found that using different bait types reduced unwanted catches of various species including undersized haddock and Atlantic cod, while two studies found no reduction in unwanted catches, and global reviews found no effect on unwanted shark and ray catches (Action 2700).\n\nGillnet modifications showed promising results for reducing unwanted catch - three of four studies found that modifications including reduced height, increased mesh size, and changes in twine diameter reduced unwanted catch of cod, discarded commercial and non-commercial species, though one study found no reduction in unwanted shark catches (Action 2701). Additional gear modifications like escape grids and panels in trawl nets also showed effectiveness, with three of four studies finding reduced unwanted fish and shark catches when these devices were fitted to nets (Action 2726).",

Three of seven replicated studies in the Barents/Norwegian Sea, the Atlantic Ocean and the Greenland Sea found that different types or configurations of size-sorting escape grid systems in trawl nets resulted in better size-selectivity for unwanted redfish and Greenland halibut and of commercial target hake compared to other designs or configurations (Action 2728).

Additionally, six of seven fish species had a lower flight response distance in the closed area, making them more vulnerable to capture with spear guns (Action 2675).\n\nWhen establishing community-based fisheries management: In the Foveaux Straight, a customary fisheries area with community-based management had more New Zealand scallops compared to both a protected area prohibiting all fishing and an area allowing recreational harvest, though the scallops tended to be smaller (Action 2242).\n\nWhen prohibiting commercial fishing while allowing other activities: Results varied depending on the specific management approach. In some cases, marine protected areas prohibiting commercial fishing showed mixed results for lobster populations, with some studies finding no increase in abundance over 12 years, while others found bigger lobsters in protected areas compared to fished areas (Action 2225).\n\nGeneral fishing restrictions in marine protected areas: A global review found that 10 of 11 studies showed higher fish abundance inside areas with fishing restrictions compared to areas without restrictions, and five out of 11 studies found larger fish inside protected areas (Action 2680).

        "Several ecological outcomes have been observed from different approaches to managing small-scale traditional fisheries.",
        "In the Adriatic Sea, a marine protected area zone allowing only artisanal fishing activity for three years had higher overall commercial catch rates of five of seven fish species compared to unprotected areas openly fished.",
        "In the Bismark Sea, an area closed to customary fishing for eight years showed higher abundance of only one of seven fish species compared to an area open to customary fishing.",
        "In an area of the Bismark Sea closed to customary fishing, six of seven fish species had a lower flight response distance.",
        "The lower flight response distance made the fish species more vulnerable to capture with spear guns.",
        "In the Foveaux Straight, a customary fisheries area with community-based management had more New Zealand scallops compared to both a protected area prohibiting all fishing and an area allowing recreational harvest.",
        "The scallops in the Foveaux Straight's customary fisheries area tended to be smaller.",
        "Results from prohibiting commercial fishing while allowing other activities varied depending on the specific management approach.",
        "Marine protected areas prohibiting commercial fishing showed mixed results for lobster populations.",
        "Some studies of marine protected areas prohibiting commercial fishing found no increase in lobster abundance over 12 years.",
        "Other studies found bigger lobsters in marine protected areas compared to fished areas.",
        "A global review found that 10 of 11 studies showed higher fish abundance inside areas with fishing restrictions compared to areas without restrictions.",
        "A global review found that five out of 11 studies showed larger fish inside protected areas.",
        "When territorial user rights for fisheries were established, one study found larger-sized and more numerous egg capsules of Chilean abalone compared to open-access areas.",
        "When territorial user rights for fisheries were established, one study found more larvae of Chilean abalone compared to open-access areas."
