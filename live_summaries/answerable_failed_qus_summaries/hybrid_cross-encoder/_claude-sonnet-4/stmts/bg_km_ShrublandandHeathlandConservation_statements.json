Other mechanical methods include rotovating (1648), though this did not alter grass presence in one study, and raking (1640), which reduced both invasive and native grass cover in one study. Prescribed burning (1723) is used to control grass, though one study found it did not reduce purple moor grass cover but did reduce common heather cover. Combination treatments include herbicide with prescribed burning (1725), which did not reduce purple moor grass cover, and cutting with prescribed burning (1724), which also did not reduce purple moor grass cover. Grazing management through livestock use (1646) had mixed effects, with one study finding increased wavy-hair grass cover and another finding reduced grass height. Livestock exclusion using fences (1545) showed variable results, with one study finding declined grass cover and one study finding increased grass cover. Additional techniques include adding mulch with seeding (1650), though this did not reduce grass cover, and allowing natural regeneration without active management (1679), where two studies found decreased grass cover or biomass after fire.",

Changing the type of livestock leads to mixed effects on shrub cover, but in two studies it reduced the cover of herbaceous species (Action 1608). Grazing with both cattle and sheep, as opposed to grazing with sheep alone, reduced cover of purple moor grass but had no effect on four other plant species (Action 1608).\n\nIncreasing the number of livestock shows varied impacts on shrub communities. In the UK, high density livestock caused common heather cover to decline, while in the Netherlands dwarf shrub cover was lower in grazed versus ungrazed areas (Action 1628). However, one study in Belgium found that grazing increased heather cover, and areas grazed by cattle in France had higher cover of non-ericaceous shrubs but lower cover of ericaceous shrubs (Action 1628). Increasing livestock numbers resulted in increased common heather and cross-leaved heath seedlings in the Netherlands, but one US study found no alteration in shrub cover (Action 1628). A systematic review found that increased grazing intensity increased grass species cover relative to heather species (Action 1628).\n\nExcluding livestock from shrublands through fencing generally increases shrub cover and abundance, with studies showing increased shrub biomass and height of individual heather plants (Action 1545). However, one US study found decreased woody plant cover with fencing (Action 1545). Livestock exclusion typically decreases grass cover in some studies, though effects are mixed across different locations (Action 1545). \n\nIn degraded peatlands, excluding livestock shows variable effects: some studies found no effect on shrub cover, while others found increased shrub cover, with responses sometimes varying between species and sites (Action 1734).

Livestock grazing represents another alternative, where increasing livestock numbers can influence shrub cover and vegetation structure, with studies showing mixed effects on heather cover and increases in grass species relative to heather species (Action 1628). Cutting and mowing can be used to mimic traditional grazing practices, with studies in North Western Europe, Italy, and Spain showing varied effects on heather abundance and grass cover (Action 1627). Heathland management through cutting has shown benefits for some butterfly species, with mechanical cutting demonstrating higher abundance of certain species compared to other management approaches (Action 3947). Rotovation represents another mechanical approach for controlling grass species, though studies found it did not significantly alter heather presence compared to mowing or cutting (Action 1648). Additionally, cutting combined with seeding of shrubland plants can help control grass while establishing desired shrub species (Action 1639).

One controlled study in the UK found that mowing increased the number of heathland plants in one of two sites and increased the presence of a small minority of heathland plants (Action 1638). Two randomized controlled studies in the USA found that mowing reduced grass cover, but in one study grass cover recovered over time (Action 1638). However, three replicated controlled studies found that cutting to control grass did not alter cover of common heather or shrub seedling abundance (Action 1638).\n\n**Cutting/Mowing Combined with Seeding**: When cutting is combined with sowing shrubland plant seeds, one randomized controlled study in the USA found that this approach increased shrub seedling abundance and reduced grass cover (Action 1639). However, another study found that the biomass of sagebrush plants in areas where grass was cut and seeds sown did not differ from areas where grass was not cut but seeds were sown (Action 1639).\n\n**Mechanical Soil Disturbance**: Rotovating (mechanical cultivation) showed limited effectiveness, with one study finding it did not alter the presence of heather or wavy hair grass compared to mowing or cutting (Action 1648). When combined with mowing, one controlled study found that mowing followed by rotovating increased the number of heathland plant species in one of two sites (Action 1641).\n\n**Turf Stripping**: Cutting and removing turf showed promise in one controlled study in the UK, which found it increased the number of heathland plants and increased the presence of heathland plants while decreasing the presence of non-heathland plants (Action 1647).\n\n**Prescribed Burning**: Prescribed burning alone showed mixed results for grass control. One replicated controlled study found that prescribed burning to reduce purple moor grass cover did not reduce its cover but did reduce the cover of common heather (Action 1723). When combined with cutting, burning and cutting reduced cover of common heather but did not reduce cover of purple moor grass (Action 1724).\n\n**Grazing**: One replicated controlled study in the Netherlands found that grazing to reduce grass cover had mixed effects on cover of common heather and cross-leaved heath, while cover of wavy-hair grass increased (Action 1646). One before-and-after study in Spain found a reduction in grass height with grazing (Action 1646).",

In one study, prescribed burning to reduce purple moor grass cover did not reduce the target species but did reduce common heather cover (action 1723).

In reptile populations, immediate negative effects were documented, with reptile abundance being lower immediately after burning compared to before burning, though abundance recovered after vegetation regrew (action 3651). Additionally, areas burned 1-4 years earlier had lower reptile species richness and abundance compared to areas burned 11-15 years earlier (action 3651).

No studies were found that evaluated the effects of placing signs to discourage access to sensitive areas of shrub habitat on shrublands (Action 1620). Similarly, no evidence was found for the effects of creating managed paths/signs to contain disturbance on forests (Action 1170), and no studies evaluated the effects of limiting, ceasing or prohibiting access for recreational purposes on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations (Action 2152). While one study in Turkey found that using signs and access restrictions (specifically fencing sea turtle nests with signs) resulted in higher hatching success compared to areas with no fencing or signs (Action 3642), this was in a marine turtle context rather than shrubland habitat. For broader access management, studies on mammals showed that excluding or limiting visitors to protected areas resulted in higher population abundance of medium-sized and large mammals on roads with restricted access compared to unrestricted access, fewer bear killings when visitor access was temporarily restricted, and increased use of protected areas by grizzly bears and leopards when human access was restricted (Action 2330). However, these findings are not specific to shrubland ecosystems.",
