      "relevant_summary": "The most effective actions for increasing natural enemy populations on farmland include several habitat management and chemical control strategies. Creating beetle banks provides habitat for natural enemies, with studies finding higher numbers of invertebrate predators on beetle banks compared to surrounding crops, though effects varied with time and location (Action 729, 651). Natural regeneration of ground cover beneath perennial crops shows mixed results, with some studies finding more natural enemies in natural ground cover, particularly short-term effects for most natural enemy groups (Action 720). \n\nPlanting specific vegetation can attract and support natural enemies. Growing non-crop plants that produce chemicals attractive to natural enemies resulted in higher numbers of natural enemies in three of four studies, with one replicated, randomised, controlled trial showing increased natural enemy populations (Action 724). Planting flowers in strips led to more natural enemies in fields with planted flower strips compared to fields without them, with two replicated studies from the USA showing positive effects (Action 1400). Planting hedgerows resulted in more natural enemies in fields with hedgerows compared to fields with weedy edges in some comparisons (Action 1401). Planting nettle strips in field margins resulted in higher numbers of aphid predator species (Action 118).\n\nChemical attraction methods can also be effective. Using chemicals to attract natural enemies increased natural enemy populations in five of 13 studies from multiple continents, though eight studies found positive effects that varied between enemy groups, sites or study dates (Action 754). Two of four studies found higher chemical doses attracted more enemies (Action 754).\n\nManagement practices that reduce pesticide impacts support natural enemy populations. Delaying herbicide use resulted in more natural enemies in two randomised, replicated, controlled trials from Australia and Denmark, though some but not all natural enemy groups benefited (Action 774). Incorporating parasitism rates when setting thresholds for insecticide use resulted in acceptable levels of crop damage while considering natural enemy activity, though effects on natural enemy populations were not directly monitored (Action 726).\n\nMass-emergence devices showed limited effectiveness, with one study in Switzerland finding higher parasitism at one site but no effect at another site (Action 775). Adding compost to soil showed mixed results, with one study finding similar ratios of natural enemies to pests and similar percentages of pests consumed by natural enemies in plots with or without added compost (Action 1392).",

Allelopathic plant incorporation (action 728) involves incorporating plant remains into soil that produce weed-controlling chemicals, with six studies finding reductions in weed growth though effects varied between years and weed groups. Cover crops (action 1394) can be grown in arable fields, with four studies finding fewer weeds in plots with cover crops compared to plots without them, though some studies found inconsistent effects. Competitive planting (action 722) involves growing plants that compete with damaging weeds, with all nine studies finding reduced weed plant weight or ground cover. Crop rotation (action 1396) was shown in one study to reduce weed biomass when using a canola-wheat sequence compared to wheat-wheat sequence. Tillage management offers multiple approaches: reduced tillage (action 1399) showed more weeds in most comparisons according to seven studies, while no-tillage (action 1397) had inconsistent effects with sometimes more and sometimes fewer weeds across multiple studies. General tillage reduction (action 126) increased numbers of some weeds according to studies across European countries. Mixed pasture systems (action 721) showed reduced weeds in two studies comparing mixed to monoculture pasture. Ground cover management in orchards and vineyards (action 1395) found fewer weeds in one comparison and more weeds in another. Natural regeneration of ground cover beneath perennial crops (action 720) provided weed suppression benefits. Converting to organic farming (action 717) found more weeds in organically farmed fields in three studies, though effects varied between crops and years. Surface mulching (action 1650) was tested for grass control though showed limited effectiveness in one study.",

      "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from action documents, several alternative pest management methods are available for perennial tree crops like orchards besides using insecticides. Ground cover management shows promise, with action 1395 indicating that planting or maintaining ground cover in orchards or vineyards can affect pest regulation, with some studies finding more leafhopper eggs parasitized in plots with cover crops compared to bare fallows, though results were inconsistent across studies. Physical exclusion methods are effective, as action 886 demonstrates that excluding ants that protect pests using glue or pesticide barriers can reduce pest numbers and increase parasitism by natural enemies in crops including cherry, grape, grapefruit, orange, and pecan trees. Push-pull systems represent another alternative approach, with action 753 showing that combining trap and repellent crops increased parasitism of stem borer larvae and resulted in fewer pests and higher yields in some studies. Chemical attractants for natural enemies offer potential benefits, as action 754 found that using chemicals to attract natural enemies increased parasitism in some studies and resulted in more natural enemies, though effects varied between enemy groups, sites, and study dates across crops including apple, grape, grapefruit, and orange. Beneficial insect conservation can be enhanced through habitat management, with action 118 showing that planting nettle strips resulted in higher numbers of aphid predator species, including green lacewings that were only found on nettles. Integrated approaches such as incorporating parasitism rates when setting thresholds for pest control decisions (action 726) resulted in acceptable levels of crop damage from pests in tomato studies. Alley cropping (action 718) showed mixed results on pest management, with some studies finding fewer pests and others finding variable effects depending on pest groups and study years. Conversion to organic farming (action 895) demonstrated higher soil organism diversity and fruit quality in some orchard studies, though with mixed effects on yields.",

Beetle banks create refuge habitats that increase predator numbers, with four studies and a review finding more invertebrate predators on beetle banks than in surrounding crops (Action 729). Six studies from Canada, the UK and USA found that predators increased in adjacent crops near beetle banks, though effects varied with time and movement of predators from banks to crops was sometimes slow (Action 729).\n\nGrowing non-crop plants that produce chemicals attractive to natural enemies has shown positive results, with three studies from China, Germany, India and Kenya (including one randomised controlled trial) finding higher numbers of natural enemies in plots with such plants, while all four studies found decreased pest populations or damage (Action 724). \n\nFlower strips planted within agricultural systems demonstrate benefits for natural enemies, with two replicated studies from the USA finding more natural enemies in fields with planted flower strips compared to fields without them, and two controlled studies from Italy finding more natural enemies in planted flower strips than on bare ground (Action 1400). Three replicated studies from Italy and the USA found greater pest reduction or higher proportions of parasitized pests in fields and farms with planted flower strips (Action 1400).\n\nHedgerows provide habitat that supports natural enemies, with one study from the USA finding more natural enemies in fields with hedgerows compared to fields with weedy edges, and a higher proportion of pest eggs parasitized in tomato fields with hedgerows up to 100m into the crop (Action 1401). Intercropping systems also boost beneficial insects, with three randomised controlled studies from the Netherlands, Poland and the UK finding increased ground beetle abundance when intercropping cabbage with French beans or clover (Action 124).\n\nField margin management contributes to natural enemy populations, with studies showing that nettle strips in field margins resulted in higher numbers of aphid predator species, with three insect families including green lacewings found only on nettles (Action 118). Uncultivated margins around fields support more invertebrates including beneficial species, with 19 studies from European countries finding they support more invertebrates and higher plant diversity than conventionally managed margins (Action 63).",

One study found that genetically modified maize expressing Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki (Btk) toxin was effective against European corn borer.\n\nCrop rotation systems have shown pest reduction benefits (Action 719).

In perennial crop systems specifically, one replicated, randomized, controlled study from the USA found that more leafhopper eggs were parasitized in plots with cover crops compared to bare fallows in orchards or vineyards, though this was only observed in one of six comparisons (Action 1395). Two additional replicated, randomized, controlled studies from the USA found inconsistent differences or no differences in parasitism of leafhopper eggs between plots with or without ground cover (Action 1395). The use of mass-emergence devices showed mixed results, with one randomised, replicated, controlled study in Switzerland finding higher parasitism at one site but no effect at another site when used in urban areas (Action 775). Four studies from China, Germany, India and Kenya found that growing non-crop plants that produce chemicals attracting natural enemies resulted in higher numbers of natural enemies, including in fruit trees, though one study found no effect on parasitism when the plant used was not attractive to natural enemies in laboratory studies (Action 724). Alley cropping systems showed variable results, with two of four studies from Kenya and the USA finding that effects on parasitism varied between study sites, sampling dates, pest life stages or crop alley width, while two studies found no effect on parasitism (Action 718).

One study found net profit increased if produce received a premium, but otherwise profit decreased (Action 717).

One study also found that crop rotation increased profit (Action 719).\n\nTillage practice modifications show variable results. For reduced tillage systems, nine replicated, controlled studies from the USA found higher cereal yields compared to conventional tillage in some or all comparisons, though three of these studies also found lower cereal yields in some comparisons (Action 1359). Five replicated, randomized, controlled studies from the USA found higher fruit or vegetable yields with reduced tillage in some comparisons, though two studies also found lower yields in some comparisons (Action 1359).

For ant exclusion methods (Action 886), effects varied between sampling dates, and one study specified effects at times of peak pest abundance only. However, most of the evidence does not provide specific quantitative data about how long these natural pest control interventions remain effective.",

Push-pull systems combine trap and repellent crops, with studies from Kenya finding increased parasitism of stem borer larvae, more natural predators, fewer pests and witchweeds, less pest damage, and higher yields (Action 753). Intercropping involves planting more than one crop per field, with studies from the Netherlands, Poland and the UK showing increased ground beetle abundance when cabbage was intercropped with French beans or clover (Action 124). Alley cropping uses hedgerows of trees or shrubs between crop alleys, with one study from Kenya finding more wasps and spiders but fewer ladybirds, and effects varying between study sites and pest life stages (Action 718). Planting flowers for pest regulation has shown greater pest reduction and higher proportions of parasitized pests in fields with planted flower strips according to studies from Italy and the USA (Action 1400). Growing non-crop plants that produce chemicals to attract natural enemies resulted in higher numbers of natural enemies and decreased pest populations or damage across studies from China, Germany, India and Kenya (Action 724). Cover crops in arable fields can provide pest regulation benefits, with some studies finding fewer aphids and reduced disease severity (Action 1394). Natural regeneration of ground cover beneath perennial crops shows mixed effects, with some studies finding more natural enemies and fewer pests in fruit tree and vine systems (Action 720). Mixed pastures reduce weeds and some pest groups compared to monoculture systems according to studies from North America (Action 721). Planting hedgerows around fields increases parasitism of pest eggs and provides more natural enemies, with one study from the USA finding higher parasitism rates in tomato fields with hedgerows compared to fields with weedy edges (Action 1401).",

Alley cropping systems have shown mixed results but can affect natural enemy populations and pest levels (Action 718).\n\nIncorporating biological factors into pest management decisions, such as using parasitism rates when setting thresholds for insecticide use, has resulted in acceptable levels of crop damage from pests (Action 726). Organic farming systems have been studied as an alternative approach, showing different effects on various species populations compared to conventional farming (Action 961).",

Planting or maintaining ground cover in orchards or vineyards showed that four replicated controlled studies found more natural enemies in plots with ground cover compared to plots without ground cover, in some or all comparisons (Action 1395). Allowing natural regeneration of ground cover beneath perennial crops demonstrated that five studies found more natural enemies in natural ground cover, and four studies found fewer pests or lower crop damage, though effects varied for different pest groups (Action 720). Excluding ants that protect pests showed that three of seven studies found fewer pests, and one study found greater tree growth when ants were excluded from trees (Action 886). Isolating colonies of beneficial ants resulted in predatory ants occupying more cashew trees, leading to lower pest damage and higher yields (Action 773). Using chemicals to attract natural enemies showed that five of 13 studies found more natural enemies, three of nine studies found fewer pests, and one study found higher wheat yields (Action 754). Incorporating parasitism rates when setting thresholds for insecticide use resulted in acceptable levels of crop damage from pests in one controlled study (Action 726). Delaying herbicide use increased natural enemies in two randomized, replicated, controlled trials, and one study found fewer pests in one of two experiments (Action 774). Alley cropping showed mixed results, with some studies finding increased natural enemies like wasps and spiders, though effects on pests varied between sites and years (Action 718).",

      "relevant_summary": "Alternative strategies to routine, preventative insecticide spraying for managing farm pests include several evidence-based approaches. Crop rotation has been shown to reduce pest populations, crop diseases, and the need for insecticide treatments in potato farming systems (719). Push-pull systems that combine trap and repellent crops increase parasitism of stem borer larvae, provide more natural predators, and result in fewer pests with less crop damage and higher yields (753). Incorporating parasitism rates when setting thresholds for insecticide use allows for acceptable levels of crop damage while reducing pesticide applications (726). Planting flower strips increases pest reduction and higher proportions of parasitized pests in fields and farms, while also supporting more natural enemies (1400). Creating beetle banks provides refugia for predatory invertebrates that can reduce pest numbers, particularly in areas closest to the banks (729). Using chemicals to attract natural enemies can increase parasitism and predation rates, though effects vary by chemical type and application conditions (754). Allowing natural regeneration of ground cover beneath perennial crops can increase natural enemy populations on the ground, with some studies finding fewer pests and reduced crop damage (720). Leaving part of the crop or pasture unharvested provides habitat for predatory insects and spiders, increasing predation and parasitism rates of pest eggs (725). Excluding ants that protect pests can increase parasitism by natural enemies and reduce pest numbers in fruit trees (886), while isolating colonies of beneficial ants can increase predatory ant occupation and reduce pest damage (773). Organic farming systems provide alternatives to synthetic pesticides, though effects on pest management vary by implementation (961).",

Excluding ants that protect pests resulted in greater parasitism of pests by natural enemies in one of two replicated, controlled studies from Japan and the USA, with the other study finding greater parasitism at one site but no effect at another (action 886). Push-pull cropping systems increased parasitism of stem borer larvae in two randomised, replicated, controlled studies from Kenya, though one study found no effect on egg parasitism (action 753). Planted flower strips led to higher proportions of parasitized pests in three replicated studies from Italy and the USA (action 1400). Using chemicals to attract natural enemies increased parasitism in one review and two of five studies from Asia, Europe and North America, while two studies found greater parasitism for some but not all chemicals, crops, sites or years, and one study found no effect (action 754). Mass-emergence devices resulted in higher parasitism at one site but no effect at another site in one randomised, replicated, controlled study in Switzerland (action 775). Leaving part of the crop unharvested or uncut increased predation and parasitism rates of pest eggs in unharvested strips in one replicated, controlled study from Australia (action 725). Alley cropping showed variable effects, with two of four studies from Kenya and the USA finding that effects on parasitism varied between study sites, sampling dates, pest life stages or the width of crop alleys, while two studies found no effect on parasitism (action 718).",
