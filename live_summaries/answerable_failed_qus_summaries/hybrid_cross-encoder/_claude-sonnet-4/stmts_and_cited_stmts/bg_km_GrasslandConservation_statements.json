Action 133 found that restoring species-rich grassland resulted in higher plant species richness compared to other types of grassland, with effective techniques including grazing, introducing plant species, hay spreading and mowing. \n\nAction 3406 showed that increasing the number of species in a seed mix increased the species richness of target plants when seeds from local sources were used, and increased the species richness of sown plants. Action 3399 demonstrated that planting grassland plants increased overall plant species richness compared to seeding alone, with particular success in increasing forb species richness in 83% of cases and grass species richness in 50% of cases.\n\nSeeding techniques can enhance establishment success. Action 3409 found that sowing seeds in larger prepared gaps within vegetation led to greater cover of sown target plant species than sowing in smaller gaps. Action 129 showed that adding yellow rattle seed to hay meadows helped other sown target meadow species to colonize and resulted in more plant species being found when yellow rattle was present.\n\nAction 3426 found mixed results for transferring plant material from intact grassland alongside seeding, with one study showing increased target plant species richness while two others found no effect. Action 3405 indicated that sowing seeds at higher density increased forb species richness. Action 3418 demonstrated that applying herbicide before sowing seeds increased sown species richness and improved seedling emergence for five of eight wildflower species.",

      "relevant_summary": "Based on the available action documents, several potential negative impacts of different seeding strategies on existing native vegetation in North American grasslands have been identified:\n\n**Competitive Effects on Native Species**: Sowing grass seeds can reduce the abundance of native grassland species (action 3397). One study found that sowing grass seeds reduced the abundance of grassland species, while another found that it either reduced native grass cover or did not alter native grass density (action 3397). Additionally, sowing grass seeds reduced the abundance of native forb species and shrub species in some cases (action 3397).\n\n**Temporary vs. Long-term Outcomes**: Some seeding strategies show initial positive effects that diminish over time. Three studies found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased plant species richness during the first year, but after 3-13 years, species richness did not differ between sown and unsown areas or was lower in sown areas (action 3432). Similarly, one study found that after two years grass cover was higher in areas where grass seeds were sown, but after seven years there was no longer a difference (action 3397).\n\n**Fertilizer Application Concerns**: Adding fertilizer after planting native prairie plants reduced the diameter of prairie lupine plants and did not alter the growth of six other plant species (action 3427). This suggests potential negative growth effects on certain native species when fertilizer is combined with seeding strategies.\n\n**Carbon Addition Effects**: Adding carbon to soil after sowing seeds either reduced or did not alter the density of sown forb species (action 3433), indicating potential suppressive effects on establishing vegetation.\n\n**Community Composition Changes**: Plant communities in sown areas were found to be different from those of ancient grasslands or sites where natural regeneration was allowed (action 3397), suggesting that seeding can alter natural community development patterns compared to allowing natural succession.",

For seeding techniques, sowing seeds in large gaps within vegetation led to greater cover of sown target plant species compared to sowing in smaller gaps, as found in one study from Hungary (Action 3409). Post-planting ground cover using mulch increased total plant cover according to one study in the USA (Action 1240). Regarding soil amendments, applying fertilizer after planting increased the size of planted trees in studies from Canada and Portugal (Action 1260), though other studies showed mixed or no effects. Adding below-ground organic matter such as manure to plots planted with tree seedlings had mixed effects on survival and growth over three years, depending on the species and dose, as reported in one Brazilian coastal swamp study (Action 3311). Amending soil with fresh plant material or crop remains showed multiple benefits including improved soil structure, higher soil nitrogen levels, increased carbon levels, and in some cases higher yields, as demonstrated in studies from various countries (Action 910).",

Sowing seeds at a higher density can increase grass and forb cover, with one study finding that higher seeding density increased grass cover and forb cover (Action 3405). Adding mulch before or after seeding has shown mixed results, with one study finding that adding mulch before sowing seeds increased the cover of target plant species and increased the number of seedlings in most cases (Action 3425). Inoculating soil with mycorrhizal fungi before seeding initially increased vegetation cover in one study, though after three years the effect diminished (Action 3429). Adding soil microbes and nutrients when planting grass plugs increased the cover of three of 38 native prairie species in one study (Action 3429). Using erosion blankets after seeding has shown variable results, with one study finding increased plant species richness and another finding increased plant density (Action 3431). Irrigation after seeding increased vegetation cover in six of 10 cases when using non-native seeds (Action 3430). Increasing the number of species in seed mixes showed that higher species diversity increased the cover of sown plant species in one study and increased the species richness of target plants when combined with local seed sources (Action 3406).",

The same study found that sowing seeds of nurse plants did not change plant species richness and richness was lower than in nearby intact steppe (Action 3401). One replicated, controlled study in Slovenia found that sowing a seed mix containing nurse species resulted in a community composition that was less similar to the target community when compared to sowing a seed mix that did not contain nurse species (Action 3402). The Slovenia study also found that sowing a seed mix containing nurse species did not increase species richness compared to sowing a seed mix that did not contain nurse species (Action 3402). A replicated, paired, controlled study in the USA found that sowing seeds of nurse plants alongside that of grassland species did not change grass abundance or forb abundance (Action 3402). However, nurse plants showed some benefits for plant establishment: one replicated, controlled study in Spain found that sowing seeds under nurse plants increased seed germination (Action 3402). For survival outcomes, one of two replicated, controlled studies in Kenya and Spain found that sowing seeds or planting under nurse plants increased survival of planted plants, while the other study found that sowing seeds under nurse plants initially increased seedling survival, but there was no difference in survival after two to three years (Action 3402).",

      "relevant_summary": "Several interventions have been studied to enhance seed germination and emergence during grassland restoration. Soil preparation methods include disturbing soil before seeding/planting, which increased plant emergence in most cases compared to sowing alone according to four of five studies (action 3413). Soil scarification or ploughing to enhance germination increased the cover and diversity of understory plants according to two studies (action 1251). Removing vegetation before seeding/planting increased the germination rate of sown species according to one of two studies, with one study finding that removing vegetation along with removing leaf litter increased the number of seedlings for one of three species (action 3416). Applying herbicide before seeding/planting increased seedling emergence for five of eight wildflower species in one study (action 3418). Site preparation also includes removing leaf litter before seeding/planting, though this had mixed effects on the number of seedlings of sown plant species according to two of three studies (action 3414). Adding topsoil before seeding/planting increased the biomass of sown species in most cases according to one study (action 3420). Seeding techniques include sowing seeds at a higher density, which increased the number of purple needlegrass seedlings according to one study (action 3405). Drill seeding rather than seeding by hand increased the density of two sown grass species compared to sowing by hand in one of three studies (action 3410). Hydroseeding (spraying slurry of seed, mulch and water) increased the abundance of half of the sown plant species compared to drill seeding in one study (action 3412). Timing matters, as sowing seeds at the start of growing season in spring led to similar emergence of forb seedlings compared to sowing in winter according to one study (action 3407). Post-seeding interventions include irrigating before or after seeding/planting, which increased vegetation cover in six of 10 cases when irrigating after sowing non-native seeds (action 3430). However, soaking seeds of non-woody plants before sowing typically had no significant effect on their germination rate according to one greenhouse study (action 3363).",

      "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, several different methods can be used to introduce seeds into a site for grassland vegetation restoration:\n\n1. **Drill seeding**: Seeds can be sown using a seed drill rather than by hand (Action 3410). Studies found that drill seeding increased the density of two sown grass species and the abundance of warm-season grass species compared to hand sowing, though in most cases it led to no change or reduction in abundance of sown plants compared to other methods.\n\n2. **Hand seeding**: Seeds can be sown by hand as an alternative to mechanical methods (Action 3410). One study found higher plant diversity in areas where seeds were sown by hand compared to areas where they were sown using a seed drill (Action 1698).\n\n3. **Hydroseeding**: This involves spraying a slurry of seed, mulch and water (Action 3412). Studies found that hydroseeding increased plant species richness in some cases and increased the abundance of half of the sown plant species compared to drill seeding in one study.\n\n4. **Strip/slot seeding**: This method involves seeding in strips or slots (Action 3411). One study found that strip seeding increased both grass and forb species richness, though a review found that in the majority of cases strip seeding resulted in failed introductions of sown species.\n\n5. **Seed balls**: Seeds can be planted in the form of seed balls (Action 1712), though one study found this resulted in lower seedling numbers than sowing seed.\n\n6. **Direct seeding**: Seeds can be sown directly onto the site (Action 1698). Studies found this method increased shrub cover in most cases and resulted in increased plant cover.\n\n7. **Planting seedlings**: As an alternative or supplement to seeding, grassland plants can be planted as seedlings (Action 3399). One study found that planting seedlings in addition to sowing seeds increased the number of plant species compared to sowing seeds alone.\n\n8. **Transfer of plant material with seeding**: Plant material from intact grassland can be transferred alongside seeding/planting (Action 3426). Studies showed mixed results, with some finding increased species richness and cover of target plants, while others found no effect.",

Sowing seeds of parasitic species, particularly yellow rattle (Rhinanthus minor), can increase plant species richness and diversity in grasslands by reducing grass cover and total plant biomass, allowing other species to establish (Action 3404, 129). Hydroseeding, which involves spraying a slurry of seed, mulch and water, can increase plant species richness and overall plant cover while increasing the abundance of sown plant species compared to drill seeding (Action 3412). Sowing seeds at higher density can increase forb species richness, grass cover, and forb cover (Action 3405). Sowing or planting nurse plants alongside grassland species can increase seed germination and survival of planted plants, though this may result in community composition that is less similar to target communities (Action 3402). Sowing seeds of nurse plants alone can modify community composition but may reduce similarity to target steppe communities (Action 3401).",

The same technique also increased the density of young trees in France (Action 1274).\n\n**Soil Disturbance Before Seeding:** Multiple studies showed that disturbing soil before seeding increased plant emergence in most cases compared to sowing alone, based on replicated controlled studies in the USA, Germany, China and Spain (Action 3413). Soil disturbance also increased plant and seedling species richness in studies from the UK and Germany (Action 3413). Specifically, rotovating soil before sowing seeds increased both grass and forb species richness in most cases compared to harrowing before sowing in the UK (Action 3413). One study found that disturbing soil before sowing forb seeds increased the cover of forb species in the USA (Action 3413).\n\n**Soil Scarification/Ploughing:** Studies in Portugal and the USA found that ploughing increased the cover and diversity of understory plants (Action 1251). However, effects on tree establishment were mixed, with studies in Canada and Brazil showing that ploughing increased tree density in two of three studies but decreased it in one (Action 1251).\n\n**Topsoil/Turf Removal:** Studies in France, UK and USA demonstrated several positive outcomes. Removing topsoil before sowing seeds increased plant species richness (Action 3415), increased plant community similarity to intact steppe (Action 3415), and increased the species richness of sown plants (Action 3415). Removing turf before sowing seeds increased both grass and forb species richness compared to soil disturbance alone (Action 3415). Studies also found that removing topsoil before planting increased the survival of seedlings and plants in the USA (Action 3415).\n\n**Vegetation Removal Alone:** Studies in the UK and Belgium found that removing vegetation before sowing seeds increased the germination rate of sown species, and when combined with leaf litter removal, increased the number of seedlings for some species (Action 3416).",

In the short term (first year), sowing native grass and forb seeds increased plant species richness during the first year, but after 3-13 years, species richness did not differ between sown and unsown areas or was lower in sown areas (Action 3432). However, one study found that after one year, sowing did not alter plant species richness but after eight years, species richness was higher than in unsown areas (Action 3432). Over time, plant communities became more similar to those of intact grasslands (Action 3432). For forb species specifically, one study found that one year after sowing, the cover of forb species increased, but after 10 years it did not differ between sown and unsown areas (Action 3432). For overall vegetation abundance, one study found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased plant species richness during the first 2-7 years, but after eight years, species richness did not differ between sown and unsown areas (Action 3432). In terms of restoration timelines, six studies saw positive signs of restoration in less than five years, 11 studies within 10 years and two studies found restoration took more than 10 years, while six studies found limited or slow changes in plant communities following restoration (Action 133). Two studies found differences in vegetation between restored and existing species-rich grasslands nine or 60 years after restoration (Action 133). For grasslands restored from arable land, butterfly communities developed to become increasingly similar to existing high-quality grasslands over the first 10 years after establishment (Action 3929), and species richness was higher on grasslands created less than 10 years ago than on grasslands created more than 20 years ago (Action 3929).",

Removing vegetation before seeding/planting increased germination rate of sown species and increased the number of seedlings for one of three species (action 3416).\n\nHerbicide application: Applying herbicide before seeding/planting increased sown species richness and the cover of sown grass species (action 3418). One study found spraying with herbicide before sowing seeds increased seedling emergence for five of eight wildflower species.\n\nLeaf litter and debris management: Removing leaf litter before seeding/planting had mixed effects on the number of seedlings of sown plant species in two of three studies (action 3414). Mowing before or after seeding/planting increased sown species richness and abundance of sown forb species, and increased germination of four grassland plant species in one of three studies (action 3419).\n\nSoil amendments: Adding topsoil before seeding/planting increased plant species richness and biomass of sown species in most cases (action 3420). Adding sulphur to soil before seeding/planting increased the cover of three of six sown species when low amounts were used (action 3428).\n\nProtective measures: Adding mulch before or after seeding/planting increased the number of seedlings in most cases and increased the cover of target plant species (action 3425). Sowing or planting nurse plants alongside grassland species increased seed germination and survival of planted plants in one of two studies (action 3402).

A replicated, controlled study in Germany found that sowing grassland seeds from a local source, along with increasing the number of species in a seed mix, led to an increase in the species richness of target plants and increased cover of target plant species (Action 3400). One replicated study in the USA found that after sowing grassland seeds from a local source, vegetation cover increased over time compared to areas sown with non-native seeds (Action 3400).\n\nDrawbacks of local source seeds: The same USA study found that while vegetation cover increased with local seeds, the density of individual plants declined compared to non-native seeds (Action 3400). A replicated, randomized, controlled experiment in the USA found that sowing Sandberg bluegrass seeds from a local source did not change the survival of sown plants compared to sowing non-local varieties (Action 3400).\n\nNeutral outcomes: One replicated, controlled study in Germany found that vegetation cover did not differ between areas sown with local source seeds and those sown with commercial grass seed (Action 3400). Two replicated studies in the USA and Italy found that sowing grassland seeds from a local source did not alter vegetation height compared to sowing non-native grass seeds or a commercial seed mix (Action 3400).\n\nContext from native species studies: Studies examining native grass and forb seeding found that sixteen of 28 controlled studies in Europe, North America and New Zealand found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased overall plant species richness, though seven studies found no change and three found initial increases followed by later declines (Action 3432).

      "relevant_summary": "Several alternative and additional actions can be taken to increase plant species richness in grassland restoration beyond simply sowing a standard seed mix. Increasing the number of species in seed mixes has been shown to increase the species richness of sown plants and target plant species (Action 3406). Transfer of plant material from intact grassland alongside seeding/planting, such as hay transfer, has been shown in some studies to increase the species richness and cover of target plants (Action 3426). Inoculating soil with mycorrhizal fungi before seeding/planting can increase the abundance of target species that are considered a local conservation priority (Action 3429). Adding yellow rattle seed (Rhinanthus minor) to hay meadows helps other sown target meadow species to colonize and results in more plant species being found when yellow rattle is present (Action 129). Effective restoration techniques identified include grazing, introducing plant species, hay spreading and mowing, with various studies showing that these techniques can be effective for restoring species-rich grassland when used alone or in combinations (Action 133). Restoration success can vary by timeframe, with six studies showing positive signs of restoration in less than five years, eleven studies within 10 years, and two studies finding restoration took more than 10 years (Action 133). Changing mowing regimes on grassland has been shown to affect different species groups, with haying management resulting in higher abundance of prairie specialist butterflies compared to burning management (Action 3945).",
