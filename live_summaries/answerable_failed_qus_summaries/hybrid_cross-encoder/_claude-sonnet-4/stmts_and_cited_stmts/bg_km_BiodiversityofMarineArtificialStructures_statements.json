Creating hole habitats (>50 mm) showed mixed effects on invertebrate abundances, with one study finding increased abundance of brown crabs but not other mobile invertebrates, while another reported mixed effects depending on species group (action 3434). Creating short flexible habitats (1-50 mm) had mixed effects on mobile and non-mobile invertebrate abundance, varying by survey week, species group, flexible habitat length, or site (action 3450). Creating textured surfaces (≤1 mm) produced mixed effects on non-mobile invertebrate abundance depending on the site (action 3449). Creating long flexible habitats (>50 mm) resulted in mixed effects on mobile and non-mobile invertebrate abundance depending on species group and survey week, or flexible habitat length and density, with one study finding decreased mussel abundance on structure surfaces but that the flexible habitats themselves supported higher biomass, mostly mussels (action 3451). Transplanting or seeding organisms showed positive results, with one study finding transplanting sea urchins reduced non-native sea mat cover on kelps, and another reporting that transplanting corals increased coral cover on structure surfaces (action 3471). Creating groove habitats (1-50 mm) had mixed effects on invertebrate abundances depending on species group (action 3448). Creating pit habitats (1-50 mm) also had mixed effects on invertebrate abundances depending on species group (action 3455). Different artificial reef structures and materials showed varying results, with some studies finding no differences in invertebrate abundances between different reef structures and materials, while others found specific materials like oyster shell bags recruited more oysters and ribbed mussels compared to \"ReefBall\" breakwaters (action 2259). Ceasing or altering maintenance activities showed limited effects on overall abundance but one study found reducing the cleaning area increased seahorse abundance on structure surfaces (action 3447). Creating combinations of grooves and small protrusions, ridges or ledges (1-50 mm) had mixed effects on combined macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate abundance depending on surface orientation (action 3452).",

Combined macroalgae, invertebrate and fish species richness in created pools was similar to natural rock pools in some cases (Action 3476). One before-and-after study reported that creating pools, along with reducing the slope of a structure, increased the combined macroalgae, invertebrate and fish species richness on the structure (Action 3476). Rock pools created on intertidal artificial structures were used by sea slugs, urchins, octopuses, macroalgae, invertebrates and fishes (Action 3476).

However, behavioral effects included increased feeding activity for juvenile salmon and increased time benthic fishes spent interacting with structure surfaces (Action 3474). Large ridges or ledges (>50 mm) showed different patterns, with studies finding increased abundance of mussels or limpets but not barnacles, and increased rockweed abundance (Action 3465).\n\nGroove habitats specifically were found to be colonized by microalgal species and were used by mussels and periwinkles (Actions 3474, 3473).

Action 3455 found that pit habitats (1-50 mm) created with holes, grooves and environmentally-sensitive material increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species diversity on structure surfaces in Israel. Action 3456 demonstrated that large adjoining cavities or swimthrough habitats (>100 mm) increased overall fish species richness on and around structure surfaces in the USA. Action 3470 showed that using ECOncrete material along with creating texture, grooves, holes, pits and/or small ledges increased species diversity and/or richness on and around structures in three studies across multiple locations. Action 3471 found that transplanting oysters onto subtidal artificial structures increased combined invertebrate and fish species richness and diversity on and around structure surfaces in the USA. The evidence indicates that combinations of multiple habitat features rather than single features, and the use of specialized materials like ECOncrete, appear most consistently effective at enhancing species richness.",

For grooves and small protrusions, ridges or ledges (1-50 mm), three studies from marinas in northern Israel and the UK and an open coastline in southeast Spain showed that these features can alter community composition and support non-mobile invertebrate species absent from unmodified surfaces (Action 3452). One study found that groove habitats and small ledges increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness and diversity, while another found mixed effects depending on surface orientation (Action 3452). \n\nFor groove habitats alone (1-50 mm), two studies from Japan and northern Israel found they can alter community composition and increase species diversity when combined with other features like holes and pits (Action 3448). These grooves supported macroalgae, non-mobile invertebrate and fish species absent from structures without habitat features (Action 3448).\n\nFor hole habitats (>50 mm), three studies from Israel and Sweden found they altered community composition and supported species absent from unmodified structures (Action 3434). Two of three studies found holes increased species richness and/or diversity when combined with other structural features (Action 3434). One study found holes increased brown crab abundance but had mixed effects on other species groups (Action 3434).\n\nFor pit habitats (1-50 mm), one study from Israel found they altered community composition and increased species diversity when combined with holes, grooves and environmentally-sensitive material (Action 3455). Effects on abundances were mixed depending on species group (Action 3455).\n\nHowever, no studies were found evaluating the effects of creating large ridges or ledges (>50 mm), crevice habitats (>50 mm), or reducing the slope of subtidal artificial structures, meaning there is no evidence for these specific interventions (Actions 3445, 3454, 3442).",

Additionally, rock pools created different combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition compared to surfaces without pools (Action 3476).\n\nPit habitats (1–50 mm) also demonstrate consistent effectiveness, with four of six replicated, controlled studies finding that pit habitats altered the combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition on structure surfaces (Action 3475). Nine studies reported that pit habitats supported macroalgae, invertebrate and/or fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without added habitats (Action 3475).\n\nHole habitats (>50 mm) showed consistent community composition effects, with three studies finding that hole habitats altered the combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition on structure surfaces and supported species that were absent from structure surfaces without added habitat features (Action 3467).\n\nLong flexible habitats (>50 mm) altered the combined macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate community composition on structure surfaces and supported macroalgae, mobile and non-mobile invertebrates that were absent from structure surfaces without flexible habitats (Action 3460).\n\nIn contrast, groove habitats (1–50 mm) showed mixed results, with two of three studies finding that groove habitats did not alter the combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition on structure surfaces (Action 3473).

Creating natural rocky reef topography did not increase combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness on structure surfaces and had mixed effects on barnacle and mobile invertebrate abundances depending on the site (Action 3435). Creating pit habitats showed variable effectiveness, with studies finding that pit creation did not alter community composition in some cases, did not increase species richness in some studies, and decreased combined macroalgae and invertebrate abundance in one study (Action 3475). The effects of pit habitats were frequently site-dependent and varied based on pit size and arrangement. Creating textured surfaces had mixed effects on species richness depending on the type of texture created and the site, and some studies found no increase in macroalgal or invertebrate abundance on structure surfaces (Action 3466). Reducing slope showed limited benefits, with one study finding no increase in macroalgal abundance or oyster and mobile invertebrate abundance on structure surfaces (Action 3461). Creating hole habitats showed some limitations, with studies reporting no increase in macroalgal abundance and mixed effects on limpet abundance depending on shore level and site (Action 3467). The effectiveness of topographical complexity modifications appears to be highly context-dependent, with results varying significantly based on site conditions, specific design parameters, and target species.",

Creating textured surfaces (≤1 mm) on artificial structures can alter community composition on structure surfaces, with studies showing changes in macroalgae and invertebrate communities and support for species absent from non-textured surfaces (Action ID 3449, 3466). Small protrusions (1-50 mm) can be added to artificial structures, which have shown mixed effects on macroalgal abundance depending on species (Action ID 3453). Creating grooves and small protrusions, ridges or ledges (1-50 mm) together on artificial structures can alter community composition and increase species richness and diversity, supporting species absent from structures without these features (Action ID 3452). Short flexible habitats (1-50 mm) can be installed on structures to alter community composition (Action ID 3459). The slope of artificial structures can be reduced to increase species richness when combined with other modifications like creating rock pools (Action ID 3461). Groove habitats (1-50 mm) can be created on structures to alter community composition and increase species diversity, supporting species groups not found on unmodified structures (Action ID 3448). Pit habitats (1-50 mm) can be created on artificial structures to alter community composition and increase species diversity (Action ID 3455). Natural rocky reef topography can be created on structures, though effects on biodiversity vary (Action ID 3446). Organisms can be transplanted or seeded onto artificial structures to alter community composition and increase species richness and diversity (Action ID 3471). Green infrastructure including green roofs can be established in urban areas, though they may have lower species richness compared to urban parks (Action ID 3837). Textured coatings can be applied to specific structures like turbines, though effects on wildlife activity may be limited (Action ID 1957).",
