Fallowing periods demonstrate effectiveness - a trial in Tasmania found sediment community structure under Atlantic salmon cages became more similar to non-impacted sites over two fallowing cycles (Action 1027). Three studies on leaving fallow periods during fish farming found that after fallowing, invertebrate community composition became similar to that before fish were added, and abundances of pollution-indicator polychaete worms decreased, though communities remained different from sites without fish farms (Action 2191). Integrated aquaculture systems show promise for waste management - a study in Canada found that blue mussels absorbed waste from a salmon farm, while studies in the USA and Scotland reported enhanced growth of scallops and algal growth when placed adjacent to fish farms (Action 932). Natural control methods for reducing chemical treatments include using cleaner wrasse for sea lice control - one controlled study in Ireland found corkwing and goldskinny cleaner wrasse were as effective at controlling lice infestation as chemical treatments (Action 738). Lighting modifications also show potential - a study in Norway reported lower numbers of lice on salmon kept in low intensity artificial light or natural lighting (Action 741). Non-chemical treatments like freshwater bathing provide mixed results for disease control - studies in Australia showed mixed evidence for reducing amoebic gill disease (Action 739). However, no studies were found evaluating the effects of improving fish food to reduce waste production, locating aquaculture systems in vegetated areas, or cleaning waste water before environmental release (Actions 2192, 2189, 3142).",

Fallowing systems can reduce parasites and disease, with a study in Scotland recording lower lice numbers on Atlantic salmon in cages using fallowing (Action ID: 1026). Fallowing also helps reduce pollution, as a trial in Tasmania found sediment community structure under Atlantic salmon cages became more similar to non-impacted sites over two fallowing cycles (Action ID: 1027). Vaccination programs show effectiveness, with controlled studies from Iceland and Norway finding higher survival rates in vaccinated salmon compared to unvaccinated control groups when exposed to disease-causing bacteria (Action ID: 733). Infrastructure maintenance is important, as replacing anti-predator nets more frequently at salmon farms resulted in fewer salmon losses to harbor seal predation (Action ID: 2774). Selective breeding for disease resistance traits can improve health outcomes, with a study in Norway finding increased survival levels in salmon exposed to infectious pancreatic necrosis when the family was bred for high resistance compared to low resistance (Action ID: 735). The use of probiotics and immunostimulants also shows promise, with a study in Scotland finding increased survival in salmon fed probiotics before exposure to disease-causing bacteria, and a Norwegian study showing reduced lice infections when salmon were fed diets with beta-glucans (Action ID: 732).",

However, no studies were found that evaluated the effects of these interventions on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.
