Multiple intervention techniques have demonstrated positive results, including moss layer transfer technique, which showed that restored areas developed communities of bog-characteristic plant species within 11 years and had greater moss/bryophyte cover (including Sphagnum) compared to unrestored areas after 4-8 years. Multiple intervention approaches (excluding moss layer transfer) were found to increase total moss/bryophyte cover, Sphagnum moss cover, herbaceous plant cover, and overall vegetation cover across multiple studies in bogs and other peatlands. Surface covering with straw mulch showed mixed results, increasing the number of fen-characteristic plants present but not affecting their cover. Seed introduction of peatland trees/shrubs demonstrated variable outcomes, with some studies showing greater shrub cover and total vegetation cover in sown plots compared to unsown plots, while other studies found no difference in shrub cover or species richness. However, survival rates were variable, with some studies reporting seedling death within short timeframes.",

Other moss species showed cover ranging from negligible to 76%, though cover remained low (<1%) unless plots were mulched, shaded, or limed. When mixed vegetation was spread on peatland surfaces (1822), 17 studies found Sphagnum moss present after 1-6 growing seasons with cover ranging from <1 to 73%, with Sphagnum cover higher in sown than unsown plots in controlled studies. Other mosses showed <1 to 65% cover, and vascular plants appeared in 10 studies, with two controlled studies showing mixed results on vascular plant cover. Direct planting of peatland trees/shrubs (1820) found that eight studies reported majority survival of planted trees/shrubs over periods between 10 weeks and 13 years, though some species showed <50% survival. Four studies reported planted trees grew successfully. Introduction of tree/shrub fragments to freshwater wetlands (3262) showed only 12% overall survival of planted unrooted cuttings over two years in one study, with no seedlings surviving for two of four species.

      "relevant_summary": "The evidence base for peatland vegetation restoration after mining or peat extraction shows several promising interventions with varying levels of support. The most direct evidence for post-mining restoration comes from studies of vegetation block replacement, with two studies showing that transplanted peatland vegetation blocks can retain their characteristic plant communities. In one UK bog study, transplanted blocks maintained their community composition over time, while a Canadian fen study found replaced vegetation blocks remained similar to undisturbed fen communities, though Sphagnum moss cover did decline in transplanted blocks.\n\nMultiple intervention approaches have shown positive results in nine studies, including increased moss cover (particularly Sphagnum), enhanced herbaceous plant coverage, and improved overall vegetation cover across bogs, fens, and mixed peatlands. The moss layer transfer technique, tested in four Canadian bog studies, demonstrated successful restoration outcomes with development of bog-characteristic plant communities within 11 years, greater moss and herb cover compared to unrestored areas, and increased plant species richness.\n\nRewetting interventions, while not specific to post-mining sites, provide relevant evidence from 36 studies showing that raising water tables typically increases Sphagnum moss cover, enhances herbaceous vegetation including sedges and cottongrass, and often reduces tree/shrub encroachment. However, rewetting effects on plant community composition varied, with some studies showing development of wetland-characteristic communities while others found no significant changes.\n\nReprofiling/relandscaping without planting showed limited success in one study, with restored bogs developing different plant communities and lower vegetation cover than natural fens after five years. This suggests that physical habitat restoration alone may be insufficient for vegetation recovery without additional interventions.",

Rewetting peatlands by raising the water table through drainage management (action 1756) was evaluated in 36 studies and typically increased cover of wetland-characteristic plants, sedges, cottongrasses, and Sphagnum mosses while reducing tree and shrub cover. Surface disturbance techniques (action 1811) showed that soil disturbance affected plant community development over 2-3 years, with wetland-characteristic species colonizing disturbed plots. Reprofiling or relandscaping the peat surface (action 1807) was shown to change plant community composition, though vegetation cover remained lower than natural reference sites after five years. Other interventions include stabilizing the peat surface using materials like coconut fiber rolls (action 1815), though this specific technique showed no effect on vegetation cover development. Combining tree removal with rewetting (action 1732) increased Sphagnum moss cover and herb cover while reducing tree density. Roughening the peat surface to create microclimates (action 1808) represents a potential technique for which no evaluation studies were found, but creating topographic variation through reprofiling remains a viable approach to encourage natural colonization through environmental heterogeneity.",

Two studies reported that the area of protected peatland increased following pressure from campaign groups. Additionally, major retailers stopped buying compost containing peat from important peatland areas, and horticultural companies began marketing peat-free compost following campaign pressure. Garden centres and local governments also signed peatland conservation agreements.\n\nGeneral public awareness campaigns (Action ID 1844) demonstrated behavioural change in one UK study. Following awareness-raising activities, the percentage of the public buying peat-free compost increased.\n\nLegal protection of peatlands (Action ID 1796) showed mixed results across five studies. While two Indonesian studies reported that peat swamp forest was still lost from within national park boundaries, one study found forest loss was greater outside the protected areas. A Chinese study reported that peatland area initially decreased but then increased following legal protection. A Chilean study found that protected areas had greater vegetation cover than adjacent grazed and harvested areas, though plant richness and diversity were lower.\n\nMitigation requirements for wetland impacts (Action ID 3386) showed concerning results across nine US studies. Four studies reported that requiring mitigation did not prevent loss of wetland area, with restored/created areas being less than destroyed areas. Compliance issues were prevalent, with five studies reporting that the total area of wetlands conserved was less than required in permits, and three studies finding that most mitigation projects failed to meet permit targets.\n\nNo studies were found evaluating the effectiveness of voluntary agreements to protect peatlands, zero burning policies near peatlands, or legislation for 'no net loss' of wetlands, indicating research gaps in these policy approaches.",

      "relevant_summary": "Different methods of introducing vegetation to peatlands show varying levels of success. When introducing seeds, studies show mixed results: some planted herb seeds successfully germinated, with wetland-characteristic plants colonizing sown plots, while other studies found no increase in plant species richness or herb cover compared to unsown plots. For shrub/tree seeds, germination occurred but survival was often poor, with all germinated willow seedlings dying within one month in one study.\n\nUsing whole plants or fragments appears more successful than seeds. Adding moss fragments (especially Sphagnum) to peatland surfaces resulted in moss cover ranging from negligible to over 90% in multiple studies, with sown plots typically having higher cover than unsown plots. Adding mixed vegetation containing Sphagnum also proved effective, with Sphagnum cover ranging from less than 1% to 73% in sown plots. The moss layer transfer technique, which spreads whole moss layers, was particularly successful with restored areas developing bog-characteristic plant communities within 11 years and achieving greater vegetation cover than unrestored areas.\n\nHowever, success rates vary significantly depending on environmental conditions and additional interventions, with some studies reporting very low survival or cover unless plots were mulched, shaded, or received other treatments.",

Additionally, rerouting input water on a longer path to slow down flow and allow more time for pollutant removal showed positive effects with increased moss cover characteristic of low nutrient levels and decreased vascular plant biomass in a Netherlands floating fen (Action ID 1780).

Two studies in fens demonstrate that cutting large trees/shrubs can shift plant community composition to more closely resemble target open fen communities and increase the abundance of characteristic fen plants. A controlled study in a forested fen found tree removal increased herb cover and biomass while maintaining similar shrub cover levels, indicating selective removal benefits herbaceous species without promoting further shrub encroachment.\n\nAdditionally, studies show that combining tree removal with peatland rewetting (raising the water table) provides enhanced restoration outcomes. When implemented together, tree removal and rewetting increased wetland-characteristic plant abundance and improved Sphagnum moss cover in bogs and fens. Multiple studies reported that rewetting alone typically reduces tree and shrub cover over time while promoting herbaceous species including sedges, cottongrasses, and reeds.\n\nFor areas where trees have naturally colonized, cutting/removing forest plantations followed by rewetting has been shown to increase herb cover and reduce forest-characteristic mosses, with some studies reporting restoration of Sphagnum cover to natural levels. The evidence suggests a combined approach of mechanical vegetation removal and hydrological restoration is most effective for returning overgrown peatlands to open conditions.",

The study reported that the effects of boar and deer exclusion on vascular plant cover, moss cover, total vegetation biomass, and plant species richness all depended on other treatments applied to the plots. This suggests that physical barriers can influence peatland vegetation characteristics, but their specific benefits may be context-dependent and interact with other management practices.

      "relevant_summary": "As alternatives to prescribed burning for managing vegetation on fens, both mowing and grazing show distinct effects on vegetation compared to prescribed fire. \n\n**Mowing effects:** Multiple studies demonstrate that mowing can alter plant community composition, increase cover of fen-characteristic plants, increase moss/bryophyte cover, and reduce cover of problematic herbaceous species including purple moor grass and reeds. Mowing typically increases plant species richness and can reduce shrub/tree cover. The effects on vegetation structure show mixed results, with some studies finding reduced vegetation height and biomass. Seasonal timing matters, with summer mowing showing greater increases in plant species richness compared to spring or autumn mowing.\n\n**Grazing effects:** Grazing can increase cover of some herb groups like sedges and cottongrasses while reducing purple moor grass cover. However, grazing effects on plant community composition are more variable, with some studies finding different communities compared to mown areas, and others finding reduced fen-characteristic plant species compared to mowing. Grazing can reduce Sphagnum moss cover and has mixed effects on shrub cover and plant species richness.\n\n**Comparison with prescribed burning:** While prescribed burning typically reduces tree/shrub cover and can increase plant species richness (though results are mixed), mowing appears to offer more consistent benefits for fen-characteristic vegetation and moss cover. Both mowing and grazing avoid the potential negative effects of fire on Sphagnum moss cover that has been observed with prescribed burning. Mowing provides more predictable outcomes for maintaining fen-characteristic plant communities compared to grazing, which shows more variable responses.",
