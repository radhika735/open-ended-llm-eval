Biological control using co-evolved, host-specific herbivores shows promise, with studies demonstrating that flea beetles caused heavy feeding destruction to water primrose seedlings and significantly reduced plant abundance when introduced to ponds. Physical removal through hand-pulling was found to eradicate smaller populations when done from pond margins, though hand pulling combined with raking failed to reduce abundance in larger populations. Other non-chemical methods including flame treatment, use of bottom mats, environmental control (shading, altered flow, dredging), and bank excavation have been proposed, but no evidence was found documenting their effectiveness. Similarly, biological control using fungal-based herbicides lacks supporting evidence for its use.",

Evidence indicates that trapping with food bait (tinned meat) is more effective than using pheromones or unbaited traps, with over half of all crayfish caught in food-baited traps (Action 1029). Creating physical barriers using concrete dams specifically designed with features to prevent crayfish from crawling over them has been shown to effectively contain population spread upstream in Spain (Action 1037). Combining trapping with predator encouragement has demonstrated significant population reductions - a Swiss study found that introducing predators combined with trapping significantly reduced crayfish populations, and an Italian study showed this combination was more effective than predation alone (Action 1031). Natural predation by eels has been shown to reduce crayfish populations in Italian studies, and pike also predate on red swamp crayfish according to French research (Action 1030). Sterilization of males through X-ray exposure reduced offspring production by 43% in laboratory studies (Action 1032). However, no evidence was found for the effectiveness of draining waterways (Action 1034), electrofishing (Action 1035), or removal of food sources (Action 1033).",

For crayfish, specifically red swamp crayfish, there is evidence from a before-and-after study in Spain (2007-2010) that concrete dams designed with features to prevent crayfish from crawling over them were effective at containing population spread upstream (Action ID: 1037). For aquatic invasive fish like Ponto-Caspian gobies, a controlled, replicated field study in the USA found that electrical barriers prevented movement across them, with increased effectiveness at higher electrical pulse durations and voltages (Action ID: 1074). However, for aquatic plants like parrot's feather, no evidence was found regarding the use of lightproof barriers (Action ID: 1576), and for problematic plants in peatlands, no studies were found evaluating the effectiveness of covers or barriers (Action ID: 1775). For Ponto-Caspian gammarids, research focused more on behavioral deterrents using predator cues rather than physical barriers (Action ID: 1088).",

Adult bullfrog removal techniques include using single traps floating on the water surface overnight in small ponds in the USA (action 1045), though catchability using double fyke nets was found to be very low. Shooting metamorphosed individuals before reproduction was also used as part of combination treatments in France, resulting in significant reduction in recorded adults and juveniles (action 1045). However, one study found that bullfrog populations rapidly rebounded following intensive removal of adults (action 1045).\n\nFor red-eared terrapins, Aranzadi turtle traps were found effective for trapping adults from rivers in Spain, though they did not eradicate the population (action 1055). Sein nets were used to trap adults and juveniles in the British Virgin Islands but were not successful in eradicating the population (action 1055). Draining invaded waterbodies was considered as a removal technique for red-eared terrapins but no evidence was found on its impact on population reduction (action 1057).\n\nBoth species showed rapid population recovery following removal efforts, indicating that sustained and repeated removal efforts are necessary for effective control.",

Physical removal alone was found to be insufficient, as a two-week removal program in Western Australia showed that growth rate exceeded removal rate (action 1126). However, mechanical removal combined with monthly hand picking in the UK greatly reduced coverage but did not achieve complete eradication (action 1126). For chemical control, the herbicide 2,4-D amine applied at 4.2 kg/ha demonstrated the highest effectiveness, achieving near 100% mortality, while glyphosate applied at 2.2 kg/ha without adjuvant resulted in negligible mortality (action 1127). A combination approach proved successful, with cutting followed by glyphosate treatment in Western Australia successfully removing floating pennywort (action 1128). Hydrogen peroxide treatment showed limited results, with 30% concentration causing leaf curling and transparency but insufficient to kill the plants (action 1129). No evidence was found for biological control using fungal-based herbicides (action 1125).",
