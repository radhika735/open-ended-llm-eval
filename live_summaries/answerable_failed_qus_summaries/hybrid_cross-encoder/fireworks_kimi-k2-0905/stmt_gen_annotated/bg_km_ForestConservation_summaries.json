    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence, both fencing and tree guards show effectiveness for protecting newly planted trees from herbivores, though the evidence is limited. For fencing, one controlled study found that deer exclusion fencing increased shrub height, and five studies in freshwater wetlands showed mixed results: fencing sometimes increased survival of planted tree seedlings depending on factors like planting season and site conditions, and increased tree seedling height in some cases but not others. One study found planted swamp gum seedlings had much higher survival rates over one year in mammal-excluded plots compared to open plots. For tree guards, one replicated, randomized, controlled study found that light-colored plastic tree shelters increased survival rates of planted tree seedlings, while one replicated, controlled study found tree guards increased tree height after 37 months but not after 44 months. One study in a nutria-invaded wetland found that plastic guards significantly increased both height and diameter growth rates of planted baldcypress seedlings over one growing season. No direct comparative studies between fencing and tree guards were found in the available evidence.",

Several studies found no significant effects on planted seedling emergence, survival, growth rate, or frost damage (Action 1256), though one study noted increased seedling biomass when competing herbs were removed, and another found that removing sheep laurel shrubs increased growth rate and height of planted black spruce seedlings. In freshwater wetlands, clearing vegetation before planting typically had no clear effect on seedling height, diameter, or survival, though it sometimes increased survival rates when specific competitive species like reed canarygrass were removed (Action 3334). However, vegetation removal can negatively impact overall forest biodiversity - applying herbicides after restoration planting was found to decrease plant species richness and diversity (Action 1241). Vegetation removal combined with mechanical soil disturbance increased cover and diversity of understory plants while decreasing understory shrub cover, and also increased density of young trees (Action 1274). Studies on mammal responses showed mixed results, with one finding increased use by American martens where competing vegetation was removed in clearcut areas, while other studies found mixed or no effects on moose and snowshoe hares (Action 2644).",

Several studies evaluating access restriction measures exist, but primarily for non-forest ecosystems. For forest-specific interventions, there is no evidence found for the effects of creating managed paths/signs to contain disturbance (Action ID: 1170) or providing paths to limit extent of disturbance to mammals (Action ID: 2337), meaning no studies have directly tested these interventions. Evidence from other ecosystems shows mixed results: six studies on using signs and access restrictions to reduce disturbance at nest sites (Action ID: 309) found increased numbers of breeders, higher reproductive success or lower levels of disturbance in waders and terns, while one small study found no effect on eagle reproductive success. Similarly, 11 studies on installing cave gates to restrict public access (Action ID: 999) showed mixed results for bat populations, with some finding more bats after gate installation and others finding negative behavioral effects.

Shelterwood harvesting results in higher plant diversity, lower grass cover, and higher density of tree species compared to clearcutting (1214). Group-selection harvesting increases cover and diversity of understory plants and density of young trees (1224). Thinning trees by girdling increases understory plant species richness, diversity and cover (1226). Variable retention management supports higher densities of bird species compared to control stands (332). Patch retention harvesting contains more birds of more species than clearcut areas while maintaining similar numbers to unharvested areas (330). Thinning trees within forests increases the density, cover, species richness and diversity of understory plants (1211). Selective or reduced impact logging maintains species richness and diversity while supporting higher butterfly abundance (3867). Harvesting groups of trees or using thinning instead of clearcutting results in higher species richness of macro-moths (3868).",

For young trees, 6 of 12 studies found thinning increased young tree density, though effects varied with one study showing decreased density and five showing no or mixed effects (action 1210). Understory plants showed consistent positive responses, with 17 of 25 studies finding increased density and cover, and 13 of 19 studies showing increased species richness and diversity, though some studies found no effects or mixed results (action 1211). Thinning by girdling specifically increased understory plant species richness, diversity and cover (action 1226). The combination of thinning followed by prescribed fire increased understory plant cover and abundance as well as deciduous tree density in 3 of 6 studies (action 1227). Beyond vegetation, thinning affected wildlife populations differently - amphibians showed mixed responses with population declines in some studies (action 852), while reptiles generally maintained similar abundance and species richness compared to unthinned areas (action 3627). Mammal responses varied by species, with some small mammals increasing in abundance while larger mammals like deer showed no consistent preference for thinned areas (action 2650).",

Studies from Sweden and the USA found that shelterwood harvesting resulted in higher plant diversity, lower grass cover, and higher density of tree species compared to clearcutting. Research across multiple countries including Australia, Iran, Nepal, and the USA found that shelterwood harvesting increased abundance, species richness and diversity of understory plants, as well as the growth and survival rate of young trees in six of seven studies, though one study found negative effects. For wildlife impacts, studies in the USA found that shelterwood harvesting and group harvesting resulted in smaller reductions in salamander populations compared to clearcutting, with shelterwood showing higher or initially higher salamander abundance. However, both shelterwood harvesting and group harvesting still decreased salamander abundance compared to unharvested forests in most cases. Research on butterflies and moths found that shelterwood harvesting maintained higher species richness and faster recovery of moth populations compared to clearcutting. Regarding forest structure, Canadian studies found that partial retention harvesting decreased the density of young trees compared to clearcutting. Studies on mammals showed that selective harvesting did not consistently increase small mammal abundance compared to clearcutting, though it sometimes maintained red-backed vole populations better.",

Forty-four studies involved planting mangroves or other coastal swamp trees: 20 in\\u00a0Asia, seven in Central America, six in Africa, four in North America, four in South America, two in Oceania\\u00a0and one globally. Three studies involved planting shrubs in the USA\\u00a0or Spain. There was overlap in the sites used in two studies. One systematic review\\u00a0included several of the other summarized studies.\\n\\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\\n\\nOverall extent (3 studies): Two before-and-after studies in India\\u00a0and South Africa\\u00a0reported that the area of mangrove forest was greater 6\\u201342 years after planting mangrove trees (sometimes\\u00a0along with other interventions) than in the years before. One study in Sri Lanka\\u00a0simply quantified the area of mangrove vegetation present 8\\u201310 years after planting seedlings (and propagules).\\nTree/shrub richness/diversity (6 studies): Three site comparison studies in the USA, Mexico\\u00a0and Brazil\\u00a0reported that where mangrove forests developed after planting trees (sometimes\\u00a0along with other interventions), they contained a similar number of tree species to mature\\u00a0and/or naturally regenerating\\u00a0forests after 10\\u201330 years. One site comparison study in Vietnam\\u00a0reported that after 14\\u201334 years, a planted mangrove forest contained more tree species than a (slightly older) naturally regenerated forest. One replicated, paired, before-and-after, site comparison study in Kenya\\u00a0reported that planted mangrove forest contained fewer adult tree species than mature natural forest after five years, but more species of seedling. One study in a former shrimp pond in Thailand\\u00a0simply reported the number of unplanted tree species that had colonized six years after planting (along with other interventions).\\n\\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\\n\\nTree/shrub abundance (9 studies): Three replicated, site comparison studies of coastal sites in the Philippines, the USA\\u00a0and Brazil\\u00a0reported that where mangrove forests developed after planting trees (sometimes\\u00a0along with other interventions), woody vegetation was typically more dense than in mature natural forests\\u00a0and/or naturally regenerating forests. Two site comparison studies in Kenya\\u00a0and Vietnam\\u00a0found that tree abundance (density\\u00a0and biomass) was similar in planted and natural mangroves after 5\\u201334 years. One site comparison study in Mexico\\u00a0reported that a planted mangrove forest contained fewer trees than pristine natural forests after 12 years. Two site comparison studies in the Philippines\\u00a0reported mixed results according to time since planting\\u00a0and site. One study in Thailand\\u00a0simply quantified the abundance of mangrove trees six years after planting (along with other interventions).\\nAlgae/phytoplankton abundance (1 study): One site comparison study in Kenya\\u00a0found that mangrove forests restored by planting contained a similar algal biomass, after eight years, to mature natural forests. However, mangrove forests created by planting into bare sediment contained less algal biomass than mature natural forests.\\nIndividual species abundance (7 studies): Seven studies\\u00a0quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. Four of the studies compared the abundance of woody vegetation\\u00a0or algae\\u00a0in planted mangrove forests and mature natural forests \\u2013 and sometimes\\u00a0naturally regenerating forests (see original papers for data). One replicated, paired, controlled study in a brackish wetland in the USA\\u00a0reported that there were fewer common reed Phragmites australis stems in plots planted with wetland shrubs (and herbs) than in unplanted plots, after 1\\u20133 years. One before-and-after study of an intertidal site in the USA\\u00a0reported greater abundance of red mangrove Rhizophora mangle over five years after planting (along with other interventions) than before.\\n\\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE\\n\\nOverall structure (3 studies): Three replicated, site comparison studies of coastal sites in the Kenya, the USA\\u00a0and the Philippines\\u00a0reported that where mangrove forests developed after planting trees (sometimes\\u00a0along with other interventions), their overall structure differed from mature natural forests for up to 50 years.\\nHeight (18 studies): Four site comparison studies (three replicated, three paired) of coastal sites in Kenya, the USA, Brazil\\u00a0and the Philippines\\u00a0reported that where mangrove forests developed after planting trees (sometimes\\u00a0along with other interventions), the vegetation was shorter than in mature\\u00a0and naturally regenerating\\u00a0forests after 5\\u201330 years. One site comparison study in Mexico\\u00a0reported that planted mangrove forests contained taller trees than pristine natural forests after 12 years. Fourteen studies (four replicated) in Asia, Central/South America, Africa\\u00a0and North America\\u00a0simply quantified the height of mangrove trees for up to six years after they were planted; in 13 of these studies, the average height increased over time.\\nDiameter (7 studies): Two site comparison studies in Mexio\\u00a0and Vietnam\\u00a0reported that tree diameters were similar in planted and natural mangroves after 12\\u201334 years. In contrast, two site comparison studies in Brazil\\u00a0and the Philippines\\u00a0reported that planted mangroves contained thinner tree stems than mature natural mangroves after 7\\u201312 years. The study in Brazil\\u00a0also reported that stem diameters were thinner than in naturally regenerating areas. Three studies in India\\u00a0and Nigeria\\u00a0simply quantified the diameter of mangrove trees for up to three years after they were planted; in all three studies, the average stem diameter increased over time.\\nBasal area (3 studies): Two site comparison studies (one also replicated, paired, before-and-after) in Kenya\\u00a0and Mexico\\u00a0reported that planted mangrove forests had a smaller basal area than mature natural forests after 5\\u201312 years. One replicated, site comparison study in the USA\\u00a0reported that where mangrove forests developed after planting trees (along with other interventions), their basal area was similar to mature natural forests after 17\\u201330 years.\\n\\nOTHER\\n\\nSurvival (37 studies): Thirty-six studies (including one review\\u00a0and one systematic review) quantified survival rates of individual trees/shrubs planted in brackish/saline wetlands. Survival rates ranged from 0% to 100% after 15 days to 21 years. The studies were of mangroves in North America, Central/South America,\\u00a0Asia, Africa, Oceania\\u00a0or globally, and of shrubs in the USA\\u00a0or Spain. Six studies\\u00a0reported 100% survival in some cases. Eleven studies\\u00a0reported 0% survival or absence of planted species in some cases. In six studies, survival of planted seedlings was not distinguished from survival of seeds or propagules. Proposed factors affecting survival included elevation/water levels, exposure to wind/waves, soil properties, sediment deposition, oyster/barnacle colonization, salinity, use of guidance\\u00a0and post-planting care.\\nGrowth (9 studies): Nine studies monitored true growth of individual trees/shrubs (rather than changes in average height of survivors). The nine studies, in Colombia, the USA, the Philippines, Brazil\\u00a0and China, reported that planted trees/shrubs typically grew, over periods from 40 days to 50 years. One replicated study in the USA\\u00a0reported that planted seedlings grew less quickly than naturally colonizing seedlings. One replicated, site comparison study in the Philippines\\u00a0found that growth rates of trees in planted mangroves became more similar to those in mature natural mangroves over time.\"\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "Several actions are available to protect newly planted trees from competition and other threats. To reduce competition from other vegetation, selective thinning can be used after restoration planting, which has been shown to increase herbaceous species abundance while decreasing tree competition. Ground covering techniques such as plastic mats can decrease cover of competing herbaceous plants and grasses, while mulch application can increase total plant cover. For protection from animal damage, tree guards or shelters can increase survival rates of planted tree seedlings, with light-colored plastic shelters being more effective than dark-colored ones. Physical barriers like fences can be used to exclude wild herbivores from restoration areas. Ground preparation before planting is another important action, with most studies showing increased survival and growth rates of planted trees when proper ground preparation treatments are applied. Mechanical thinning before or after planting has also been shown to increase survival and size of planted trees in most cases.",

Mechanical methods include removing understory vegetation after tree planting (1256) and using mechanical thinning before or after planting (1261). Mulching with woodchips before planting native shrubs showed mixed results - it had no significant effect on overall shrub cover or swamp gum seedling height in Australian floodplain swamps, but reduced cover of problematic herb species in one of two tested swamps (3314). Covering plots with plastic or jute mats before planting reduced cover of two problematic herb species in Australian floodplain swamps (3318), while shading black mangrove seedlings with black mesh on a Mexican sandflat resulted in increased height growth over six months (3319). Prescribed burning can be used to control trees (1721) and problematic plants in freshwater swamps (3118), with one study finding that burning canarygrass-invaded vegetation after herbicide spraying increased overall plant diversity compared to spraying alone. Planting a mixture of tree species is another approach to enhance survival and growth, though no quantitative evidence was found for this method (1159).",

One study found similar bat species richness in thinned and unthinned forest, except for chocolate wattled bat which was not recorded in unthinned regrowth (Action 991). Higher bat diversity was found in forest thinned up to 20 years previously compared to unthinned forest (Action 991).\n\nPRESCRIBED FIRE: In eucalyptus forest, selective burning resulted in fewer Eltham copper caterpillars than before burning (Action 3877). Forest restored by burning in combination with thinning had higher species richness and abundance of butterflies than unburned forest (Action 3877). Reptile studies showed mixed results: burned areas had similar reptile species richness compared to unburned areas, with some studies finding higher abundance of certain reptile species in burned areas (Action 3646).\n\nSELECTIVE vs. CLEARCUT LOGGING: Two studies found logging trees in forests decreased epiphytic plant abundance and fern fertility, with mixed effects depending on species (Action 1270).\n\nFOREST RESTORATION: Forests restored after mining had significantly higher or similar bat activity as unmined forests for five of seven bat species (Action 2050). Restored forest areas had higher reptile abundance than remnant forest areas in one study, while another found similar reptile abundance across different restoration types (Action 3749).\n\nTHINNING FOLLOWED BY PRESCRIBED FIRE: One replicated, controlled study found no effect on the genetic diversity of black ash (Action 1227).",

Adding below-ground organic matter like compost to freshwater wetlands planted with tree seedlings showed mixed results: large amounts led to plant communities characteristic of drier conditions and reduced plant species richness and diversity after three years, while smaller doses had no significant effects on these outcomes. However, birch saplings were larger when planted with large amounts of compost. Ground coverings like straw showed positive effects, with one study in the Czech Republic finding that straw mulch increased growth rates of planted trees and shrubs. Lime amendments showed variable effects: two studies found either decreased survival of pine seedlings or no effect on oak seedling growth. The effectiveness appears context-dependent, with studies showing that organic matter incorporation generally increased soil carbon levels, microbial biomass, and sometimes improved yields, while lime effects varied between vegetation types and study sites.",
