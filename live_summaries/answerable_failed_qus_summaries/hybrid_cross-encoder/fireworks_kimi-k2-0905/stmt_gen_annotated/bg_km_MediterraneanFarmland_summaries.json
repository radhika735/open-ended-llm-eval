Ten studies showed compost increases soil nutrients, with some finding inconsistent effects on nitrogen and no differences in phosphorus. Ten studies found compost increases microbial biomass, though two showed similar amounts and one found inconsistent bacterial abundance differences. Compost consistently reduces soil erosion and increases soil stability. However, six studies found compost increases greenhouse gas emissions compared to controls.\n\nMANURE (1363, 911): Eight studies found manure increases organic matter, though three showed similar amounts. Five studies showed varied effects on nitrogen, with some finding increases and others showing similar levels. Manure consistently increases potassium levels and shows mixed effects on phosphorus. Studies showed manure increases soil stability and reduces erosion. Two studies found manure increases greenhouse gas emissions (carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide).\n\nMIXED APPLICATIONS (902, 911): Studies combining manure with inorganic fertilizers showed higher microbial biomass and activity than inorganic fertilizers alone. Mixed amendments increased soil organic carbon and nutrients more consistently than individual applications. Four studies found mixed manure/compost applications increased crop yields.\n\nBoth compost and manure improve soil fertility through increased organic matter, nutrients, and microbial activity, with compost showing more consistent results for organic matter increases and manure showing more variable nutrient effects depending on application timing and type.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on Mediterranean studies, both no-tillage and reduced tillage systems improve soil health compared to conventional tillage, with some differences between them. No-tillage consistently shows benefits for soil organic matter, with studies from Spain finding more organic matter in no-tillage systems compared to reduced tillage (action 1370). A meta-analysis of Mediterranean countries found more organic matter in no-tillage soils compared to tilled soils (action 1369), and another meta-analysis found more organic matter in reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage (action 1371).\n\nFor soil nutrients, results are mixed. No-tillage systems show varied effects on nitrogen compared to reduced tillage - some studies found more nitrogen (action 1370), while others found less or similar amounts (actions 1369, 1370). Both systems generally increase phosphorus levels compared to conventional tillage, with no-tillage sometimes showing more phosphorus than reduced tillage (action 1370).\n\nRegarding soil organisms, both systems support microbial biomass. No-tillage and reduced tillage show similar microbial biomass levels in most cases, though some studies found more microbial biomass in no-tillage systems (actions 1369, 1370). Both systems support earthworm populations better than conventional tillage, with studies finding more earthworms in no-tillage fields (action 1369).\n\nFor soil structure and erosion control, both systems improve soil aggregation and stability compared to conventional tillage. No-tillage sometimes shows better water-stability and formation of larger aggregates compared to reduced tillage, though results vary (action 1370). Studies from Spain found that both no-tillage and reduced tillage create more stable soils than conventional tillage (actions 1369, 1371).\n\nIn terms of greenhouse gases, both systems show variable effects on carbon dioxide emissions, with no clear consistent difference between no-tillage and reduced tillage systems (actions 1369, 1370, 1371).",

Additionally, there is potential for increased pest populations, as studies found more leafhoppers in some vineyard plots with cover crops (action ID 1395), and more gophers in plots with clover cover crops (action ID 1395).

Studies on adding slurry to soil (Action ID 1365, 8 studies) found that 5 of 6 studies showed higher nitrous oxide emissions from plots with added slurry compared to soils without it. For carbon dioxide emissions from slurry-treated soils, 2 of 3 studies found higher emissions. When comparing organic fertilizers to inorganic fertilizers (Action ID 1366, 11 studies), 4 of 5 studies found higher carbon dioxide emissions from plots with organic fertilizer. For compost amendments (Action ID 1362, 10 studies), 6 of 10 studies found more greenhouse gas emissions from soils with added compost compared to soils without it. Manure applications (Action ID 1363, 2 studies) resulted in higher carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions compared to plots without added manure. Adding sewage sludge to soil (Action ID 1364, 2 studies) also led to higher carbon dioxide emissions in both studies. Overall, while organic amendments improve soil organic matter content consistently, they tend to increase greenhouse gas emissions from Mediterranean farmland soils.",

Organic fertilizers generally increase microbial biomass and activity in Mediterranean soils, with studies from France, Italy, and Spain showing more microbial biomass in organically fertilized soils compared to inorganic fertilizers [Action 1366]. Mixed organic and inorganic amendments also enhance soil biodiversity, with trials from China, India, and Japan demonstrating higher microbial biomass, increased microbial diversity, and improved microbial activity [Action 902].\n\nFresh plant material and crop residue amendments show positive effects on soil organisms, with studies from Belgium finding increased microbial biomass when crop remains and straw were added [Action 910]. Green manures also contribute positively, with studies from India and Pakistan showing higher soil organic carbon levels [Action 908].\n\nDirect application of beneficial microorganisms, including bacteria and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, has been shown to increase microbial diversity in Indian trials [Action 888], while compost applications in Italian silty-clay soils increased soil organic matter, microbial biomass, and fruit yield [Action 889].\n\nHowever, some studies show complex or inconsistent effects. One Spanish study found fewer bacteria in soils with organic fertilizer compared to inorganic in one comparison [Action 1366], and an Italian study found inconsistent differences in microbes between plots with organic or inorganic fertilizer [Action 1366].\n\nOrganic farming practices, which typically involve various organic amendments, show higher numbers, diversity, functional diversity, and activity of soil organisms in studies across Asia, Europe, and the USA, including Mediterranean regions [Action 895].",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, several management practices can improve water availability on arable farms in Mediterranean climates. Cover crops show mixed effects on water availability - multiple studies found cover crops can reduce water loss through drainage, runoff, or evaporation, and some studies found more water infiltration with cover crops, though other studies found they can use more water than bare fallows in some cases. Reduced tillage is consistently beneficial, with numerous studies finding more water in soils with reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage, improved water infiltration rates, and reduced water loss. No-tillage practices also show significant benefits, with multiple studies finding more water retention compared to tilled soils. Adding mulch to crops is effective, with studies showing increased soil moisture and reduced soil erosion and runoff. Retaining crop residues improves water storage and reduces soil erosion. Growing cover crops when fields are empty can improve soil structure and nutrient retention, leading to better water management. These practices work by reducing evaporation, improving water infiltration and retention, and reducing runoff, making more water available for crops in Mediterranean climates.",

Planting and managing hedgerows (actions 2383, 116) can increase small mammal abundance and was associated with higher brown hare density in arable sites. Hedge management resulted in increased berry yields, species diversity or richness of plants and invertebrates, and diversity or abundance of farmland birds, though some studies showed mixed or no effects. Restoring habitat along watercourses (action 1416) showed similar numbers of amphibian, reptile, and mammal species in restored and remnant sites, but findings were mixed for birds and invertebrates, with some studies finding similar numbers while others found fewer species in restored sites. Creating uncultivated margins around fields (actions 190, 3518) provided habitat for birds, with some bird species using margins more than crops, and reptiles like slow worms, common lizards and grass snakes were found using these margins. Buffer strips alongside watercourses (action 120) had positive influence on plant, invertebrate and bird diversity or abundance in some studies, while other studies found no increase in plant species numbers. Increasing semi-natural habitat in farmed landscapes (action 145) showed mixed effects, with some bird species increasing while others showed no change or decreases.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on studies from Mediterranean countries including Spain, Italy, Greece, Turkey, and France, compost, manure, and slurry amendments show distinct effects on soil organic matter and nutrients:\n\n**Soil Organic Matter**: Compost showed the most consistent positive effects, with twelve replicated studies from Mediterranean countries finding more organic matter in soils with added compost compared to soils without it. Manure showed variable results, with five studies finding more organic matter but three studies finding similar amounts between treated and untreated soils. Slurry showed minimal benefits for organic matter, with three studies finding similar amounts in soils with or without added slurry, and only one study finding more organic matter in some comparisons.\n\n**Nutrients**: Compost applications resulted in more nutrients in six replicated studies from Mediterranean countries, though three studies showed inconsistent differences in nitrogen. Manure consistently increased nitrogen levels in three studies, phosphorus in one study, and potassium in two studies from Mediterranean regions. Slurry showed mixed effects on nutrients, with two studies finding more nitrate but two other studies finding similar nitrate levels, and variable effects on ammonium.\n\n**Greenhouse Gas Emissions**: Slurry applications showed concerning results with five studies finding higher nitrous oxide emissions compared to untreated soils. Manure also increased nitrous oxide emissions in one study, while compost showed variable greenhouse gas effects with six studies finding more emissions but four studies finding no differences.",
