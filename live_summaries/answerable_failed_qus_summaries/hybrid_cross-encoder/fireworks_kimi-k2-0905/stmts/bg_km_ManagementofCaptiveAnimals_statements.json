However, effects vary by species, as one study found that unpredictable feeding increased territorial behavior in coyotes but did not affect traveling or foraging (Action 1904). Regarding feeding frequency, one study found that large felids fed once every three days paced more frequently on non-feeding days (Action 1906).

For lemurs, a fruit-free diet was found to reduce aggression and self-directed behavior. Both species benefit from scattered feeding throughout the enclosure, which increases exploratory and feeding behaviors while reducing abnormal behaviors and aggression. Presenting whole foods instead of processed items increases food consumption and feeding time in macaques. Providing fresh produce instead of pellet feed results in more time spent feeding and less inactive time in rhesus macaques. The inclusion of cut branches (browse) allows for natural processing skills, as seen when captive gorillas used the same techniques as wild gorillas to handle stinging nettles. Live vegetation in planters can enhance foraging behavior, with chimpanzees spending more time foraging when provided with planted grass. Formulating diets to reflect the nutritional composition of wild foods, including the removal of domestic fruits, represents a comprehensive approach to dietary naturalism in captive primates.",

These include providing specific enclosure furniture such as rotting logs, hollow bamboo pipes, and varied substrates to create calling sites and breeding areas [1876]. Simulating seasonal changes through temperature variation (dropping from 20-24°C to 17°C) has been shown to stimulate breeding [1864], as has varying artificial rainfall to simulate wet and dry seasons [1872]. Managing social dynamics through allowing female mate choice [1882], separating sexes during non-breeding periods [1880], and playing recorded breeding calls to simulate the breeding season [1881] are also effective strategies. Using surrogate species to refine husbandry techniques before working with target critically endangered species has proven beneficial [1862]. Hormonal treatments can also be used to induce sperm and egg release, with 30-71% of females producing viable eggs following treatment [883]. A combined approach incorporating multiple factors - such as pre-breeding cooling periods, allowing females to gain weight before breeding, providing mate choice, playing recorded calls, and using enclosures with proper furniture and flowing water - has shown increased breeding success and larger clutch sizes [1864, 1882, 1880, 1881].",

        "Simulating seasonal changes through temperature variation by dropping temperatures from 20-24°C to 17°C has been shown to stimulate breeding.",
        "Varying artificial rainfall to simulate wet and dry seasons has been shown to stimulate breeding.",
        "Allowing female mate choice is an effective strategy for managing amphibian social dynamics.",
        "Separating sexes during non-breeding periods is an effective strategy for managing amphibian social dynamics.",
        "Playing recorded breeding calls to simulate the breeding season is an effective strategy for managing amphibian social dynamics.",
        "Using surrogate species to refine husbandry techniques before working with target critically endangered species has proven beneficial.",
        "Hormonal treatments can be used to induce sperm and egg release in amphibians.",
        "Following hormonal treatment, 30-71% of females produce viable eggs.",
        "A combined approach incorporating multiple factors has shown increased breeding success and larger clutch sizes.",
        "A combined approach for breeding success can include pre-breeding cooling periods and allowing females to gain weight before breeding.",
        "A combined approach for breeding success can include providing mate choice and playing recorded calls.",
        "A combined approach for breeding success can include using enclosures with proper furniture and flowing water."
