At aquaculture systems (Action 2775), acoustic devices reduced predation on caged salmon by grey seals, harbour seals, and South American sea lions. Using acoustic devices on fishing gear (Action 2808) reduced seal damage to fish catches and fishing nets in multiple controlled studies.\n\nPhysical gear modifications have also proven effective. Modifying fishing pots and traps to exclude mammals (Action 2822) with wire grids or steel bars, along with strengthened netting, reduced damage to salmon catches by grey and harbour seals. Installing steel rods or metal frames on fishing pots and traps also reduced the number of grey and harbour seals that entered or became trapped in pots.\n\nElectric deterrents showed positive results in one controlled study (Action 2818), where using an electric current on a fishing net reduced Pacific harbour seal predation on salmon catches.\n\nLess effective methods included switching off artificial lighting at wild fisheries (Action 2825) and installing cork line barriers (Action 2824), both of which failed to deter harbour seals from feeding on salmon released from a hatchery.

      "relevant_summary": "The evidence for mitigating seal predation shows distinct approaches between aquaculture systems and wild fisheries. In aquaculture systems, there is documented evidence for several techniques: replacing anti-predator nets more frequently at salmon farms resulted in fewer salmon losses to harbour seal predation (action 2774), and using acoustic devices at salmon farms reduced predation on caged salmon by grey seals, harbour seals and South American sea lions, though effectiveness varied with two of six studies showing no reduction in predation (action 2775). Translocating mammals away from aquaculture systems showed limited effectiveness, with more than half or nearly all of translocated Australian and New Zealand fur seals returning to salmon farms (action 2776). For wild fisheries, the evidence focuses on gear modifications: installing steel rods on lobster pots or metal frames on fishing pots reduced seal entrapments (action 2822), and installing wire grids or steel bars on fishing trap-nets or bag-nets, along with strengthened netting, reduced damage to salmon catches by seals and resulted in higher catches of undamaged salmon (action 2822). Other approaches like switching off artificial lighting at wild fisheries did not deter harbour seals from feeding on salmon (action 2825), and playing predator calls did not deter Cape fur seals from feeding on fish catches (action 2817). No studies were found on enforcing regulations to prevent harmful deterrents at wild fisheries (action 2779).",
