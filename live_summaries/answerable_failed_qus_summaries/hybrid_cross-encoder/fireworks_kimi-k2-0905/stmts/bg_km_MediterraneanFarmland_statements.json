Ten studies found compost increases microbial biomass, though two showed similar amounts and one found inconsistent bacterial abundance differences. Compost consistently reduces soil erosion and increases soil stability. However, six studies found compost increases greenhouse gas emissions compared to controls.\n\nMANURE (1363, 911): Eight studies found manure increases organic matter, though three showed similar amounts. Five studies showed varied effects on nitrogen, with some finding increases and others showing similar levels. Manure consistently increases potassium levels and shows mixed effects on phosphorus. Studies showed manure increases soil stability and reduces erosion. Two studies found manure increases greenhouse gas emissions (carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide).\n\nMIXED APPLICATIONS (902, 911): Studies combining manure with inorganic fertilizers showed higher microbial biomass and activity than inorganic fertilizers alone. Mixed amendments increased soil organic carbon and nutrients more consistently than individual applications. Four studies found mixed manure/compost applications increased crop yields.\n\nBoth compost and manure improve soil fertility through increased organic matter, nutrients, and microbial activity, with compost showing more consistent results for organic matter increases and manure showing more variable nutrient effects depending on application timing and type.",

Adding mulch to crops is effective, with studies showing increased soil moisture and reduced soil erosion and runoff. Retaining crop residues improves water storage and reduces soil erosion. Growing cover crops when fields are empty can improve soil structure and nutrient retention, leading to better water management.
