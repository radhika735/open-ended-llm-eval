      "relevant_summary": "Five replicated trials in the UK found that sowing uncropped arable field margins with a native wild flower seed mix can support a higher abundance and, in three of the trials, a higher species richness of foraging bumblebees compared to cropped field edges, grassy margins, or naturally regenerated uncropped margins [19]. Another five replicated trials in Europe showed that field margins sown with an agricultural nectar and pollen seed mix, particularly those with perennial leguminous flowering plants, attract significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated, grassy, or cropped field margins [18]. Perennial leguminous herbs in seed mixes have been identified as important forage sources for bumblebees, especially long-tongued species [19]. In fact, one trial showed that common long-tongued bumblebees have a strong preference for perennial wildflower seed mixes over annual forage plants [19]. However, another three trials found that a mix of agricultural forage plants, including legumes, can attract a greater number of bumblebees than a perennial wildflower mix, at least in the first year [18]. It is worth noting that three trials in the UK suggest that margins sown with agricultural legume plants may degrade in their value to bumblebees over time and would require re-sowing every few years [18]. There is no captured evidence on the effects of these management practices on solitary bees in either of the studied approaches [18, 19].",
