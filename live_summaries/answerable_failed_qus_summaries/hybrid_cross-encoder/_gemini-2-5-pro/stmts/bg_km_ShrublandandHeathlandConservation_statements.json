In the Netherlands, a replicated, site comparison study found that in heathlands restored by topsoil removal butterfly species richness was lower than in the surrounding landscape but at restored sites abundance was higher in areas where heather litter had also been spread (3946).

Increasing the number of livestock can lead to a decline in common heather and dwarf shrub cover [1628]. However, it can also result in an increase in heather cover, as well as an increase in the number of common heather and cross-leaved heath seedlings [1628]. In some cases, increasing livestock numbers may not alter shrub cover at all, or have mixed effects [1628]. Grazing can also affect grass and vegetation height. For instance, using grazing to control grass has been found to increase the cover of wavy-hair grass and reduce grass height [1646]. Increasing the number of livestock has been shown to decrease overall vegetation height [1628]. When it comes to species diversity, areas with high livestock density may have a higher number of plant species, though in some cases, the number of species may decrease or show no change [1628].\n\nExcluding livestock from shrublands using fences has also been studied. Fencing has been found to increase shrub cover, abundance, and biomass [1545]. Specifically, heather presence and cover were higher in fenced areas in some studies [1545]. On the other hand, some studies found that fencing could lead to a decrease in the cover of woody plants, or have mixed or no effect on shrub cover [1545]. In terms of other vegetation, fencing has been observed to lead to a decline in grass cover in some instances, while in others, it did not alter or even increased grass cover [1545]. Fencing has also been found to have mixed or no effect on herb cover [1545].",

Some studies reported mixed effects or no change in shrub cover from grazing [1628]. Information from studies on fencing to exclude livestock corroborates some of these findings, with several studies showing that excluding livestock increased shrub cover, biomass, and height, suggesting that grazing has the opposite effect [1545].

One study on fencing found that excluding livestock resulted in lower species richness, suggesting grazing can enhance it [1545]. In terms of vegetation structure, increasing livestock was found to decrease vegetation height [1628]. The effect on grasses is also variable, with some studies showing increased grass cover relative to heather [1628], while another found a reduction in grass and herb cover with more livestock [1628].
