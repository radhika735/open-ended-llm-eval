One study found that introducing a parasitic plant could alter the plant community, reduce sedge cover, and increase moss cover and species richness (1777). Another study reported that herbicide application, along with other interventions, changed the plant community but could not prevent increases in shrub cover and prevented increases in plant species richness (1776). Prescribed fire has been shown to increase moss/lichen/bare ground cover in the short term, and lower heather cover, but it can also reduce or limit plant species richness (1774). The effects of cutting or mowing on plant communities were mixed, with some studies showing no significant effect and others reporting changes in community composition and increased cover of some desirable species like Sphagnum moss (1770, 1772). Finally, disturbing the peatland surface was found to affect plant community development, with one study noting an increase in weedy species (1811).",

This technique has been shown to increase moss or bryophyte cover, including Sphagnum, as well as herb cover, while reducing shrub cover (1804). It also led to a higher number of plant species compared to unrestored areas (1804). Multiple other restoration interventions have also been found to increase the cover of mosses, Sphagnum, and herbaceous plants like cottongrass (1803). These interventions have also been reported to increase overall vegetation cover (1803). The plant community in restored bogs was found to be more similar to that of natural bogs than unrestored ones (1803). However, in one study, bogs being restored as fens developed a different plant community compared to natural fens after five years (1803). No studies were found that evaluated the effects of other methods of protecting or preparing peatland vegetation before planting (1842). In the context of tree planting, ground preparation treatments have been found to increase the survival and growth rate of planted trees in six out of seven studies (1263).",

In terms of vegetation, mowing has been shown to alter the overall plant community composition (1759, 1771). Multiple studies found that mowing increased plant species richness (1759), with one study noting a greater increase in summer-mown plots compared to those mown in spring or autumn (1771). Mowing also increased the cover of plants characteristic of fens or wet meadows (1759) and, in some cases, increased total moss or bryophyte cover (1759). It was found to reduce the cover of certain herbs and shrubs (1759). The impact on vegetation structure, such as height and biomass, was mixed (1759), and one study reported that mown fen meadows had a similar vegetation structure to grazed meadows (1759). Regarding wildlife, one study found that fens managed by mowing had a higher species richness of butterflies than fens managed by cattle grazing (3950). However, recently cut fens, or fens cut in autumn or winter, had fewer large copper butterfly eggs and lower caterpillar survival compared to uncut fens (3950). The timing of mowing can be significant, as one study reported that summer and winter mowing resulted in different plant community types, while another noted similar changes in composition regardless of the season (1771).",
