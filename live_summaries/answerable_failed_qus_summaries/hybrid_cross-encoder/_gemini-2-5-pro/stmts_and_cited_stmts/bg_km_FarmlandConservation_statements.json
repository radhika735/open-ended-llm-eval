However, two studies found no effect on 11 out of 12 farmland bird species or ground beetles (562), and another study found a higher incidence of pernicious weeds on uncropped cultivated margins (562). In contrast, one UK study on retaining unmown field margins found no difference in the activity of pipistrelle bats between these margins and conventional field margins (1940).

The use of bar mowers and double chop mowers was found to cause less damage to amphibians and invertebrates than other machinery types (698). Conversely, rotary disc mowers with conditioners killed twice as many small mammals as double blade mowers (698). Using a mechanical processor or conditioner was also found to kill or injure more invertebrates (698). However, one study found that mower-conditioners led to higher Eurasian skylark nest survival compared to using a tedder (698). Additionally, skylark chick survival was four times higher with wider mowing machinery (698). Wildlife-friendly mowing techniques have been associated with lower mortality for corncrakes and Eurasian skylarks (192), and a scheme promoting such techniques coincided with a large increase in the UK corncrake population (192).\n\nIn terms of mowing height, a UK review and a study found that raised mowing heights benefited Eurasian skylarks with increased productivity and were less damaging to amphibians and invertebrates (138). However, a randomized, replicated, controlled trial in the UK found that raising mowing height did not attract more foraging birds (222, 138) or affect the number of invertebrates (138). Furthermore, one study noted that northern lapwing and common starling chicks foraged more successfully in shorter grass (138). Another UK review suggested that while raising mowing height might increase skylark productivity, it was not sufficient to maintain the local population (222).\n\nDelaying the date of mowing has also been studied. Eight studies found that delaying mowing or grazing resulted in benefits such as higher plant species richness, more insect species, greater abundance of some spiders and ground beetles, and increased breeding densities of wading birds and Eurasian skylark productivity (131). The introduction of measures including delayed mowing dates coincided with an increase in the UK corncrake population (131). However, six other studies found that delaying mowing had no clear effect on plant species richness, ground beetle communities, the abundance of some insects and spiders, or the population trends of wading bird species (131).",

A systematic review concluded that asulam herbicide, when applied repeatedly, decreased the abundance of bracken, although cutting may be just as effective (105). A laboratory trial in the UK demonstrated that asulam inhibited the growth of three common moss species often found with bracken after a three-week exposure, but not after a 24-hour exposure (105). No studies were found that assessed the effects of biological control on managing non-native, invasive, or other problematic species populations on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations. The absence of studies means there is no evidence to determine if this intervention is desirable or harmful (2172).",

      "relevant_summary": "The creation of skylark plots in cereal fields has been shown to be a beneficial action for supporting Eurasian skylarks. Studies in the UK and Switzerland have reported increases in skylark population size, breeding density, and success in areas with these plots (540, 214). Skylarks have also been observed to use these plots more than expected (214, 540), and one study found that their territories were less likely to be abandoned (540). Additionally, two UK studies found that skylark productivity was higher in or near these plots (214). However, a study in Switzerland found no difference in productivity between territories with and without plots (214). In terms of other wildlife, some studies have found benefits to plants and invertebrates from the creation of skylark plots (540), while others have found no significant difference in the numbers of some invertebrates or seed-eating songbirds between the plots and conventional crop fields (540, 214).\n\nAnother action, planting cereals in wide-spaced rows, has conflicting evidence. One UK study noted that this method \"offered benefits\" for Eurasian skylarks but did not provide details, while another study in the same region found that fields with wide-spaced rows had fewer skylark nests compared to control fields or fields with skylark plots (216).",

One UK study found that CBWCS fields, especially those with barley, were used more by seed-eating birds in both summer and winter compared to other crop types (225). This study also noted that insect-eating species tended to use other crops and grassland more (225). Another UK study found that CBWCS fields had a higher abundance of seed-eating songbirds, swallows, and martins, and that important bird food plants were more plentiful in cereals than in other crop types (149). This same study also found more invertebrates in wheat, barley, and grass silage fields compared to maize fields (149). However, a review found one study where seed-eating birds avoided CBWCS fields during the winter (149). Another in-field option is to leave rye grass uncut in silage fields. Two UK reviews and two replicated, controlled studies found that leaving rye grass with a single cut or entirely uncut benefited seed-eating birds, with these birds being more abundant on the uncut plots (224). Furthermore, uncut and ungrazed plots were found to have more seed-eating birds than plots that were uncut but grazed (224). The response of non-seed-eating birds to this management option is less certain, with some species avoiding uncut rye grass (224).",

Another five replicated trials in Europe showed that field margins sown with an agricultural nectar and pollen seed mix, particularly those with perennial leguminous flowering plants, attract significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated, grassy, or cropped field margins [18]. Perennial leguminous herbs in seed mixes have been identified as important forage sources for bumblebees, especially long-tongued species [19]. In fact, one trial showed that common long-tongued bumblebees have a strong preference for perennial wildflower seed mixes over annual forage plants [19]. However, another three trials found that a mix of agricultural forage plants, including legumes, can attract a greater number of bumblebees than a perennial wildflower mix, at least in the first year [18]. It is worth noting that three trials in the UK suggest that margins sown with agricultural legume plants may degrade in their value to bumblebees over time and would require re-sowing every few years [18]. There is no captured evidence on the effects of these management practices on solitary bees in either of the studied approaches [18, 19].",
