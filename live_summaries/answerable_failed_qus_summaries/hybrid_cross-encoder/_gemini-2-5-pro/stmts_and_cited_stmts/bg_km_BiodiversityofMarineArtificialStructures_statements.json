Created rock pools and holes were found to support macroalgae, mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate and/or fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without these features (3476, 3467).

One study found that creating pit habitats on intertidal artificial structures decreased the combined macroalgae and invertebrate abundance on structure surfaces (3475). Another study in the UK found that creating natural rocky reef topography on intertidal artificial structures did not increase the combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness on structure surfaces (3435). Other studies found that creating pit habitats did not increase species richness (3475), and creating short flexible habitats did not increase fish species richness or the combined mobile invertebrate and fish abundance (3459). The creation of pit habitats has been found to have mixed effects on the abundance of invertebrates and the overall community composition (3475). Similarly, creating natural rocky reef topography was found to have mixed effects on barnacle and mobile invertebrate abundances (3435). Adding short, flexible habitats also had mixed effects on invertebrate and fish community composition, mobile invertebrate species richness, and the abundance of macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrates (3459).",

The same study found that this intervention decreased the overall species richness of macroalgae, invertebrates and fish during low tide (3459). One study in an estuary in southeast Australia reported that reducing the slope of an intertidal artificial structure, in conjunction with creating rock pools, led to an increase in the combined species richness of macroalgae, invertebrates and fish (3461). However, another study in the same region found that reducing the slope alone did not increase the abundance of macroalgae, oysters, or mobile invertebrates (3461). There were no studies found that evaluated the effects of creating large ridges or ledges (>50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures on the biodiversity of those structures (3445).",
