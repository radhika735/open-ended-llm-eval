    "relevant_summary": "Several alternative management strategies to prescribed burning for maintaining open grassland habitats for butterflies have been studied. One study found that the species richness of butterflies was similar on semi-natural grassland managed by light grazing or by annual mowing (3908). Another study found that grassland managed by sheep and cattle grazing had a higher species richness of butterflies than grassland mown annually (3908). Butterfly species richness was highest in grasslands where mowing was staggered throughout the year, with some areas left uncut (3908). In terms of abundance, five studies found that semi-natural grasslands had a similar abundance of butterflies when managed by extensive grazing compared to annual or occasional mowing (3908). However, some studies also found that grasslands managed by grazing had a higher abundance of butterflies than those managed by annual mowing (3908), while others found that haying resulted in a higher abundance of individual butterfly species than grazing (3908). Rotational grazing has also been explored as an alternative. Some studies found that rotational cattle and sheep-grazed grasslands had a greater species richness of butterflies and burnet moths than continuously grazed or patch-burned grassland (3965) and that rotational grazing, at high stocking densities, could also increase butterfly abundance (3965). Ceasing mowing to allow for early succession is another potential strategy. Some studies found that grasslands that had been abandoned for 3-13 years had a similar species richness of butterflies to managed grasslands, while meadows not cut all summer had a higher species richness of butterflies than those cut multiple times (3957). However, long-term abandonment of over 50 years could lead to lower species richness (3957). The impact of ceasing mowing on butterfly abundance is mixed, with some studies reporting lower abundance and others reporting higher abundance compared to mown grasslands (3957). Additionally, the management of surrounding habitats like hedgerows can benefit butterflies. Hedgerows with a more complex structure, with trees, or those cut less frequently (every 2-3 years) or laid/coppiced, were found to have a higher species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths (3975).",

Mowing coastal grassland in August was found to reduce the abundance of Fisher's estuarine moth caterpillars, while mowing in November or not mowing did not (3945).

    "relevant_summary": "Several studies have looked at the effects of thinning trees on butterfly and moth populations. Four studies in Finland and the USA discovered that thinning coniferous woodland, in some cases with additional management like mulching or prescribed burning, led to a higher abundance and species richness of butterflies (3940). Another study in the Czech Republic showed that forest plots that had been partially cleared had a higher species richness of butterflies, but a lower species richness of moths, than closed-canopy forests (3940). One study in Côte d’Ivoire, however, found that a thinned forest had a similar abundance and diversity of fruit-feeding butterflies as a naturally regenerating, unmanaged forest, but that rarer species were caught less often in the thinned forest (3940).\n\nStudies have also examined the effects of different logging methods on butterfly and moth populations. A study in Brazil discovered that a forest that was managed with reduced-impact logging had a greater abundance of butterflies than a primary forest, as well as a similar diversity and species richness (3867). Another study in Brazil found that fruit-feeding butterflies were most abundant in forests with an intermediate intensity of reduced-impact logging (3867). In contrast, a study in the USA reported that forests where single tree selection harvesting was used had a lower species richness of moths than forests that were unharvested (3867).\n\nThe impact of encouraging natural regeneration in logged forests or former plantations has also been investigated. A study in Uganda showed that naturally regenerating forests had a similar abundance and species richness of butterflies to pristine forests, with both measures being highest 12 to 25 years after felling (3876). In Japan, a study found that moths were more abundant and had a greater species richness in naturally regenerating forests than in plantations (3876). However, a study in Ghana reported that a naturally regenerating forest had a lower species richness of butterflies than a primary forest (3876). In Côte d’Ivoire, a study found that a naturally regenerating forest had a similar abundance of fruit-feeding butterflies as a thinned forest, but that rarer species were found more often in the naturally regenerating one (3876).",

Five studies found that grasslands with lower stocking densities of sheep, cattle, or a mix of livestock had a greater species richness of adult butterflies, moths, and burnet moths than grasslands with higher stocking densities [3959]. Additionally, a review across Europe indicated that reducing grazing intensity, which includes both lowering stocking density and the seasonal removal of livestock, was beneficial for 41 out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern [3959, 3960]. The seasonal removal of livestock can also be advantageous; one study showed that removing cattle during the summer resulted in a higher species richness of butterflies compared to grasslands that were grazed throughout the summer [3960]. When comparing grazing to mowing, the results are varied. One study found that grassland grazed by sheep and cattle had higher butterfly species richness than grassland mown annually in June [3908]. However, three other studies found that the species richness of butterflies was similar in semi-natural grasslands managed by light grazing or by annual mowing in July or August [3908].",

Prairies managed by haying showed a higher abundance of prairie specialist butterflies and a lower abundance of generalist and migrant butterflies when compared to prairies managed by burning (3945, 3882). Specifically, two prairie specialist species, the regal fritillary and arogos skipper, were found to be less abundant in prairies managed by burning than in those managed by haying or in grazed pastures (3882). The abundance of Karner blue butterflies on oak savannas managed by mowing was found to be similar to unmanaged savannas or those managed by burning (3945).\n\nPrescribed burning has shown mixed results. The abundance of Fender’s blue butterfly caterpillars and eggs was higher in prairies one or more years after management by burning compared to grazed land (3882). Conversely, the abundance of regal fritillary adults was lower on prairies managed by burning than on unburned land (3882). One study found that pastures managed with patch-burning had a lower species richness of butterflies than rotationally grazed pastures but a higher richness than continuously grazed pastures (3882).\n\nUnder rotational burning regimes, the time since the last fire is a key factor. The abundance of prairie specialist butterflies was higher on prairies that had been burned more than one, two, or four years prior compared to those burned more recently (3883). The abundance of grassland and generalist butterflies peaked in the third year after a fire, while migrant butterflies were most abundant in the first year (3883). However, for some fritillary species, abundance was lower in prairies managed with rotational burning compared to prairies managed with only haying or grazing, or unmanaged prairies (3883). Combining rotational burning with grazing was found to create a different butterfly community composition than either management practice used alone (3883).",

One UK study found that fields with wider margins had a higher abundance of butterflies in one of two years, and another UK study found that farms with uncropped cultivated margins had a higher abundance of butterflies and micro-moths compared to conventionally managed farms (3923).

    "relevant_summary": "Reducing management intensity on permanent grasslands, which can include reducing fertiliser and pesticide use, has shown varied effects on butterfly and moth diversity. Six out of ten studies indicated that less intensively managed grasslands had a higher species richness of butterflies and moths compared to conventionally managed grasslands [3958]. However, two of these studies only observed this difference in one of two years or regions [3958]. The remaining four studies found similar species richness between less intensively and conventionally managed grasslands, though one of these noted a higher number of specialist moth species and species of conservation concern in the less intensively managed areas [3958]. One study reported an increase in the species richness of large moths after the cessation of chemical applications and a reduction in grazing [3958]. In terms of population, three out of four studies found that low-input or unfertilized, ungrazed grasslands supported a higher abundance of butterflies, micro-moths, and declining macro-moths than intensively managed grasslands [3958].
