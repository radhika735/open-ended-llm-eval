Transplanting or seeding biota onto intertidal structures (including oysters and coralline algae) supported species otherwise absent and had mixed effects on combined richness/diversity and invertebrate abundance, while generally not increasing fish richness or abundance; mobile invertebrate richness increased in one Australian study [3472]. Creating short flexible habitats (1–50 mm) on intertidal structures altered combined macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate community composition, decreased combined species richness at low tide, and showed mixed effects on macroalgal and invertebrate abundances; fish richness and abundance at high tide did not increase [3459]. Creating pit habitats (1–50 mm) on intertidal structures altered community composition in some studies, sometimes supported species absent from flat surfaces, and showed mixed effects on combined richness and invertebrate abundances across sites and designs, including in Australian estuaries [3475]. Creating hole habitats (>50 mm) on intertidal structures, often alongside other features, increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate richness/diversity, supported species absent from flat surfaces, and did not consistently increase macroalgal or invertebrate abundance; added holes and pools were used by sea slugs, urchins and octopuses in Australia [3467]. Using environmentally‑sensitive materials on intertidal structures (e.g., sandstone vs basalt, modified concretes, ECOncrete with grooves/ledges/holes) sometimes altered community composition and increased richness/diversity and overall cover, but effects on algal and invertebrate abundances were mixed across materials and sites, including an Australian estuary [3469]. On subtidal structures in Australian estuaries, creating long flexible habitats (>50 mm) supported species absent from bare surfaces and showed mixed effects on fish richness and on mobile and non‑mobile invertebrate abundances [3451]. Creating short flexible habitats (1–50 mm) on subtidal structures produced mixed effects on invertebrate community composition and abundances, and mixed effects on seahorse abundance, with no increase in invertebrate richness in a paired study [3450]. Transplanting or seeding onto subtidal structures included an Australian study where transplanted sea urchins reduced the cover of a non‑native sea mat on kelps; transplanted urchins survived [3471]. Using environmentally‑sensitive materials on subtidal structures (e.g., quarried rock, shell‑concrete, ECOncrete with added texture/holes/grooves/pits) sometimes altered community composition and increased richness/diversity, with mixed effects on macroalgal and invertebrate abundances across materials and locations that included Australian estuaries [3470].",

Species richness/diversity often increased with grooves and small ridges/ledges, though effects were mixed and context‑dependent; grooves frequently supported higher richness than adjacent small ridges/ledges [3474, 3464, 3473]. Large ledges, when added alongside grooves and small protrusions, increased combined macroalgae, microalgae and invertebrate diversity and abundance, and increased rockweed abundance; large ridges did not consistently raise richness [3465]. Invertebrate abundances showed mixed responses overall, with some increases for oysters and mussels in certain designs, but not for barnacles or mobile invertebrates in others; grooves often matched or exceeded small ledges for mobile invertebrates and oysters [3474, 3465, 3473, 3464]. Fish richness and abundance typically did not increase with grooves or small ledges, although responses varied by site; behavioral changes were observed, including more benthic interaction near small ledges and increased juvenile salmon feeding where large ledges and grooves were installed [3474, 3473, 3465].",

Creating textured surfaces (≤1 mm) on intertidal structures showed mixed effects on species richness, did not increase algal abundance in two studies, and produced mixed or increased barnacle and mobile invertebrate abundances, with different textures supporting different abundances [3466]. Creating groove habitats (1–50 mm) on subtidal structures, alongside holes, pits and environmentally-sensitive material, altered community composition, increased species diversity, supported species absent from control surfaces, and had mixed effects on algal, invertebrate and fish abundances [3448]. Creating pit habitats (1–50 mm) on subtidal structures, with holes, grooves and environmentally-sensitive material, altered community composition, increased species diversity, supported species absent from control surfaces, and had mixed effects on algal, invertebrate and fish abundances [3455]. Creating long flexible habitats (>50 mm) on intertidal structures altered community composition, and the flexible habitats supported macroalgae and invertebrates absent from surfaces without them [3460]. Creating short flexible habitats (1–50 mm) on intertidal structures altered community composition, reduced overall species richness at low tide, showed mixed effects on algal and invertebrate abundances and mobile invertebrate richness, did not increase fish richness or abundance, and did not increase fish biting rates [3459].",
