Sowing grass seeds showed mixed community outcomes: in one study communities in sown and unsown areas both trended toward intact grasslands over time, while another found sown areas remained different from ancient grasslands or natural regeneration sites (3397). Species richness effects are mixed over longer periods: sowing native grass and forb seeds frequently increased richness, but several studies found early increases that disappeared or reversed after 3–13 years, while one study reported higher richness after eight years; richness in sown areas was sometimes lower than in nearby intact grasslands (3432). For sowing grass seeds, several studies reported no change or reductions in overall richness, and richness was lower than intact prairies in one study (3397). Vegetation cover/abundance outcomes are also mixed: sowing native grass and forb seeds increased cover/biomass/density in some studies but often showed no change, with one study noting early gains that were not sustained at 10 years (3432); sowing grass seeds increased cover in some cases, but in other years or after seven years differences disappeared (3397). Using local seed sources increased plant species richness versus commercial mixes and increased vegetation cover over time relative to non-native seeds, though plant density declined; combining local sources with more species in the mix increased target species cover (3400). Increasing the number of species in a seed mix raised sown-species richness and sometimes target cover, though effects on overall richness and sown cover were mixed (3406). Higher seeding density did not increase similarity to a target community but increased grass and forb cover, with no change in overall sown-species cover (3405).",

(2) Using native grass and forb seed mixes increased overall plant species richness in many cases, as well as richness of characteristic grassland plants, sown species, and often the cover or density of grasses and forbs (3432). (3) Increasing the number of species in the seed mix increased the richness of sown plants and, when combined with local seed sources, increased the richness and cover of target plants; overall plant species richness did not always increase (3406). (4) Sourcing seeds locally increased plant species richness compared to commercial mixes and, when combined with higher species numbers, increased richness and cover of target plants; effects on vegetation cover and height varied among studies (3400). (5) Adding nurse species to the seed mix did not increase species richness and made community composition less similar to target communities in one study, though sowing under nurse plants (a related approach) increased germination and/or early survival in some cases (3402).",

Managing vegetation after introduction by mowing can raise richness: annual mowing after sowing increased plant species richness versus grazing, and higher mowing frequency increased richness of characteristic grassland species and sown-species richness in trials [3419]. Transferring plant material such as green hay from intact grassland alongside seeding/planting sometimes increased target plant species richness and cover, though some studies found no change [3426]. Adjusting the season/timing of mowing can influence richness; in a fen meadow, species richness increased more over two years in summer‑mown plots than in spring‑ or autumn‑mown plots [1771]. Reducing overall management intensity on permanent grasslands (e.g., altering combinations of grazing/mowing/fertilizer) has, in several European studies, benefited plants, though results were mixed across studies [69]. Broader evidence on restoring or maintaining species‑rich grassland identifies effective techniques including grazing, introducing plant species, hay spreading and mowing, with many studies reporting increased plant species richness or vegetation quality under such regimes [133, 702].",
