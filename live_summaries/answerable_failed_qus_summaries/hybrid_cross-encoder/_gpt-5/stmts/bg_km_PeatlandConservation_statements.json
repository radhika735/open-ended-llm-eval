The moss layer transfer technique in cutover Canadian bogs is supported by four studies showing restored areas developed bog‑characteristic plant communities over time; had greater moss/bryophyte (including Sphagnum) and herb (including cottongrass) cover but less shrub cover than unrestored areas after 4–8 years; became more similar to natural bogs; and had higher plant species richness than unrestored areas, with many sites showing bog‑characteristic communities within 11 years [1804]. Rewetting before or after planting has no direct evidence identified to date [1831]. Rewetting without planting is supported by 36 studies across bogs and fens, with mixed but often positive vegetation responses: shifts from drier grassland to more peatland‑characteristic communities in several countries; rewetted plots differing from drained plots; differences from natural peatlands; variable effects on peatland‑characteristic plants; Sphagnum cover often increased (though sometimes no effect), non‑Sphagnum moss/bryophyte cover often unchanged or reduced; herb groups frequently increased (sedges, cottongrass, some reeds/rushes); tree/shrub cover often reduced or unchanged (sometimes increased); overall vegetation cover and species richness showed mixed outcomes; and Sphagnum growth reached natural levels in forested fens in one study [1756]. Disturbing the peat surface (without planting) in fens is supported by two studies showing altered community development with increased cover of weedy seed‑bank species, divergence from undisturbed plots over time, colonization by wetland/fen‑characteristic species alongside other interventions, and lack of colonization by peat‑forming species [1811].",

Planting herbs showed survival for several species over 2–3 years and growth of planted individuals, but in one study planting herbs did not change moss, herb or shrub cover compared to natural colonization (1819).

Sowing herb seeds led to some germination, colonization by peatland- or wetland-characteristic plants in some sites, development of herb cover (sometimes greater than in unsown plots) but in one study similar herb cover to unsown plots, increased total vegetation cover in one study but no effect in others, and inconsistent or no effects on plant richness (1823). Adding vegetation fragments: Adding Sphagnum or other moss fragments typically resulted in presence of Sphagnum within 1–4 growing seasons and higher Sphagnum cover than in unsown plots in controlled comparisons, though cover ranged from negligible to high and in some studies survival/cover was very low unless mulched or otherwise protected; non-Sphagnum moss cover established in some cases but was often low without mulch, shade or lime (1821). Spreading mixed peatland vegetation fragments resulted in Sphagnum presence (often higher than in unsown plots) with cover ranging from <1% to >70%, presence of other mosses, appearance of vascular plants with higher cover than in unsown plots in one study but no effect on herb cover in another, and an increase in fen-characteristic species in one study (1822).

Introducing grazing: resulted in plant communities that differed from mown meadows; grazed fen meadows had fewer fen-characteristic species and fewer plant species overall than mown meadows; grazing increased cover of some herb groups (cottongrasses, sedges or all grass-like plants), reduced purple moor grass in one study but typically had no effect in another; cover of fen-characteristic mosses sometimes did not change, while Sphagnum cover was reduced in one study; shrub cover was reduced in one study but typically unaffected in another; and overall plant species richness increased after reinstating grazing in one study but typically showed no effect in another (1762). For invertebrates, fens managed by mowing had greater butterfly species richness than those managed by cattle grazing; recently cut fens had fewer large copper eggs than uncut fens, and large copper caterpillar survival was lower in recently cut fens and in fens cut in autumn or winter than in uncut fens (3950).",
