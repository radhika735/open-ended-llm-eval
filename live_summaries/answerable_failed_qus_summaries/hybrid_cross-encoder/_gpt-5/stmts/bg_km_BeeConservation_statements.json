Trials on North American declining species show mixed captive-rearing outcomes: B. vagans queens reared adults; B. terricola and B. rufocinctus queens reared adults in some attempts; B. fervidus queens laid eggs but larvae died before adulthood across three trials; similar larval mortality was reported for B. affinis (rusty-patched) and B. pensylvanicus; B. ruderatus was also successfully reared; and laboratory rearing was reported for the pocket-making B. atratus [50]. Captive-rearing performance is influenced by diet and husbandry: freshly frozen pollen increased queen size and subsequent colony performance versus dried frozen pollen, higher-protein pollen increased worker offspring production, an 8L:16D light regime shortened time to egg-laying, and specific hibernation regimes affected survival and colony formation (e.g., 4–5°C for 45 days enhanced egg-laying/colony formation but yielded smaller colonies; survival likelihood improved for queens >0.6 g and hibernated ≤4 months) [50]. For reintroduction of laboratory-reared colonies, seven replicated field trials report mixed success: in four trials (three UK, one Canada) colonies were monitored until new queens emerged or the founding queen died; two UK trials yielded very low or zero new queens per colony, whereas two other trials produced good numbers of new queens [52]. Social parasitism rates after release were variable: two replicated trials (Canada, UK) found high parasitism (25–66% and 79% respectively), and parasitism was reduced by placing colonies in landscapes with intermediate rather than very high floral resources and by releasing later in the season; five other trials reported no social parasites [52]. Supplementary feeding produced inconsistent benefits: one Canadian trial improved reproductive success without reducing parasite load, while a USA trial found no increase in productivity; a small Norwegian trial found released B. terrestris foraged mostly >100 m from nests [52].",

Complementary evidence shows solitary bee nest boxes were readily used in several countries, with 1–26% cavity occupancy where reported, increases in local population size or emerging red mason bees when boxes were provided, recommended placement 150–600 m from forage, and highest production in reed stems or wood materials [80].\n- Provide artificial nest sites for bumblebees: Multiple designs (surface wooden/brick/tile, underground tin/wood/terracotta, aerial/tree-attached) have been tested; underground, false underground, or aerial boxes are more readily occupied than wooden surface boxes; entirely buried boxes 5–10 cm deep with a 30–80 cm entrance pipe showed 6–58% occupancy; recent UK trials of surface boxes showed very low uptake (0–2.5%), while several earlier trials in the UK/USA/Canada reported 10–48% uptake; no evidence was found for effects on bumblebee populations [48]. Additional evidence notes very low uptake (≤2%) in two bumblebee nest box trials [80].\n- Introduce nest boxes stocked with solitary bees: No evidence was found for effects of this action on farmland wildlife [81].",

Patch-scale interventions have shown mixed evidence for broader population responses: one trial found planted lupine patches in apple orchards significantly enhanced the reproductive success of Osmia lignaria, while another found bee numbers and species richness in farmland 50–1,500 m away from planted patches were not higher; two trials reported no or relatively few solitary bees nesting on set-aside fields sown with phacelia or clover [17]. Field margins sown with agricultural nectar and pollen mixes, particularly perennial leguminous plants, attract significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated, grassy, or cropped margins, though their value may degrade over time and require re-sowing every few years [18]. At the wider landscape scale, one large replicated controlled trial found that the average abundance of long-tongued bumblebees on field margins was positively correlated with the number of ‘pollen and nectar’ agri-environment agreements within a 10 km grid square [21, 362]. Additionally, the attractiveness of planted perennial leguminous herbs to bumblebees increased in landscapes with a greater proportion of arable farming, indicating landscape context can influence patch-level outcomes [17].",
