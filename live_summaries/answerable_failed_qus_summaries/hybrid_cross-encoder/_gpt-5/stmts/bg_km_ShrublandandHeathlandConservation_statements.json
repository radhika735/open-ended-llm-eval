Adding topsoil alongside sowing increased grass biomass but reduced forb biomass compared to topsoil alone in a randomized, replicated, paired, controlled USA study (1857). Stripping/removing topsoil had mixed outcomes: two UK studies found no increase in heather or heathland species cover, one UK study found increased heather cover, another UK study found increased cover of both specialist and generalist plants without increasing species richness, one paired UK study found increased annual grass cover and decreased perennial grass cover, one UK study found turf removal reduced wavy hair grass cover, and a before-and-after UK trial found increased gorse and sheep’s sorrel cover and higher plant species numbers after stripping surface soil (1685). In heathlands restored by topsoil removal, butterfly species richness was lower than in the surrounding landscape, while abundance was higher where heather litter was spread compared to where it was not (3946).

      "relevant_summary": "Increasing livestock numbers: High livestock density was associated with declines in common heather cover in UK sites and lower dwarf shrub cover in grazed vs ungrazed areas in the Netherlands, though one Belgium study reported increased heather cover with grazing, cattle grazing in France increased non‑ericaceous shrubs but reduced ericaceous shrubs, a Netherlands study found more heather and cross‑leaved heath seedlings with higher livestock, and a USA trial found no change in shrub cover; overall, studies from the UK and Netherlands reported mixed effects on shrub and heather cover (ID: 1628). Species richness often increased in grazed areas in France, the Netherlands and Greece, but showed no change in Belgium and decreased in one Netherlands study (ID: 1628). Vegetation height decreased with higher livestock numbers in the Netherlands, and vegetation cover increased at one of five French sites but not at four others (ID: 1628). Grass responses included increased grass relative to heather with greater grazing intensity in a North‑Western Europe review; higher grass and sedge cover in high‑density or grazed sites in the Netherlands and France; reduced grass and herb cover in one USA trial; reduced grass height with more ponies in Spain; and mixed effects of increased cattle on grasses and herbs in the UK and Netherlands (ID: 1628).\n\nReducing numbers of large herbivores: Removing feral sheep, cattle, and horses increased shrub cover and reduced grass cover in the USA, and lowering red deer grazing increased the cover and height of common heather in the UK (ID: 1663).\n\nReducing livestock numbers: Reducing or stopping grazing increased shrub abundance or cover in UK and South African studies; UK site comparisons found heather cover declined with high density but increased with low density; ungrazed sites had higher dwarf shrub cover in the Netherlands; reducing grazing increased western gorse cover in Spain; two USA studies found stopping grazing did not increase shrub abundance; in France, ungrazed sites had higher ericaceous but lower non‑ericaceous shrub cover; and one UK study found mixed effects on shrub cover (ID: 1607). Reducing grazing increased vegetation height in one UK study but reduced heather height in another UK comparison (ID: 1607). Ungrazed sites had lower plant species numbers in France and the Netherlands, while reducing livestock increased plant cover and species numbers in Namibia/South Africa; other studies reported no change in species number in the UK, increased plant biomass in Israel, and no increase in plant cover on Gomera, Spain (ID: 1607). Grass and sedge cover were lower in ungrazed than grazed sites in France and the Netherlands; a USA study found mixed effects on grass cover; and a UK study found no change in rush or herb cover (ID: 1607).\n\nExcluding livestock with fences: Several UK and German studies found fenced areas had higher shrub cover/abundance, greater shrub biomass, and increased heather biomass and height, with higher heather presence/cover in Denmark and the UK; however, one USA comparison found decreased woody plant cover, and other USA/UK studies found mixed or no change in shrub cover (ID: 1545). One UK study found no change in plant species number but increased vegetation height and biomass, whereas another UK study found lower species richness inside fences (ID: 1545). Grass cover declined in some UK/USA studies, did not change in several USA/UK/Finland studies, and increased in two studies (USA and UK); herb/forb responses were generally unchanged or mixed (ID: 1545).",
