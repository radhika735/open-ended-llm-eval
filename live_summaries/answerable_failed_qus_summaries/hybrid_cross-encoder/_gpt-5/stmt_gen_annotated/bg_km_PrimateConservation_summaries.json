Regular anti-poaching patrols were associated with mixed outcomes: two studies in Rwanda reported gorilla population increases after patrols alongside other interventions; one study across Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, and Uganda reported gorilla population declines after patrols; a review in Uganda found no gorillas killed over 21 months when the number of guards increased alongside other interventions; and a study in Ghana reported reduced illegal primate hunting after patrols alongside other interventions (1471).

Additional community-oriented ideas with no direct evidence found in the documents include employing hunters in conservation roles (1484), providing alternative livelihoods such as fish- or domestic meat farms (1483), integrating religion/local taboos into conservation education (1574), and informing hunters about disease risks from wild primate meat (1480).",
