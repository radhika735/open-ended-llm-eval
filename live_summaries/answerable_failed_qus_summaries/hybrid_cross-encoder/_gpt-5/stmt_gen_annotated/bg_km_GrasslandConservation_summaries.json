Sowing seeds at higher density increased forb species richness, grass cover, forb cover, and the number of purple needlegrass seedlings in replicated USA studies, and increased cover of thickspike wheatgrass in one Canadian study, while one UK study found no increase in similarity to a target community and one USA study found no change in overall sown species cover; one USA site comparison found reduced native shrub cover [3405]. Sowing seeds in prepared gaps showed that larger gaps led to greater cover of sown target species than smaller gaps in a replicated study in Hungary [3409]. Across multiple regions, sowing grass seeds sometimes increased overall vegetation cover and increased abundance of sown species in one South African study, but often did not change or reduced overall species richness and could reduce native forb and shrub abundance in some North American studies [3397]. In freshwater wetlands, introducing seeds of non-woody plants sometimes increased plant diversity compared to unsown wetlands and increased prevalence of characteristic native species when densely sown mixtures were used, although overall vegetation cover was often similar to unsown plots and germination rates ranged from ≤1–61% with some failures under invasive plant presence [3264]. In shrublands, sowing seeds increased shrub cover in most studies and increased overall plant cover in one South African study; one USA study reported higher plant diversity when seeds were sown by hand than with a seed drill [1698].",

Sowing grass seeds showed mixed community outcomes: in one study communities in sown and unsown areas both trended toward intact grasslands over time, while another found sown areas remained different from ancient grasslands or natural regeneration sites (3397). Species richness effects are mixed over longer periods: sowing native grass and forb seeds frequently increased richness, but several studies found early increases that disappeared or reversed after 3–13 years, while one study reported higher richness after eight years; richness in sown areas was sometimes lower than in nearby intact grasslands (3432). For sowing grass seeds, several studies reported no change or reductions in overall richness, and richness was lower than intact prairies in one study (3397). Vegetation cover/abundance outcomes are also mixed: sowing native grass and forb seeds increased cover/biomass/density in some studies but often showed no change, with one study noting early gains that were not sustained at 10 years (3432); sowing grass seeds increased cover in some cases, but in other years or after seven years differences disappeared (3397). Using local seed sources increased plant species richness versus commercial mixes and increased vegetation cover over time relative to non-native seeds, though plant density declined; combining local sources with more species in the mix increased target species cover (3400). Increasing the number of species in a seed mix raised sown-species richness and sometimes target cover, though effects on overall richness and sown cover were mixed (3406). Higher seeding density did not increase similarity to a target community but increased grass and forb cover, with no change in overall sown-species cover (3405).",

(2) Using native grass and forb seed mixes increased overall plant species richness in many cases, as well as richness of characteristic grassland plants, sown species, and often the cover or density of grasses and forbs (3432). (3) Increasing the number of species in the seed mix increased the richness of sown plants and, when combined with local seed sources, increased the richness and cover of target plants; overall plant species richness did not always increase (3406). (4) Sourcing seeds locally increased plant species richness compared to commercial mixes and, when combined with higher species numbers, increased richness and cover of target plants; effects on vegetation cover and height varied among studies (3400). (5) Adding nurse species to the seed mix did not increase species richness and made community composition less similar to target communities in one study, though sowing under nurse plants (a related approach) increased germination and/or early survival in some cases (3402).",

After sowing native grasses and forbs, some studies found communities became more similar to intact grasslands over time, while one study found they became more similar to unsown areas over time [3432]. For overall richness, several studies reported initial increases in the first year that later converged with or fell below unsown areas after 3–13 years, whereas another study detected no change at one year but higher richness by eight years [3432]. For forb cover, one study found an increase after one year but no difference from unsown areas after 10 years [3432]. When using local-source seed, vegetation cover increased over time relative to non-native seeds, but the density of individual plants declined [3400].",

One study (USA/Germany) found that, relative to non-native seedings, local-source seedings led to higher vegetation cover over time but lower individual plant density, while another found no difference in vegetation cover compared with commercial grass seed [3400].

    "relevant_summary": "Planting grassland plants (e.g., plugs/seedlings) in addition to any seeding increased overall plant species richness and increased richness of grasses and forbs in multiple trials, and also increased the number of native species compared to seeding alone [3399]. Managing vegetation after introduction by mowing can raise richness: annual mowing after sowing increased plant species richness versus grazing, and higher mowing frequency increased richness of characteristic grassland species and sown-species richness in trials [3419]. Transferring plant material such as green hay from intact grassland alongside seeding/planting sometimes increased target plant species richness and cover, though some studies found no change [3426]. Adjusting the season/timing of mowing can influence richness; in a fen meadow, species richness increased more over two years in summer‑mown plots than in spring‑ or autumn‑mown plots [1771]. Reducing overall management intensity on permanent grasslands (e.g., altering combinations of grazing/mowing/fertilizer) has, in several European studies, benefited plants, though results were mixed across studies [69]. Broader evidence on restoring or maintaining species‑rich grassland identifies effective techniques including grazing, introducing plant species, hay spreading and mowing, with many studies reporting increased plant species richness or vegetation quality under such regimes [133, 702].",

Of these, 20 from Finland, Germany, Lithuania, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK (15 replicated of which eight controlled and three also randomized) found restoring species-rich grassland resulted in higher ground beetle abundance, increased plant species richness, farmland bird abundance, pollinating insect density and diversity and earthworm abundance than other types of grassland, or that restored grasslands had similar abundance and species richness of insects to old traditionally managed sites.\\nSeven studies from Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK (five replicated and controlled, two also randomized) found that efforts to restore species-rich grassland had no clear effect on the species richness or abundance of plants, beetles, or the abundance of butterflies and moths. Three replicated studies from Sweden and the UK (one also controlled and two site comparisons) found that restored grassland had a lower diversity and frequency of certain plant species, and attracted fewer foraging queen bumblebees than continuously grazed or unmanaged grasslands.\\nWe captured 40 studies (including 19 replicated and controlled studies of which six were also randomized, and six reviews) from nine European countries that found ten different techniques used alone or in combinations were effective for restoring species-rich grassland. Effective techniques included: grazing, introducing plant species, hay spreading and mowing.\\nWe found 22 studies from seven European countries that included information on the length of time taken to restore grassland communities (including 16 replicated trials of which nine also controlled and three reviews). Six studies saw positive signs of restoration in less than five years, 11 studies within 10 years and two studies found restoration took more than 10 years. Six studies found limited or slow changes in plant communities following restoration. Two studies from Germany and the UK (one replicated controlled trial) found differences in vegetation between restored and existing species-rich grasslands nine or 60 years after restoration.\"\n}"
