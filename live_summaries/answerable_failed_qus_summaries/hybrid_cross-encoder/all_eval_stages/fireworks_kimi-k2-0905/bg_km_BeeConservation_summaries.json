    "relevant_summary": "Artificial nest sites for solitary bees show much higher success rates and occupancy compared to bumblebee nest boxes. For solitary bees, 29 out of 30 replicated trials showed occupancy by bees, with many species readily using nest boxes including endangered species. Occupancy rates for solitary bee nest boxes ranged from 1-26% of available cavities, and studies demonstrated that nest provision could double the number of occupied nests over three years. In contrast, bumblebee nest boxes showed very low uptake rates of 2% or less in recent UK trials, with only 0-2.5% occupancy in three replicated trials since 1989. While some older trials (pre-1978) showed higher bumblebee occupancy rates of 10-48%, current evidence indicates underground nest boxes are most effective for bumblebees with 6-58% occupancy, whereas surface wooden boxes commonly marketed for gardens show very low success rates of 0-1.5%.",

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes. In one trial, these introduced species more commonly occupied the boxes than native bees.\\nA small trial tested three soil-filled nest boxes for the mining bee Andrena flavipes in the UK, but they were not occupied.\"\n}"

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes. In one trial, these introduced species more commonly occupied the boxes than native bees.\\nA small trial tested three soil-filled nest boxes for the mining bee Andrena flavipes in the UK, but they were not occupied.\"\n}"

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes. In one trial, these introduced species more commonly occupied the boxes than native bees.\\nA small trial tested three soil-filled nest boxes for the mining bee Andrena flavipes in the UK, but they were not occupied.\"\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "The evidence regarding large-scale habitat management such as forest replanting and habitat corridors on wild bee populations is limited and largely indirect. For forest replanting and native vegetation restoration (Action 3933), studies show mixed results for butterflies and moths - with five studies finding similar species richness or diversity of butterflies and flower-visiting insects in replanted areas compared to remnant forests, prairies, and naturally regenerating areas, but some studies also finding lower butterfly species richness and abundance in replanted areas compared to remnant native habitat. One large replicated controlled trial (Action 362) found that the average abundance of long-tongued bumblebees on field margins was positively correlated with the number of pollen and nectar agri-environment agreements in a 10 km grid square. For habitat restoration along watercourses (Action 1408), one replicated, paired site comparison found similar numbers of bees and bee species, but different bee communities, in restored and remnant sites, with bee visitation rates to native flowers not differing between restored and remnant sites. Studies examining habitat corridors (Actions 1580, 1730, 2576) provide very limited evidence for bees specifically, with no studies directly testing corridors for bee conservation. One study in Indonesia (Action 1730) found that a peat swamp forest corridor contained substantial tree density but did not assess bee populations. For increasing natural or semi-natural habitat in farmed landscapes (Action 6), no evidence was found demonstrating effects on bee diversity or abundance. Similarly, increasing landscape diversity of nectar and pollen plants (Action 21) has limited evidence showing positive correlation with long-tongued bumblebee abundance.",

For cavity-nesting solitary bees, artificial nest boxes have proven highly effective across multiple studies, with 29 out of 30 replicated trials showing occupancy by bees (action ID: 47). These include nest boxes made from cut hollow stems or tubes, blocks of wood drilled with holes, and wooden boxes. Optimal placement is within 150-600 m of foraging resources (action ID: 80), with reed stem and wooden grooved-board designs being most productive (action ID: 47). For ground-nesting bees, creating artificial patches of bare ground has shown success in colonization by ground-nesting solitary bees and wasps within the first or second year (action ID: 13). For bumblebees, underground nest boxes buried 5-10 cm below ground with 30-80 cm entrance pipes are most effective, achieving 6-58% occupancy rates, compared to wooden surface nest boxes which showed very low uptake (0-1.5%) in recent trials (action ID: 48). However, evidence for population-level effects of nest box provision on bumblebees is currently lacking (action ID: 48).",

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes. In one trial, these introduced species more commonly occupied the boxes than native bees.\\nA small trial tested three soil-filled nest boxes for the mining bee Andrena flavipes in the UK, but they were not occupied.\"\n}"

Planting dedicated floral resources on farmland has shown substantial benefits, with fourteen trials demonstrating wild bees foraging on perennial or annual sown flowering plants, particularly phacelia which attracted 8-35 bee species across studies. Hedgerow management significantly benefits wild bees, with five replicated studies finding more bee species in fields with hedgerows compared to those without, along with enhanced crop visitation rates by native bees in fields adjacent to planted hedgerows. Organic farming systems show mixed but potentially positive results, with three replicated trials demonstrating higher wild bee abundance under organic arable farming compared to conventional methods. Agri-environment schemes have demonstrated enhanced wild bee diversity and abundance in four replicated trials across Europe, including Swiss Ecological Compensation Areas, German organic farming options, Dutch meadow bird agreements, and Scottish Rural Stewardship schemes. Other beneficial practices include reducing tillage intensity, with one study finding three times more squash bees on no-till farms, and reducing meadow management intensity with two trials showing enhanced bee diversity on extensively managed meadows with delayed cutting and reduced agrochemical use. Providing set-aside areas has also been beneficial, with studies finding higher species richness on set-aside land compared to crops.",

Research shows that planting nectar flower mixtures/wildflower strips (actions 189, 3932, 442) can enhance bee foraging with studies finding 8-35 bee species using plots containing phacelia. Planting hedgerows (actions 1407, 2515) is effective, with five replicated studies finding more bee species in fields with hedgerows compared to fields without hedgerows. Leaving unharvested crop headlands (action 3924) can provide floral resources, with one study finding higher abundance and species richness of butterflies in unharvested alfalfa headlands compared to harvested crops. Planting dedicated floral resources (action 17) on farmland using perennial leguminous herbs including clovers has been shown to be particularly attractive to bumblebees, especially in landscapes with greater arable farming.

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes. In one trial, these introduced species more commonly occupied the boxes than native bees.\\nA small trial tested three soil-filled nest boxes for the mining bee Andrena flavipes in the UK, but they were not occupied.\"\n}"

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes.

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from multiple studies, several actions can be taken to create or enhance nesting sites for various bee species, beyond providing bare ground. The most consistently effective approach is providing artificial nest sites using specific materials and designs. Studies across 10 countries demonstrate that solitary bees readily occupy nest boxes made from cut hollow stems or tubes (23 replicated trials) and blocks of wood drilled with holes (11 replicated trials), with 29 out of 30 trials showing occupancy by bees, including endangered species. Reed stems and wooden grooved-board designs were found to be particularly productive, while plastic-lined holes and paper or plastic tubes had lower success due to parasitism and mold issues. For bumblebees, underground nest boxes proved most effective, with seven replicated trials showing 6-58% occupancy for boxes buried 5-10 cm underground with 30-80 cm entrance pipes, compared to very low uptake (0-2.5%) for surface wooden boxes commonly marketed for wildlife gardening. However, nest boxes for stingless bees showed no uptake in one Brazilian trial. Protecting existing nesting sites is also important - excluding ants from solitary bee nests increased offspring production, and using sticky barriers to exclude introduced European earwigs significantly increased native bee use of nest boxes. Nest boxes should be strategically placed within 150-600 m of foraging resources, as this represents the foraging range of medium to large European solitary bee species.",

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes.

The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes. In one trial, these introduced species more commonly occupied the boxes than native bees.\\nA small trial tested three soil-filled nest boxes for the mining bee Andrena flavipes in the UK, but they were not occupied.\"\n}"

Additionally, two replicated trials found that bumblebee populations were not enhanced on farmland managed under agri-environment schemes at the landscape scale.

One large replicated trial found positive correlation between long-tongued bumblebee abundance and the number of pollen/nectar agreements in 10 km grid squares, but other trials show that bee numbers and species richness are not significantly higher in farmland 50-1,500 m away from planted flower patches. Additionally, two replicated trials found that bumblebee populations were not enhanced on farmland managed under agri-environment schemes at the landscape scale.
