Adding below-ground organic matter through compost and manure applications increases soil organic matter content, with controlled trials showing positive effects from amendments with manures and agricultural composts (Action 911), as well as mixed organic and inorganic amendments (Action 902). Growing green manure crops increases soil organic carbon according to controlled studies (Action 908). Changing tillage practices to reduced tillage or no-tillage systems maintains or increases soil organic matter, with fifteen studies showing maintained or increased soil organic matter under reduced tillage (Action 906).

Changing tillage practices (Action 906) showed mixed results, with four of eleven studies finding more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. Excluding grazers from areas (Action 2309) was found to increase nematode diversity in one controlled study.

One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage.

Adding mulch to crops (action 887) increases soil stability and reduces soil erosion on clay soils. Planting or maintaining ground cover in orchards or vineyards (action 1367) reduces soil erosion on clay soils compared to bare or tilled soils. Changing tillage practices to reduced or no-tillage systems (action 906) shows mixed results but generally reduces soil loss on clay soils when crop cover is present. Planting grass buffer strips/margins around fields (action 3982) helps reduce soil erosion at field edges. Using crop rotation (action 857) that includes forage crops reduces rainwater runoff and soil loss. Reducing grazing intensity (action 901) helps control compaction and reduces sediment erosion on clay soils. Amending soil with organic materials like fresh plant material or crop remains (action 910) and adding mulch can improve soil structure and reduce erosion susceptibility.",

Fresh plant material and crop remains incorporation also improved yields, with a trial from the Philippines finding higher grain yields when crop remains were incorporated earlier in the season. Adding manures and agricultural composts proved effective with four controlled, replicated studies from India, Spain and Turkey finding higher crop yields when manures or compost were applied. Bacterial and fungal amendments also showed positive results with two randomized, replicated trials from India and Turkey finding higher crop yields. Formulated chemical compounds (fertilizers) showed yield increases in trials from India and the Philippines where maize, wheat and rice yields increased with increased fertilizer application. Soil amendments with composts not otherwise specified increased fruit yield in Italy.

Similarly, amending soil with manures and agricultural composts (Action 911) increased soil organic carbon in four studies while also increasing microbial biomass and diversity in multiple trials.\n\n**Crop residue retention** (Action 907) demonstrated positive effects for both outcomes, with higher soil organic carbon found in two randomized trials while also showing increased microbial biomass when crop residues were retained.\n\n**Cover cropping** (Action 898) proved effective with increased soil carbon levels found in studies while also resulting in more diverse nematode communities and greater microbial biomass under different cover crop systems.\n\n**Reduced or no-tillage systems** (Action 906) showed strong evidence for increasing soil organic carbon in twelve studies while four studies found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms, plus higher microbial diversity and activity.\n\n**Using mixed organic and inorganic amendments** (Action 902) provided dual benefits with four trials finding more organic carbon in soils while five controlled trials found higher microbial biomass and activity.\n\n**Crop rotation** (Action 857) increased soil organic carbon in four studies while also increasing microbial numbers and diversity of different soil animals in trials.\n\nThese actions consistently demonstrate positive outcomes for both soil organic carbon sequestration and biodiversity enhancement across multiple peer-reviewed studies worldwide.",

Adding mulch to crops, such as straw or municipal compost, can increase soil stability and reduce erosion, with studies from India, France, Nigeria and the UK showing increased soil stability and reduced runoff (action 887). Growing cover crops when fields are empty improves soil structure and nutrient retention, with three randomized studies from Denmark, Turkey and the UK finding improved soil structure and higher soil porosity (action 898). Changing tillage practices, such as switching from conventional tillage to no-tillage, can improve soil aggregation and stability, with seven replicated studies from Spain and the USA finding that untilled soils were more stable than tilled soils (actions 906, 1369). Using crop rotation, particularly including legumes and forage crops, can improve soil structure and increase water infiltration, with one replicated trial from Syria showing increased water infiltration when legumes were included in rotation (action 857). Retaining crop residues helps reduce soil erosion and improve water storage, with one review finding reduced water runoff, increased water storage and reduced soil erosion (action 907).",

Reducing grazing intensity allows compacted soils to recover - one study from Australia found that excluding sheep for 2.5 years enabled compacted soils to recover. Amending soil with organic processing wastes or composts can improve soil structure and reduce soil loss, as demonstrated by a controlled trial from Spain that found applying high rates of cotton gin compost and poultry manure improved soil structure. Amending soil with fresh plant material or crop remains, such as straw incorporation, was found to improve soil structure in a study from India, and also reduced soil loss in a study from Canada. Growing cover crops when fields are empty can improve soil structure and nutrient retention, with studies from Denmark, Turkey, and the UK finding higher soil porosity, interconnectivity, and lower resistance in soil under cover crops. Using brash mats during harvesting can help avoid soil compaction, though no direct evidence was available for this practice. Reducing tillage intensity, including using no tillage or reduced tillage instead of conventional tillage, can improve soil aggregation and stability, with multiple studies finding that soils without tillage were more stable than tilled soils.",

For biodiversity outcomes, seven of eleven studies found organic arable farms had greater species richness of butterflies, burnet moths and all moths than conventional farms, though some effects were context-dependent (occurring only in intensively managed landscapes, or in farms managed organically for <6 years but not 15-23 years) [Action ID: 3907]. Similar results were found for bat populations, with five of seven studies finding more bat species on organic farms, though five of nine studies found no difference in overall bat activity between organic and non-organic farms [Action ID: 961]. For wild bees, three studies showed higher abundance under organic farming while three found no difference [Action ID: 25].\n\nSoil and ecosystem benefits included higher soil carbon levels in organically managed orchards compared to conventional management [Action ID: 895], and four studies finding higher numbers, diversity or activity of soil organisms under organic management [Action ID: 895]. However, one study found lower soil nutrients in organically managed soils [Action ID: 895].\n\nKey drawbacks center on production and economics. Six studies measuring yields found mixed effects - one positive, one negative, one mixed, and three showing no or inconsistent effects [Action ID: 717]. One study found net profit increased only if produce received a premium, otherwise profit decreased [Action ID: 717]. Another found yields were lower in organically managed soils [Action ID: 895]. For organic fertilizers specifically, studies showed mixed effects on yields - some found higher yields with organic fertilizer, others found lower yields, and some found similar yields [Action ID: 1350].\n\nLow-input systems showed benefits including higher diversity of soil invertebrates and microorganisms in two studies [Action ID: 904], and stopping fertilizer inputs in grasslands increased plant species richness and invertebrate abundance in six studies [Action ID: 694].

Reduced tillage systems maintain or increase soil organic matter and improve soil structure compared to conventional ploughing (actions 906, 211, 3488, 1386, 2307). Growing cover crops when fields are empty improves soil structure and nutrient retention, with studies showing higher soil porosity, interconnectivity, and lower resistance (actions 898, 1345, 2304). Soil amendments using organic materials also enhance soil structure - incorporating fresh plant material or crop remains improves soil structure and creates larger soil aggregates (action 910), while amending soil with organic processing wastes or composts improves soil structure and reduces soil loss (action 891). Mixed organic and inorganic amendments are more effective at reducing soil cracks than fertilizers alone (action 902). These alternatives work by increasing soil organic carbon, enhancing microbial biomass, and creating better soil aggregation, which collectively improve soil structure without the need for conventional ploughing.",

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage.

Adding mulch to crops (action 887) has been shown in multiple studies to increase soil stability and reduce soil erosion and runoff, with five studies from India, France, Nigeria and the UK demonstrating these benefits. Mulches also increased soil moisture and improved yields in replicated trials. Reducing grazing intensity (action 901) was found to help soil recovery from compaction and reduce sediment erosion, with studies showing that excluding grazing animals increased soil carbon and nitrogen levels while reducing soil phosphate loss and sediment erosion. Planting grass buffer strips and margins around fields (action 246) can help reduce runoff and soil loss, with nineteen studies from Europe showing benefits for biodiversity while helping to filter runoff. Using alley cropping (action 903), which involves intercropping with trees, was found to increase soil fungal diversity. These practices work by protecting soil surfaces, improving soil structure, reducing runoff velocity, and increasing ground cover to prevent soil particles from being washed or blown away.",

However, manure application also documented drawbacks including higher nitrate leaching in some cases (911) and increased nutrient runoff with more dissolved organic carbon, nitrate, ammonium, phosphorus, and potassium being leached from soils (1378).\n\nMunicipal waste applications demonstrated benefits including greatly reduced soil loss and water runoff in semi-arid soils (890) and increased soil organic matter (1364). Drawbacks included mixed results in some applications (890), increased nitrate levels in soil (1364), and higher carbon dioxide emissions from soils with added sewage sludge compared to untreated soils (1364). Implementation variations showed digested sewage sludge resulted in more soil nitrate compared to composted or thermally dried forms (1364).",

Adding organic amendments is highly effective, including composts and organic processing wastes (action 891), fresh plant material or crop remains (action 910), and manures with agricultural composts (action 911), which improve soil structure, increase soil organic carbon, create larger soil aggregates, and enhance nutrient retention. Growing cover crops when fields are empty (action 898) improves soil structure by increasing soil porosity and interconnectivity while reducing compaction. Changing tillage practices (action 906) can reduce soil compaction, though results vary between studies. Adding mulch to crops (action 887) increases soil stability and reduces erosion. Amending soil with a mix of organic and inorganic amendments (action 902) effectively reduces crack size in dry clay soils. Growing green manures (action 908) increases soil organic carbon in clay loam soils. Adding gypsum to soil (action 1708) can improve soil conditions for planting.

Adding organic amendments is highly effective, including composts and organic processing wastes (action 891), fresh plant material or crop remains (action 910), and manures with agricultural composts (action 911), which improve soil structure, increase soil organic carbon, create larger soil aggregates, and enhance nutrient retention. Growing cover crops when fields are empty (action 898) improves soil structure by increasing soil porosity and interconnectivity while reducing compaction. Changing tillage practices (action 906) can reduce soil compaction, though results vary between studies. Adding mulch to crops (action 887) increases soil stability and reduces erosion. Amending soil with a mix of organic and inorganic amendments (action 902) effectively reduces crack size in dry clay soils. Growing green manures (action 908) increases soil organic carbon in clay loam soils. Adding gypsum to soil (action 1708) can improve soil conditions for planting.
