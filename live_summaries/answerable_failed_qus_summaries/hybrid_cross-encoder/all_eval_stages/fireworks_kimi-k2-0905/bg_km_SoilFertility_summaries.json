Converting to organic farming has been shown to increase soil carbon levels compared to conventional management (Action 895). Changing tillage practices, particularly adopting no-tillage or reduced tillage systems, results in higher soil organic carbon compared to conventionally tilled soils (Action 906). Amending soil with manures and agricultural composts increases soil organic carbon levels and improves soil organic matter content (Action 911). Using a mix of organic and inorganic amendments, particularly manure combined with inorganic fertilizers, increases organic carbon in soils (Action 902). Growing cover crops when fields are empty increases soil carbon levels, especially when legumes are included in the cover crop mix (Action 898). Amending soil with crops grown as green manures increases soil organic carbon (Action 908). Adding composts made from organic processing wastes improves soil structure and nutrient retention (Action 891). Amending soil with fresh plant material or crop remains, such as straw incorporation, results in higher carbon levels in soils (Action 910). Adding mulch to crops increases soil organic matter and improves soil structure (Action 887).",

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done.

These include adding mulch to crops, as five studies found mulches increase soil stability and reduce erosion and runoff on clay soils. Growing cover crops was shown to reduce soil loss and erosion in multiple studies. Changing tillage practices can reduce soil loss and runoff, with nine replicated trials demonstrating that reduced tillage systems performed better than conventional ploughing on clay soils. Using crop rotation that includes forage crops can reduce rainwater runoff and soil loss. Reducing grazing intensity or excluding grazers leads to less sediment erosion on clay soils. Planting new hedges was found to reduce soil erosion while maintaining or improving soil fertility. All these actions have been tested and shown effective on clay soil types specifically.",

Growing cover crops in arable fields (action 1357) and when fields are empty (action 898) significantly reduces nitrate leaching from soils, with multiple replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Spain and the USA demonstrating this effect. Changing the timing of ploughing (action 712) to delay until spring reduces nitrate leaching, as found in replicated site comparison studies from Denmark and Norway. Using organic fertilizers instead of inorganic ones (action 1381) can reduce nitrate loss, though results vary, with some studies from Italy and Spain showing reduced nitrate loss. Amending soil with formulated chemical compounds, specifically nitrification inhibitors (action 909), reduces nitrate losses and nitrous oxide emissions according to trials from New Zealand and the UK. Amending soil with manures and agricultural composts (action 911) showed mixed results, with some studies finding reduced nutrient loss and higher nitrogen levels while others found higher nitrate leaching. Changing tillage practices (action 906) can affect nitrate levels, with some studies showing less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil.",

Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done.

(3) Growing cover crops, which increased soil carbon levels and resulted in more diverse nematode communities and greater microbial biomass (action 898). (4) Using crop rotation, particularly when including legumes, which increased soil organic carbon and enhanced the number and diversity of soil microbes and animals (action 857). (5) Adding mulch to crops, which increased soil animal and fungal numbers, diversity, and activity while also increasing soil organic matter (action 887). (6) Amending soil with organic materials like manures and composts, which enhanced microbial biomass while increasing soil carbon levels in multiple controlled studies (action 911). These actions provide the most robust evidence for simultaneous benefits to both soil carbon sequestration and biodiversity enhancement.\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"895\",\n    \"906\",\n    \"898\",\n    \"857\",\n    \"887\",\n    \"911\"\n  ]\n}"
