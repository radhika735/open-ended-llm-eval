    "relevant_summary": "Several agricultural practices can effectively increase soil organic matter. Cover crops grown in arable fields when fields are empty consistently increase soil organic matter and carbon content, with studies from Mediterranean climates and the USA finding more organic carbon in soils with winter cover crops compared to soils without them (Action 1345, 898). Changing tillage practices, particularly using no-tillage or reduced tillage systems, increases soil organic carbon levels according to 12 studies from multiple countries including Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA (Action 906, 1355). Soil amendments with manures and agricultural composts increase soil organic carbon and organic matter levels, with studies from India, Japan and the UK finding higher carbon levels when manures were applied (Action 911). Retaining crop residues on fields increases soil organic carbon and nitrogen, with randomized controlled trials from Australia and China finding higher levels when residues were retained (Action 907). Converting to organic farming increases soil carbon levels, with replicated trials in Italy and the USA showing organically managed orchards had higher soil carbon compared to conventionally managed orchards (Action 895). Crop rotation systems, particularly when legumes are included, increase soil organic carbon and matter according to studies from Australia, Canada, and Denmark (Action 857). Adding fresh plant material or crop remains to soil increases soil organic carbon levels, with six studies from China, Denmark and India all finding higher carbon levels when plant material was added (Action 910). Adding mulch to crops increases soil organic matter, with studies showing mulch improved soil structure and increased soil organic matter (Action 887). Mixed organic and inorganic soil amendments increase soil organic carbon, with four controlled trials from China and India finding more organic carbon in soils with mixed fertilizers (Action 902). Amending soil with bacteria or fungi can increase soil organic matter content, with one controlled trial from Turkey finding increased soil organic matter under mycorrhizal-inoculated compost applications (Action 888). Alley cropping systems result in higher diversity of beneficial soil fungi that contribute to soil health (Action 903).",

Four studies found higher numbers, diversity, functional diversity or activity of soil organisms under organic management (Action 895).\n\nReducing fertilizer, pesticide or herbicide use generally is highly beneficial, with two site comparison studies finding higher diversity of soil invertebrates and microorganisms in low-input systems (Action 904).\n\nAdding mulch to crops significantly increases soil organism diversity. Three replicated trials showed that adding mulch increased soil animal and fungal numbers, diversity and activity (Action 887).\n\nGrowing cover crops when fields are empty enhances soil biodiversity. One controlled experiment found more diverse nematode communities, and one trial found greater microbial biomass under cover crops (Action 898).\n\nNo-tillage as the main cultivation method benefits soil fauna. Five studies found more microbial biomass in soils without tillage, and two studies found more earthworms in soils without tillage. One study found different communities of nematodes and mites in soils without tillage (Action 2306).\n\nReducing tillage practices generally supports soil organism diversity. Four studies found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage, and one trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms (Actions 906, 126).\n\nUsing crop rotations has mixed effects on soil organisms. One study found more microbial biomass and more fungi in soils with crop rotations, though results varied across different studies (Action 1368).",

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done.

Thirty-four studies (of which 21 were replicated and controlled and seven also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found some positive effects on earthworms, some invertebrates (other than earthworms), weeds or farmland birds, of reducing tillage compared to conventional management. Positive effects included increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms, greater abundance of some invertebrates other than earthworms, increased numbers of some weeds and/or weed species, higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying date and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields, and greater abundance of some birds - including Eurasian skylark, seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in late winter on non-inversion or conservation tillage. A review found tillage had negative effects on invertebrate numbers and no-till systems had more invertebrate bird food resources.\\nTwenty-six studies (of which 13 replicated and controlled and three also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found reducing tillage had either negative, no effect or no consistent effects on abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates (other than earthworms), earthworm abundance, biomass, or species richness, number of different plant species found as seeds, number of some weed species, mammal abundance, some bird species, and one study found bird preferences for conservation tillage fields decreased over time.

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, different types of organic soil amendments show various effects on soil properties and crop performance. Compost amendments increase soil organic matter levels, microbial biomass and fruit yield (action 889). Mixed organic and inorganic amendments result in higher microbial biomass and activity, increased microbial diversity, and more effective reduction of cracks in dry soil compared to inorganic fertilizers alone (action 902). These mixed amendments also increase soil organic carbon levels and nutrients, and can increase maize yield (action 902).\n\nManure amendments show varied effects on soil properties. They increase organic matter content in some studies while showing similar amounts in others, with mixed results for nitrogen content, increased phosphorus and potassium levels, and varied pH effects (action 1363). Manure reduces soil erosion, increases soil stability, but leads to higher greenhouse gas emissions including carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide (action 1363). When combined with agricultural composts, manures increase microbial biomass and respiration, reduce soil loss and water runoff, increase carbon levels and organic matter, improve soil physical properties including larger soil aggregations, and increase crop yields (action 911).\n\nMunicipal waste composts greatly reduce soil loss and water runoff in semi-arid soils, though show mixed results in other contexts (action 890). In wetland environments, large amounts of compost can alter plant community composition toward drier conditions, reduce plant species richness and diversity, but increase individual plant size such as birch saplings while maintaining similar overall vegetation biomass (action 3310). Charcoal additions to soil increase legume cover but do not alter overall plant biomass or grass cover (action 3422).",

Crop rotation including legumes reduces rainwater runoff and soil loss while increasing water infiltration (Action 857). Adding mulch to crops increases soil stability and reduces soil erosion and runoff, with some mulches being more effective than others (Action 887). Changing tillage practices through reduced tillage reduces soil loss and runoff compared to conventional ploughing, though mixed results occur and no-tillage can increase soil loss in the absence of crop cover (Action 906). Growing cover crops beneath main crops or between crop rows reduces erosion, with soil stability being highest under grass cover and cover crops reducing soil loss (Action 897). Controlled traffic and traffic timing reduces runoff and increases water filtration into the soil while reducing compaction (Action 899). Planting new hedges with grass or shrub hedgerows reduces soil erosion and improves soil organic matter levels (Action 744). Amending soil with fresh plant material or crop remains reduces soil loss, though effects vary depending on soil type (Action 910). Adding organic and inorganic soil amendments together is more effective at reducing cracks in dry soil than inorganic fertilizers alone (Action 902). Reducing grazing intensity decreases sediment erosion when grazing time in forage crops is reduced (Action 901). Cover crops grown in arable fields show less erosion compared to soils with fallows or bare soils and create more water-stable soil aggregates (Action 1345).",

Manures and agricultural composts showed positive results, with four controlled, replicated studies from India, Spain and Turkey finding higher crop yields when manures or compost were applied, and one study finding higher yields when manure was applied in combination with cover crops (Action 911). Green manures also proved effective, with two controlled, randomized, replicated studies from India and Pakistan finding increased grain yields when green manures were grown (Action 908). Fresh plant material and crop remains showed benefits in Asian contexts, with one trial from the Philippines finding higher grain yields when crop remains were incorporated earlier in the season, and one replicated trial finding higher barley yield when straw was incorporated (Action 910). The evidence indicates that these amendments also provide additional soil benefits including higher soil organic carbon levels, improved microbial biomass and activity, and better soil structure across various soil types including clay, clay loam, sandy-loam, silt clay loam, and silty-loam soils.",

Applying nitrification inhibitors to soil has been shown to reduce nitrate losses and nitrous oxide emissions (action 909). Using organic fertilizers instead of inorganic fertilizers can result in less nitrate loss compared to inorganic fertilizers in some comparisons (action 1381). Adding manures and agricultural composts to soil has been found to reduce nutrient loss and result in higher nitrogen levels (action 911), with farmyard manure showing lower nutrient loss when applied in winter rather than autumn. Growing cover crops beneath the main crop or between crop rows can help retain nutrients in the soil system (action 897). Winter cover crops in arable fields have been found to increase nitrogen in soils in some comparisons (action 1345), with legume cover crops showing more nitrogen retention than non-legumes. Retaining crop residues has been shown to increase soil organic carbon and nitrogen (action 907). Changing the timing of ploughing, specifically delaying until spring, has been found to reduce nitrate leaching (action 712). Reducing tillage practices can help improve nutrient retention, with no-tillage systems showing more nitrogen in soils compared to reduced tillage in some comparisons (actions 126, 1370).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, several practices are consistently beneficial for both increasing soil organic carbon and improving biodiversity. Converting to organic farming (action 895) shows higher numbers, diversity, functional diversity or activity of soil organisms and higher soil carbon levels compared to conventional management. Using crop rotation (action 857) increases soil organic carbon, particularly when legumes are included, while also increasing the number of microbes and diversity of soil animals. Growing cover crops when the field is empty (action 898) increases soil carbon levels and results in more diverse nematode communities and greater microbial biomass. Similarly, growing cover crops in arable fields (action 1345) increases organic matter in soils and improves microbial biomass, nematode populations, earthworm numbers, and beneficial fungi. Reduced tillage practices show consistent benefits, with changing tillage practices (action 906) resulting in higher soil organic carbon in no-tillage systems and increased numbers of microbes, earthworm species, and soil animals. Using reduced tillage in arable fields (action 1371) increases organic matter in soils and microbial biomass. Amending soil with mixed organic and inorganic amendments (action 902) increases organic carbon and leads to higher microbial biomass, activity, and diversity. Green manures (action 908) increase soil organic carbon. Agroforestry systems that retain or plant native trees and shrubs among crops (action 963) support diverse bat communities, though specific soil benefits are not detailed in the action document.",

Fresh plant material or crop remains can be incorporated, with one study from India finding improved soil structure when straw was incorporated, and studies showing increased microbial biomass and larger soil aggregates (Action 910). Non-chemical minerals and mineral wastes can be used as soil amendments, with studies from Australia and New Zealand showing reduced nutrient loss and erosion when these materials are added (Action 892). Changing tillage practices offers another approach - reduced tillage and no-tillage systems have been shown to increase soil organic carbon and improve soil structure compared to conventional tillage, with multiple studies finding higher organic carbon in soils under reduced tillage systems (Action 906). Mixed organic and inorganic amendments can be effective, with controlled trials from China and India finding that combinations of manure and inorganic fertilizers were more effective at reducing soil cracking than inorganic fertilizers alone (Action 902). Gypsum can be added to soils as a mineral amendment, though evidence is limited to specific applications (Action 1708). These methods specifically cover silty-clay soil types and provide alternatives to traditional compost applications for soil structure improvement.",

Amending soil with manures and agricultural composts (action 911) increases soil organic carbon levels and organic matter content, with studies finding higher carbon levels when manures were applied. Using crops grown as green manures (action 908) results in higher soil organic carbon. Amending soil using a mix of organic and inorganic amendments (action 902) leads to more organic carbon in soils, with four controlled trials finding more organic carbon in soils with mixed fertilizers and manure alone also increasing organic carbon. Changing tillage practices (action 906) significantly impacts soil organic matter, with twelve studies finding higher soil organic carbon in soils under no-tillage or reduced tillage systems compared to conventionally tilled soil, and eight studies finding maintained or increased soil organic matter under reduced tillage. Reducing tillage (action 126) provides similar benefits for soil organic matter retention. Retaining crop residues (action 907) increases soil organic carbon and nitrogen, with two randomized trials finding higher soil organic carbon when residues were retained. Incorporating plant remains into soil (action 728) also contributes to soil organic matter through the addition of organic materials.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from multiple studies, several actions are most beneficial for increasing the diversity of soil organisms. Reducing fertilizer, pesticide or herbicide use generally is highly effective, with studies from Italy and Pakistan finding higher diversity of soil invertebrates and microorganisms in low-input systems (Action 904). Converting to organic farming shows significant benefits, with four studies across Asia, Europe, and the USA finding higher numbers, diversity, functional diversity or activity of soil organisms under organic management (Action 895). \n\nTillage management practices are particularly important for soil organism diversity. No-tillage cultivation methods result in more microbial biomass, more earthworms, and different communities of nematodes and mites (Action 2306). Reduced tillage practices also increase microbial biomass and earthworms in multiple studies (Actions 2307, 906, 126). Using crop rotation, particularly when including legumes, increases the number of microbes and diversity of different soil animals according to four randomized, replicated trials from Canada, Portugal and Zambia (Action 857).\n\nCover crop management provides substantial benefits for soil organisms. Growing cover crops when fields are empty results in more diverse nematode communities and greater microbial biomass (Action 898). Cover crops or ground cover in perennial crops increase microbial biomass, symbiotic fungi, bacteria and nematodes (Action 2304). Adding mulch to crops increases soil animal and fungal numbers, diversity and activity in three replicated trials from Canada, Poland and Spain (Action 887).\n\nSoil amendments directly support soil organism diversity. Amending soil with bacteria or fungi results in higher microbial diversity (Action 888). Adding fresh plant material or crop remains increases microbial biomass (Action 910). Using a mix of organic and inorganic amendments leads to higher microbial biomass, activity and diversity according to multiple controlled trials (Action 902). Alley cropping results in higher diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Action 903). Excluding grazers from areas results in more nematodes and more diverse nematode communities (Action 2309).",

General composts applied at high rates increased soil organic matter levels, microbial biomass, and fruit yield (Action 889).

Green manures increased soil organic carbon and grain yields (Action 908). Fresh plant material and crop remains increased microbial biomass, improved soil structure, reduced soil loss with mixed effects depending on soil type, increased soil nitrogen levels and reduced nitrate leaching, consistently increased soil carbon levels and created larger soil aggregates, and improved crop yields (Action 910).

    "relevant_summary": "Besides retaining crop residues, several actions can effectively reduce soil erosion on agricultural land with clay soils. Changing tillage practices shows significant benefits, with reduced tillage reducing soil loss and runoff compared to conventional ploughing according to seven replicated trials (Action 906). Adding mulch to crops reduces soil erosion and runoff, with five studies from India, France, Nigeria and the UK finding that mulches increased soil stability and reduced soil erosion (Action 887). Growing cover crops beneath the main crop or between crop rows reduces erosion, with studies from France and the USA showing reduced soil loss under cover crops (Action 897). Crop rotation that includes legumes reduces rainwater runoff and soil loss and increases water infiltration into the soil (Action 857). Amending soil with fresh plant material or crop remains reduces soil loss, though effects can vary depending on soil type (Action 910). Amending soil using a mix of organic and inorganic amendments is more effective at reducing the size of cracks in dry soil than inorganic fertilizers alone (Action 902). Controlling traffic and timing shows that controlled traffic reduces runoff and increases water filtration into the soil (Action 899). Reducing grazing intensity reduces sediment erosion when grazing time in forage crops is reduced (Action 901). Planting new hedges reduces soil erosion and increases soil organic matter levels according to three replicated studies (Action 744). Providing un-harvested buffer strips can also contribute to soil protection on agricultural land (Action 161).",

Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done. One randomized, replicated study from Portugal found no effect of tillage treatment on yield.\\n\\u00a0\\nSOIL TYPES COVERED: anthrosol, calcareous silt loam, chalky, clay, clay loam, fine sandy loam, loam, loamy-clay, loam - sandy loam, loam \\u2013 silt-loam, loamy sand, loamy silt, non-chalky clay, sandy, sandy clay loam, sandy loam, sandy silt-loam, silt loam, silty, silty-clay, silty clay loam, silty loam.\"\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "Several actions can be taken to reduce nutrient loss, specifically nitrates, from agricultural soils based on the action documents:\n\nCover crops are highly effective for reducing nitrate losses. Growing cover crops when fields are empty improves soil structure and nutrient retention, with studies finding reduced nitrate leaching (Action 898). Four replicated, randomized, controlled studies found that less nitrate was leached from soils with winter cover crops compared to soils without them (Action 1357). Growing cover crops beneath main crops or between crop rows also helps retain nutrients (Action 897).\n\nChemical amendments can reduce nitrate losses. Three of five trials testing nitrification inhibitors found reduced nitrate losses and nitrous oxide emissions when applied to soil, although the method of application influenced effectiveness (Action 909).\n\nTiming management strategies are important. Delaying ploughing until spring reduces nitrate leaching compared to autumn ploughing (Action 712).\n\nOrganic amendments help with nutrient retention. Three randomized, replicated studies found reduced nutrient loss and higher nitrogen levels when farmyard or poultry manure was applied, with one study finding lower nutrient loss when farmyard manure was applied in winter rather than autumn (Action 911). Using organic rather than mineral fertilizers supports better nutrient management (Action 134).\n\nBuffer strips provide protection against nutrient runoff. Studies found less nitrate in runoff from irrigated pastures with buffer strips compared to those without (Action 1387). Buffer strips also increase nitrogen retention in soils (Action 1372) and reduce pesticide and nutrient runoff into waterways (Action 3894).\n\nReducing chemical inputs in grassland management helps prevent excess nutrient loss while maintaining soil health (Action 694).",

Converting to organic farming (action 895) shows four studies found higher numbers, diversity, functional diversity, or activity of soil organisms under organic management, while two replicated trials showed organically managed orchards had higher soil carbon levels. Changing tillage practices (action 906) demonstrates that all twelve studies found higher soil organic carbon in soils under no-tillage or reduced tillage systems, while eleven studies measured effects on soil biodiversity with four finding more microbes, more earthworm species, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. Using crop rotation (action 857) shows four studies found increased soil organic carbon under crop rotation, particularly when legumes were included, and four randomized replicated trials found that including legumes in crop rotations increased the number of microbes and diversity of soil animals. Growing cover crops (action 898) resulted in increased soil carbon levels according to one replicated study and one review, while one controlled randomized replicated experiment found more diverse nematode communities and one replicated trial found greater microbial biomass. Adding mulch to crops (action 887) shows three replicated trials found adding mulch increased soil animal and fungal numbers, diversity and activity, with one trial also showing increased soil organic matter. Amending soil with manures and agricultural composts (action 911) demonstrates three controlled replicated studies found higher microbial biomass when manure or compost was applied, while four studies found higher carbon levels when manures were applied. Retaining crop residues (action 907) shows one replicated study found higher microbial biomass when crop residues were retained, and two randomized replicated trials found higher soil organic carbon and nitrogen when residues were retained.",

    "relevant_summary": "Several alternatives to compost can improve soil structure in silty-clay soils. Tillage modifications are effective, including changing tillage practices to reduced or no-till systems (action 906), which improve soil structure and increase soil organic matter in silty-clay soils. No-tillage systems create more large aggregates and higher water-stability compared to reduced tillage (action 1370), while reduced tillage in arable fields increases organic matter and improves soil aggregation with higher water-stability compared to conventional tillage (action 1371). \n\nTraffic management through controlling traffic and timing (action 899) reduces compaction and increases soil porosity, with studies specifically showing benefits in silty-clay soils including reduced soil crack width and improved water filtration.\n\nSoil amendments offer additional options: mixing organic and inorganic amendments (action 902) is more effective at reducing cracks in dry soil than inorganic fertilizers alone, with studies showing benefits in silty-clay loam soils. Adding non-chemical minerals and mineral wastes (action 892) reduces nutrient loss and erosion. Adding gypsum to soil (action 1708) can improve soil conditions though limited evidence is available.\n\nCrop management practices also improve structure: growing cover crops when fields are empty (action 898) improves soil structure, increases porosity and interconnectivity, and reduces soil resistance, with specific benefits demonstrated in silty-clay soils. Adding fresh plant material or crop remains (action 910) improves soil structure when straw is incorporated, increases carbon levels, and creates larger soil aggregates, with benefits shown in silty-clay soils. Retaining crop residues (action 907) increases soil organic carbon and nitrogen and improves soil physical properties including aggregate size.",

    "relevant_summary": "Several organic soil management practices have been shown to be effective alternatives to chemical fertilizers for increasing crop yield. Organic fertilizers including manures and agricultural composts have demonstrated positive effects, with four controlled, replicated studies from India, Spain, and Turkey finding higher crop yields when manures or compost were applied (Action 911). Three replicated, controlled studies from Italy, Spain, and the USA found higher crop yields in plots with added compost compared to plots without added compost (Action 1346).\n\nGreen manures and crop residue management are also effective practices. Two controlled, randomized, replicated studies from India and Pakistan found increased grain yields when green manures were grown (Action 908). Retaining crop residues showed beneficial effects, with two randomized, replicated trials from Australia and China finding higher yields when residues were retained (Action 907). Incorporating fresh plant material or crop remains increased yields in trials from Denmark and the Philippines (Action 910).\n\nOrganic processing wastes and their composts have shown promise, with one trial finding increased barley yield when molasses were added (Action 891). The use of organic rather than mineral fertilizers generally supports higher plant diversity and improved soil biological activity (Action 134). Converting to organic farming showed mixed results for yields but demonstrated higher soil carbon levels and improved fruit quality and disease resistance in some cases (Action 895).\n\nMixed approaches combining organic and inorganic amendments have also proven effective, with two controlled, randomized, replicated trials from China finding increased maize yield in soils with mixed manure and inorganic fertilizer amendments (Action 902). Cover crops provide additional benefits by reducing nutrient leaching and improving water management (Action 1357).",

Changing tillage practices is effective, with studies showing that reduced tillage and no-tillage systems can reduce compaction (action 906). Five studies found that controlled traffic and reduced tillage led to reduced compaction and subsequent effects like reduced water runoff, and crop yields increased under no-tillage (action 906). No-tillage compared to reduced tillage showed more large aggregates in soils and higher water-stability in some comparisons (action 1370). Controlling traffic and traffic timing helps reduce compaction, with five trials finding less compaction, reduced runoff and increased water filtration into the soil under controlled traffic (action 899). Adding organic matter through incorporating fresh plant material or crop remains improves soil structure, with one study finding improved soil structure when straw was incorporated (action 910). Growing cover crops beneath the main crop or between crop rows reduces erosion and improves soil structure, with studies showing reduced erosion and highest soil stability under grass cover (action 897). Growing cover crops when fields are empty improves soil structure, with three studies finding that cover crops improved soil structure, including higher soil porosity, interconnectivity and lower resistance in soil (action 898). Using crop rotation also helps, with studies showing that including forage crops reduced rainwater runoff and soil loss, and including legumes increased water infiltration (action 857).",

Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done. One randomized, replicated study from Portugal found no effect of tillage treatment on yield.\\n\\u00a0\\nSOIL TYPES COVERED: anthrosol, calcareous silt loam, chalky, clay, clay loam, fine sandy loam, loam, loamy-clay, loam - sandy loam, loam \\u2013 silt-loam, loamy sand, loamy silt, non-chalky clay, sandy, sandy clay loam, sandy loam, sandy silt-loam, silt loam, silty, silty-clay, silty clay loam, silty loam.\"\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "Several alternatives to mulching can improve soil moisture and drought resilience on sandy soils. Retaining crop residues reduces water runoff, increases water storage and reduces soil erosion, with effectiveness demonstrated on sandy-loam soils (Action 907). Cover crops provide multiple benefits: growing cover crops when fields are empty improves soil structure and nutrient retention, increases soil carbon levels, and works on sandy clay and sandy-loam soils (Action 898). Living mulches or cover crops grown between crop rows reduce erosion and increase soil organic matter on sandy and sandy loam soils (Action 897). Soil amendments offer various options: manures and agricultural composts increase soil organic matter, improve soil physical properties, and reduce soil loss and water runoff, with effectiveness shown on sandy loam and sandy clay loam soils (Action 911). Organic processing wastes and their composts improve soil structure and reduce soil loss on sandy-clay and sandy loam soils (Action 891). Non-chemical minerals and mineral wastes reduce nutrient loss and erosion on sandy clay soils (Action 892). Bacterial and fungal amendments increase soil organic matter content and work on sandy-loam soils (Action 888). Changing tillage practices to no-tillage or reduced tillage systems increases soil organic carbon and organic matter content, with studies showing higher soil water content and improved water absorption on various soil types including sandy and sandy loam soils (Action 906). Chemical soil amendments with fertilizers increase soil organic matter and carbon, particularly effective on loamy sand and sandy loam soils (Action 909).",

One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done. One randomized, replicated study from Portugal found no effect of tillage treatment on yield.\\n\\u00a0\\nSOIL TYPES COVERED: anthrosol, calcareous silt loam, chalky, clay, clay loam, fine sandy loam, loam, loamy-clay, loam - sandy loam, loam \\u2013 silt-loam, loamy sand, loamy silt, non-chalky clay, sandy, sandy clay loam, sandy loam, sandy silt-loam, silt loam, silty, silty-clay, silty clay loam, silty loam.\"\n}"

Wild bee abundance was higher under organic arable farming in three replicated trials in Europe and Canada, with one study showing higher bee diversity in organically farmed wheat fields (Action 25). Higher overall bat activity was found on organic farms compared to non-organic farms in four studies across Europe, USA, Canada and Chile (Action 961). Reduced chemical inputs in grasslands resulted in increased plant species richness, reduced plant species loss rates, and attracted higher abundance or species richness of invertebrates in six studies from the Netherlands, Switzerland and UK (Action 694). Low-input systems showed higher diversity of soil invertebrates and microorganisms in studies from Italy and Pakistan (Action 904). Reducing chemical inputs benefited some invertebrates, plants, or farmland birds in 34 of 38 individual studies from across Europe (Action 139).\n\n**Drawbacks documented include:**\nYield and economic impacts showed mixed results, with six randomized controlled studies finding one positive effect, one negative effect, one mixed effect, and no consistent effects in three studies. Net profit increased only if produce received a premium, otherwise profit decreased (Action 717). Pest and disease management showed challenges, with only one of eight studies finding reduced pests or disease under organic farming, while two studies found more pests (Action 717). Weed management presented difficulties, with three randomized controlled studies finding more weeds in organically farmed fields (Action 717).

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, several alternatives to conventional ploughing in Europe can improve soil structure:\n\nNo-tillage systems show significant benefits for soil structure. Studies from Mediterranean countries including Italy, Spain, and Portugal found that no-tillage increased organic matter in soils compared to conventional tillage (Action 1369). No-tillage systems also led to more stable soil aggregates and reduced erosion, with seven studies from Spain and the USA finding that soils without tillage were more stable than tilled soils (Action 1369). Additionally, no-tillage systems increased earthworm populations, with two studies from the USA finding more earthworms in soils without tillage compared to soils with tillage (Action 1369).\n\nReduced tillage systems also provide soil structure improvements. A meta-analysis from multiple Mediterranean countries found more organic matter in soils with reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage (Action 1371). Studies from Italy, Spain, Syria, and the USA found more organic matter in soils with reduced tillage in some or all comparisons (Action 1371). Reduced tillage systems showed improved soil aggregation, with studies from Spain finding that soil aggregates had higher water-stability in plots with reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage (Action 1371).\n\nThe broader category of changing tillage practices demonstrates various benefits. Studies from Canada, Europe, Mexico, and the USA found that reduced tillage led to higher soil organic carbon compared to conventionally tilled soil (Action 906). Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA found that reduced tillage maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure (Action 906). Four trials found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage, and studies found more species of earthworms and higher microbe activity under reduced tillage compared to conventional systems (Action 906).\n\nThese tillage alternatives were tested across various European soil types including calcareous silt loam, chalky, clay, clay loam, fine sandy loam, loam, loamy-clay, sandy loam, silt loam, silty, and silty clay loam soils (Action 906).",

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage.

Amending soil with manures and agricultural composts also results in higher microbial biomass, as found in three controlled, replicated studies from the UK and USA (action 911). Reduced tillage practices show positive effects, with eleven replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Italy, Spain, and the USA finding more microbial biomass in soils with reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage in some comparisons (action 2307). Converting to organic farming increases numbers, diversity, functional diversity or activity of soil organisms, as demonstrated in four studies in Asia, Europe, and the USA (action 895). Growing cover crops when fields are empty increases microbial biomass, with one replicated trial from the USA finding greater microbial biomass under ryegrass compared to a ryegrass/vetch cover crop mix (action 898). Including legumes in crop rotation can increase microbial biomass, with one replicated, controlled study from Italy finding more microbial biomass in soils with crop rotations compared to continuous crops in some comparisons (action 2305). Additionally, four randomized, replicated trials from Canada, Portugal and Zambia found that including legumes in crop rotations increased the number of microbes (action 857). Reducing fertilizer, pesticide or herbicide use generally also benefits soil microorganisms, with two site comparison studies from Italy and Pakistan finding higher diversity of microorganisms in low-input systems (action 904).",

Cover crops grown beneath main crops or between crop rows have shown significant effectiveness, with studies from France and the USA demonstrating reduced erosion and soil loss, while also increasing soil stability (Action 897). Adding mulch to crops is another highly effective method, with five studies from India, France, Nigeria and the UK finding that mulches increased soil stability and reduced soil erosion and runoff (Action 887). Controlling traffic and traffic timing on agricultural land has been shown to reduce runoff and increase water filtration into the soil, with five trials from Europe and Australia demonstrating these benefits (Action 899). Ground cover in orchards and vineyards provides substantial erosion control, with six replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Chile, Italy, Spain, and the USA finding less erosion in soils with ground cover compared to bare or tilled soils (Action 1367). Reducing grazing intensity helps prevent soil erosion, with studies from New Zealand and Syria showing less sediment erosion when grazing time in forage crops was reduced (Action 901). Buffer strips planted along water courses also contribute to erosion control, with studies from the USA showing that grass buffer strips decreased sediment in runoff from irrigated fields and pastures (Action 1387).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the documented evidence, soil amendment with manures and municipal wastes on agricultural land shows several documented benefits and some drawbacks:\n\n**Benefits:**\nManure amendments provide multiple soil benefits including higher microbial biomass and respiration (action 911), increased soil organic matter and larger soil aggregations with positive effects on soil physical properties (action 911), and higher carbon levels (action 911). Manure applications also demonstrate reduced soil loss and water runoff when combined with other treatments (action 911), higher crop yields (action 911), and improved soil stability in some comparisons (action 1363). Municipal compost applications greatly reduce soil loss and water runoff in semi-arid soils (action 890). Manure additions increase nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium levels in soils compared to soils without manure (action 1363), and increase plant cover and number of plant species (action 1695). Cotton gin compost and poultry manure at high rates improve soil structure and reduce soil loss (action 891). Mixed manure and inorganic fertilizer amendments increase microbial biomass, activity, and diversity while providing more organic carbon and nutrients (action 902).\n\n**Drawbacks:**\nSeveral negative effects are documented including higher nitrate leaching with manure applications (action 911), increased nutrient loss when cotton gin compost and poultry manure are applied at high rates (action 891), and higher greenhouse gas emissions with manure additions including increased carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions (action 1363). Water quality impacts include more nitrate, ammonium, phosphorus, potassium, and organic matter leached from soils with added manure compared to soils without manure (action 1378). Municipal waste amendments showed mixed results in one trial (action 890).",

Adding organic processing wastes or their composts (Action 891) also improves soil structure, with one trial finding that applying high rates of cotton gin compost and poultry manure improved soil structure. Using a mix of organic and inorganic amendments (Action 902) was found to be more effective at reducing the size of cracks in dry soil than inorganic fertilizers alone.\n\n**Cover Crops and Crop Management**: Growing cover crops when the field is empty (Action 898) improves soil structure, with three randomized, replicated studies finding that growing cover crops improved soil structure, including higher soil porosity and interconnectivity and lower resistance. Using crop rotation (Action 857) that includes legumes increases water infiltration and improves soil structure. Retaining crop residues (Action 907) provides mixed effects on soil physical properties including penetration resistance and the size of soil aggregates.\n\n**Tillage Practices**: Changing tillage practices (Action 906) can improve soil structure, with two studies finding reduced compaction under controlled traffic, and one finding that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Using reduced tillage (Action 1371) results in soil aggregates having higher water-stability and more large aggregates in some comparisons. Using no tillage instead of reduced tillage (Action 1370) creates more large aggregates and higher water-stability in some comparisons.\n\n**Traffic Management**: Controlling traffic and traffic timing (Action 899) improves soil structure by creating a higher number of pores in the soil, less compaction, reduced runoff and increased water filtration into the soil.\n\nThese actions have been tested on various soil types including clay and clay-loam soils specifically.",
