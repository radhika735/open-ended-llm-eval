    "relevant_summary": "Multiple management techniques are available for controlling problematic grass species in shrubland habitats, with varying degrees of effectiveness. Chemical control methods include herbicide application (1643), which in four of five controlled studies reduced grass cover or non-native grass cover, though two studies in the UK found herbicide did not reduce grass cover. Herbicide can be combined with seeding shrubland plants (1644), where one of two studies found reduced non-native grass cover, though one study found no reduction in non-native grass cover. Mechanical control techniques include cutting/mowing (1638), which in two studies reduced grass cover but grass cover recovered over time in one study. Cutting can be combined with sowing shrubland seeds (1639), where one study found reduced grass cover. Other mechanical methods include rotovating (1648), though this did not alter grass presence in one study, and raking (1640), which reduced both invasive and native grass cover in one study. Prescribed burning (1723) is used to control grass, though one study found it did not reduce purple moor grass cover but did reduce common heather cover. Combination treatments include herbicide with prescribed burning (1725), which did not reduce purple moor grass cover, and cutting with prescribed burning (1724), which also did not reduce purple moor grass cover. Grazing management through livestock use (1646) had mixed effects, with one study finding increased wavy-hair grass cover and another finding reduced grass height. Livestock exclusion using fences (1545) showed variable results, with one study finding declined grass cover and one study finding increased grass cover. Additional techniques include adding mulch with seeding (1650), though this did not reduce grass cover, and allowing natural regeneration without active management (1679), where two studies found decreased grass cover or biomass after fire.",

Additional techniques include adding mulch with seeding (1650), though this did not reduce grass cover, and allowing natural regeneration without active management (1679), where two studies found decreased grass cover or biomass after fire.\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"1643\",\n    \"1644\",\n    \"1638\",\n    \"1639\",\n    \"1648\",\n    \"1640\",\n    \"1723\",\n    \"1725\",\n    \"1724\",\n    \"1646\",\n    \"1545\",\n    \"1650\",\n    \"1679\"\n  ]\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "Altering livestock grazing practices produces diverse effects on shrubland vegetation depending on the specific intervention. Changing the type of livestock leads to mixed effects on shrub cover, but in two studies it reduced the cover of herbaceous species (Action 1608). Grazing with both cattle and sheep, as opposed to grazing with sheep alone, reduced cover of purple moor grass but had no effect on four other plant species (Action 1608).\n\nIncreasing the number of livestock shows varied impacts on shrub communities. In the UK, high density livestock caused common heather cover to decline, while in the Netherlands dwarf shrub cover was lower in grazed versus ungrazed areas (Action 1628). However, one study in Belgium found that grazing increased heather cover, and areas grazed by cattle in France had higher cover of non-ericaceous shrubs but lower cover of ericaceous shrubs (Action 1628). Increasing livestock numbers resulted in increased common heather and cross-leaved heath seedlings in the Netherlands, but one US study found no alteration in shrub cover (Action 1628). A systematic review found that increased grazing intensity increased grass species cover relative to heather species (Action 1628).\n\nExcluding livestock from shrublands through fencing generally increases shrub cover and abundance, with studies showing increased shrub biomass and height of individual heather plants (Action 1545). However, one US study found decreased woody plant cover with fencing (Action 1545). Livestock exclusion typically decreases grass cover in some studies, though effects are mixed across different locations (Action 1545). \n\nIn degraded peatlands, excluding livestock shows variable effects: some studies found no effect on shrub cover, while others found increased shrub cover, with responses sometimes varying between species and sites (Action 1734). Livestock exclusion in peatlands increased total vegetation, shrub and bryophyte biomass but had no effect on grass-like herb biomass (Action 1734).",

    "relevant_summary": "Alternative management strategies for maintaining habitat openness and controlling succession in European shrublands include several mechanical and grazing approaches. Manual vegetation control involving mowing, chaining, and cutting can be used to remove midstorey and ground-level vegetation in shrublands (Action 337). Mechanical cutting has been shown to increase the number of plant species in some cases and can reduce tree cover (Action 1627). Livestock grazing represents another alternative, where increasing livestock numbers can influence shrub cover and vegetation structure, with studies showing mixed effects on heather cover and increases in grass species relative to heather species (Action 1628). Cutting and mowing can be used to mimic traditional grazing practices, with studies in North Western Europe, Italy, and Spain showing varied effects on heather abundance and grass cover (Action 1627). Heathland management through cutting has shown benefits for some butterfly species, with mechanical cutting demonstrating higher abundance of certain species compared to other management approaches (Action 3947). Rotovation represents another mechanical approach for controlling grass species, though studies found it did not significantly alter heather presence compared to mowing or cutting (Action 1648). Additionally, cutting combined with seeding of shrubland plants can help control grass while establishing desired shrub species (Action 1639). The reduction of large herbivore numbers has also been shown to increase shrub cover and reduce grass cover when grazing pressure needs to be decreased (Action 1663).",

Chemical control through herbicide application to trees has been shown to increase plant diversity and increase the abundance of common heather seedlings (Action 1629). Grazing can be employed to control trees, with research demonstrating it reduced cover of common heather and the basal area of trees (Action 1634). Mechanical cutting methods are also available, including cutting to control problematic large trees/shrubs, which has been shown to change plant community composition and increase species richness and cover of characteristic plants (Action 1772). Additionally, cutting large trees/shrubs can be used to maintain or restore disturbance, with studies showing it increased herb cover and biomass (Action 1761). Tree/crop removal specifically to restore shrubland structure is also practiced, though no studies have yet evaluated its effectiveness (Action 1683). For marsh environments, cutting can control problematic large trees/shrubs, with removal of more than 50% of invading trees shown to increase total cover of salt marsh vegetation (Action 3109).",

    "relevant_summary": "Several alternative methods can be used to mimic grazing disturbance effects for shrubland management. Mechanical cutting represents a primary alternative, as mechanical cutting of heathland has been found to provide similar or beneficial effects compared to burning (3947). Manually controlling or removing midstorey and ground-level vegetation through methods including mowing, chaining, and cutting in shrubland environments provides another approach (337). Prescribed fire is used to maintain or restore disturbance in grasslands and other open habitats, with studies showing varied effects on different species depending on timing and site characteristics (3882). Land under power lines can be managed through mechanical cutting, which has been shown to increase butterfly species richness compared to unmanaged land, with effects varying by time since management (3855). Combined approaches such as cutting and prescribed burning have also been employed to control grass vegetation (1724). Tree and shrub removal to recreate open areas represents another method for creating disturbance effects (2483). Management timing appears important, with butterfly species richness being highest 2-4 years after scrub and trees were cleared under power lines (3855).",

For bracken control, herbicide application has been found to increase heather seedlings and heather biomass in UK studies (Action 1652). One study found that herbicide increased the number of plant species in heathland sites, though another study found no effect on species richness or diversity (Action 1652). Herbicide treatment for bracken control increased cover of wavy hair-grass, sheep's fescue, gorse, and abundance of common cow-wheat (Action 1652). Studies consistently showed that herbicide application reduced bracken biomass or cover, though one study found no change in bracken abundance (Action 1652). However, herbicide use also increased silver birch seedlings, which may be undesirable in some shrubland management contexts (Action 1652). For grass control, herbicide combined with seed sowing increased shrub seedlings and the number of native plant species in USA studies, with mixed results on native plant cover (Action 1644). One study found herbicide and weeding increased native grass and forb cover while reducing non-native grass cover (Action 1645). However, some negative effects were documented: one study found that burning and herbicide application to reduce purple moor grass actually reduced common heather cover without reducing the target grass (Action 1725). When herbicide was combined with cutting for bracken control, results were mixed, with some studies showing increased heather cover and plant species richness, while others showed no significant effects on plant species cover (Action 1654).",

Herbicide treatment for bracken control increased cover of wavy hair-grass, sheep's fescue, gorse, and abundance of common cow-wheat (Action 1652). Studies consistently showed that herbicide application reduced bracken biomass or cover, though one study found no change in bracken abundance (Action 1652). However, herbicide use also increased silver birch seedlings, which may be undesirable in some shrubland management contexts (Action 1652). For grass control, herbicide combined with seed sowing increased shrub seedlings and the number of native plant species in USA studies, with mixed results on native plant cover (Action 1644).

For vegetation control applications, prescribed burning to control trees reduced cover of common heather and increased cover of purple moor grass (Action 1721), while burning to control grass did not reduce purple moor grass cover but did reduce common heather cover (Action 1723). Prescribed burning initially reduced vegetation height, but this recovered over time (Action 1723). For pollutant reduction purposes, prescribed burning to reduce nitrogen deposition impacts did not alter shoot length of common heather or number of purple moor grass seedlings compared to mowing (Action 1670). For reptile populations in grassland and shrubland environments, prescribed burning showed mixed results - some studies found similar reptile species richness and abundance between burned and unburned areas, while others found different species composition immediately after burning that remained different in some grass types even after vegetation regrowth (Action 3651). Areas burned 1-4 years earlier had lower reptile species richness and abundance than areas burned 11-15 years earlier (Action 3651).

    "relevant_summary": "Several non-herbicide management options exist for controlling grass in shrublands, with varying levels of effectiveness:\n\n**Cutting/Mowing**: Studies show that mowing can reduce grass cover, though effectiveness varies. One controlled study in the UK found that mowing increased the number of heathland plants in one of two sites and increased the presence of a small minority of heathland plants (Action 1638). Two randomized controlled studies in the USA found that mowing reduced grass cover, but in one study grass cover recovered over time (Action 1638). However, three replicated controlled studies found that cutting to control grass did not alter cover of common heather or shrub seedling abundance (Action 1638).\n\n**Cutting/Mowing Combined with Seeding**: When cutting is combined with sowing shrubland plant seeds, one randomized controlled study in the USA found that this approach increased shrub seedling abundance and reduced grass cover (Action 1639). However, another study found that the biomass of sagebrush plants in areas where grass was cut and seeds sown did not differ from areas where grass was not cut but seeds were sown (Action 1639).\n\n**Mechanical Soil Disturbance**: Rotovating (mechanical cultivation) showed limited effectiveness, with one study finding it did not alter the presence of heather or wavy hair grass compared to mowing or cutting (Action 1648). When combined with mowing, one controlled study found that mowing followed by rotovating increased the number of heathland plant species in one of two sites (Action 1641).\n\n**Turf Stripping**: Cutting and removing turf showed promise in one controlled study in the UK, which found it increased the number of heathland plants and increased the presence of heathland plants while decreasing the presence of non-heathland plants (Action 1647).\n\n**Prescribed Burning**: Prescribed burning alone showed mixed results for grass control. One replicated controlled study found that prescribed burning to reduce purple moor grass cover did not reduce its cover but did reduce the cover of common heather (Action 1723). When combined with cutting, burning and cutting reduced cover of common heather but did not reduce cover of purple moor grass (Action 1724).\n\n**Grazing**: One replicated controlled study in the Netherlands found that grazing to reduce grass cover had mixed effects on cover of common heather and cross-leaved heath, while cover of wavy-hair grass increased (Action 1646). One before-and-after study in Spain found a reduction in grass height with grazing (Action 1646).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on studies across various European countries and the USA, increasing livestock numbers in shrublands produces mixed outcomes with both positive and negative effects on vegetation and biodiversity.\n\nPositive outcomes include: Increased plant species diversity in grazed areas compared to ungrazed areas was found in studies from France, the Netherlands and Greece (Action 1628). Livestock grazing can effectively control unwanted vegetation, with studies showing reduced tree cover and basal area when grazing is used to control trees (Actions 1634, 1722). Grazing increased the number of common heather and cross-leaved heath seedlings in the Netherlands (Action 1628). One study in Belgium found that grazing increased cover of heather (Action 1628). Areas grazed by cattle had higher cover of non-ericaceous shrubs in France (Action 1628). Increased grazing intensity led to increased cover of grass species relative to heather species in North Western Europe (Action 1628).\n\nNegative outcomes include: Cover of common heather declined in sites with high livestock density in UK studies (Action 1628). Dwarf shrub cover was lower in grazed areas than ungrazed areas in the Netherlands (Action 1628). Grazing reduced the cover of common heather when used to control trees in Italy (Actions 1634, 1722). High livestock density areas had lower cover of ericaceous shrubs in France (Action 1628). Increased grazing resulted in decreased vegetation height in the Netherlands (Action 1628). One study in the Netherlands found a decrease in the number of plant species following livestock increases (Action 1628). Removal of livestock (feral sheep, cattle and horses) led to increased shrub cover and reduced grass cover in the USA, suggesting negative effects of their presence (Action 1663). Reducing grazing pressure by red deer increased the cover and height of common heather in the UK (Action 1663).\n\nThe effects appear to vary significantly by location, livestock type, grazing intensity, and target vegetation, with some studies showing no significant effects or mixed results across different sites within the same study (Actions 1628, 1608, 1646).",
