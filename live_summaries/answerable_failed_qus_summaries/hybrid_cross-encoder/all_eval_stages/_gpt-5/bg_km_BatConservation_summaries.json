One study in the USA\\u00a0found that bats used both resin and wood cylindrical bat boxes, but another study in the USA\\u00a0found that resin bat boxes became occupied more quickly than wood boxes. One study in the UK\\u00a0found higher occupancy rates in concrete than wooden bat boxes. One study in the USA\\u00a0found that Indiana bats used rocket boxes more than wooden bat boxes or bark-mimic roosts. One study in Spain\\u00a0found that more bats occupied bat boxes that had two compartments than one compartment in the breeding season. One study in Lithuania\\u00a0found that bat breeding colonies occupied standard and four/five chamber bat boxes and individuals occupied flat bat boxes. Four studies in the USA, UK, Spain\\u00a0and Australia\\u00a0found bats selecting four of nine, three of five, three of four and one of five bat box designs. One study in the UK\\u00a0found that different bat box designs were used by different species. One study in Costa Rica\\u00a0found that bat boxes simulating tree trunks were used by 100% of bats and in group sizes similar to natural roosts.\\nBat box position (11 studies): Three studies in Germany, Spain\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0found that bat box orientation and/or the amount of exposure to sunlight affected bat occupancy, and one study in Spain\\u00a0found that orientation did not have a significant effect on occupancy. Two studies in the UK\\u00a0and Italy\\u00a0found that bat box height affected occupancy, and two studies in Spain\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0found no effect of height. Two studies in the USA\\u00a0and Spain\\u00a0found higher occupancy of bat boxes on buildings than on trees. One study in Australia\\u00a0found that bat boxes were occupied more often in farm forestry sites than in native forest, one study in Poland\\u00a0found higher occupancy in pine relative to mixed deciduous stands, and one study in Costa Rica\\u00a0found higher occupancy in forest fragments than in pasture. One study in the USA\\u00a0found higher occupancy rates in areas where bats were known to roost prior to installing bat boxes.

Two studies in the USA found that managing livestock water troughs as drinking resources increased bat use: removing livestock modifications increased drinking frequency and reduced the number of approaches before successful drinking, and larger, full tanks with sparse surrounding vegetation had more bats drinking than smaller, half-full tanks with no or dense surrounding vegetation [1951].

The other two studies in the USA\\u00a0and UK\\u00a0found that bats displaced from buildings did not use any of 43 bat houses of four different designs\\u00a0or 12 heated bat boxes of one design. One review\\u00a0of 109 studies across Europe, North America and Asia found that 72 bat species used bat boxes, although only 18 species commonly used them, and 31 species used them as maternity roosts. Twenty-two studies (including 17 replicated studies, one before-and-after study and two reviews)\\u00a0found bats occupying less than half of bat boxes provided (0\\u201349%). Nine replicated studies\\u00a0found bats occupying more than half of bat boxes provided (54\\u2013100%).\\n\\nOTHER (23 STUDIES)\\n\\nBat box design (16 studies): Three studies in Germany, Portugal\\u00a0and Australia\\u00a0found that bats used black bat boxes more than grey, white\\u00a0or wooden\\u00a0boxes. One of two studies in Spain\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0found higher occupancy rates in larger bat boxes. One study in the USA\\u00a0found that bats used both resin and wood cylindrical bat boxes, but another study in the USA\\u00a0found that resin bat boxes became occupied more quickly than wood boxes. One study in the UK\\u00a0found higher occupancy rates in concrete than wooden bat boxes. One study in the USA\\u00a0found that Indiana bats used rocket boxes more than wooden bat boxes or bark-mimic roosts. One study in Spain\\u00a0found that more bats occupied bat boxes that had two compartments than one compartment in the breeding season. One study in Lithuania\\u00a0found that bat breeding colonies occupied standard and four/five chamber bat boxes and individuals occupied flat bat boxes. Four studies in the USA, UK, Spain\\u00a0and Australia\\u00a0found bats selecting four of nine, three of five, three of four and one of five bat box designs. One study in the UK\\u00a0found that different bat box designs were used by different species. One study in Costa Rica\\u00a0found that bat boxes simulating tree trunks were used by 100% of bats and in group sizes similar to natural roosts.\\nBat box position (11 studies): Three studies in Germany, Spain\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0found that bat box orientation and/or the amount of exposure to sunlight affected bat occupancy, and one study in Spain\\u00a0found that orientation did not have a significant effect on occupancy. Two studies in the UK\\u00a0and Italy\\u00a0found that bat box height affected occupancy, and two studies in Spain\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0found no effect of height. Two studies in the USA\\u00a0and Spain\\u00a0found higher occupancy of bat boxes on buildings than on trees. One study in Australia\\u00a0found that bat boxes were occupied more often in farm forestry sites than in native forest, one study in Poland\\u00a0found higher occupancy in pine relative to mixed deciduous stands, and one study in Costa Rica\\u00a0found higher occupancy in forest fragments than in pasture. One study in the USA\\u00a0found higher occupancy rates in areas where bats were known to roost prior to installing bat boxes. One review in the UK\\u00a0found that bat boxes were more likely to be occupied when a greater number of bat boxes were installed across a site.\"\n}"

Installing and maintaining gates at mine entrances to restrict public access; nine studies (USA, Australia) report mixed outcomes, including fewer bat species entering after gating, fewer bats in some mines or at entrances after gating, stable or increased bat activity at five of seven gated mines with decreases at two, continued use of 43 of 47 mines 12 years post-gating with abandonment of four mines with \u2018ladder\u2019 gates, varied effects of gate design and time since installation on presence of four species, more circling at entrances and reduced entry after gating, and up to 7% of bats colliding with gates [1963]. Maintaining microclimate in closed/abandoned mines; one before-and-after study found that closing a man-made entrance to modify microclimate increased the number of hibernating bats in the mine [1964]. Relocating bats from reclaimed mines to alternative subterranean roosts; no studies have evaluated effects [975]. Restoring bat foraging habitat at ex-quarry sites; one replicated, site-comparison study found higher overall bat activity 10 years after restoration than before/during quarrying [2286].",
