    "relevant_summary": "Thirty-nine studies from eight European countries have examined the effects of creating uncultivated margins around intensive arable or pasture fields [63]. Nineteen of these studies found that uncultivated margins support more invertebrates, including bees, and/or higher plant diversity or species richness compared to conventionally managed field margins [63]. One study also showed that uncultivated margins supported more species of small mammals than meadows and farmed grasslands [63]. Additionally, four studies reported positive associations between birds and field margins, including the provision of food [63]. A UK review also found that grass margins, including those that regenerated naturally, were beneficial for plants and some invertebrates [63]. However, fifteen studies found that the species richness or abundance of invertebrates and/or plants was lower in margins that regenerated naturally compared to conventionally managed fields or sown margins [63]. Five studies from Ireland and the UK also reported that the species richness of plants and the numbers of invertebrates in naturally regenerated margins declined over time [63]. Furthermore, seven studies noted an increased abundance or biomass of weed species in naturally regenerated margins [63]. In contrast, one study in the UK on retaining unmown field margins found that the activity of pipistrelle bats did not differ between these margins and those on conventional farms [1940].\n\nIn relation to field size, five studies have looked at the impact of reducing field size on butterflies and moths [3974]. Four of these studies found that farms and landscapes with smaller fields had a higher abundance of butterflies and burnet moths than areas with larger fields [3974]. Two of these studies also found a higher species richness of butterflies and burnet moths in areas with smaller fields, while two other studies found a similar species richness [3974]. One study in Germany observed an increase in the species richness of butterflies and burnet moths after field size was reduced by increasing the length of field edges on a farm, along with increasing the area of meadows and field margins [3974].",

    "relevant_summary": "Several studies have examined the effects of different mowing strategies on farmland wildlife.\n\nRegarding mowing techniques, one trial found that mowing from the center of the field outwards allowed 68% of corncrake chicks to escape, compared to 45% with conventional inward mowing (698). The use of bar mowers and double chop mowers was found to cause less damage to amphibians and invertebrates than other machinery types (698). Conversely, rotary disc mowers with conditioners killed twice as many small mammals as double blade mowers (698). Using a mechanical processor or conditioner was also found to kill or injure more invertebrates (698). However, one study found that mower-conditioners led to higher Eurasian skylark nest survival compared to using a tedder (698). Additionally, skylark chick survival was four times higher with wider mowing machinery (698). Wildlife-friendly mowing techniques have been associated with lower mortality for corncrakes and Eurasian skylarks (192), and a scheme promoting such techniques coincided with a large increase in the UK corncrake population (192).\n\nIn terms of mowing height, a UK review and a study found that raised mowing heights benefited Eurasian skylarks with increased productivity and were less damaging to amphibians and invertebrates (138). However, a randomized, replicated, controlled trial in the UK found that raising mowing height did not attract more foraging birds (222, 138) or affect the number of invertebrates (138). Furthermore, one study noted that northern lapwing and common starling chicks foraged more successfully in shorter grass (138). Another UK review suggested that while raising mowing height might increase skylark productivity, it was not sufficient to maintain the local population (222).\n\nDelaying the date of mowing has also been studied. Eight studies found that delaying mowing or grazing resulted in benefits such as higher plant species richness, more insect species, greater abundance of some spiders and ground beetles, and increased breeding densities of wading birds and Eurasian skylark productivity (131). The introduction of measures including delayed mowing dates coincided with an increase in the UK corncrake population (131). However, six other studies found that delaying mowing had no clear effect on plant species richness, ground beetle communities, the abundance of some insects and spiders, or the population trends of wading bird species (131).",
