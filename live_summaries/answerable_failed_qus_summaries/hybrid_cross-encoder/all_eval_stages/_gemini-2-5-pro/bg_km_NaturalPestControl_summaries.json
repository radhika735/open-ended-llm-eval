A study in the USA found that broadcasting American crow distress calls led to reduced damage in almond orchards (199). In Pakistan, a study showed that hanging reflector ribbons above crops resulted in a lower abundance of four pest species (199). Restoring habitats along watercourses is another approach, although one study in the USA observed an increase in weeds in orchards adjacent to restored riparian habitats (1402). The management style of the orchard also plays a role. For instance, a study in the USA revealed a greater species richness and diversity of leaf-eating arthropods in unmanaged and partially managed orchards compared to commercially managed ones (3917). Conversely, a German study noted a lower abundance of butterflies and burnet moths in managed orchards compared to abandoned ones (3917). Additionally, a German study found that mown orchards had higher plant species richness than grazed or abandoned ones, but there were no differences in the numbers of bee and wasp species or brood cells (703). Traditional orchards in Swiss Ecological Compensation Areas showed little benefit for birds, and in the UK, the presence of orchards was negatively related to the focal bird species (240). No studies were found on the impact of restoring abandoned orchards for bats on bat populations (2285).",

Two studies found small or slow movements of predators from banks to crops. One study found greater beetle activity in fields but this did not improve pest predation. Natural enemies on banks: Four studies and a review found more invertebrate predators on beetle banks than in surrounding crops, but one of these found that effects varied with time.\\u00a0Eight studies from the UK and USA (including two randomised, replicated, controlled trials and two reviews) compared numbers of predatory invertebrates on beetle banks with other refuge habitats.\\u00a0Two studies found more natural enemies on beetle banks, but one of these found only seasonal effects. One review found similar or higher numbers of predators on beetle banks and four studies found similar or lower numbers. Pests: A replicated, randomised study and a review found the largest pest reductions in areas closest to a beetle bank or on the beetle bank itself. One review found fewer pests in fields with than without a beetle bank. Economics: One replicated, randomised, controlled trial and a review showed that beetle banks could make economic savings if they prevented pests from reaching a spray threshold or causing 5% yield loss. Beetle bank design: Two studies from the UK found certain grass species held higher numbers of predatory invertebrates than others.\\nCrops studied were barley, field bean, maize, oats, pea, radish, rapeseed, soybean, wheat and pasture.\"\n}"

One approach is to modify the habitat to support natural pest control. For instance, planting hedgerows can increase the number of natural enemies and the parasitism of pest eggs, leading to fewer pests (1401). Similarly, planting flower strips has been found to enhance pest reduction and attract more natural enemies (1400). Another strategy involves soil management, such as adding compost, which can reduce crop diseases and plant mortality in some instances (1392). The use of organic fertilizer has shown mixed results, with one study finding an increase in aphid numbers and another finding no significant difference (1393). Direct manipulation of beneficial and harmful insect populations is also a viable strategy. For example, isolating colonies of beneficial predatory ants has been shown to reduce pest damage and increase yields (773). Conversely, excluding ants that protect pests can lead to greater parasitism of those pests and, in some cases, a reduction in their numbers (886). The use of mixed pastures instead of monocultures has been associated with a reduction in weeds and, in some studies, fewer pests (721). Finally, employing grazing instead of cutting for pasture management has demonstrated varied effects on natural enemies and, in one study, resulted in an increase in pest numbers (885).",

    "relevant_summary": "Several actions to control pests in orchards have been studied, with varying results. One approach is the use of bird scarers, where a controlled study in the USA found that broadcasting American crow distress calls reduced damage to almond orchards (199). In another study, reflector ribbons hung above crops were found to decrease the abundance of four pest species (199).\n\nPlanting or maintaining ground cover in orchards is another method, though studies show mixed outcomes. For pest regulation, one study found that more leafhopper eggs were parasitized in plots with cover crops, while two other studies found inconsistent or no differences (1395). In terms of crop damage, one study reported more pest-damaged grapes in plots with cover crops (1395). The effect on pest numbers also varies, with some studies finding fewer leafhoppers in plots with cover crops, and another finding more (1395). However, some studies did find a higher number of natural enemies in plots with ground cover (1395). Mowing the ground cover may be a beneficial practice, as two studies found fewer pests in mown plots (1395). It is worth noting that one study found more gophers in plots with clover compared to other cover crops (1395).",
