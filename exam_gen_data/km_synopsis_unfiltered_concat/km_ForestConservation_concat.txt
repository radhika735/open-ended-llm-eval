Two found it increased tree density and two found no effect of logging on tree density.
Three of six studies (including one replicated, randomized, controlled study) in Bolivia, Canada, China, Kenya, Malaysia and the USA found that logging trees in forests increased tree size. Two found it decreased tree size and one found no effect of  logging on tree size.
Two of four studies (including one paired site study) in Bolivia, China, Mexico and Papua New Guinea found that logging trees in forests decreased tree species richness and diversity. One study found it increased diversity and one found no effect of logging on tree species diversity.
One replicated, controlled study in Canada found that logging trees in forests increased tree mortality rate.

1273: Log/remove trees within forests: effects on understory plants
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Key Messages:

Five of ten studies (including four replicated, randomized, controlled studies) in Bolivia, Canada, India and the USA found that logging trees in forests increased the density and cover of understory plants. Five studies found no effect or mixed effects.
Four of seven studies (including one replicated, randomized, controlled study) in Australia, Canada and the USA found that logging trees in forests increased species richness and diversity of understory plants. Three studies found no effect.

1274: Use vegetation removal together with mechanical disturbance to the soil
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Key Messages:

Two studies (including one replicated, randomized, controlled study) in Portugal and France found that vegetation removal together with mechanical disturbance of the soil increased the cover and diversity of understory plants. One of the studies found it also decreased understory shrub cover.
One replicated, randomized, controlled study in France found that vegetation removal together with mechanical disturbance of the soil increased the density of young trees.

Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the USA found no effect of invasive plant control using herbicide on the total native plant species richness.
