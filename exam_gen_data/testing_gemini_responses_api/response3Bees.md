Good json formatting but seems to have reverted to action ids to generate question being same as those in model answer - may need to rename that property in the json schema.
Prompt same as response2Bats.

    "question": "What are the most effective ways to provide nesting sites for different types of bees, such as bumblebees and solitary bees?",
    "answer": "For ground-nesting solitary bees, creating patches of bare soil can lead to successful colonization [13]. Artificial nest boxes, such as hollow stems or drilled wood blocks, are also readily occupied by many species of solitary bee [47]. For bumblebees, providing grassy field margins can attract nest-searching queens [12]. Artificial nest boxes for bumblebees have shown variable uptake rates, with studies indicating that underground boxes are generally more effective than the wooden surface boxes often sold for wildlife gardening [48].",

    "question": "How do different field margin management strategies on farmland compare in their benefits for bees?",
    "answer": "Sowing margins with native wildflowers or agricultural nectar mixes has been shown to support a higher abundance of foraging bumblebees compared to grassy or naturally regenerated margins [18, 19]. Leaving margins to naturally regenerate can also support more foraging bumblebees than cropped margins, but their value may be inconsistent year-to-year and reliant on weed species [20]. Providing simple grass strips has shown mixed results for bee abundance and diversity [14], while unsprayed crop edges (conservation headlands) did not attract more foraging bumblebees than conventionally sprayed crop fields [29].",

    "question": "What evidence exists for managing invasive species to protect native bee populations?",    
    "answer": "Evidence for managing invasive species to benefit bees is mixed. For invasive honey bees, one study showed insecticide-laced syrup could kill colonies [38]. For invasive bumblebees, trapping and killing them increased native bumblebee numbers but failed to achieve eradication [38]. At a local scale, using a sticky barrier on nest boxes reduced the presence of introduced European earwigs, which in turn increased nest box use by native bees [44]. However, an attempt to control the spread of the invasive small hive beetle using mite-killing strips in transport packages was not effective [41].",

    "question": "What are the key considerations and challenges when using captive rearing and reintroduction for bee conservation?",
    "answer": "Captive rearing has been attempted for several declining bumblebee species, but with mixed success; in some cases, queens laid eggs but the larvae died before reaching adulthood [50]. When reintroduced to the wild, lab-reared bumblebee colonies have shown variable success in producing new queens and can suffer high rates of social parasitism [52]. For solitary bees, managed populations can be increased, but translocation of adults is challenging as few remain at the new site; translocating them at an immature stage can be more successful [54, 55].",
