    "question": "What are some effective methods for physically protecting bird nests from predators, and are there any potential downsides?",
    "model_answer": "Based on the evidence, physically protecting nests using non-electric or electric fencing is likely to be beneficial. Studies found fewer nests were predated when using non-electric fencing (183), and electric fencing led to higher survival or productivity in waders and seabirds (188). Individual nest exclosures can also be beneficial for waders, storks, and songbirds (398, 399, 400), though some studies show they may increase nest abandonment or predation on adult birds (401, 403).",

    "question": "What are the most beneficial habitat management strategies for birds on agricultural land?",
    "model_answer": "Several actions are considered beneficial for birds on farmland. Planting wild bird seed or cover mixtures was found to increase bird diversity and abundance in numerous studies (187). Similarly, providing or retaining set-aside areas resulted in more species and higher densities of birds compared to crops (175). Other likely beneficial interventions include leaving overwinter stubbles (203), creating uncultivated margins around fields (190), and increasing the overall proportion of natural or semi-natural vegetation in the landscape (171).",

    "question": "What are the most effective interventions to reduce seabird bycatch in longline fisheries, and are there any associated trade-offs?",
    "model_answer": "Using streamer lines is a beneficial method, with strong evidence from multiple studies showing reduced seabird bycatch (285). Other likely beneficial methods include weighting baits or lines to make them sink faster (296) and releasing offal overboard as a distraction during line setting (299). However, some methods involve trade-offs. Setting longlines at night reduces bycatch for many species but can increase it for others like white-chinned petrels and northern fulmars (283). Similarly, setting lines underwater can be effective but was found in one study to increase attacks by shearwaters (288).",

    "question": "How does prescribed burning affect bird communities, and do the effects vary by habitat type?",
    "model_answer": "The effects of prescribed burning on bird communities are highly context-dependent and often involve trade-offs. In pine forests, burning can increase the abundance of open-habitat species but adversely affect closed-forest and ground-nesting birds (318). Conversely, in deciduous forests, burning appears to be ineffective or harmful, with studies finding no benefits to community composition and reduced nesting for some species (317). In grasslands and savannas, burning also results in trade-offs, with some species becoming more abundant and others less so (320, 322). The effectiveness in Australian sclerophyll forest is unknown, but fire does alter species assemblages (319).",
