2066: Bury drill cuttings in the seabed rather than leaving them on the seabed surface
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Key Messages:
 

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of burying drill cuttings in the seabed rather than leaving them on the seabed surface on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.

 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
