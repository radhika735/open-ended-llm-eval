    "question": "To prepare a site for grassland seeding, what are the different outcomes of removing topsoil versus adding fertilizer?",
    "answer": "Removing topsoil before seeding or planting can increase plant community similarity to a target community, increase overall and sown species richness, and improve seedling survival (3415). In contrast, adding fertilizer may not alter species richness but has been shown in multiple studies to increase overall vegetation cover (3427).",

    "question": "What are some promising approaches for increasing plant species richness in a grassland restoration project?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests several methods can increase plant species richness. Sowing native grass and forb seeds is a common approach that increased richness in sixteen of twenty-eight studies (3432). Sowing seeds of parasitic plants like yellow rattle also increased species richness in five of six studies (3404). Additionally, planting seedlings in combination with sowing seeds can be more effective for increasing plant species numbers than sowing seeds alone (3399).",

    "question": "What are the contrasting effects of using nurse plants versus parasitic plants when trying to restore grassland vegetation?",
    "answer": "The effects appear to be quite different based on limited evidence. Sowing nurse plants was found to reduce the similarity of the plant community to that of intact steppe and did not increase species richness (3401, 3402). In contrast, sowing seeds of parasitic plants like yellow rattle was found to increase plant species richness in five of six studies and can also decrease grass cover, potentially creating opportunities for other species (3404).",

    "answer": "Mowing and grazing have shown different outcomes. Annual mowing after seeding was found to increase plant community similarity to natural grassland and could increase plant and sown species richness (3419). In contrast, grazing with livestock after seeding had mixed effects on richness, increasing it in one study compared to no grazing, but reducing it in another compared to cutting (3423). Grazing could also reduce the cover of sown species depending on the livestock used (3423), whereas mowing could increase the abundance of sown forbs (3419).",
