    "question": "What factors should be considered to increase the survival rate of primates reintroduced into the wild?",
    "answer": "Several factors appear to influence reintroduction success. Releasing primates into habitats without predators was linked to a chimpanzee population increase (1592). Reintroducing primates into areas where the species is absent has led to population increases for chimpanzees and high survival rates for gorillas and orangutans (1590). Allowing primates time to adapt to local conditions before release has shown mixed results, though several studies report majority survival for gorillas and chimpanzees for at least a few months (1564). Finally, rehabilitating primates before release has been associated with increased chimpanzee populations and high survival for vervet monkeys and western lowland gorillas (1597).",

Two studies found gorilla populations increased after implementing regular anti-poaching patrols (1471) and one study saw numbers increase where snares were regularly removed (1475). Providing better equipment (1476) and training (1477) to anti-poaching guards was also associated with increases in gorilla populations or numbers of immature gorillas.

However, other studies linked tourism to population declines for Tana River red colobus and crested mangabeys, and increased stress and infant mortality in Tibetan macaques (1512). Mitigation strategies that were in place during a period of mountain gorilla population growth include habituating primates to human presence (1519), keeping a safety distance from the animals (1538), and limiting the time tourists are allowed to spend with them (1539).",
