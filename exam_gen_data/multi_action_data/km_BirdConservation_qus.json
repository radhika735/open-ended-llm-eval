    "question": "What are some effective physical modifications to reduce bird mortality from collisions with man-made structures like windows, power lines, and fences?",
    "answer": "To reduce collisions with power lines, marking them with devices such as brightly coloured plastic spirals is effective for cranes and other species (265). More comprehensive measures include burying or isolating power lines, which dramatically increased survival for Spanish imperial eagles (262), and removing earth wires, which reduced mortality for cranes and grouse (263). For fences, marking them with orange netting has been shown to reduce collisions (238). To mitigate window collisions, angling them away from the vertical can be effective (166). Tinting windows has also been found to reduce bird strikes, as has covering them largely with white cloth (167).",

    "question": "What are the trade-offs and effectiveness of different predator control methods for protecting bird nests, such as fencing versus bait-based approaches?",
    "answer": "A systematic review found that predator removal generally increases bird reproductive success (371). Physical exclusion fences can be effective; electric fencing increased tern numbers and wader productivity but also sometimes increased predation by birds (188). Non-electric fences also reduced nest predation in some studies, but others found no effect on overall nesting success (183). Bait-based approaches have shown mixed results. Using poison bait in dispensers improved robin survival compared to scattering it (157). However, making baits safer for non-target birds has had varied success. Using repellents on baits was ineffective for American kestrels in one study but reduced pecking by North Island robins in another (159), and using coloured baits to deter birds gave conflicting results across different studies (182).",

    "question": "To improve breeding success for waders on farmland, what are the most beneficial habitat management strategies involving water and field structure?",
    "answer": "Several habitat management strategies involving water and field structure have been shown to benefit waders. Maintaining traditional water meadows can increase populations of species like the northern lapwing and common redshank (229). Directly creating scrapes and pools in wetlands and wet grasslands is also beneficial, increasing site use and providing foraging areas for chicks (359). Managing water levels is key; raising water levels in ditches or grasslands can encourage waders to recolonize sites (354), and managing ditches for wildlife has also shown positive responses (180). At a landscape level, using \u2018mosaic management\u2019 has led to population increases for the northern lapwing and higher productivity for the black-tailed godwit (202). Finally, creating uncropped, cultivated plots for species like lapwings can provide important nesting and foraging habitat, with some studies finding higher nesting success compared to in crops (213).",

    "question": "How successful is the provision of artificial nest sites for different raptor groups like falcons and owls, and what factors influence their effectiveness?",
    "answer": "Providing artificial nest sites is generally a beneficial action for raptors. Studies on falcons found that installing nest boxes led to local population increases, with productivity that was often high and sometimes exceeded that of natural nests (489). Similarly, providing artificial nests for owls has been shown to increase local populations, with many studies finding high levels of breeding success (490). Other raptors, such as ospreys, also experienced population increases after the installation of artificial nesting platforms (488). However, success is not guaranteed, as some studies for both falcons and owls reported lower productivity or success in artificial nests compared to natural ones (489, 490). Factors influencing effectiveness can include the design and position of the nest site, with some studies finding these variables affect occupancy and productivity, while other studies found no differences (489, 490).",

    "question": "What methods are effective for protecting ground-nesting bird nests from predation, and what are the potential negative consequences of these interventions?",
    "answer": "Using fencing can be effective. Both non-electric (183) and electric (188) fencing have been shown to reduce nest predation, although one study noted that electric fences could increase predation by avian predators while excluding mammals (188). Individual nest exclosures or barriers can also increase hatching rates and productivity for waders and seabirds (398, 397). However, these interventions have potential trade-offs. Studies have found that nest exclosures can lead to higher rates of nest abandonment by the parent birds (401) and may also increase predation on the adult birds, as predators can learn to associate the exclosures with a food source (403).",

    "answer": "Several habitat creation actions are rated as beneficial. Providing or retaining set-aside areas is beneficial, with studies showing more bird species and higher densities than in crops (175). Planting wild bird seed or cover mixtures is also beneficial for increasing bird diversity and abundance (187). Other actions are considered likely to be beneficial, including creating skylark plots to increase skylark density and productivity (214), planting nectar flower or wildflower strips to attract more birds (189), and creating uncultivated margins, which can support higher bird abundances (190). Leaving uncropped cultivated plots has also been found to increase populations of specific species like the Eurasian thick-knee (213).",

Similarly, marking fences is likely to be beneficial, with one study finding that orange netting on deer fences reduced bird collisions (238). Evidence for reducing window collisions is less certain. A single experiment found that angling windows away from the vertical reduced collisions (166), while another found tinted windows were more effective than un-tinted ones, though results for marking windows were mixed (167). Evidence for wind turbines is minimal, but one experiment suggested painting black stripes on blades could increase their visibility to kestrels (258).",

    "question": "When reintroducing captive-bred birds, what techniques can improve the success of the program?",
    "answer": "Several techniques can influence the success of reintroduction programmes. Providing supplementary food after release is likely to be beneficial; studies show released birds use the food, which can increase survival rates (639). Pre-release 'anti-predator training' may also improve survival for some species like pheasants and bustards (637). The ideal release age appears to be species-dependent, with studies finding higher survival for sub-adults in some cases and for juveniles in others (636). For migratory species, releasing birds into existing wild flocks tends to be more successful (621). Using holding pens at the release site has shown mixed results, increasing survival in some studies but decreasing it in another (632).",

Using repellents on baits can also be effective; one study found that treating baits with pulegone reduced pecking rates in North Island robins, although another study found that different repellents did not reduce bait consumption by American kestrels (159). Additionally, using dyed baits may reduce consumption by non-target birds, as two US trials found lower consumption rates of dyed baits, but an Australian trial found no difference (182).",

    "answer": "Planting new hedges was associated with an increase in northern bobwhite populations in one study, though other interventions were also used (178). Creating uncultivated margins can provide habitat for certain sparrow species, but studies on their effect on overall bird abundance are mixed (190). Planting grass buffer strips has been shown in some studies to support higher populations of certain bird species compared to fields without them, and management such as mowing can influence their use by birds (191). A study comparing habitat types found that field margins held more birds than sown grass strips, which in turn held more birds than the crop fields themselves (191).",

    "question": "What are the potential trade-offs for bird communities when choosing between prescribed burning and tree thinning as management tools in pine forests?",
    "answer": "Both actions involve trade-offs benefiting different groups of birds. Prescribed burning in pine forests tends to increase the abundance of open-habitat species, but can negatively affect closed-forest and ground-nesting species. The effect on nesting success is variable (318). Similarly, tree thinning can increase the abundance of some species while decreasing others, with mixed results for overall species richness (328). Some studies found that combining thinning with burning resulted in higher bird densities for certain species compared to controls. The decision between these actions depends on the specific conservation goals for the bird community, as burning generally creates more open habitat while thinning can have more varied structural results (318, 328).",
