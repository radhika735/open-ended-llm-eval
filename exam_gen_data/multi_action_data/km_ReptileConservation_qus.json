    "question": "What are the observed effects of modifying or ceasing livestock grazing on reptile populations in different habitats?",
    "answer": "The effects vary by habitat and management approach. In grasslands and forests, modifying grazing intensity or ceasing it altogether has yielded mixed results for reptile richness and abundance (3490, 3492, 3498, 3511). However, one study found higher Texas horned lizard survival in moderately grazed grasslands (3490). In wetlands, moderate autumn-winter grazing benefited European pond turtles more than other regimes (3496), whereas ceasing grazing in a US wetland led to fewer bog turtles (3512).",

Physically protecting nests with artificial covers like cages has also proven effective in many cases for sea turtles (3686) and other tortoises and terrapins (3687). Fencing nest areas, especially when combined with predator removal, can also reduce predation (3677).

On agricultural land, creating uncultivated margins had neutral effects on reptile richness and abundance in one study (3518). In contrast, another study found planting trees on farmland increased the abundance of rare reptiles, particularly with greater canopy cover (3527).

Restoring former mining sites shows that reptiles will colonize these areas, but species richness and abundance tend to be lower than in undisturbed sites [3497].

For tortoises and terrapins, releases of captive-bred individuals have resulted in high survival (66\u2013100% in some studies) and subsequent reproduction in the wild [3770]. Head-starting tortoises has also shown success, with some studies finding higher survival rates for head-started individuals compared to wild hatchlings [3776]. For snakes and lizards, the evidence is more mixed. While some releases have led to breeding, reviews suggest that only a minority of projects result in population growth, and post-release survival can be low [3771]. Head-starting snakes has also yielded mixed survival outcomes when compared to resident populations [3777].",

For trawl fisheries, installing turtle exclusion devices has been shown to prevent turtles from entering nets and reduce lethal strandings (3584). Changing bait from squid to fish also reduced sea turtle catch in several studies (3612).

However, relocating nests to hatcheries or other parts of the beach shows highly variable effects on hatching success compared to natural nests (3781, 3785). For habitat management, reducing artificial light is important; using barriers or specific light colours can improve hatchling orientation to the sea (3618, 3628), though simply lowering light intensity may not be enough (3623).
