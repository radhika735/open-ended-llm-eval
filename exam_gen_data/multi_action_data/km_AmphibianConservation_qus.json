    "question": "What are some effective methods for controlling invasive predators like bullfrogs and fish to protect native amphibian populations?",
    "answer": "Removing invasive American bullfrogs is likely to be beneficial, with studies showing it can significantly increase populations of native frogs like the California red-legged frog (825). For controlling fish, several methods have proven effective. Draining ponds to eliminate fish is a beneficial action that can increase amphibian species numbers (826). Physically catching and removing fish is also likely to be beneficial for increasing salamander and frog abundance (827). Using rotenone can also eliminate fish and increase amphibian populations, but it comes with a trade-off as it has been shown to cause mortality in frogs and newts (828).",

    "answer": "Closing roads during seasonal migration is rated as likely to be beneficial, with studies showing it protects large numbers of amphibians from death (842). Installing tunnels or culverts, particularly when combined with barrier fencing, can also decrease road deaths, though their effectiveness can depend on design features like width and substrate (884, 756). Conversely, using human patrols to assist migrating amphibians is considered unlikely to be beneficial, as studies show populations continued to decline over several years despite these efforts (784).",

    "answer": "Pond creation is generally a beneficial action for amphibians, with studies finding that created ponds are widely colonized (869). The intervention is rated as 'Beneficial' for establishing breeding populations of frogs (865), natterjack toads (866), and salamanders/newts (867). For great crested newts specifically (863) and toads more generally (868), it is rated 'Likely to be beneficial'. Success can vary, with some studies noting that naturally colonizing species may fare better than translocated ones, and that mortality factors can differ between created and natural ponds (866, 868).",

    "answer": "Compared to clearcutting, shelterwood harvesting is likely to be beneficial, resulting in smaller reductions in salamander populations (851). Retaining riparian buffer strips during timber harvest is also rated as likely to be beneficial (747). In contrast, thinning trees and harvesting small groups of trees are both considered likely to be ineffective or harmful, as they can still significantly decrease salamander abundance compared to unharvested forest (852, 844). Leaving coarse woody debris presents a trade-off, as it can increase survival for juvenile amphibians in clearcuts but may also have negative physiological effects on some species (843).",

    "answer": "Both retaining riparian buffer strips and shelterwood harvesting are considered likely to be beneficial alternatives to clearcutting. Studies on riparian buffers found that amphibian abundance was significantly higher with buffers compared to clearcutting in one study, while others found mixed effects (747). When compared to unharvested forest, abundance in buffered areas was sometimes similar, but sometimes lower (747). Shelterwood harvesting resulted in higher or similar salamander abundance compared to clearcutting. However, compared to unharvested forest, it still caused a decrease in salamander abundance (851). Therefore, both methods reduce the negative impacts of clearcutting, but may not fully maintain amphibian populations at pre-harvest levels.",

Pond restoration is rated 'Likely to be beneficial' and has been shown to increase amphibian species numbers and populations (878).

However, some interventions have mixed results; adding limestone can help establish natterjack toad populations in some cases but caused high tadpole mortality in others (748).

    "question": "What are the relative successes and key considerations when establishing amphibian populations through translocation versus the release of captive-bred individuals?",
    "answer": "Both translocation and releasing captive-bred amphibians can establish populations, but success rates and considerations differ. Overall, 65% of assessed translocations established breeding populations, with programmes moving over 1,000 animals being more successful (854). For captive-bred or head-started releases, 41% showed evidence of breeding for multiple generations (871). Success is highly species-dependent; releases of some captive-bred frogs were highly successful (870), while those for green and golden bell frogs largely failed (872). Key considerations include the source of animals, as wild-translocated natterjack toads increased populations more than captive-bred ones (859), and the potential for reduced genetic diversity in populations established from captive stock (873).",
