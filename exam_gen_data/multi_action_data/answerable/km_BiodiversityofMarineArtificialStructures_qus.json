    "question": "How do the biodiversity outcomes of creating large hole habitats compare between subtidal and intertidal artificial structures?",
    "answer": "Creating large hole habitats (>50 mm) on both subtidal and intertidal structures has been found to alter community composition and increase species richness and diversity (3434, 3467). On subtidal structures, studies found holes altered community composition and two of three found increased species richness, but one study found no increase in mobile invertebrate and fish abundance (3434). Similarly, on intertidal structures, three studies found creating holes (sometimes with other features) increased species diversity and supported new species, but studies on abundance showed mixed or no effects for invertebrates and no effect for algae (3467).",

    "question": "Which interventions are most effective for increasing fish populations on subtidal artificial structures?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests that creating large swimthrough habitats (>100 mm) can increase overall fish species richness and abundance (3456). Similarly, restricting harvesting on subtidal structures was found to result in higher fish species richness and, in one case, higher seabream abundance (3457). Reducing the cleaned area on a structure was also found to increase seahorse abundance (3447). Many other interventions, such as creating smaller holes, grooves, or pits, have shown mixed effects on fish populations (3434, 3448, 3455).",

    "question": "To improve biodiversity on intertidal structures, what are the relative benefits of creating complex features like grooves and ridges versus transplanting key organisms like oysters?",
    "answer": "Creating grooves and small ridges on intertidal structures has been shown in multiple studies to increase species richness and diversity, as well as alter community composition, often by supporting species absent from unmodified surfaces (3474). Transplanting oysters has also been shown to support species that were absent from structure surfaces and increase mobile invertebrate richness, but it had mixed effects on overall species richness (3472). For abundance, creating grooves and ridges has shown mixed effects, while transplanting oysters was found to increase oyster and mobile invertebrate abundance in one study but had mixed effects in others (3472, 3474).",

On intertidal structures, one study found this action did not increase species richness and another found mixed effects on invertebrate abundance, though it was noted that limpets did use the created features for shelter (3435). On subtidal structures, a single study found that creating this topography did not increase the abundance of juvenile canopy macroalgae that settled on the surface (3446).",

Evidence suggests pits may be particularly effective, with eight of twelve studies showing an increase in richness/diversity, often alongside other features (3475). Creating holes also increased richness/diversity in three studies (3467). Results for grooves are more mixed; three of six studies found an increase in richness (3473).

Similarly, on intertidal structures, a study found mixed effects on species richness depending on texture type and site, also when used with special materials (3466).

For habitat creation, adding large swimthroughs (>100 mm) was found to increase overall fish species richness and abundance (3456).

On subtidal structures, creating grooves (3448) or pits (3455), often along with other features, was found to increase combined macroalgae and invertebrate species diversity.

Using environmentally-sensitive materials like ECOncreteTM, particularly when combined with other habitat features, was found to increase species richness and diversity on both intertidal (3469) and subtidal (3470) structures. However, other materials showed mixed or no effects. Transplanting organisms, such as oysters, also showed mixed effects on overall species richness on intertidal structures (3472), while transplanting oysters onto subtidal structures did increase species richness and diversity in one study (3471).

    "answer": "Creating complex topography on intertidal structures often produces contrasting results and microhabitat-specific benefits. For instance, studies found that grooves supported higher species richness than the small ridges or ledges created between them (3464, 3473). While combining grooves and ridges can increase overall diversity, the outcome can be influenced by factors like their depth/height, the shore level, and site (3474). Interventions creating large ridges and protrusions were found to increase the abundance of limpets but not barnacles (3465), illustrating that the design of topographical features can favor certain species over others.",

On intertidal structures, both short (1-50 mm) and long (>50 mm) flexible habitats altered the community composition of macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrates (3459, 3460).

Similarly, creating rock pools had mixed effects on fish abundance and did not increase species richness in one study, though they were used by fish (3476).
