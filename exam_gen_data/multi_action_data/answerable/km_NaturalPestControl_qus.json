    "question": "Which farming strategies are most effective for increasing the number of natural enemies to control pests?",
    "answer": "Combining trap and repellent crops in a 'push-pull' system is beneficial for increasing natural predators (753). Growing non-crop plants that release chemicals attractive to natural enemies is also likely to be beneficial (724). Converting to organic farming has been found to increase natural enemies in a majority of studies (717). In contrast, creating beetle banks may only increase predator numbers on the banks themselves with slow movement into the crop (729).",
