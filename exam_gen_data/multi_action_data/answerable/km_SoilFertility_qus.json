    "answer": "Multiple studies found that increasing soil organic carbon and matter can be achieved through several actions. These include using crop rotation, especially with legumes (857), adding amendments like mulch (887), compost (889) or manures (911), growing cover crops (897, 898), retaining crop residues (907), and adopting reduced or no-tillage systems (906).",
