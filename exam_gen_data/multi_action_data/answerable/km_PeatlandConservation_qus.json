    "answer": "Introducing a parasitic plant was found to increase overall plant species richness in one study [1777]. Physically removing moss also increased species richness, but only in a drained area [1768]. In contrast, using prescribed fire or herbicides was found to reduce, limit, or prevent increases in plant species richness [1774, 1776]. The effect of cutting problematic trees/shrubs on species richness was mixed, with one study finding an increase and another finding it prevented increases [1772].",

In contrast, studies on grazing show mixed results for richness, with one study finding fewer species in grazed meadows compared to mown ones [1762].

    "answer": "Relying on natural colonization after rewetting can change the plant community to be more wetland-characteristic, but some studies report that the resulting community differs from natural peatlands [1756]. In contrast, actively adding mixed peatland vegetation onto a bog surface has been shown in seventeen studies to establish Sphagnum moss, often with higher cover than in unsown plots, and also encourages the appearance of vascular plants [1822]. Similarly, adding moss fragments directly has been shown to be a beneficial method for establishing Sphagnum [1821].",

Direct application methods are also effective: spreading mixed vegetation fragments (1822), adding moss fragments (1821), and directly planting mosses (1818) have all been shown to increase Sphagnum cover, especially in controlled studies.

Twenty-one studies reported that rewetting increased the cover of at least one herb group, such as sedges or cottongrasses (1756). In contrast, grazing has shown mixed results; two studies reported increases in some herb groups after introducing grazing in fens, but one of these found purple moor grass cover was reduced (1762).
