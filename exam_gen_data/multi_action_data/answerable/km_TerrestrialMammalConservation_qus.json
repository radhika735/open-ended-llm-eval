    "question": "What are the different outcomes and trade-offs when translocating mammals for conservation versus for human-wildlife conflict resolution?",
    "answer": "Translocating mammals to re-establish or boost populations is often rated as 'Beneficial', with many studies showing population increases, though sometimes with lower survival for the translocated individuals compared to residents (2397). In contrast, translocating 'problem' mammals to reduce conflict is often 'Likely to be ineffective or harmful'. These animals frequently have lower survival rates (2336, 2430, 2485) and many return to their original capture locations to continue causing nuisance behaviour (2336, 2341). One study found that translocated leopards attacked more humans and livestock than before their translocation (2336).",

Directly scaring bears has mixed success; while some noise and pain deterrents were ineffective, chasing bears with dogs or people did deter them in some studies (2347). A more effective approach appears to be preventing access to food sources, for example by using electric shock devices on bird feeders (2346).

Installing barrier fencing along roads is beneficial for reducing collisions (2567), and when combined with underpasses (2571) or overpasses (2526), it creates a system that both prevents animals from accessing the road surface and provides safe crossing points. These crossing structures are used by a wide range of mammals. For animals that still end up within fenced road sections, installing one-way gates or escape ramps can further reduce collisions by allowing them to exit the road corridor (2558).
