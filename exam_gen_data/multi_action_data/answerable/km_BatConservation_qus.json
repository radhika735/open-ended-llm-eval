It is also likely beneficial to avoid illuminating foraging and drinking sites (2018) and commuting routes (2017).

    "answer": "Imposing general restrictions on cave visits can be beneficial, leading to increased bat populations (1002). However, installing gates at cave or mine entrances presents a trade-off. While some studies show bat population increases (999), others report fewer bats or species after installation, and changes in behaviour such as reluctance to enter (1963, 999). Gate design is important, and one study found bats in a gated cave lost more body mass than those in an unmodified cave (999). Replacing a gate with a fence was found to increase the number of bats emerging from a cave (1991).",

Retaining forested corridors in logged areas is also likely beneficial, as they show higher bat activity and provide roosting sites (996). Selective or reduced-impact logging appears to be beneficial, with smaller negative effects on bat abundance compared to conventional logging (989). In contrast, prescribed burning presents a trade-off; while it increased activity for some open-habitat bat species, it had no effect on others and can alter bat community composition (1006).",
