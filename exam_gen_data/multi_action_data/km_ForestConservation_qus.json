    "question": "What are the contrasting effects of thinning trees on different components of a forest ecosystem?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests there are trade-offs when thinning forests. Thinning is rated as 'likely to be beneficial' for young trees and understory plants. Six of twelve studies found thinning increased young tree density (1210) and seventeen of twenty-five studies found it increased understory plant cover (1211). However, thinning is rated as a 'trade off between benefit and harms' for mature trees, as it often decreases their density and cover while increasing their size (1209). For non-vascular plants, it is rated 'likely to be ineffective or harmful', with studies finding it decreased epiphytic plant abundance and richness (1212).",

Conversely, for understory plants, there is also a 'trade off between benefit and harms' as fourteen of twenty-four studies found prescribed fire increased species richness and diversity, but six studies found it decreased plant cover (1221).",
