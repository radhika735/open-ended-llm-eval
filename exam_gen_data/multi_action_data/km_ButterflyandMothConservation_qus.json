    "question": "What are the most effective ways to manage agricultural field margins and set-aside land to increase butterfly and moth populations?",
    "answer": "Several actions can improve agricultural land for butterflies and moths. Agri-environment schemes that pay farmers for conservation measures have been found to increase butterfly and moth species richness and abundance (3915). Specifically, planting nectar flower or wildflower strips is effective, with studies showing higher species richness and abundance compared to conventional margins (3932). Creating uncultivated margins is better than cropped land but less effective than sown wildflower strips (3981). Planting grass margins can also increase butterfly abundance compared to cropped edges, with wider and floristically enhanced margins being more beneficial (3982). Retaining set-aside areas can also increase butterfly richness compared to cereal fields, though the effect on abundance is less clear (3980).",

Coppicing woodland can lead to higher butterfly species richness and abundance compared to unmanaged areas (3939). Thinning trees, especially when combined with prescribed burning, has also been shown to increase butterfly richness and abundance (3940). Studies comparing logging methods found that shelterwood harvesting and thinning led to higher moth species richness than clearcutting (3871, 3868). Creating cleared patches or rides in forests also supports greater butterfly richness and abundance than closed-canopy forest (3938).

In urban areas, protecting remaining greenfield sites with native vegetation supports higher butterfly richness than urban parks (3836). While green roofs have fewer butterflies than parks, their value increases with age and planting diversity (3837). Managing existing greenspaces, like parks and road verges, by reducing mowing frequency can increase butterfly and moth richness and abundance (3841). Planting these areas with native species is also beneficial, supporting more butterflies and caterpillars than non-native plants (3842).

Prescribed burning has shown mixed results; some studies found it increased abundance of species like the heath fritillary, while others found it decreased abundance for prairie specialists like the regal fritillary compared to unburned or hayed land (3882). Rotational burning can be beneficial, with butterfly abundance often being higher in areas several years after a burn compared to recently burned sites (3883). When directly compared, some studies found prairies managed by haying supported a higher abundance of specialist butterflies than burned prairies (3945). Similarly, direct comparisons between grazing and mowing show that some butterfly species are more abundant in grazed grasslands, while others do better in mown hay meadows (3908).",

For existing green spaces, planting native species in gardens and on road verges is often more beneficial than using non-native plants, leading to greater richness and abundance of both adult butterflies and caterpillars (3842). Altering mowing regimes to be less frequent on urban greenspaces can also increase butterfly and moth richness, diversity, and abundance (3841). In contrast, establishing green roofs appears less effective, resulting in lower butterfly richness and abundance compared to urban parks (3837).

In contrast, single tree selection logging was found to result in a similar moth species richness to clearcutting (3867, 3868).

Sown wildflower strips consistently provide the most significant benefits, with numerous studies indicating they support higher species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths compared to conventional or unsown margins (3932). Grass buffer strips are also beneficial, showing higher butterfly abundance than cropped edges, with wider grass margins supporting greater diversity (3982). However, grass margins enhanced with wildflowers are more effective than standard grass-only strips (3982). Uncultivated margins can support more butterflies than the adjacent crop (3981), but generally have lower richness and abundance than margins actively sown with diverse wildflower or forb mixes.

Many studies report that translocated populations persisted and increased in abundance in areas where habitat was restored through actions like coppicing, planting, scrub clearance, or grazing (3909). For instance, restored grasslands have successfully supported translocated regal fritillary populations (3943), and restored heathland has supported growing populations of released silver-studded blues (3946). Similarly, released captive-bred populations have been shown to persist for many years in appropriately managed habitats (3914). However, some initiatives fail, with translocated or captive-bred populations dying out within a few years despite habitat management (3909, 3914). Furthermore, survival rates for released captive-bred individuals can be lower than for their wild or translocated counterparts (3914).",

Prescribed fire in grasslands can increase the abundance of some species, such as heath fritillary, but decrease others like regal fritillary [3882].

Mechanical clearance of understorey vegetation, for instance to create fire breaks, can also increase butterfly richness and abundance (3881). Retaining deadwood may benefit specific moth species, though evidence is limited (3873).",

    "question": "What grassland management strategies are most beneficial for butterfly and moth populations?",
    "answer": "Reducing overall management intensity on permanent grasslands generally leads to higher species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths (3958). More specifically, seasonally removing livestock during the summer or delaying the first cut of the year until July or September has been shown to increase butterfly abundance (3960, 3967). Conversely, increasing grazing intensity or cutting frequency typically reduces both the abundance and species richness of butterflies (3962). The restoration of grasslands from scrub has shown more mixed results (3955).",

    "question": "What actions can be taken within arable farming systems to boost butterfly and moth numbers?",
    "answer": "Several actions within arable farms can benefit butterflies. Converting to organic farming often increases species richness and abundance compared to conventional farms (3907). Creating unsprayed conservation headlands around fields also increases butterfly richness and abundance (3898). Structurally, planting new hedgerows provides better habitat than other margins (3976), and maintaining smaller fields is associated with higher butterfly abundance (3974). Additionally, leaving crop headlands unharvested can support a greater richness and abundance of butterflies (3924).",

    "question": "How do different habitat restoration approaches compare in their effectiveness for butterfly communities?",
    "answer": "The outcomes of habitat restoration vary depending on the approach. Restoring roadside verges by sowing native wildflowers has proven effective at increasing butterfly species richness and abundance (3854). In contrast, restoring semi-natural grasslands by clearing scrub and reintroducing management has yielded mixed results, with some studies finding richness to be similar to or lower than unrestored areas (3955). Replanting native trees in logged areas resulted in similar species richness but lower diversity compared to naturally regenerating forest (3874), while other native vegetation replanting efforts have also shown variable success compared to remnant habitats (3933).",

    "question": "How does simply legally protecting a habitat compare to actively managing it for butterfly conservation?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests legal protection alone yields mixed results. Studies have found that protected sites can lose threatened butterfly species at similar rates to unprotected sites, and that habitat condition within a protected area may be more influential than the protection status itself (3831). In contrast, active management often provides clearer benefits. For example, mechanically clearing woody understorey vegetation (3881), managing woodland edges to increase structural diversity (3942), and managing heathland by cutting (3947) have all been documented to increase butterfly abundance or richness.",
