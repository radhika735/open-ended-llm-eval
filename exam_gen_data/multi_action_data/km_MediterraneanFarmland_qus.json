    "question": "How do no-tillage and reduced tillage practices compare for improving soil organic matter and stability on Mediterranean farmland?",
    "answer": "Both no-tillage and reduced tillage tend to increase soil organic matter compared to conventional tillage [1369, 1371]. When comparing them directly, three studies found no-tillage provides more organic matter than reduced tillage, while three found no difference [1370]. No-tillage generally improves soil stability compared to conventional tillage, with seven studies supporting this [1369]. However, the comparison between no-tillage and reduced tillage shows inconsistent results for soil stability [1370].",

    "question": "What are the main trade-offs of growing cover crops in arable fields on Mediterranean farmland?",
    "answer": "Growing cover crops on Mediterranean farmland involves significant trade-offs. They are beneficial for soil health by increasing organic matter, improving soil organism populations, and reducing erosion [1345]. They are also likely beneficial for pest regulation, particularly by reducing weeds [1394]. However, these benefits may come at the cost of cash crop yield, which is often lower in fields with cover crops [1351]. There are also trade-offs for water; while cover crops can reduce water loss from runoff and leaching, they can also deplete soil water content through their own consumption [1357].",

    "answer": "Several interventions can enhance biodiversity with varying effectiveness. Restoring habitat along watercourses is likely beneficial, with studies showing positive effects for birds, although outcomes can be mixed compared to remnant habitats [1416]. Maintaining ground cover in vineyards was found in one study to increase bird numbers and diversity [1413]. Excluding grazers presents a trade-off, as it can benefit some bird and mammal species while negatively affecting others and potentially reducing plant species diversity [1417]. Adding compost to the soil can increase plant biomass and support rare plant species [1409].",

    "answer": "Adding organic amendments to soil can negatively impact water quality by increasing nutrient loss. Adding slurry is considered likely to be ineffective or harmful, with studies showing it increased leaching and runoff of nitrate and dissolved organic matter [1380]. Similarly, adding manure was found to increase the leaching of dissolved organic carbon, nitrate, ammonium, phosphorus, and potassium [1378]. Adding compost has also been found to increase nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in runoff [1377]. Therefore, while beneficial for soil, these amendments risk polluting nearby watercourses.",
