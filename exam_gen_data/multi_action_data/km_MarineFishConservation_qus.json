    "question": "What are the comparative effects on fish abundance from establishing temporary, long-term, or complete (no-take) fishery closures?",
    "answer": "Prohibiting all fishing in a marine protected area appears to have the most consistently positive effects on fish abundance. Many studies found that prohibiting all fishing for extended periods resulted in higher fish abundance (density and/or biomass) compared to fished areas (ref: 2682). In contrast, long-term closures showed mixed results for abundance, with some studies finding higher numbers of certain species while others found higher abundance for only one of seven species studied (ref: 2655). Temporary closures were found in one study to have no effect on the biomass of spawning cod compared to fished areas over nine years (ref: 2664).",

    "answer": "Several modifications to trawl nets have been shown to reduce unwanted fish catch. Using a larger mesh size is often effective, with 15 of 20 studies finding a reduction in the catch of unwanted or undersized fish (ref: 2697). Similarly, using square mesh codends instead of diamond mesh reduced unwanted catches in 10 of 16 studies (ref: 2714). Fitting square mesh escape panels or windows is another successful method, with 14 of 19 studies reporting reduced unwanted catch (ref: 2716). Finally, using a separator trawl has also been shown to help separate and allow the escape of unwanted species like cod and other non-target fish (ref: 2711).",

    "question": "Besides modifying gear, what fishing practices or management strategies can help reduce unwanted shark catch and improve their survival?",
    "answer": "Several non-gear-modification strategies exist for reducing unwanted shark catch. Reducing the duration of longline deployments was found in one study to decrease the catch rate of unwanted sharks (ref: 2686). Deploying fishing gear at specific depths can also reduce unwanted catches of some shark and ray species (ref: 2683). Attaching electropositive deterrents to gear showed mixed results, but did reduce unwanted shark and ray catches in two of four studies (ref: 2696). If sharks are caught, protocols for live release can be effective, with studies showing high survival rates for some species post-release (ref: 2691). In contrast, two global reviews found that changing bait type was not an effective method for reducing unwanted shark and ray catches (ref: 2700).",

    "answer": "Prohibiting all fishing appears to be the most consistently effective strategy for increasing overall fish abundance. A large number of studies (30 of 54) found that marine protected areas prohibiting all fishing had higher fish abundances compared to fished areas (ref: 2682). Prohibiting only specific gear types shows more variable results. For example, studies on prohibiting bottom-towed fishing gears found mixed effects, with some showing higher fish biomass and others showing no effect on abundance (ref: 2673). Similarly, prohibiting all static and mobile bottom gears had varied outcomes across different studies and species (ref: 2654). However, specifically prohibiting offshore line fishing was found in one study to effectively increase the abundance of four fish species over-exploited by that method (ref: 2671).",

Studies found no increase in the biomass, survival, or size of cod after a nine-year seasonal closure (2938). Furthermore, a key consequence can be the displacement of fishing effort; during a seasonal closure of a grouper fishery, spear fishers increased their targeting and catch of other fish groups, indicating a shift in fishing pressure (2938, 2664).",

The introduction of catch shares has also been linked to a higher likelihood of fisheries meeting biomass sustainability targets (3812). Involving fishers and stakeholders in co-management was also found in one study to increase overall fish abundance after nine years (2910).",

Conversely, prohibiting all fishing within a marine reserve can have a \"spillover\" effect; one study found catch rates for small-scale fisheries were highest near the reserve boundary and decreased with distance (2682).

Similarly, fish size was larger for some species in closed areas in one study, but other studies found varied or no effects (2673).

In prawn fisheries, fitting size-sorting escape grids to trawl nets can reduce unwanted shark catches (2721). For longline fisheries, modifications such as increasing the sinking rate or using nylon instead of wire hook attachments can reduce catches of unwanted sharks and rays, though results are mixed (2699).

While permanently prohibiting all fishing can lead to higher fish abundance (2682), some studies show that closing areas to fishing for extended periods can lower the flight response distance of fish (2655, 2675). This behavioural change makes fish less wary and more vulnerable to capture with gear like spear guns, which could lead to high catch rates if fishing is allowed in the future or if fish move outside the protected area.",

Spatial controls, such as combining long-term fishery closures with prohibitions on certain gear types, reduced unwanted cod catch (3810). Establishing \"move-on\" rules, where fishing ceases temporarily when a catch threshold is met, has been shown to lower discards (3815). Economic incentives and regulations can also be effective; setting catch limits for non-targeted species (2693) and establishing species-specific catch shares (3814) have both been found to reduce unwanted catch. Finally, providing fishers with near real-time catch information can enable them to avoid unwanted species (3826).",

In protected areas where fishing is allowed only periodically, greater fish biomass was noted within 18 months to six years (2679).

Modifying fishing gear, such as by fitting large escape openings or size-sorting grids to trawl nets, can have an immediate effect by reducing the unwanted catch of non-target or undersized fish (2723, 2728). Conversely, establishing protected areas with fishing restrictions, like prohibiting spearfishing or creating zoned reserves, tends to result in broader, population-level changes over several years. These changes include increased fish abundance, larger average fish sizes, and sometimes higher species richness, with effects noted from two to fifteen years after implementation (2672, 2674).",
