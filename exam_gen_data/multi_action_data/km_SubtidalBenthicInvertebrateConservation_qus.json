Translocating reef-forming corals has been found to increase the abundance and richness of associated invertebrates (2246). Restoring oyster reefs can increase the abundance of reef-associated invertebrates and provide new habitat for oyster settlement (2248). Creating artificial reefs can increase invertebrate abundance and biomass compared to adjacent natural sediments, though communities may differ from natural reefs (2258). Other methods like restoring mussel beds (2247) and seagrass beds (2249) have also shown some positive effects, such as increased invertebrate abundance, but their effectiveness is currently rated as unknown.",

MPAs with a zonation system also appear beneficial, with zones prohibiting all fishing showing higher lobster abundance and bigger individuals compared to zones with fewer restrictions (2230). Prohibiting only commercial fishing has shown mixed results; one study found bigger lobsters, but others found no increase in lobster abundance or size compared to fished areas, possibly due to continued recreational harvesting (2225).",

Other replacements have unknown effectiveness but have shown some positive signs. For instance, using an otter trawl instead of a beam trawl caused lower invertebrate mortality in silty areas but not sandy areas (2125).

Prohibiting all fishing can lead to different invertebrate community compositions and, after 20 years, higher species richness (2096), as well as greater overall invertebrate abundance and biomass in marine protected areas (2224). Similarly, ceasing bottom trawling led to different invertebrate community compositions and higher diversity in areas closed for 15-37 years (2099).

Using rigid grids is also 'likely to be beneficial' and can reduce bycatch of sponges and crabs, but some grid designs also reduced the catch of commercial prawns (2133). Using a larger codend mesh size is rated as 'likely to be beneficial' for reducing bycatch, but one study found it also reduced the catch of commercially targeted shrimps (2135).
