    "answer": "This question cannot be answered by the provided text. Action 756 documents that barrier fencing can decrease amphibian road deaths, but it does not provide evidence on whether this reduction in mortality translates into long-term increases or stability in the size of local amphibian populations.",

While it details several methods for controlling fish, such as drying out ponds (826), catching them (827), and using rotenone (828), it does not include any cost data, making it impossible to determine which is the most cost-effective.",
