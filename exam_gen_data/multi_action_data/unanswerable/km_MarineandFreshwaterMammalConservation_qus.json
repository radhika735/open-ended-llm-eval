    "answer": "This question cannot be answered from the provided text. While multiple interventions to reduce bycatch are described (e.g., using acoustic devices on fishing gear, modifying gear), the documents do not contain any information on the financial costs or cost-effectiveness of these actions, making a comparison impossible.",

    "question": "What is the effectiveness of programmes designed to reduce plastic pollution on the survival of sea turtles?",
    "answer": "This question is unanswerable for two reasons. Firstly, none of the conservation actions in the database are related to reducing or mitigating plastic pollution. Secondly, the database exclusively covers marine and freshwater mammals, and therefore contains no information about sea turtles.",

    "question": "How does mitigating the effects of ocean acidification impact coral reef-dependent dolphin populations?",
    "answer": "This question cannot be answered as the provided text contains no conservation actions or studies that address the effects of ocean acidification or climate change. The interventions listed focus on more direct threats like fishing interactions, vessel strikes, and habitat disturbance.",

    "question": "What is the success rate of using vaccinations to protect harbour seals from phocine distemper virus?",
    "answer": "This question cannot be answered because none of the listed conservation actions in the document involve the use of vaccinations for disease prevention in marine or freshwater mammals. The only disease-related intervention mentioned is the use of drugs to treat parasites (2861).",
