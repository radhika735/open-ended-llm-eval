    "question": "What is the most cost-effective method for reducing human-bear conflict in residential areas?",
    "answer": "The provided text evaluates several actions to reduce human-bear conflict, such as providing diversionary feeding (2323), translocating problem bears (2336), and using deterrents (2347). However, none of the summaries include data on the financial costs associated with these interventions. Therefore, it is impossible to determine the most cost-effective method from the evidence provided.",

    "question": "Does using gene drive technology to control invasive rodent populations on islands effectively increase native mammal populations?",
    "answer": "The database contains information on controlling non-native mammals through physical removal or fencing (e.g., actions 2504, 2528). However, there are no studies mentioned that investigate the use of genetic methods like gene drives for invasive species control. Consequently, the provided text cannot answer this question.",

While some actions mention changes in human behavior (e.g., 2422), the database does not contain information on public opinion, attitudes, or broader social acceptance of these conservation measures.",

    "question": "What is the overall impact of climate change on terrestrial mammal populations in the Arctic, and which mitigation strategies are most effective there?",
    "answer": "This question is too broad and addresses a topic not directly covered by the provided actions. While some actions mention specific mammal populations in arctic or sub-arctic regions (e.g., arctic fox in action 2367, polar bear in 2347), the database does not provide a comprehensive synthesis on the overall effects of climate change, nor does it evaluate conservation actions specifically framed as climate change mitigation strategies.",
