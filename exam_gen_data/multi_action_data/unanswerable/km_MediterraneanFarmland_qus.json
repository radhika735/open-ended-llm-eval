    "question": "What is the most cost-effective method for increasing soil organic matter on Mediterranean farms?",
    "answer": "This question cannot be answered by the provided text. The database describes the effectiveness of several actions for increasing soil organic matter, such as adding compost (1362), adding manure (1363), or using no-tillage (1369). However, it provides no data on the financial costs of implementing these actions, so their relative cost-effectiveness cannot be determined.",

    "question": "What are the social or cultural barriers preventing the widespread adoption of crop rotation in Mediterranean farming communities?",
    "answer": "This question cannot be answered using the provided information. The database contains scientific evidence on the effects of crop rotation on crop yield (1354) and soil health (1368) in Mediterranean farmland. However, it does not contain any information regarding the social, cultural, or political factors that might influence farmers' decisions to adopt this practice.",

    "question": "How does installing solar panels over arable fields for agrivoltaics affect pest numbers and pollination services in the Mediterranean?",
    "answer": "This question cannot be answered as none of the actions in the database are relevant to this topic. The database details many on-farm interventions like planting flowers (1406) or hedgerows (1407) to support pollinators, and using cover crops to manage pests (1394), but there are no actions or studies related to agrivoltaics or the installation of solar panels.",

    "question": "Which farm management strategies offer the best resilience to the increased frequency of wildfires projected under future climate change scenarios in the Mediterranean?",
    "answer": "This question is unanswerable using the provided evidence. While the database assesses the effects of many farm management strategies on factors like water availability and soil health, none of the studies or key messages mention wildfire risk, prevention, or resilience. Furthermore, the evidence is based on past studies and does not make projections about future climate change scenarios.",
