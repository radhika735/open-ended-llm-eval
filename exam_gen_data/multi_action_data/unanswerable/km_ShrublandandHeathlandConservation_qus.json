    "answer": "This question cannot be answered from the provided text. While several actions for controlling grass are discussed (e.g., cutting/mowing, using herbicides, prescribed burning), the evidence base does not contain any information on the financial costs or cost-effectiveness of these interventions.",

    "answer": "This question cannot be answered by the provided text. The document describes studies on adding sulphur (1691, 1710), but the reported effects are on heather cover or seedlings over a short timeframe, with one study noting survival was very low after just two years. No long-term data exceeding 20 years is available in the synopsis.",
