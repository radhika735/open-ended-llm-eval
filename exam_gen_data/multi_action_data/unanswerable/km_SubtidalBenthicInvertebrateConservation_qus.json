    "question": "What is the most cost-effective method for restoring oyster reefs?",
    "answer": "The provided evidence does not contain information on the cost-effectiveness of any interventions. While Action 2248 describes various methods for restoring oyster reefs and their effects on invertebrates, it does not evaluate the financial costs associated with these methods, making it impossible to determine the most cost-effective approach.",

    "question": "Does reducing underwater noise pollution from military sonar benefit subtidal benthic worm populations?",
    "answer": "The provided text does not contain any studies that have examined the effects of reducing underwater noise pollution from sonar on subtidal benthic invertebrates. While there is an action related to ceasing shipping (2086), this does not specifically address sonar noise, and no other actions are relevant to this type of disturbance.",

    "question": "What is the optimal size for a Marine Protected Area to ensure the recovery of scallop populations?",
    "answer": "The provided evidence does not contain information on the optimal size for Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). While several actions (e.g., 2224, 2277) examine the effects of MPAs or ceasing scallop harvesting on scallop populations, the key messages focus on the duration of protection and the presence of restrictions, not on the spatial extent required for conservation success.",

    "question": "Is creating artificial reefs more beneficial for overall invertebrate diversity than translocating corals?",
    "answer": "The provided evidence base cannot answer this question. The studies for creating artificial reefs (2258) and translocating corals (2246) were conducted independently, in different locations, and did not directly compare these two interventions. There is no common metric or comparative study within the database to determine which action is more beneficial for invertebrate diversity.",
