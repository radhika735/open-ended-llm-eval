    "question": "What is the impact of sowing native grass and forb seeds on pollinator populations such as bees and butterflies?",
    "answer": "This question cannot be answered using the provided text. The database exclusively documents the effects of conservation actions on 'grassland vegetation,' such as plant community composition, species richness, and abundance. None of the actions, including 'Sow native grass and forbs' (3432), contain any information or studies regarding impacts on fauna, including pollinators.",

    "question": "Which is more cost-effective for increasing plant species richness: using slot/strip seeding or removing topsoil before seeding?",
    "answer": "This question is unanswerable as the provided synopses do not contain any data on the financial costs or cost-effectiveness of the conservation actions. While the text describes the ecological outcomes for 'Use slot/strip seeding' (3411) and 'Remove topsoil or turf before seeding/planting' (3415), there is no information to facilitate an economic comparison between them.",

    "question": "How does using prescribed fire to prepare a site before seeding affect the establishment of native prairie plants?",
    "answer": "The provided text cannot answer this question because it does not contain any actions or studies related to the use of prescribed fire as a site preparation method before seeding. The database details other preparation techniques such as soil disturbance (3413), herbicide application (3418), and removing topsoil (3415), but the specific action of using fire is not included.",

    "question": "What is the long-term effect of adding fertilizer to soil on grassland carbon sequestration rates?",
    "answer": "This question cannot be answered from the document. The synopsis for action 3427, 'Add fertilizer to soil before or after seeding/planting', only details impacts on vegetation community, abundance, and plant survival. Broader ecosystem functions like long-term carbon sequestration rates are not measured or mentioned in any of the provided study summaries.",
