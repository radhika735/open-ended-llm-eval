    "question": "What are the different outcomes for vegetation when restoring freshwater marshes on former cropland, comparing passive abandonment with active water level management?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests different outcomes depending on the approach. Passively abandoning cropland can allow the plant community to become more like a natural marsh over time, with increased species richness and biomass (2952). In contrast, actively raising the water level to restore marshes can increase the extent of marsh vegetation but may also reduce overall plant species richness and vegetation cover, and can lead to dominance by a non-native species (3198).",

Cutting or mowing can increase native vegetation abundance in some cases, while other studies found no significant effect on native species (3104). Herbicide use presents a trade-off; it can increase native plant abundance and richness, but one study found it eliminated all living native plants one year after application (3120).",

    "answer": "Creating new salt marshes yields mixed success in replicating natural vegetation. Restoring tidal exchange can result in similar plant species richness to natural marshes within a decade, but the overall plant community may remain distinct for up to 30 years and vegetation cover is often lower (3207). Conversely, creating marshes by depositing sediment and planting vegetation can achieve similar vegetation cover to natural marshes within a few years, but the overall plant community composition can remain very different from natural marshes (3195).",

While it can increase the total area of marsh vegetation, some studies found it led to lower overall plant species richness, diversity, and vegetation cover (3026, 3198). In one case, restoration led to dominance by a non-native shrub (3026).

In contrast, prescribed fire has a 'trade-off between benefits and harms' rating. Its effect on species richness is inconsistent across studies, with some reporting increases, some decreases, and others no effect. Fire can reduce vegetation height and woody plant cover but has mixed effects on dominant herbaceous species (3054).

    "answer": "Facilitating tidal exchange on former farmland is a beneficial method that can increase the area of salt marsh vegetation over 3-10 years, though the resulting plant community may differ from natural marshes for many years (3207). Another likely beneficial approach is to deposit sediment to create the physical structure, which can then be colonized by salt marsh plants (3236). Combining sediment deposition with the introduction of vegetation is also likely to be beneficial, potentially achieving vegetation cover and cordgrass abundance similar to natural marshes within 1-9 years (3195). Simply planting non-woody plants into a prepared area is also considered beneficial and can increase biomass compared to unplanted areas, although the vegetation structure might take time to resemble a natural marsh (3257).",

Swamps recovering on abandoned aquaculture ponds had shorter canopies and smaller tree basal area after 14 years, despite higher tree density (2983). Similarly, restoring tidal exchange can result in smaller tree basal area after 10-11 years (3037). Creating swamps by reprofiling sediment and planting can result in forests with shorter canopies and thinner trees for 17-30 years, though tree density can be higher than in mature forests (3216). Directly planting trees can also result in shorter vegetation with a smaller basal area for 5-30 years compared to mature forests (3259).

Planting mangrove trees or propagules can successfully establish new forest areas, which over several years to decades may develop similar species richness and density to natural forests.

Conversely, excluding livestock can also be beneficial. Excluding cattle from a historically grazed saline swamp led to taller and faster-growing mangrove trees with more seedlings (2969).
