    "question": "What is the evidence for the effectiveness of providing artificial nest boxes for different types of bees, such as solitary bees, bumblebees, and stingless bees?",
    "answer": "Evidence varies by bee type. Many species of solitary bees readily occupy artificial nest boxes made from hollow stems or drilled wood blocks (47). For bumblebees, underground nest boxes are most effective, with studies showing 6-58% occupancy, whereas wooden surface boxes have very low uptake rates of 0-2.5% in recent UK trials (48). For stingless bees, one trial found no uptake of artificial nest boxes (49).",

    "answer": "Sowing field margins with native wildflower mixes (19) or agricultural nectar and pollen mixes (18) has been shown in multiple trials to attract significantly more foraging bumblebees than grassy or cropped margins. Leaving margins to naturally regenerate can also support more bumblebees than cropped margins, but the value can be inconsistent and reliant on weed species (20). Evidence for the benefit of simple grass strips is mixed (14).",

    "question": "Do conservation actions on farmland have different recorded effects on bumblebees versus solitary bees?",
    "answer": "Yes, for many actions on farmland, the evidence base is focused on bumblebees. For example, sowing field margins with agricultural nectar mixes (18) or native wildflower mixes (19) has been shown to benefit bumblebees, but for both actions, no evidence has been captured on their effects on solitary bees. Similarly, increasing areas of rough grassland was shown to attract queen bumblebees, but the effect on solitary bees was not mentioned (12).",

    "answer": "The evidence is mixed. While four trials in Europe showed enhanced bee diversity or abundance on land under agri-environment schemes, four other trials found no such enhancement. At a wider landscape scale, two UK trials found that bumblebee populations were not enhanced on farmland managed under these schemes (24). However, a separate large trial found a positive correlation between the abundance of long-tongued bumblebees and the number of pollen and nectar schemes in a 10 km grid square (21).",

    "question": "How effective are artificial nest boxes for different types of bees, and what are the key considerations for their design?",
    "answer": "Many species of solitary bee readily nest in artificial sites like hollow stems or drilled wood blocks (47). For bumblebees, uptake rates of nest boxes are often low, particularly for surface-level designs, with underground boxes being more effective (48). One trial for stingless bees found no uptake of nest boxes at all (49). For solitary bees, nest box design can impact productivity, with reed stem and grooved-board boxes performing better than plastic-lined types due to lower parasitism and mould (47).",

    "answer": "Sowing uncropped field margins with a native wildflower seed mix generally supports a higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees compared to grassy or naturally regenerated margins (19). Sowing an agricultural nectar and pollen mix also attracts significantly more foraging bumblebees than grassy or naturally regenerated margins (18). Simply leaving margins to naturally regenerate can attract more bumblebees than cropped margins, but the benefit is inconsistent and relies on weed species (20). Providing grass strips has mixed results (14), while leaving field margins unsprayed within the crop (conservation headlands) does not appear to attract more foraging bumblebees (29). A trade-off is that agricultural mixes may degrade in value over a few years and need re-sowing (18).",

    "answer": "Several methods have been tested with varying success. Using a sticky barrier to exclude introduced European earwigs from solitary bee nest boxes was successful, reducing earwig numbers and increasing nest use by native bees (44). In another case, attempting to eradicate invasive European buff-tailed bumblebees by catching them led to an increase in native bumblebee numbers, but failed to eradicate the invasive species (38). For invasive Africanized honey bees, providing insecticide-laced syrup was shown to kill colonies (38). Conversely, an attempt to control the spread of the invasive small hive beetle using mite-killing strips in honey bee transport packages was not effective (41).",

    "question": "What are the main challenges associated with captive rearing and reintroducing bumblebee colonies?",
    "answer": "A key challenge in captive rearing is achieving successful reproduction; factors like pollen diet and artificial hibernation regimes significantly influence success (50). While several species have been reared in captivity, attempts to rear some declining species have failed (50). Upon reintroduction to the wild, a major challenge is low productivity, with some trials showing that released colonies produce very few or no new queens (52). Social parasitism by cuckoo bees is another significant problem, with high rates of infestation reported in some reintroduction trials (52). Additionally, translocating established colonies can result in queen death and reduced colony productivity (53).",

    "answer": "Sowing margins with native wildflowers supports a higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees compared to grassy or naturally regenerated margins [19]. Sowing with an agricultural nectar and pollen mix also attracts significantly more foraging bumblebees than grassy or naturally regenerated margins, and may attract more than wildflower mixes in the first year, but their value can degrade over time [18]. In contrast, leaving margins to naturally regenerate can attract more bumblebees than cropped margins, but the value is inconsistent and depends on weed species [20]. Providing grass strips shows mixed results [14], and unsprayed conservation headlands do not appear to attract more foraging bumblebees than conventional crop fields [29].",
