    "question": "What are the effects on Atlantic salmon growth when replacing traditional fish meal and fish oil in their diet with alternative sources?",
    "answer": "Evidence is mixed. Replacing fish meal with plant-based protein has led to both decreased and similar growth rates in different studies (924). Diets with bacterial protein showed mixed results depending on the concentration (918), while krill meal resulted in similar weight gain (916). Replacing fish oil with vegetable oil generally resulted in similar or sometimes higher growth rates (926). However, one study showed that salmon on a fishmeal diet weighed more than those on diets with alternative proteins (922).",

For sea lice, fallowing cages (1026), feeding probiotics (732), and using low-intensity lighting (741) have been found to reduce numbers, while cleaner wrasse show mixed results (738). For other diseases, vaccinations have increased survival against several bacteria (733), breeding for resistance has been effective against infectious pancreatic necrosis (735), and aerobic training increased survival in salmon exposed to the same disease (740).",
