    "answer": "A range of methods are likely to be beneficial for controlling Procambarus crayfish. These include trapping with food bait (1029), combining trapping with the encouragement of predators like eels and pike (1031), sterilizing males using X-rays (1032), and adding the chemical pyrethrum to the water (1036). Creating physical barriers can also effectively contain their spread (1037).",
