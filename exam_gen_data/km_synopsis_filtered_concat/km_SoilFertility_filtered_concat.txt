711: Encourage foraging waterfowl
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Key Messages:
One controlled, replicated experiment from the USA found increased straw decomposition when ducks were allowed to forage.
SOIL TYPE COVERED: Silty clay
 

Synopsis Details:
Title: Soil Fertility
Description: Soils Synopsis
892: Amend the soil with non-chemical minerals and mineral wastes
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:
Two replicated studies from Australia and New Zealand measured the effects of adding minerals and mineral wastes to the soil. Both found reduced nutrient loss and one study found reduced erosion.
 
SOIL TYPES COVERED: Sandy clay, silt loam.

893: Change the timing of manure application
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:
One controlled, randomized, replicated site comparison study from the UK found less nitrate was lost from the soil when manure application was delayed from autumn until December or January.
SOIL TYPE COVERED: sandy-loam.

900: Incorporate leys into crop rotation
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Key Messages:
One replicated study from Denmark showed that reducing the extent of grass pasture in leys reduced the undesirable uptake of nitrogen by grasses, therefore requiring lower rates of fertilizer for subsequent crops.
SOIL TYPE COVERED: sandy-loam.

901: Reduce grazing intensity
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Key Messages:
Compaction: One replicated study from Australia found compacted soils recovered when sheep were excluded for 2.5 years. 
Erosion: Two replicated studies from New Zealand and Syria (one also controlled) measured the effect of grazing animals on soil nutrient and sediment loss. Of these, one trial found increased soil carbon and nitrogen when grazing animals were excluded. One trial found higher soil phosphate levels, and less sediment erosion when grazing time in forage crops was reduced.
 
SOIL TYPES COVERED: clay, clay-loamy, loamy, silt loam.

903: Use alley cropping
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Key Messages:
A controlled, randomized, replicated study from Canada found that intercropping with trees resulted in a higher diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.
SOIL TYPES COVERED: sandy-loam.

Description: Soils Synopsis
904: Reduce fertilizer, pesticide or herbicide use generally
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be ineffective or harmful
Key Messages:
Biodiversity: Two site comparison studies from Italy and Pakistan (one also replicated) found a higher diversity of soil invertebrates and microorganisms in low-input systems.
Nutrient loss: One study from Canada found lower nutrient levels and yields in low-input systems.
 
SOIL TYPES COVERED: coarse sandy, loam, sandy-loam, and silt.

Description: Soils Synopsis
905: Restore or create low input grasslands
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Key Messages:
One randomized, replicated trial in the Netherlands and one controlled trial from France found that restoring grasslands increased the diversity of soil animals. One trial also found higher microbial biomass, activity and carbon under grassland.
 
SOIL TYPES COVERED: sandy-loam, silty.

Description: Soils Synopsis
908: Amend the soil with crops grown as green manures
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:
Two controlled, randomized, replicated studies from India and Pakistan found higher soil organic carbon, or increased grain yields when green manures were grown.
SOIL TYPES COVERED: Clay loam.
