1889: Amphibians: Formulate larval diets to improve development or survival to adulthood
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

One randomized, replicated, controlled study in the USA found that tadpoles had a higher body mass and reached a more advanced developmental stage when fed a control diet (rabbit chow and fish food) or freshwater algae, compared to those fed pine or oak pollen. Tadpoles fed only pine or oak pollen did not undergo metamorphosis.
One randomised, replicated study in Portugal found that tadpoles reared on a diet containing 46% protein had higher growth rates, survival and body weights at metamorphosis compared to diets containing less protein.

1900: Carnivores: Feed commercially prepared diets
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

One replicated, before-and-after study in the USA found that providing a commercial diet to maned wolves led to similar dry matter intake and digestibility despite having a lower protein content.
One replicated, randomized study of African wildcats in the USA found that feeding a commercial diet decreased crude protein digestibility and increased food intake and faecal output compared to raw meat. One controlled study of African wildcats in the USA found lower organic matter digestibility compared to a ground-chicken diet.
One replicated, controlled study in South Africa found that cheetahs fed a commercial diet had a similar likelihood of developing gastritis as those fed horse meat, lower levels of blood protein urea but higher levels of creatine. One study in USA found that cheetahs fed a commercial meat diet or whole chicken carcasses had plasma a-tocopherol, retinol and taurine concentrations within the ranges recommended for domestic cats.
