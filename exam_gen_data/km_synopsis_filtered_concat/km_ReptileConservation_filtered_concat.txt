Behaviour change (4 studies): One replicated, controlled study in the USA1 found that reducing the intensity of light sources did not improve loggerhead turtle hatchling seaward orientation. One replicated, site comparison study in Malaysia4 found that green turtle hatchlings in low and moderate ambient artificial light took more direct crawl routes to the sea than hatchlings released in high ambient artificial light. One replicated, controlled study in the USA3 found that in laboratory trials, loggerhead and green turtle hatchlings showed reduced preference for lower intensity light sources. One replicated, site comparison study in the USA2 found mixed effects of embedding streetlights in the road on seaward orientation of loggerhead turtle hatchlings compared to overhead lighting depending on shading by shrubs and weather and lunar phase.

Human behaviour change (3 studies): One replicated study in Colombia found that in areas with conservation initiatives relating to turtles, more people reported changing consumption habitats and fewer people reported using turtles for food compared to in areas with no initiatives, however, stated rates of hunting, buying and selling of turtles remained similar. One study in Saint Kitts found that attending an educational summer camp on turtle conservation had mixed effects on reported behaviours in relation to sea turtles of attendees and their parents/guardians, and mixed effects on whether they took part in conservation activities after the camp. One study in the USA found that providing an information leaflet did not decrease the number of hotel rooms that left lights on at night compared to when no leaflet was provided.

Seven studies evaluated the effects of using holding pens or enclosures at release sites prior to release of wild reptiles. Four studies were in the USA and one study was in each of Australia, New Zealand and the UK.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (5 STUDIES)

Reproductive success (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in New Zealand found that in a site where jewelled geckos were translocated into holding pens prior to release, more gravid females were found compared to a site where holding pens were not used.
Survival (4 studies): Two of three controlled studies (including one replicated study) in the USA and the UK found that gopher tortoises translocated into holding pens with artificial burrows prior to release or viviparous lizards released into an enclosure had higher survival (recaptured) or assumed survival (dug burrows) than individuals released without pens or enclosures. The other study found that translocating eastern box turtles into holding pens, or keeping them in pens for longer, did not affect post-release survival. One replicated study in the USA found that survival of Florida sand skinks within holding pens with different combinations of habitat features (trees, shade cloth, woody debris) ranged from 49–79% over two years.
Condition (1 study): One randomized, controlled study in the UK found that viviparous lizards released into an enclosure had similar body condition compared to those released without an enclosure.

BEHAVIOUR (4 STUDIES)

Behaviour change (4 studies): Two of three controlled studies (including two replicated studies) in the USA and New Zealand found that gopher tortoises and jewelled geckos translocated into holding pens prior to release dispersed away from the release site less frequently than those not held in pens. One study also found that the activity area of tortoises held in pens was smaller in the year of release, but similar in the year after release, compared to those not held in pens. The other study found that translocating eastern box turtles into holding pens, or keeping them in pens for longer, did not affect post-release dispersal behaviour. One controlled study in Australia found mixed effects on a range of behavioural measures of translocating pygmy bluetongue lizards into holding pens with artificial burrows for one day compared to five days.

Behaviour change (4 studies): Two controlled studies (including one replicated study) in Australia found mixed effects on movement behaviour and home range size of translocating problem tiger snakes and dugite snakes compared to resident snakes. One randomized, controlled study in Canada found that translocated massasauga rattlesnakes moved further from release points after two days than snakes released at their point of capture, but distances were similar after 18 days. One controlled study in the USA found that the home ranges of problem Gila monsters translocated &gt;1 km were similar in size to those translocated &lt;1 km.

OTHER (5 STUDIES)

Human-wildlife conflict (5 studies): Three of five controlled studies (including three replicated studies) in the USA, Australia, Canada and Hong Kong of translocations of problem Gila monsters, tiger snakes and western rattlesnakes found that at least some returned to their point of capture or moved in to adjacent suburban areas within a month. One of the studies found that while all problem Gila monsters translocated &lt;1 km returned to their point of capture, none of those translocated &gt;1 km returned. The other two studies found that no massasauga rattlesnakes or problem white-lipped pit vipers returned to their point of capture.

Two of the studies also found that fewer nests relocated to hatcheries were lost to erosion or predation compared to natural nests. One of the studies also found that hatching success was similar following immediate relocation compared to delayed but careful relocation. Four studies (including one replicated, randomized study) in Malaysia, Mexico, Costa Rica and Mauritius reported that hatching success of sea turtle eggs and nests relocated to hatcheries ranged from 35–78%. One study also found that hatching success was not affected by the number of eggs in the nest. Three studies (including one randomized replicated study) in the USA, Malaysia and Mexico found that sea turtle nests relocated to hatcheries had similar hatching success compared to those relocated for artificial incubation. One study also found that handling eggs during the first five days did not affect hatching success. One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in Costa Rica found that leatherback turtle nests relocated to a hatchery or to other parts of the beach (results combined) had similar hatching success compared to natural nests. One replicated, controlled study in Turkey found that hatching success was similar if nests were relocated 0–18 h after laying.

POPULATION RESPONSE (12 STUDIES)

Reproductive success (12 studies): One of four controlled studies (including three replicated studies) in Suriname, the Dominican Republic, the USA found that kemp’s ridley nests relocated for artificial incubation had higher hatching success than natural nests. One of the studies found that leatherback turtle nests relocated for artificial incubation had lower hatching success than natural nests. One of the studies found that hawksbill turtle nests relocated for artificial incubation had similar hatching success compared to natural nests. The other study found that hatching success of leatherback and green turtle nests relocated for artificially incubation was similar to natural nests above the high tide line and may have been higher than for natural nests washed over by sea swells. This study also found higher embryo mortality in artificially incubated nests compared to natural nests. Three studies (including one randomized, controlled study) in the USA, Mexico and Malaysia found that loggerhead, olive ridley and leatherback turtle nests relocated for artificial incubation had similar hatching success compared to nests relocated to an on-beach hatchery. One study also found that careful handling of eggs during the first five days of incubation did not affect hatching success. Four studies (including one replicated study) in Surinam, Ascension Island and Costa Rica, the Cayman Islands, the USA and Mexico reported that hatching success of green, loggerhead and olive ridley turtle nests relocated for artificial incubation varied from 26% to &gt;90%. One study also reported that hatching success from two trials was 30% and 58% in foam-packed boxes and 26% and 48% in sand-packed boxes. One study also reported that hatching success was 60–89% in 14 of 18 years. One replicated, randomized, controlled study in Costa Rica found that olive ridley turtle eggs artificially incubated in low oxygen conditions had lower hatching success than those in normal oxygen conditions.

Reproductive success (16 studies): Two of three replicated controlled studies (including one randomized study) in Brazil, Venezuela and the USA found that Hilaire’s side-necked turtle and bog turtle nests relocated for artificial incubation had higher hatching success, or likely had higher success, than natural nests.The other study found that yellow-headed sideneck turtle nests relocated for artificial incubation had lower hatching success than natural nests and nests moved to an on-beach hatchery. One replicated study in the Galápagos reported that hatching success of five subspecies of giant tortoise nests relocated for artificial incubation was 35–100%, compared to 76–85% for natural nests of two sub species. Six of eight studies (including four replicated studies) in the USA and China reported that hatching success for artificially incubated eggs, including eggs recovered from road-killed turtles, was 60–97%, or that 314 hatchlings emerged, and 14 eggs did not hatch. One study also found that eggs collected from the wild had similar hatching success compared to oxytocin-induced eggs. The other two studies reported that hatching success of eggs or clutches was 39–54%. One replicated study in the Galápagos reported that hatching success of giant tortoise nests relocated for artificial incubation may have been higher for nests relocated longer after laying. One replicated study in the USA found that high levels of CO2 during artificial incubation of pond slider and Mississippi map turtle eggs resulted in lower hatching success compared to low CO2. One replicated, randomized study in China found that hatching success of artificially incubated Chinese three-keeled pond turtle eggs was similar across all temperatures tested. One randomized study in the USA found that hatching success of artificially incubated snapping turtle eggs was highest at intermediate levels of soil moisture.
Survival (3 studies): Two studies (including one replicated study) in the USA reported that after relocating smooth softshell turtle and gopher tortoise nests for artificial incubation, two of 314 and three of 36 hatchlings died soon after emergence. One randomized study in the USA found that survival of artificially incubated snapping turtle hatchlings was lower at high soil moisture levels compared to intermediate moisture levels.
Condition (4 studies): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in Brazil found that Hilaire’s side-necked turtle nests relocated for artificial incubation produced heavier hatchlings that were larger in four of five measures compared to hatchlings from natural nests. Two replicated studies (including one randomized study) in China found that modifying incubation temperatures of Chinese three-keeled pond turtle or Asian yellow pond turtle eggs had mixed effects on hatchling size and mobility or different effects on growth depending on the population eggs were sourced from. One replicated study in Thailand found that artificially incubating snail-eating turtle eggs at higher temperatures resulted in more embryos with physical deformities.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (6 STUDIES)

Reproductive success (6 studies): Two studies (including one before-and-after study) on Reunion Island and Jamaica found that the number of Reunion day gecko eggs and Jamaican iguana hatchlings at artificial nesting sites increased over time. One of two replicated, controlled studies in Canada and the USA found that hatching success of eggs from four species of freshwater turtle moved to artificial nest sites was higher than for eggs left in natural sites.
