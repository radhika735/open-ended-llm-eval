11: Reduce tillage
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Key Messages:
Evidence on whether reduced tillage or no tillage benefits ground-nesting bees is mixed. Two replicated trials on squash Cucurbita spp. farms in the USA had contrasting results. One showed no difference in the abundance of bees between tilled and untilled farms, the other found three times more squash bees Peponapis pruinosa on no-till farms than on conventional farms.

16: Increase the use of clover leys on farmland
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Key Messages:
We have captured no evidence that increasing the use of clover leys can enhance wild bee populations. One replicated trial in Germany showed that fields planted with a white clover grass mixture do not attract solitary bees to nest preferentially on site. A trial in Switzerland showed that if white clover is mowed during flowering, injuries and mortality of bees can be reduced by avoiding the use of a processor attached to the mower.

17: Plant dedicated floral resources on farmland
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Key Messages:
Fourteen trials in Europe and North America have recorded substantial numbers of wild bees foraging on perennial or annual sown flowering plants in the agricultural environment.
Ten trials (eight replicated) have monitored bees foraging on patches sown with a high proportion of phacelia Phacelia tanacetifolia on farmland and all but one found substantial numbers of foraging wild (non-Apis) bees, particularly bumblebees Bombus spp. Six of these trials recorded the number of foraging bee species, which ranged from eight to 35. One replicated trial shows that phacelia is not very attractive to wild bees in Greece.
One replicated controlled trial in the UK showed that planted perennial leguminous herbs, including clovers, were more attractive to bumblebees in landscapes with a greater proportion of arable farming.
Four replicated trials have quantified the wider response of wild bee populations to planted flower patches by measuring reproductive success, numbers of nesting bees or numbers foraging in the surrounding landscape. One trial showed that planted patches of bigleaf lupine Lupinus polyphyllus in commercial apple orchards in Novia Scotia, Canada, significantly enhanced the reproductive success of blue orchard mason bees Osmia lignaria. One trial in the Netherlands showed that bee numbers and species richness are not higher in farmland 50-1,500 m away from planted flower patches. Two trials in Germany found no or relatively few species of solitary bee nesting on set-aside fields sown with phacelia or clover respectively.

1: Plant parks and gardens with appropriate flowers
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Key Messages:
Two replicated trials in the USA and Canada have found more wild bees (either more species or more individuals) in gardens planted with bee forage or native plants, relative to conventionally managed gardens. Another USA trial found more bee species after the addition of bee forage plants to a community garden. Three trials in the UK or USA have shown that native flowering plants or bee forage plants are well used by wild bees when planted in gardens. A UK trial demonstrated that some popular non-native or horticulturally modified garden flowers are not frequently visited by insects, despite providing nectar in some cases.

22: Reduce the intensity of farmland meadow management
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Key Messages:
Four replicated trials in Europe have compared farmland meadows managed extensively with conventionally farmed meadows or silage fields. Two found enhanced numbers and diversity of wild bees on meadows with a delayed first cut and little agrochemical use. Two found no difference in bee diversity or abundance between conventional meadows and meadows with reduced fertilizer use or cutting intensity.

Key Messages:
We can find no evidence of the impact of reduced honey-hunting or improved harvesting methods on wild honey bee populations.

33: Replace honey-hunting with apiculture
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Key Messages:
 

One study reported that a programme to enhance take-up of stingless beekeeping in southern Mexico increased the number of managed colonies in the area.
Five trials contributed to scientific improvement of stingless beekeeping methods. Two controlled trials showed that either brewer's yeast (one trial) or a mix with 25% pollen collected by honey bees Apis mellifera (one trial) can be used as a pollen substitute to feed Scaptotrigona postica in times of pollen scarcity. A study on the island of Tobago found a wooden hive design with separate, different-shaped honey and brood chambers allowed honey to be extracted without damaging the brood. One trial showed that 50 g of comb with mature pupae is enough to start a new daughter colony of S. mexicana. One trial found brood growth was higher in traditional log hives than in box hives with internal volumes exceeding 14 litres, and recommended smaller box hives.
We have captured no clear evidence about whether these activities help conserve bees or enhance native bee populations.

54: Rear and manage populations of solitary bees
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Key Messages:
Several species of solitary bee in the family Megachilidae are reared and managed commercially as pollinators, mostly for the forage crop alfalfa, or fruit trees. These species readily nest in drilled wooden blocks, or stacked grooved boards of wood or polystyrene. Parasites and pathogens can be problematic and a number of control methods have been developed. Rearing methods have been investigated for two other species not yet commercially managed and one replicated trial shows that temperature regimes are important to survival. If rearing for conservation purposes is to be attempted, we would recommend a systematic review of these methods.
Three management trials with megachilids not commercially managed in the USA or Poland, and a review of studies of managed species, found that local populations can increase up to six-fold in one year under management if conditions are good and plentiful floral resources are provided.
Two replicated trials have reared solitary bees on artificial diets. One found high larval mortality in Osmia cornuta reared on artificial pollen-based diets, including honey bee-collected pollen. The other found Megachile rotundata could be reared on an artificial diet based on honey bee-collected pollen, but bees reared on synthetic pollen substitutes either died or had low pre-pupal weight.

912: Use prescribed burning to control lantana <i>Lantana camara</i>
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Key Messages:

One controlled study from Australia found lantana plants in a fire-treated area were smaller and less abundant than an unburned area. One randomized, replicated, controlled trial from India found burned lantana produced fewer new shoots than plants cut to ground level. One replicated site comparison from Australia found lantana in a forest burned every three years produced fewer fruits and seeds, had higher seedling mortality and slower growth rates but more flowering individuals than plants in other lantana-invaded habitats managed by grazing or mechanical control.
One randomized, replicated, controlled greenhouse trial in India found more lantana seeds germinated and germination rates were higher when seeds were exposed to smoke than seeds not exposed to smoke.
One randomized, replicated, controlled trial from Australia found two native tree species had higher germination and seedling survival when lantana was burned.
