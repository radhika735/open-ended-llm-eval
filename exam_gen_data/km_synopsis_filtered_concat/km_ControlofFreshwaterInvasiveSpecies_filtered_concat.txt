Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Key Messages:

A replicated, controlled laboratory study in the USA found that movements of invasive freshwater shrimp slowed down or stopped when they were placed in water that had been exposed to different species of predatory fish, compared to those not exposed to fish. 
A replicated laboratory study in the UK found carbonating the water stunned invasive killer shrimp.

Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Key Messages:

A controlled laboratory study in the UK found that iodine solution, acetic acid, Virkon S and sodium hypochlorite added to freshwater killed invasive killer shrimp, but were considered impractical for field application. Methanol, citric acid, urea, hydrogen peroxide and sucrose did not kill invasive killer shrimp when added to freshwater.

1101: Skunk cabbage:  Physical removal
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Key Messages:

A study in Switzerland found that annual physical removal of recently established skunk cabbage plants over five years removed the entire stock. 
A study in the Netherlands found that manual removal of mature skunk cabbage plants was effective for a small outbreak of a small-growing plant.
A study in Germany reported that after the first four years of a twice yearly full removal programme of skunk cabbage, a large number of plants still needed to be removed each year.

1117: Asian clams: Use gas-impermeable barriers
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Key Messages:

A controlled study in North America found that placing gas-impermeable barriers across the bottom of the lake (several small fabric covers or one large cover) significantly reduced the abundance of Asian clams.

1119: Asian clams: Clean equipment
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Key Messages:

A study in Portugal found that mechanical removal and regular cleaning of industrial pipes or addition of a sand filter were effective methods of permanently removing or reducing numbers of Asian clams, respectively.

1120: Asian clams: Mechanical removal
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Key Messages:

A replicated, controlled, before-and after trial in North America found that suction dredging reduced Asian clam densities within the sediment by 96% over two weeks and that the reduction persisted for a year.
A replicated, controlled, before-and-after field trial in Ireland found that three types of dredges were equally effective at removing Asian clams, resulting in a biomass reduction ranging from 74% to &gt;95%, and an density reduction ranging from 65% to 95%.

Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Key Messages:

A replicated laboratory and field study in South America found that the South American weevil caused more feeding lesions on floating pennywort than on any other plant species, but field results found that the weevil did not reduce floating pennywort biomass.
