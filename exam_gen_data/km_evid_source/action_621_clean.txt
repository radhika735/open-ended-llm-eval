621: Release captive-bred individuals into the wild to restore or augment wild populations of cranes
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Key Messages:

Four studies of five release programmes from the USA and Russia, from a total of eight programmes, found that released cranes had high survival or bred in the wild. Two studies from two release programmes in the USA found low survival of captive-bred eggs fostered to wild birds, compared with wild eggs, or a failure to increase the wild flock size.
A worldwide review found that releases of migratory species only tended to be successful if birds were released into existing flocks, with higher success for non-migratory populations.
One study from the USA found that birds released as sub-adults had higher survival than birds cross-fostered to wild birds.
One study from the USA found that 73% of all mortalities occurred in the first year after release.
