565: Restrict certain pesticides
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

A small scale study in the UK found that      using the fungicides Propiconazole and Triadimefon reduced chick food      insect abundance less than using Pyrazophos. A replicated, controlled      trial in Switzerland found that applying metaldehyde slug pellets in a 50 cm band      along the field edge adjacent to wildflower strips provided equivalent      crop protection to broadcasting the pellets across the whole field.
