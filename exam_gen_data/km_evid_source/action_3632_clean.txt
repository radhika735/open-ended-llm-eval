3632: Leave woody debris in forests after logging
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Key Messages:

Six studies evaluated the effects of leaving woody debris in forests after logging on reptile populations. All six studies were in the USA.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (5 STUDIES)

Richness/diversity (5 studies): Four of five studies (including four replicated, randomized, controlled studies) in the USA found that leaving or removing woody debris did not affect the richness of reptile species, or immigrating reptiles. The other study found that areas where woody debris was left in place had higher reptile species richness than areas where debris was cleared and burned. Three replicated, randomized, controlled studies in the USA found that leaving or removing woody debris did not affect reptile species diversity or overall reptile and amphibian species diversity.

POPULATION RESPONSE (5 STUDIES)

Abundance (5 studies): Four of five studies (including three replicated, randomized, controlled studies) in the USA found that leaving or removing woody debris did not affect the abundance of reptiles, snakes, snakes and lizards or immigrating reptiles. The other study found that areas where woody debris was left in place had higher reptile abundance than areas where debris was cleared and burned.
