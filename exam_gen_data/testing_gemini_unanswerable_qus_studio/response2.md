Added structured outputs. This included property ordering but don't know why the response didn't have these ordered? Also it only generated one question. Weird?
Prompt same as response1.

Attached is a file containing conservation actions, their effectiveness and key messages relating to them. This has been gathered by hand and forms part of the Conservation Evidence living evidence database. Each action is prefixed with a numerical id.
You will be generating synthetic questions for use in an experiment. Generate four questions which CANNOT be answered by any of the actions in this database. Keep the questions short. Include a model answer to this question, explaining clearly why the question is unanswerable.

Here are some example reasons why a particular question may be unanswerable:
a) Answering the question requires drawing on actions for which there has been no supporting evidence.
b) The question asks about a factor which is not recorded in the database (e.g. cost-effectiveness)
c) None of the actions in the database are relevant enough to answer the question.
d) The question is too broad / not relevant to the database.

Potential question types:
a) Effects/outcomes of specific conservation actions
b) Actions to achieve specific conservation objectives/outcomes
c) Alternatives to achieve a particular conservation goal
d) Trade-offs between different conservation actions
e) Geographical and contextual variations in action effectiveness
f) Scaling of actions and their impacts
g) Timeframes for expected outcomes
h) Factors associated with success or failure of conservation efforts

{"answer":"The database provides effectiveness ratings for various conservation actions, such as clearing vegetation (761), creating ponds (866), and restoring ponds (878), which have been shown to benefit natterjack toads. However, it contains no information on the financial costs associated with implementing these actions, making it impossible to determine which is the most cost-effective.","question":"What is the most cost-effective method for increasing natterjack toad populations?"}
