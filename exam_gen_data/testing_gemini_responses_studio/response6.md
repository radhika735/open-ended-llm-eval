Including the line "- these do not have to be exactly the same as the action ids used to generate the answer" had an effect. In ALL of the questions there was either one extra action ID that was in the question but not in the answer or vice versa. May be worth including "it can be but does not have to be".

# Prompt: #
Attached is a file containing conservation actions, their effectiveness and key messages relating to them. This has been gathered by hand and forms part of the Conservation Evidence living evidence database. Each action is prefixed with a numerical id.
You will be generating synthetic questions for use in an experiment. Generate four questions which requires drawing on multiple actions from this database. Also include a short model answer using only the evidence database provided. Cite the action id in your model answers. Also include a list of the action ids used to generate that question - these do not have to be exactly the same as the action ids used to generate the answer. Keep the questions short and similar in style to the following example questions but vary the species and actions:
Which predatory fish species are most effective at controlling invasive crayfish populations in European freshwater systems?
Which conservation intervention can reduce the negative effects of artificial light pollution on nocturnal bat species' activity patterns?
What actions are most effective for mitigating the impacts of offshore wind farms for biodiversity?
What are the most beneficial actions I can take on agricultural land to improve impacts on pollinators and other aspects of biodiversity?
Potential question types:
a) Effects/outcomes of specific conservation actions
b) Actions to achieve specific conservation objectives/outcomes
c) Alternatives to achieve a particular conservation goal
d) Trade-offs between different conservation actions
e) Geographical and contextual variations in action effectiveness
f) Scaling of actions and their impacts
g) Timeframes for expected outcomes
h) Factors associated with success or failure of conservation efforts

# Response: #
Here are four synthetic questions about Amphibian Conservation, with model answers and the action IDs used to generate them.

Question 1:
I need to control invasive fish in amphibian ponds. What are the benefits and drawbacks of different control methods?

Action IDs used to generate question:
826, 827, 828, 829

Model Answer:
Evidence suggests several methods with varying outcomes. Draining ponds to eliminate fish is rated as beneficial, shown to increase amphibian species numbers and breeding success (826). Removing fish by catching them is likely to be beneficial, with studies showing it can significantly increase salamander or frog abundance, recruitment, and survival, although some studies found no effect or that fish returned (827). Using rotenone to eliminate fish has a trade-off between benefits and harms; while it can increase amphibian species numbers, abundance, and recruitment, it has also been shown to cause mortality in frogs and newts (828).

Question 2:
What are the most effective logging practices to mitigate impacts on forest salamander populations?

Action IDs used to generate question:
747, 844, 846, 851, 852

Model Answer:
Retaining riparian buffer strips during timber harvest is likely to be beneficial; studies found amphibian abundance was significantly higher with buffers, particularly wider ones (747). Using shelterwood harvesting instead of clearcutting is also likely to be beneficial, resulting in higher or similar salamander abundance compared to clearcutting (851). Conversely, other partial harvest methods appear less effective. Harvesting trees in small groups (844), thinning (852), leave-tree harvesting (846), and leaving only standing deadwood (845) have all been found to decrease salamander abundance compared to unharvested forest and in some cases were not an improvement on clearcutting.

Question 3:
What are the trade-offs between reintroducing amphibians by translocating wild animals versus releasing captive-bred individuals?

Action IDs used to generate question:
854, 859, 870, 871, 872, 873, 881

Model Answer:
Both strategies have shown success but come with trade-offs. Translocation of wild amphibians is generally rated as likely to be beneficial, with a majority of assessed projects resulting in established breeding populations, and success is often higher when over 1,000 animals are moved (854). Releasing captive-bred amphibians is also likely to be beneficial, with studies showing high rates of population establishment (870, 871). However, this approach is often rated as a "trade-off" because it carries risks such as low survival post-release for some species (875), complete failure to establish populations (872), and potential loss of genetic diversity and anti-predator traits in long-term captive populations (873).

Question 4:
To reduce amphibian road mortality, what are the most effective interventions and their limitations?

Action IDs used to generate question:
756, 782, 784, 840, 841, 842, 884

Model Answer:
Closing roads during seasonal migration is likely to be beneficial, protecting large numbers of amphibians from death (842). Installing culverts or tunnels, usually with barrier fencing, is another common method with a "trade-off" rating; it can significantly decrease road deaths, but their use by amphibians is highly variable and depends on design features like diameter, substrate, and lighting (884, 756). Similarly, modifying gully pots by moving them away from the kerb can be beneficial in reducing the number of newts that fall in (782). Less effective interventions include using humans to assist migrating amphibians, which has been shown to be unlikely to be beneficial as populations still declined and many toads were still killed (784), and using warning signage, which was also found to be insufficient (841).
