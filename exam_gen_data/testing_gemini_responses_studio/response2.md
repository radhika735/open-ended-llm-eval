# Prompt: #
Attached is a file containing conservation actions, their effectiveness and key messages relating to them. This has been gathered by hand and forms part of the Conservation Evidence living evidence database. Each action is prefixed with a numerical id.
You will be generating synthetic questions for use in an experiment. Generate four questions which requires drawing on multiple actions from this database. Also include a short model answer using only the evidence database provided. Cite the action id in your model answers. Keep the questions short and similar in style to the following example questions but vary the species and actions:
Which predatory fish species are most effective at controlling invasive crayfish populations in European freshwater systems?
Which conservation intervention can reduce the negative effects of artificial light pollution on nocturnal bat species' activity patterns?
What actions are most effective for mitigating the impacts of offshore wind farms for biodiversity?
What are the most beneficial actions I can take on agricultural land to improve impacts on pollinators and other aspects of biodiversity?
Potential question types:
a) Effects/outcomes of specific conservation actions
b) Actions to achieve specific conservation objectives/outcomes
c) Alternatives to achieve a particular conservation goal
d) Trade-offs between different conservation actions
e) Geographical and contextual variations in action effectiveness
f) Scaling of actions and their impacts
g) Timeframes for expected outcomes
h) Factors associated with success or failure of conservation efforts

Here are four questions about amphibian conservation, with model answers based on the provided text.

Question 1
What actions can be taken to increase breeding populations of frogs in and around ponds?

Model Answer
Several actions can be beneficial for increasing frog breeding populations. Creating new ponds is a highly effective measure, with multiple studies showing that frogs will establish breeding populations in them. This can be enhanced by also creating artificial hibernacula and refuges, which have been shown to be used by species like the common frog. Restoring existing ponds by deepening, de-silting, or re-profiling them can also increase common frog populations and calling male tree frogs. In the surrounding terrestrial habitat, replanting vegetation can help, as it can lead to amphibian community compositions similar to those at natural sites. Additionally, clearing vegetation, in conjunction with other habitat management, has been shown to increase the numbers of frog species. It can also be beneficial to remove invasive bullfrogs, as this has been found to significantly increase populations of native frogs like the California red-legged frog.

Question 2
What are the most effective alternatives for reducing amphibian deaths on roads?

Model Answer
Several interventions can reduce amphibian road mortality, but their effectiveness varies. Installing culverts or tunnels is a beneficial approach, with multiple studies showing they significantly decrease road deaths, especially when combined with barrier fencing. Similarly, closing roads entirely during seasonal migration periods protects large numbers of amphibians. Restoring habitat connectivity, for instance by raising a road on a viaduct, has also been shown to significantly decrease deaths of migrating amphibians. Modifying gully pots and kerbs can also be beneficial; one study found that moving gully pots 10 cm from the kerb reduced the number of great crested newts falling in by 80%. In contrast, using humans to assist migrating amphibians across roads is considered unlikely to be beneficial, as populations have been observed to decline even with this intervention. Warning signs have also been found to be of unknown effectiveness, with high numbers of toads still being killed on roads where signs are present.

Question 3
What are the trade-offs between different timber harvesting methods for conserving salamander populations in forests?

Model Answer
Different timber harvesting methods have varying impacts on salamander populations when compared to unharvested forests. Shelterwood harvesting, for instance, is considered likely to be beneficial. While it can decrease salamander abundance compared to no harvesting, it results in higher or similar abundance compared to clearcutting. In contrast, other partial harvesting methods are rated as likely to be ineffective or harmful. Harvesting trees in small groups, for example, significantly decreases salamander abundance compared to no-harvest areas and does not lead to higher abundance than clearcutting. Similarly, leave-tree harvesting also decreases salamander abundance compared to unharvested forests and does not show an improvement over clearcutting. Thinning trees has mixed effects but is generally considered likely to be ineffective or harmful, with some studies showing declines in salamander populations. Leaving standing deadwood is unlikely to be beneficial, as it doesn't prevent a decrease in salamander abundance compared to no harvesting. Finally, leaving coarse woody debris presents a trade-off; while it can increase survival for juvenile amphibians within clearcuts, the overall response of amphibians can be more negative where it is retained compared to where it is removed.

Question 4
What combination of actions would create a comprehensive conservation plan for the natterjack toad?

Model Answer
A comprehensive conservation plan for the natterjack toad would involve a combination of habitat management, population establishment, and threat mitigation. A key action is the creation and restoration of ponds, which has been shown to significantly increase, maintain, or establish natterjack toad populations. The effectiveness of these ponds can be enhanced by adding limestone to combat acidification, which can help in establishing translocated populations and increase breeding. Translocating natterjack toad eggs, tadpoles, or adults is another beneficial action to establish breeding populations, with greater success found on dune and saltmarsh habitats. Alongside aquatic habitat work, terrestrial management such as clearing vegetation and introducing grazing has been shown to increase, stabilize, or maintain populations. To further support populations, engaging landowners and volunteers in habitat management has proven effective. Public awareness campaigns can also contribute to conservation success by increasing support and leading to the creation of more ponds. Finally, since natterjack toad populations are better protected at sites with statutory habitat protection, seeking such designation would be a valuable component of a long-term strategy.
