Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of reducing pesticide, herbicide and fertiliser use on bat populations, in Portugal.

Community composition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Portugal found that farms using few or no chemicals had different compositions of bat species to farms using high chemical inputs.

POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Abundance (1 study): A replicated site comparison study in Portugal found that farms with few or no chemical inputs had higher overall bat activity (relative abundance) than those using high chemical inputs.
