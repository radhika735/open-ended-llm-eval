3341: Plant non-woody plants into moisture-retaining peat pots: freshwater wetlands
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of using moisture-retaining peat pots when planting emergent, non-woody vegetation in freshwater wetlands. The study was in the USA.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY
 
VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Individual species abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a wetland in the USA found that tussock sedge Carex stricta cover was similar across plots, after two growing seasons, whether sedges were planted into peat pots or into existing wetland soil.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Individual plant size (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a wetland in the USA found that the biomass of tussock sedge Carex stricta plants was similar, after two growing seasons, whether they were planted into peat pots or into existing wetland soil.

OTHER

Survival (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a wetland in the USA found that the survival rate of tussock sedge Carex stricta plants was similar, after two growing seasons, whether they were planted into peat pots or into existing wetland soil.
Growth (1 study): The same study found that the growth rate of tussock sedge Carex stricta was typically similar, over two growing seasons, when planted into peat pots or into existing wetland soil. However, in a dry area and in a dry year, planting in peat pots did increase the growth rate.
