3030: Lower water level to restore degraded freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of lowering the water level to restore degraded freshwater marshes. One study was in the USA and one was in Canada.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall extent (1 study): One before-and-after study of a lakeshore marsh in the USA reported that following a drawdown of water levels, emergent vegetation coverage increased in areas that were previously open water.
Community types (1 study): One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study of freshwater marshes in Canada reported changes in the area of some vegetation classes over three years of partial drawdown. There was a temporary increase in coverage of dead vegetation at the expense of some live vegetation classes. Two classes – horsetail-dominated and bur-reed-dominated – had greater coverage after three years of drawdown than before.
