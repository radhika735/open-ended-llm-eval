1365: Soil: Add slurry to the soil
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:
Organic matter (4 studies): Three studies (two replicated, randomized, controlled; one meta-analysis) from Spain and multiple Mediterranean countries found similar amounts of organic matter in soils with or without added slurry. One replicated, randomized, controlled study from Spain found more organic matter in soils with added slurry, compared to soils without it, in some comparisons.
Nutrients (4 studies): Two replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Spain found more nitrate in soils with added slurry, compared to soils without it. Two replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Portugal and Spain found similar amounts of nitrate in soils with or without added slurry. One of these studies also found more ammonium, but another one did not.
Soil organisms (2 studies): One replicated, randomized, controlled study from Spain found more microbial biomass in soils with added slurry, compared to soils without it, but another one did not.
Soil erosion and aggregation (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study from Spain found more stable soils in plots with added slurry, compared to plots without it, in some comparisons.
Greenhouse gases (8 studies)

Carbon dioxide (3 studies): Of three replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Spain, two studies found higher carbon dioxide emissions in soils with added slurry, compared to soils without it, but one study did not.
Methane (4 studies): One replicated, randomized, controlled study from Spain found that less methane was absorbed by soils with added slurry, compared to soils without it. Three replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Spain found similar methane fluxes in soils with or without added slurry.
Nitrous oxide (6 studies): Five replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Spain found higher nitrous oxide emissions in soils with added slurry, compared to soils without it, in some or all comparisons. One replicated, randomized, controlled study from Spain found similar nitrous oxide emissions in soils with or without added slurry.

Implementation options (3 studies): One replicated, randomized, controlled study from Spain found no differences in organic matter or greenhouse-gas emissions between plots with different amounts of slurry. One replicated, randomized, controlled study from Spain found similar amounts of nitrogen in soils with or without added slurry. One replicated, randomized, controlled study from Spain found similar nitrous oxide emissions in soils with digested or untreated pig slurry. One replicated, randomized, controlled study from Spain found similar carbon dioxide and methane emissions in soils with digested or untreated slurry.
