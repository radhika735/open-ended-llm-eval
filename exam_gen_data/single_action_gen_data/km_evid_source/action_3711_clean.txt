Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects of managing vegetation using livestock grazing on reptile populations. One study was in France and one was in the USA.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Abundance (1 study): One site comparison study in France found that one reptile species was more abundant in areas grazed by sheep than in areas managed by burning, whereas the abundance of five other species was similar in all areas.
Reproductive success (1 study): One before-and-after study in the USA found that after grazing cattle to restore bog turtle habitat, along with providing artificial nest covers, more bog turtle eggs were laid and hatching success was higher than before.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)

Use (1 study): One before-and-after study in the USA found that bog turtle nests were laid only in areas that had been grazed in the current or previous growing season.
