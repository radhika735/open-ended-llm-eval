2991: Plug/dam canals or trenches: freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of plugging/damming canals or trenches in freshwater marshes. The study was in the USA.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall extent (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study of backfilled canals in freshwater marshes in the USA reported that emergent marsh vegetation coverage was greater within the channels of plugged than unplugged canals, after 6–60 months. However, coverage on former spoil areas did not significantly differ between plugged and unplugged canals.
