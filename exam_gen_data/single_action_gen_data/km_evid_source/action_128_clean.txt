128: Take field corners out of management
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Key Messages:

A      replicated site comparison study in the UK found that      taking field corners out of management was positively correlated with grey      partridge overwinter survival. However it had no effect on grey partridge brood      size, the ratio of young to old birds or year-on-year density changes.
