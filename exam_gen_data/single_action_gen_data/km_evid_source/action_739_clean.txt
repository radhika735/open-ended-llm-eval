739: Bathe in freshwater
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Key Messages:
  

Two studies in Australia provide mixed evidence of the effect of freshwater bathing to reducing amoebic gill disease. One study found a reduction in numbers of amoebae on salmon gills persisting for up to 10 days after bathing. One replicated, controlled study found similar levels of amoebae in the gills of treated and untreated salmon.
