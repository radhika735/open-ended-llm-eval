303: Use high-visibility mesh on gillnets to reduce seabird bycatch
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

A repeated, randomised and controlled trial in the USA found that having gillnets made partially from high-visibility mesh was effective in reducing seabird bycatch.
Having a greater percentage (25% vs. 10%) of the net made from high-visibility mesh was more effective, but also reduced catch of the target species.
