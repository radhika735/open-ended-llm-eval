761: Clear vegetation
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Key Messages:

Six studies (including four replicated studies) in Australia, Estonia and the UK found that vegetation clearance, along with other habitat management and in some cases release of animals, increased numbers of frog species, or increased, stabilized or maintained populations of natterjack toads. One before-and-after study in the UK found that vegetation clearance, along with other habitat management, maintained a population of great crested newts for the first six years, but not in the longer term.
One before-and-after study in England found that vegetation clearance, resulted in increased occupancy by natterjack toads.
