1837: Add fresh peat to peatland (before planting)
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects, on peatland vegetation, of adding fresh peat before planting peatland plants. The study was in a bog.
Cover (1 study): One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in a bog New ZealandÂ reported that plots amended with fine peat supported higher cover of two sown plant species than the original (tilled) bog surface. However, for one species fertilization cancelled out this effect.
