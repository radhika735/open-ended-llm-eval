452: Use visual and acoustic ‘scarers’ to deter birds from landing on pools polluted by mining or sewage
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Key Messages:

Two studies found lower bird mortality or fewer birds rescued from toxic ponds when deterrent systems were used. Four of five studies found that fewer birds landed on pools with deterrents than controls, although one of these found that the effect was weaker for grebes compared to wildfowl and absent for waders. One study that used regular broadcasts of different sounds found that it had no impact on bird behaviour.
Two studies investigated different systems and found that radar-operated systems were more effective than systems that worked at random intervals. One of these studies also found that loud noises were more effective than moving peregrine falcons Falco peregrinus models.
