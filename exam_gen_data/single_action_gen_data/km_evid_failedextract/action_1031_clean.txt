1031: <i>Procambarus</i> crayfish control: Trapping combined with encouragement of predators
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Key Messages:

A before-and-after study in Switzerland found that introducing predators, combined with trapping significantly reduced red swamp crayfish populations in a pond. A second replicated, controlled study from Italy demonstrated that trapping and predation in combination was more effective at reducing red swamp crayfish populations than predation alone.
