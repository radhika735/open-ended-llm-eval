2254: Use green engineering techniques on artificial structures - Modify rock dump to make it more similar to natural substrate
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of modifying rock dump to make it more similar to natural substrate on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.

 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
