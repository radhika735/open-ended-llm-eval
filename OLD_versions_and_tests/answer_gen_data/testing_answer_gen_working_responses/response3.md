Same as before, will not copy paste the actual formatted output string itself as its final answer.

2025-07-30 16:39:11,042 - INFO - Executing tool: get_formatted_result with args: {'action_ids': ['970', '2939', '1960'], 'answer': 'To reduce bat fatalities at wind turbines, effective interventions include preventing turbine blades from turning at low wind speeds (feathering), slowing the rotation of turbine blades at low wind speeds, and increasing the wind speed at which turbines become operational (cut-in speed). Feathering turbine blades at low wind speeds or in conjunction with increased cut-in speed has been shown in multiple studies in the USA and Canada to result in fewer bat fatalities. Similarly, increasing the cut-in speed, either alone or with feathering, has also been found to reduce bat fatalities. One study in Canada specifically noted a reduction in bat fatalities when turbine blade rotation was slowed at low wind speeds.'}

Use the search_actions tool to find relevant actions based on user queries, and then use get_action_details to retrieve full details for specific actions when needed. When searching for actions, start with the default parameters, but if you need more results, use the offset parameter to retrieve additional actions. Keep searching with increasing offset values until the returned actions become irrelevant to the user's query - this ensures you find all pertinent information before providing your final answer. Finally, convert your generated answer and the list of the action IDs used to generate this answer into a valid JSON format by using the get_formatted_result tool. You should copy the exact outputted json string of the get_formatted_result tool as your final message."
