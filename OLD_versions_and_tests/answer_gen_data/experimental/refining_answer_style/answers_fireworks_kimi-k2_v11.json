    "query": "What are the most effective interventions for reducing bat fatalities at wind turbines?",
    "answer": "Based on the evidence from multiple studies, the most effective interventions for reducing bat fatalities at wind turbines are operational adjustments, with feathering turbine blades at low wind speeds and increasing the wind speed at which turbines become operational both rated as \"Beneficial\". These operational changes have been extensively tested across North America, with five of six studies on feathering and ten of twelve studies on increasing cut-in speed showing significant reductions in bat fatalities. Additionally, automatically reducing turbine blade rotation when bat activity is predicted to be high and slowing blade rotation at low wind speeds have shown promising results, though with less evidence, earning them \"Likely to be beneficial\" ratings. These interventions work by reducing the risk of collision when bats are most active, particularly during low wind conditions when turbines might otherwise operate at full capacity.",
