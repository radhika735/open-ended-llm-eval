    "query": "What are the most effective interventions for reducing bat fatalities at wind turbines?",
    "answer": "The most effective interventions for reducing bat fatalities at wind turbines are:\n\n1. **Increasing the wind speed at which turbines become operational ('cut-in speed')** (Action ID 1960): Rated 'Beneficial' with strong evidence from 12 studies (10/12 showing reduced fatalities). This approach significantly decreases bat fatalities by delaying turbine operation until wind speeds are higher, when bats are less active.\n\n2. **Preventing turbine blades from turning at low wind speeds ('feathering')** (Action ID 970): Also rated 'Beneficial,' supported by 6 studies (5/6 showing reduced fatalities). Feathering minimizes blade movement during low-wind periods when bats are most active.\n\n3. **Automatically reducing turbine blade rotation during high bat activity** (Action ID 971): Rated 'Likely to be beneficial,' with 2 studies confirming effectiveness. This method uses real-time monitoring to adjust operations when bats are detected nearby.\n\nCombining cut-in speed adjustments with feathering (as tested in some studies) may further enhance effectiveness. Methods like ultrasound or radar deterrents (Actions 968, 967) currently lack sufficient evidence to recommend.",
