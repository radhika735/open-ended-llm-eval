    "answer": "The most beneficial conservation action for establishing new populations of threatened toad species in the UK is the **translocation of natterjack toads**. Studies have shown that translocating natterjack toad eggs, tadpoles, juveniles, or adults can successfully establish breeding populations, with re-establishing toads on dune or saltmarsh habitat being more successful than on heathland. Replicated translocations of wild rather than captive-bred toads generally lead to increased populations.\n\nWhile \"use humans to assist migrating amphibians across roads\" might seem helpful, studies indicate that despite such efforts, toad populations still decline or a significant number of toads are killed.\n\nAdding lime to water bodies to reduce acidification has a trade-off between benefit and harm. Some studies show it can help establish new populations and increase breeding or survival, especially when combined with other habitat management. However, other studies have found it can lead to high tadpole mortality, pond abandonment, and abnormal eggs in common frogs. Therefore, its effectiveness is not consistently positive.",
