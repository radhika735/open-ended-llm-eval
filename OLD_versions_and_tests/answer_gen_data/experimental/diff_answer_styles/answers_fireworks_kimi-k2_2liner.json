    "answer": "The most effective interventions for reducing bat fatalities at wind turbines are preventing turbine blades from turning at low wind speeds (feathering) and increasing the wind speed at which turbines become operational (cut-in speed), both rated as 'Beneficial' [970, 1960]. Additionally, automatically reducing turbine blade rotation when bat activity is high and slowing blade rotation at low wind speeds are 'Likely to be beneficial' [971, 2939].",
