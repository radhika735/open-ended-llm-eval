    "relevant_summary": "Several interventions have been studied for managing bear conflicts: Diversionary feeding reduced nuisance behavior by black bears in two US studies [2323]. Electric fencing has proven effective, with one study showing it successfully prevented polar bears from entering a compound [2347]. Deterrents have shown mixed results - some studies found noise and pain deterrents prevented bears from seeking food at human sites, while others found these methods ineffective at keeping bears away from urban areas [2347]. Using conditioned taste aversion by lacing foodstuffs with illness-inducing substances led to black bears avoiding those foods [2384]. Translocation of problem bears has shown limited success: studies found that many black bears return to their capture locations, with younger bears being less likely to return when moved greater distances or across geographic barriers [2341]. Additionally, translocated grizzly bears showed lower survival rates than non-translocated bears [2336]. Regarding garbage management, one study found that enforcement notices for proper dumpster use did not reduce garbage accessibility to black bears [2345]. Electric shock devices were successful in preventing black bears from accessing bird feeders [2346].",
