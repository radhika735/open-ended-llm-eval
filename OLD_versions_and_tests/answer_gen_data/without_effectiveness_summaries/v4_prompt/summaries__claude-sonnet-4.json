    "relevant_summary": "Based on action document evidence, several approaches have been evaluated for reducing human-wildlife conflict with bears. Diversionary feeding has shown effectiveness, with studies finding that it reduced nuisance behaviour by black bears and comprised 22-63% of the estimated annual energy content of brown bear diets (Action 2323). Preventing access to food sources using electric shock devices prevented American black bears from accessing or damaging bird feeders (Action 2346). Deterrent methods have mixed results: two studies found that chasing nuisance black bears with dogs caused them to stay away longer from human-occupied sites, while two other studies found that noise and pain deterrents did not prevent black bears from returning to urban areas (Action 2347). Conditioned taste aversion successfully led to avoidance of laced foodstuffs by black bears (Action 2384). However, several approaches showed limited effectiveness: issuing enforcement notices requiring appropriate dumpster use did not reduce garbage accessibility to black bears (Action 2345). Translocation approaches have poor success rates, with almost half of translocated 'nuisance' black bears returning to their capture locations, and success being higher when bears were translocated as younger bears, over greater distances, or across geographic barriers (Action 2341). Studies of bears translocated away from residential areas found that most returned to their original capture location and/or continued to cause nuisance, with translocated grizzly bears having lower survival rates than non-translocated bears (Action 2336).",

Integrated aquaculture systems represent one approach, where a study in Canada found that blue mussels absorbed waste from a salmon farm, and a replicated, controlled study in Scotland reported enhanced algal growth when placed adjacent to fish farms (Action 932). Another approach is to establish aquaculture to extract nutrients from run-offs, though no studies have yet evaluated this intervention's effects (Action 2883). Improving fish food and pellets to reduce aquaculture waste production is another potential action, although no studies have been found that evaluate this intervention's effects on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations (Action 2192). Additionally, cleaning waste water before it enters the environment has been shown to have effects on vegetation, with one study in the Netherlands finding that after input water began to be cleaned, cover of mosses characteristic of low nutrient levels increased and vascular plant biomass decreased (Action 1778). Locating artificial reefs near aquaculture systems to benefit from nutrient run-offs has been studied, with research showing that artificial reefs located under aquaculture cages had similar invertebrate community composition and biomass to those without aquaculture cages (Action 2260).",
