query: "What are the most effective interventions for reducing bat fatalities at wind turbines?"

response:

Based on the conservation evidence, the most effective interventions for reducing bat fatalities at wind turbines are:

1. **Increase turbine operational wind speed (cut-in speed)**  
   Setting turbines to start operating at higher wind speeds (typically 5-7 m/s).  
   *Effectiveness*: **Beneficial** - reduces fatalities by 36-94%. Significant for migratory tree bats.  
   *(Action ID 1960)*  

2. **Prevent blade rotation at low wind speeds ("feathering")**  
   Stopping blades from rotating below critical wind speeds.  
   *Effectiveness*: **Beneficial** - combined with raised cut-in speeds, reduces fatalities by 44-93%.  
   *(Action ID 970)*  

3. **Slow blade rotation at low wind speeds**  
   Reducing rotational speed rather than full cessation.  
   *Effectiveness*: **Likely beneficial** - balances energy production and conservation.  
   *(Action ID 2939)*  

4. **Automatically reduce operation during high bat activity**  
   Using acoustic sensors to curtail turbines when bats are active.  
   *Effectiveness*: **Likely beneficial** - achieves 76-84% fatality reduction.  
   *(Action ID 971)*  

**Key insights**:  
- Maximum efficacy (>90%) comes from **combining feathering with increased cut-in speeds**  
- Most effective during low-wind conditions when bats are active  
- Migratory species like hoary bats show greatest response  

These operational modifications significantly outperform experimental deterrents like ultrasound or radar.
