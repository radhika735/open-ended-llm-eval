    "query": "What are the most effective interventions for reducing bat fatalities at wind turbines?",
    "answer": "\"Based on the available evidence, the most effective interventions for reducing bat fatalities at wind turbines are those rated as 'Beneficial':\n\n- Preventing turbine blades from turning at low wind speeds ('feathering') - Supported by six studies showing fewer bat fatalities.\n- Increasing the wind speed at which turbines become operational (\u2018cut-in speed\u2019) - Supported by twelve studies showing fewer bat fatalities.\n\nInterventions likely to be beneficial include:\n- Slowing the rotation of turbine blades at low wind speeds - One study showed reduced fatalities.\n- Automatically reducing turbine blade rotation when bat activity is high - Two studies showed fewer fatalities.\n\nDeterring bats using ultrasound has unknown effectiveness with mixed results from four studies.\n\nNo evidence was found for deterring bats using radar.\"",
