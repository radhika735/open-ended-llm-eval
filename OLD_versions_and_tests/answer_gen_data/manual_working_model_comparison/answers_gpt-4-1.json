    "query": "What are the most effective interventions for reducing bat fatalities at wind turbines?",
    "answer": "The most effective interventions for reducing bat fatalities at wind turbines are:\n\n1. Increasing the wind speed at which turbines become operational ('cut-in speed'): This strategy is well-supported by evidence. Ten out of twelve studies in the USA and Canada found that increasing the cut-in speed alone or in combination with feathering resulted in fewer bat fatalities compared to conventional operation. Some studies with small sample sizes or short treatment periods did not detect a reduction.\n\n2. Preventing turbine blades from turning at low wind speeds ('feathering'): Five out of six studies in North America found that feathering, or feathering combined with increased cut-in speed, reduced bat fatalities.\n\n3. Automatically reducing turbine blade rotation when bat activity is high: Two studies (one in Germany, one in the USA) reported that reducing blade speed during periods of high bat activity lowered bat fatalities for all and specific species.\n\n4. Slowing rotation of turbine blades at low wind speeds: One study in Canada found this to likely reduce bat fatalities.\n\n5. Deterring bats using ultrasound: Evidence for this intervention is mixed and effectiveness is currently rated as unknown.\n\nOverall, increasing cut-in speed and feathering at low wind speeds are the most strongly supported, practical measures for reducing bat fatalities at wind turbines.",

    "query": "What are the most effective interventions for reducing bat fatalities at wind turbines?",
    "answer": "The most effective interventions for reducing bat fatalities at wind turbines, supported by multiple studies, are:\n\n1. Preventing turbine blades from turning at low wind speeds ('feathering'): Most studies found this approach, or feathering combined with increasing the operational wind speed, significantly reduced bat fatalities compared to conventional operations.\n\n2. Increasing the wind speed at which turbines become operational ('cut-in speed'): This intervention is consistently found to reduce bat fatalities in a majority of studies. Some studies also tested this in combination with feathering for greater effect.\n\nAdditionally, slowing the rotation of turbine blades at low wind speeds was found in a controlled study to likely be beneficial in reducing bat fatalities.\n\nThese interventions have been evaluated primarily in the USA and Canada, showing repeated success in reducing bat deaths at wind energy facilities.",
