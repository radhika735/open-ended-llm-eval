    "query": "What are the most effective interventions for reducing bat fatalities at wind turbines?",
    "answer": "The most effective interventions for reducing bat fatalities at wind turbines include: \n\n* **Preventing turbine blades from turning at low wind speeds ('feathering')**: This method has been found to be beneficial, based on studies in the USA and Canada. Five out of six studies showed that feathering, sometimes combined with increasing the cut-in speed, resulted in fewer bat fatalities. \n\n* **Increasing the wind speed at which turbines become operational ('cut-in speed')**: This intervention is also considered beneficial. Ten out of twelve studies in the USA and Canada demonstrated that increasing the cut-in speed, or increasing it along with feathering, led to a reduction in bat fatalities. \n\n* **Slowing rotation of turbine blades at low wind speeds**: One study in Canada found that slowing turbine blade rotation at low wind speeds was likely to be beneficial in reducing bat fatalities.",
