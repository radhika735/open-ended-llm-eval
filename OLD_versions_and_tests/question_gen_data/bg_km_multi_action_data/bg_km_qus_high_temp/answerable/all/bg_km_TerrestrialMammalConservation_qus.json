    "question": "What are the most beneficial actions for reducing human-wildlife conflict with bears?",
    "answer": "Several actions are rated as beneficial for reducing human-wildlife conflict with bears. Excluding or limiting the number of visitors to reserves was found to result in fewer bears being killed to protect humans (2330). Preventing bears from accessing food sources, for example by using electric shock devices on bird feeders, has been shown to be effective (2346). Scaring or deterring bears, such as by chasing them with dogs, can cause them to stay away from human-occupied areas (2347), and using non-lethal deterrents like pepper spray or rubber bullets has been found to repel them (2385). In contrast, translocating problem bears is rated as likely to be ineffective or harmful, as studies found they often had low survival rates, returned to their capture sites, or continued to cause nuisance behaviour (2336).",

Planting or maintaining hedgerows also increased small mammal abundance (2383). Creating uncultivated margins around fields was found to have higher numbers of small mammals and brown hares in some studies (2365). Planting specific crops for wildlife also led to higher abundance of small mammals and European rabbits (2394).

    "question": "What are the documented benefits and negative impacts of translocating 'problem' mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests translocation of 'problem' mammals has significant negative impacts and questionable benefits. Translocating predators like leopards away from human-dominated areas was found to lead to more attacks on humans and livestock than before translocation (2336). For black bears, translocation is rated as likely to be ineffective or harmful due to low survival, high rates of return to capture sites, and continued nuisance behaviour (2336, 2341). Similarly, translocating predators away from livestock often resulted in reduced survival, and animals continued to predate livestock or return to their capture sites (2436). Translocated crop-raiding elephants also showed lower survival rates than non-translocated elephants (2485). Therefore, while translocation moves an individual animal, it often leads to poor outcomes for the animal and may not resolve the conflict.",

For nuisance black bears, success was higher when younger bears were moved over greater distances and across geographic barriers (2341). For ungulates, success was higher when larger numbers of animals were released (2397). Releasing animals in larger groups was found to increase reproductive success and survival for black-tailed prairie dogs (2462). The presence of invasive predators is a major factor; a review of marsupial translocations found much higher success on predator-free islands (2464). The overall success of ungulate translocations was also found to be higher when a population had more mature individuals and an equal sex ratio (2397).",

Limiting visitor access to protected areas resulted in fewer bears being killed to protect humans (2330). Conversely, issuing enforcement notices for bear-proof dumpsters did not reduce garbage accessibility (2345). Scaring bears using noise, pain deterrents, or dogs has shown mixed results, with some studies finding it effective and others not (2347). Translocating problem bears away from residential areas is often ineffective, as many return and continue nuisance behaviour, and it can lead to increased attacks on humans and livestock (2336).

Two of seven studies found higher survival for species like water voles and European rabbits compared to direct release, while four studies found similar survival for species like swift foxes and gray wolves (2434). Holding wild-caught mammals in pens also reduced the tendency of sea otters and gray wolves to return to their capture site (2434). For captive-bred mammals, using holding pens resulted in greater post-release survival for water voles in one study, but two other studies found similar survival rates for eastern barred bandicoots and swift foxes compared to direct release (2510).

Taste-aversion is also 'Likely to be beneficial', with three of seven studies showing it reduced killings by coyotes, but four studies found no effect (2429). Shock collars are rated 'Beneficial', with multiple studies finding they reduced predation or bait consumption by wolves and coyotes (2446). Using loud noises (2435) or a combination of lights and sound (2449) was found to deter predators in three studies each.

In terms of benefits, translocating 'nuisance' black bears from recreational areas in the USA and Canada sometimes works, with success being higher for younger bears moved over greater distances (2341). However, almost half of translocated bears returned to their capture locations in one study (2341). The harms are significant, leading to an effectiveness rating of 'Likely to be ineffective or harmful' when moving animals from residential areas (2336). Survival rates of translocated bears and deer are often lower than non-translocated animals. For example, a US study found grizzly bears had lower survival, and another found fewer than half of translocated black bears survived for a year (2336).

Using loud noises, such as bangers, is also 'Likely to be beneficial'. Five of six studies found that motion-activated noises reduced crop damage, but three studies found regularly sounding noises were ineffective against rabbits and deer (2460).

The number of animals released is important; a worldwide review found that translocating ungulates was more successful when larger numbers were released (2397). Releasing animals in social or family groups is rated as 'Beneficial'. Studies found that black-tailed prairie dogs translocated as family groups had higher reproductive success, and releasing African wild dogs or lions in social groups led to high survival and stable home ranges (2463). Releasing larger, unrelated groups can also be beneficial, with one study finding that black-tailed prairie dogs released in larger groups had higher reproductive success and survival (2462). The timing of release matters; four of five studies found that releasing animals like black bears and Canada lynx in a specific season led to higher survival rates (2447). Finally, providing artificial refuges/breeding sites at the release site is 'Beneficial', with studies showing they increased abundance of European rabbits and were used by various species, likely improving establishment (2453).",

    "question": "What are the conservation benefits of installing fences to manage mammal populations?",
    "answer": "Fencing offers several benefits. It can reduce human-wildlife conflict; studies found that non-electric fences reduced livestock predation by carnivores and crop damage by rabbits (2415), while electric fences also deterred predators from livestock (2417) and various mammals from crops (2439). Fencing can also protect vulnerable populations; installing fences to exclude predators and other problematic species was found to increase the abundance and richness of native small mammals in some cases (2497). Finally, fencing around protected areas has been associated with increased mammal species richness and abundance (2561).",

    "question": "Besides culling, what are the most effective non-lethal methods for reducing predation on livestock by wild carnivores?",
    "answer": "Several non-lethal methods are rated as 'beneficial' or 'likely to be beneficial'. Methods rated 'beneficial' include using guardian animals like dogs and llamas, which were found to reduce attacks on livestock (2433), using shock-collars on predators (2446), and installing non-electric fences (2415). 'Likely to be beneficial' interventions include paying farmers compensation for losses, which reduced lion killings in Kenya (2414); using flags on fences (fladry), which deterred wolves (2421); using loud noises (2435); a combination of lights and sound (2449); predator scent deterrents (2450); and taste-aversion treatments (2429).",

    "question": "What are the outcomes for mammal survival when different soft-release techniques are used for reintroductions?",
    "answer": "Evidence for soft-release techniques shows varied outcomes for mammal survival. Releasing animals into fenced areas is beneficial, with studies showing higher survival rates for common hamsters and European rabbits compared to unfenced areas (2467). Similarly, releasing mammals to areas with invasive predator control is beneficial and increased survival for species like water voles and hare-wallabies in some studies (2469). Using pre-release holding pens is rated 'likely to be beneficial', but studies show mixed results, with some finding higher survival (water voles) and others finding similar or lower survival compared to direct release (swift foxes, American martens) (2434, 2510). Providing supplementary food during or after release is also rated 'likely to be beneficial', but direct evidence for increased survival is mixed, with studies finding that many individuals did not survive long term (2470).",
