    "question": "What are some available actions to increase the diversity of understory plants in forests?",
    "answer": "Several actions have been shown to increase the diversity of understory plants. Thinning trees can increase species richness and diversity (1211). Similarly, shelterwood harvesting (1223), group-selection harvesting (1224), and logging/tree removal (1273) have also shown positive effects on understory plant diversity. Excluding livestock from forests using wire fences (1205) or by preventing grazing altogether (1206) can increase species richness. Both clearcutting (1222) and thinning after a wildfire (1234) have also been found to increase plant species richness.",

    "answer": "Thinning trees has varied effects across the forest ecosystem. For mature trees, it generally decreases density and cover but increases their size, though it may decrease species richness (1209). For young trees, studies show it can increase their density and growth rate (1210). Thinning is 'Likely to be beneficial' for understory plants, with many studies finding it increased their density, cover, species richness, and diversity (1211). Conversely, it is 'Likely to be ineffective or harmful' for non-vascular plants, with studies showing decreases in epiphytic plant abundance and richness (1212).",

Completely preventing grazing was found to increase oak seedling and sapling density in one study (1206), while using wire fences for exclusion increased the size and density of regenerating trees in three of four studies (1205). Reducing grazing intensity, rather than complete removal, was found to increase the number of tree saplings in one study (1207). The timing of grazing is also a factor; shortening the grazing period increased the abundance and size of regenerating oaks in one study, and another found more seedlings after summer grazing compared to winter grazing (1208).",
