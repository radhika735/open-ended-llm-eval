    "question": "What actions can be taken to protect amphibians from the negative impacts of roads?",
    "answer": "Several actions have been studied. Installing culverts or tunnels, often with barrier fencing, can decrease amphibian road deaths (884, 756). Closing roads during migration periods also protects large numbers of amphibians (842). Modifying gully pots by moving them away from the kerb can decrease the number of newts that fall in (782). Restoring connectivity by raising a road on a viaduct has also been shown to decrease deaths of migrating amphibians (840). Conversely, using volunteers to assist toads across roads has been associated with long-term population declines (784), and warning signs may be ineffective (841).",

Treatment with antifungal chemicals, particularly itraconazole, has also been shown to be effective at curing amphibians in the majority of studies (882). In contrast, some other treatments are less effective. Treatment with trimethoprim-sulfadiazine increased survival time but did not cure frogs (763). Adding antifungal bacteria to amphibian skin did not reduce infection rate or death in three of four studies (764). Similarly, vaccinating frogs with formalin-killed chytrid fungus did not significantly reduce infection rate or mortality (765).",

Harvesting trees in small groups significantly decreased salamander abundance and changed species composition (844). Leaving a low density of trees (leave-tree harvesting) also decreased salamander abundance and altered species composition (846). Shelterwood harvesting similarly decreased salamander abundance in two of three studies (851). Thinning trees had mixed effects, with one study finding a negative overall response for amphibians and another showing decreased body condition of ensatina salamanders (852).

Simulating natural environmental cycles, such as a wet and dry season, was found to be important for inducing reproduction in some frogs and toads (835, 836). Temperature can also affect reproductive success and tadpole development (835). For toads, housing them in outdoor enclosures led to higher reproductive success than indoor tanks (848). Parental care and tadpole density were also found to affect development (835). Hormone treatments can induce sperm and egg production, but success depends on the type, amount, and number of doses of hormone used (883).",

One study found that excluding livestock by fencing did not increase overall amphibian abundance but did increase larval abundance of some species, while other studies found that American toad and green frog abundance was higher with grazing (746). Managing grazing regimes also shows mixed results; one study found grazed plots had lower common toad abundance than ungrazed plots (780). However, several studies found that reintroducing grazing as part of broader habitat management increased or maintained populations of green toads and natterjack toads (780).
