    "question": "What is the evidence for managing ant populations in orchards to improve natural pest control?",
    "answer": "The evidence suggests two distinct strategies. Excluding pest-protecting ants from trees is 'likely to be beneficial', with studies finding fewer pests and greater parasitism, though effects on the wider natural enemy community were varied (886). Conversely, for beneficial predatory ants, a single study found that isolating their colonies in cashew trees led to lower pest damage and higher yields (773).",

    "question": "For which natural pest control interventions are the effects known to be short-lived?",
    "answer": "Several interventions have shown time-limited effects. The benefits to natural enemies from allowing natural ground cover regeneration were found to be short-term in one study (720). The weed-suppressing effect of incorporating certain plant remains into the soil did not last beyond a few weeks in two studies (728). Similarly, the increase in natural enemies from using threshold-based spraying lasted as little as three weeks in one study (750).",
