    "question": "What non-lethal methods are available to mitigate human-wildlife conflict with bats in agricultural and urban settings?",
    "answer": "Education and non-lethal deterrents are two approaches. Educating the public may lead to more positive perceptions of bats (1000). For fruit growers, using deterrent sprays, flags, or netting has been shown to reduce fruit damage by flying foxes (1953). There is also evidence that educating hunters about the ecological roles of bats can reduce their intention to hunt them (1973). In urban areas, educating homeowners about planning laws is another proposed method, though its effect on bat roost disturbance has not been studied (1931).",

    "question": "To mitigate impacts from onshore wind farms, what are the most effective operational adjustments for reducing bat fatalities?",
    "answer": "The most effective operational adjustments are those rated 'Beneficial'. This includes increasing the turbine 'cut-in' speed, where ten of twelve studies found this reduced bat fatalities (1960). Similarly, preventing turbine blades from turning at low wind speeds ('feathering') was found to reduce fatalities in five of six studies (970). Actions rated 'Likely to be beneficial' include slowing turbine blade rotation at low wind speeds, which reduced fatalities in one study (2939), and automatically reducing rotation when bat activity is high, which reduced fatalities in two studies (971).",

    "answer": "Providing artificial roosts is often beneficial. Providing bat boxes is 'Likely to be beneficial', with 41 of 43 studies finding bats used them, and some studies showing numbers increased over time (1024). Creating artificial caves or hibernacula is also 'Likely to be beneficial', with four studies finding they were used by bats, in one case with numbers increasing annually (2049). Similarly, creating spaces for roosting bats in road bridges is 'Likely to be beneficial', with one review finding that bats recolonized such spaces, sometimes in greater numbers (1967). However, the effectiveness of creating alternative roosts within developments is 'Unknown', with studies showing mixed results where some roosts were used and others were not (949).",

    "question": "What are the documented benefits and negative impacts of installing gates at cave and mine entrances?",
    "answer": "There is a trade-off between benefits and harms. For caves, installing gates to restrict public access led to more or similar numbers of bats in three of four studies, and populations increased or stabilised for many Indiana bat colonies (999). However, gates can be harmful; bats were found to circle more and enter caves less after gate installation, and one study found bats lost more body mass in a gated cave (999). Similarly for mines, gates can cause bats to circle more and enter less frequently, and one study found fewer bat species entered mines after gates were installed (1963). In some cases, bat activity decreased at gated mines (1963).",

One study found red lighting resulted in higher activity for one bat group compared to white or green light, and another found more bats emerged from a roost under red light than white light (2021). The effectiveness of using ultraviolet (UV) filters is 'Unknown'. One study found that hedges lit with UV-filtered lights had higher activity of soprano pipistrelles, but not common pipistrelles, compared to unfiltered light (1020).

Alternatives with 'Unknown effectiveness' include treating infected bats with a probiotic, which was found to increase survival in two studies (2008). Vaccinating bats has also been proposed, but no effective vaccine has been developed (1011).

Restoring wetlands is 'Likely to be beneficial', with one US study finding it increased overall bat activity to levels similar to undisturbed wetlands (2036). The effectiveness of other restoration types is 'Unknown'. For grasslands, one UK study found creating species-rich grassland did not increase pipistrelle activity compared to conventional pasture (2051). For forests, one study found restored forests had higher bat activity than unmined forests, while another found lower bat diversity in reforested areas compared to native forest (2050). Restoring habitat at ex-quarry sites was found to increase overall bat activity in one study (2286).",

    "question": "What factors of bat box design and placement are associated with higher occupancy rates by bats?",
    "answer": "Evidence from one review suggests that bat box occupancy is influenced by several design and placement factors (1024). In terms of design, black boxes were used more than lighter colored ones, and larger boxes sometimes had higher occupancy. Concrete boxes had higher occupancy than wooden ones in one study. Specific designs like rocket boxes were preferred by Indiana bats, and multi-chambered boxes were preferred during breeding season. Regarding placement, box orientation and sun exposure were found to affect occupancy in three studies. Height was a factor in two studies but not two others. Boxes on buildings were occupied more than those on trees, and occupancy was higher in areas where bats were already known to roost. Finally, installing a greater number of boxes at a site increased the likelihood of occupation (1024).",
