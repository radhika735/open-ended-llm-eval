    "question": "What actions can be taken to protect amphibians from the negative impacts of roads?",
    "answer": "Several actions have been studied. Installing culverts or tunnels, often with barrier fencing, can decrease amphibian road deaths (884, 756). Closing roads during migration periods also protects large numbers of amphibians (842). Modifying gully pots by moving them away from the kerb can decrease the number of newts that fall in (782). Restoring connectivity by raising a road on a viaduct has also been shown to decrease deaths of migrating amphibians (840). Conversely, using volunteers to assist toads across roads has been associated with long-term population declines (784), and warning signs may be ineffective (841).",

    "question": "In a captive setting, what are the most and least effective methods for treating chytridiomycosis in amphibians?",
    "answer": "Increasing enclosure or water temperature to 30\u201337\u00b0C for over 16 hours was found to cure frogs and toads of chytridiomycosis in four of five studies (770). Treatment with antifungal chemicals, particularly itraconazole, has also been shown to be effective at curing amphibians in the majority of studies (882). In contrast, some other treatments are less effective. Treatment with trimethoprim-sulfadiazine increased survival time but did not cure frogs (763). Adding antifungal bacteria to amphibian skin did not reduce infection rate or death in three of four studies (764). Similarly, vaccinating frogs with formalin-killed chytrid fungus did not significantly reduce infection rate or mortality (765).",

    "answer": "Creating ponds is generally beneficial, with most studies showing that amphibians use and colonize created ponds (869). For specific groups, outcomes are positive: created ponds have led to the establishment of breeding populations of great crested newts (863), frogs (865), salamanders (867), and various toad species (864, 866, 868). Comparisons to natural ponds show that created ponds can have similar or even higher numbers of species, although species composition sometimes differs (869). However, one study found that natterjack toad tadpoles in created ponds suffered higher mortality from invertebrate predation than in natural ponds (866).",

    "question": "Within managed forests, what are the potential negative impacts on salamanders from timber harvesting techniques other than clearcutting?",
    "answer": "Various partial harvesting techniques have been found to negatively impact salamanders compared to unharvested forests. Harvesting trees in small groups significantly decreased salamander abundance and changed species composition (844). Leaving a low density of trees (leave-tree harvesting) also decreased salamander abundance and altered species composition (846). Shelterwood harvesting similarly decreased salamander abundance in two of three studies (851). Thinning trees had mixed effects, with one study finding a negative overall response for amphibians and another showing decreased body condition of ensatina salamanders (852). A meta-analysis found that all types of partial harvest, including these, decreased salamander populations (852).",

    "question": "When managing commercial forests, how does thinning trees compare to shelterwood harvesting in terms of impacts on amphibian populations?",
    "answer": "Both thinning and shelterwood harvesting generally have less negative impacts than clearcutting, but still cause population declines compared to unharvested forest. For thinning, two studies found it resulted in higher amphibian abundance or a less negative overall response compared to clearcutting (852). For shelterwood harvesting, studies found it resulted in higher or similar salamander abundance compared to clearcutting (851). Compared to unharvested forest, both techniques were found to decrease salamander abundance (851, 852). One study found that emigrating salamanders used thinned forest significantly more than clearcuts, while use was similar to unharvested forest (852).",

Leaving coarse woody debris (fallen dead trees and branches) in forests provides valuable microhabitats (843), and reintroducing coarse woody debris during forest restoration was found to increase frog species in one study (772). Adding coarse woody debris to forest floors had mixed effects on the abundance of individual species (772). Providing artificial refugia made of other materials has also been shown to be used by translocated frogs and hellbenders (772).",

    "answer": "The evidence for translocation success is mixed but generally positive. A global review found that 65% of 54 amphibian translocations resulted in established breeding populations or substantial recruitment (854). Success varies by group: translocations of wood frogs (856) and salamanders/newts (860, 858) frequently established breeding populations. Toad translocations have also been successful, though one study on boreal toads failed (855, 859). Frog translocations have established populations, but some went extinct within five years (861). One review found that translocations of over 1,000 animals were more successful (854).",

    "question": "What factors are associated with the success or failure of captive breeding programs for frogs and toads?",
    "answer": "The success of captive breeding is influenced by several factors. Simulating natural environmental cycles, such as a wet and dry season, was found to be important for inducing reproduction in some frogs and toads (835, 836). Temperature can also affect reproductive success and tadpole development (835). For toads, housing them in outdoor enclosures led to higher reproductive success than indoor tanks (848). Parental care and tadpole density were also found to affect development (835). Hormone treatments can induce sperm and egg production, but success depends on the type, amount, and number of doses of hormone used (883).",

    "question": "On agricultural land, how does the effectiveness of managing livestock grazing for amphibians vary between species and habitat contexts?",
    "answer": "The effects of livestock grazing are highly variable. One study found that excluding livestock by fencing did not increase overall amphibian abundance but did increase larval abundance of some species, while other studies found that American toad and green frog abundance was higher with grazing (746). Managing grazing regimes also shows mixed results; one study found grazed plots had lower common toad abundance than ungrazed plots (780). However, several studies found that reintroducing grazing as part of broader habitat management increased or maintained populations of green toads and natterjack toads (780). One study noted that excluding livestock from temporary pools caused them to dry out 50 days earlier, which could be detrimental (746).",

Another review found that after translocation, breeding failed in 48% of ponds within three years (858). For toads, assisting them across roads during migration did not prevent population declines, with 64\u201370% of populations declining over 6\u201310 years (784).
