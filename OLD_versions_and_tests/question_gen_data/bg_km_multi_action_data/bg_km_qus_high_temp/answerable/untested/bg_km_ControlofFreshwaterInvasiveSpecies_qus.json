    "question": "What are the most effective non-chemical methods for controlling Crassula helmsii?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests that using salt water and lightproof barriers are the most effective non-chemical methods. Two container trials and two field trials found that seawater eradicated Crassula helmsii (1288). Similarly, five studies found that covering the plant with black sheeting or carpet strips eradicated or severely reduced it (1294). In contrast, other non-chemical methods have been found to be unlikely to be beneficial, including using hot foam (1286), aquatic dyes (1293), grazing (1301), and hydrogen peroxide (1281).",

    "answer": "Evidence from the UK on the comparative effectiveness of glyphosate and 2,4-D amine for controlling skunk cabbage is conflicting. One study found that both herbicides successfully killed all skunk cabbage plants in test areas. However, another UK study found that while 2,4-D amine successfully eradicated the plant, glyphosate was unsuccessful and resulted in only a limited reduction in growth (1102).",

    "answer": "For water primrose, a field study in China found that a specific flea beetle caused heavy destruction to seedlings (1135). For parrot's feather, studies have investigated a few different agents. Two field studies found that stocking with grass carp reduced the biomass or abundance of parrot's feather, though a laboratory study found no effect (1599). A field study in South Africa reported reduced growth following the release of a South American leaf-feeding beetle (1599). Additionally, one study found that parrot's feather plants survived treatment with a strain of the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris (1601).",

A before-and-after study in Switzerland found that introducing predators combined with trapping significantly reduced red swamp crayfish populations in a pond. Furthermore, a study from Italy demonstrated that trapping and predation in combination was more effective at reducing red swamp crayfish populations than predation alone (1031). For context, separate studies found that eels and pike could reduce red swamp crayfish populations (1030).",

    "question": "Besides applying chemical biocides, what are some effective alternative methods for controlling invasive Asian clams?",
    "answer": "Several effective alternatives to chemical biocides exist for controlling Asian clams. Mechanical removal via suction dredging has been shown to reduce clam densities by 96% in one trial and by 65-95% in another (1120). Placing gas-impermeable barriers on the lake bottom also significantly reduced clam abundance (1117). Environmental modifications are also effective; clams were killed by exposure to high salinity water (1115) and temperatures of 36\u00b0C or higher (1116). Finally, in industrial settings, mechanical removal, regular cleaning of pipes, or adding a sand filter have proven effective (1119).",

However, a potential drawback of removal efforts is that populations may not be controlled in the long term. A separate controlled study in the USA on direct removal found that bullfrog populations rapidly rebounded following intensive removal of adults (1045), suggesting that chemical control may need to be sustained to prevent re-establishment.",
