    "question": "What actions are available to mitigate reptile mortality on roads and railways?",
    "answer": "Several actions have been evaluated. Installing barriers along roads can reduce turtle mortality when combined with other measures like creating artificial nests or actively moving turtles (3500). Combining barriers with crossing structures has shown mixed results, with some studies finding no reduction in road deaths (3507). Tunnels and culverts are used by reptiles, but studies found they did not necessarily reduce road mortality (3508). Overpasses are also used by some reptiles (3510). Manually removing turtles from roads, in conjunction with fencing, was found to reduce deaths in one study (3523). Road signs have shown mixed effectiveness but can reduce mortality when combined with other measures (3524). Studies on road closures and altering road surfaces found that Blandingâ€™s turtles did not use these roads more or less than unmodified roads (3503, 3504).",

One study found Texas horned lizard survival was higher in moderately grazed sites compared to heavily grazed ones (3490). Ceasing livestock grazing altogether has also produced varied results. Seven of 14 studies found mixed effects on reptile abundance, four found ungrazed areas had higher abundance, and three found similar abundance compared to grazed areas (3498).",

One study also found they increased reptile species richness and abundance (3720). For artificial burrows, five studies reported their use by pygmy blue tongue lizards and gopher tortoises.

Adding LED lights, light sticks, or UV lights to fishing gear has been shown to reduce green and loggerhead turtle bycatch in gillnets, with mixed results for longlines (3554). Using fish bait instead of squid bait on hooks has been found to catch fewer sea turtles in four of five studies (3612). Using larger hooks may also reduce the likelihood of turtles swallowing them (3578).",

Lethal control of predators like raccoons and feral pigs was found to reduce nest predation in two before-and-after studies in the USA, although another study found short-term raccoon control had no effect (3671). Using artificial nest covers has shown positive results, with eight of 14 studies finding they reduced predation on sea turtle nests (3686). Relocating nests to hatcheries can also be effective at reducing predation losses compared to natural nests. However, the effect on hatching success compared to natural nests is mixed, with studies showing lower, similar, or higher success rates depending on the circumstances (3785).",

For grassland restoration, studies found similar species richness compared to unrestored areas but also higher lizard abundance in one case and fewer snakes in another (3737).

One study found this was more effective for gopher tortoises than a 'hard release' (3724).

The use of chemical deterrents like pepper powder has shown mixed results; three of four studies found it had no effect, while one found it reduced predation on loggerhead turtle nests (3694).
