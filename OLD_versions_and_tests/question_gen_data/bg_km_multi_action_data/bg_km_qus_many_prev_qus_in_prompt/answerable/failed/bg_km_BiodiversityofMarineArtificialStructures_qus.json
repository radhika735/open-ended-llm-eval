    "question": "To enhance biodiversity on subtidal artificial structures, which habitat creation methods have the most positive evidence for increasing overall species richness or diversity?",
    "answer": "Creating hole habitats (>50 mm) has some of the most positive evidence, with two of three studies finding they increased species richness/diversity, although often in combination with other features (3434). Creating pit habitats (3455), groove habitats (3448), and grooves with small protrusions/ledges (3452) also showed increased diversity in single studies, but again, this was in conjunction with other interventions. Creating small adjoining cavities/swimthroughs (≤100 mm) had mixed effects (3436). There is currently insufficient evidence to definitively state which is 'best'.",

    "question": "What factors might affect the long-term persistence and effectiveness of habitats created on artificial structures?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests several factors can limit long-term effectiveness. Habitats can get filled up with sediment; for example, wave-sheltered intertidal rock pools were observed to fill with sediment within two years (3476). Maintenance activities can also reverse benefits, as created or naturally formed holes and pits are often filled or repaired (3434, 3475). The size of the feature is also a factor, as small habitats like pits, grooves, and holes can get filled up rapidly (3475, 3473, 3434).",

Evidence for creating pit habitats (1-50 mm) is more mixed, with some studies finding increases in barnacle or mobile invertebrate abundance, some finding no effect, and others finding mixed results depending on the site, species, and pit configuration (3475). Creating natural rocky reef topography had mixed effects on barnacle and mobile invertebrate abundances, depending on the site (3435). Transplanting oysters was also found to have mixed effects on mobile invertebrate abundance, but did increase the abundance of other non-mobile invertebrates (3472).",

On subtidal structures, studies found that creating hole habitats (>50 mm) (3434), or a combination of grooves, small ledges, holes and environmentally-sensitive material (3452), increased species richness and diversity. Using certain environmentally-sensitive materials, such as ECOncrete™, sometimes combined with texture and small-scale habitats, also increased species richness and diversity (3470).

    "answer": "Evidence from Singapore suggests that creating small-scale topographical features generally increases biodiversity, though effects on abundance can be variable. Creating small protrusions (1-50 mm), along with other features like grooves, ridges, and pits, was found to increase the combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness (3462, 3474). However, the effects on overall community composition and abundance were mixed, often depending on the specific site, shore level, and the size and arrangement of the features created (3474, 3475). For example, creating small protrusions alone did not alter community composition in one study (3462), while creating pits was found to do so (3475).",

Creating smaller features like small swimthroughs (≤100 mm) or holes (>50 mm) had more variable outcomes, with studies reporting mixed or neutral effects on juvenile fish communities and fish abundance (3436, 3434).",
