    "question": "What actions can be taken to create new artificial roosting sites for bats?",
    "answer": "Several interventions focus on creating artificial roosts. The most widely studied action is providing bat boxes, which are used by bats in various habitats, although occupancy rates differ significantly (1024). Larger structures like artificial caves or hibernacula can also be created and have been shown to be used by multiple bat species (2049). In built environments, new roosting spaces can be incorporated into road or railway bridges and culverts (1967), or alternative roosts like bat lofts and barns can be created within building developments to replace lost roosts (949). For forest habitats, it is possible to create artificial hollows and cracks in trees (2047).",

    "question": "What are the effects of altering or avoiding artificial lighting on bat activity?",
    "answer": "Altering or avoiding artificial light is generally beneficial for bats. Avoiding illumination completely on commuting routes resulted in greater activity for lesser horseshoe and myotis bats (2017), and avoiding it at drinking sites led to greater activity for multiple species (2018). Where light is necessary, modifications can reduce negative impacts. Using red lighting instead of white or green light resulted in higher activity for one bat species group in one study, and more bats emerged from a roost lit with red light than with white light in another (2021). Additionally, using ultraviolet filters on lights led to higher activity for soprano pipistrelles in one study (1020).",

    "answer": "Several forestry management practices can mitigate the impacts of logging on bats. Using selective or reduced impact logging instead of conventional methods had a smaller effect on bat abundance and resulted in different bat species compositions (989). Thinning trees to reduce forest density is likely to be beneficial, with multiple studies finding higher overall bat activity in thinned forests compared to unthinned ones (991). During logging operations, retaining forested corridors can provide important roosting sites for some species and areas of high bat activity (996). Similarly, retaining residual tree patches within clearcut areas can provide habitat, with studies finding bat activity to be higher along the edges of these patches than in the open clearcut (995).",

One US study found that restoring wetlands increased overall bat activity to levels similar to undisturbed wetlands (2036). In contrast, restoring forests has shown mixed results; one study in Australia found restored forests had similar or higher bat activity than unmined forests (2050), while a study in Brazil found a reforested area had lower bat diversity than a native forest fragment (2050). For grassland, one UK study found that creating species-rich grassland did not result in different pipistrelle activity compared to conventional pasture or crop fields (2051).

For riparian buffers, one replicated study found that pipistrelle activity did not differ along waterways with vegetation buffers on agri-environment scheme farms compared to those on conventional farms (2284).

The distribution of most bat species in Spain was found to overlap significantly with areas designated for their protection (2045). The effectiveness of legally protecting bats during development is unknown. In the UK, while the number of development licenses for bats increased, a high proportion of licensees failed to conduct post-development monitoring, and a majority of roosts were destroyed during licensed activities (1935).

Creating new artificial water sources, such as farm ponds, is also likely to be beneficial, with studies finding that bat activity was often higher over artificial ponds compared to surrounding habitats or even natural wetlands (959). Additionally, creating or maintaining small dams can provide foraging and drinking habitat, with one study in Portugal finding that reservoirs created by small dams had greater bat activity than the streams feeding them (1997).",

For bat boxes, design elements such as colour (black boxes were used more), size (larger boxes had higher occupancy), material (concrete was preferred over wood in one study), and the number of compartments have been shown to affect use (1024). Microclimate is also critical; box orientation and sun exposure affected occupancy, and managing the microclimate of artificial roosts, such as by reducing internal temperatures, was found to increase bat numbers (1024, 2052). For roosts in buildings, access point design is important; one study found that a 'straight' design for a relocated access point was used by lesser horseshoe bats, whereas a 'bend' design was not (946). Furthermore, retaining existing roosts during development is more successful than creating new ones, as new structures are four times less likely to be used by returning bats (949).",

    "question": "What are the effects of retaining different types of vegetation features, such as forested corridors and residual tree patches, within logged forests in North America?",
    "answer": "Retaining forested corridors in logged areas in the USA is likely to be beneficial. Studies found higher bat activity along corridor edges than in adjacent logged areas, and corridors were used for roosting by Seminole bats and male evening bats (996). The effectiveness of retaining residual tree patches in logged areas in Canada is unknown. Studies found no difference in overall bat activity between the edges of tree patches and the edges of clearcuts, although smaller bat species showed higher activity at patch edges compared to the centre of clearcuts (995).",

    "question": "Besides installing gates, what other methods can be used to manage human access to caves and reduce disturbance to bats?",
    "answer": "Alternatives to installing gates to manage public access to caves include installing fencing around cave entrances (1991), imposing restrictions on cave visits, informing the public of ways to reduce disturbance (1003), and training tourist guides to minimize disturbance (1992). Evidence for fencing is mixed: one study found it did not affect bat population growth rates, while another found more bats emerged from a cave after a gate was replaced with a fence (1991). No studies were found that evaluated the effects of informing the public or training tour guides on bat populations (1003, 1992).",

    "question": "What actions are available to protect bats from direct harm or disturbance during building and development work?",
    "answer": "Several actions are available to protect bats during building work. These include changing the timing of the work to avoid vulnerable periods like the maternity or hibernation seasons, which one study found resulted in continued use of a roost (950). Another action is to exclude bats from roosts during the work; one study found this did not change the foraging behaviour of soprano pipistrelle colonies, but the overall effectiveness is unknown (1930). It is also possible to install sound-proofing insulation between roosts and human-occupied areas, though no studies evaluated this (1929). Finally, legal protection can be applied through licensing during development, but reviews in the UK suggest this has had a negative impact, with a high percentage of roosts destroyed and poor post-development monitoring (1935).",

    "question": "Based on the evidence for use and uptake, which type of artificial roosting structure is most consistently occupied by bats after installation?",
    "answer": "Based on the available evidence, bat boxes appear to be the most consistently used artificial roost. Forty-one of 43 studies found that bats used bat boxes across a wide range of habitats, and nine studies found the number of bats using them increased over time (1024). In contrast, the effectiveness of other structures is less certain. Artificial caves or hibernacula were found to be used by up to four bat species in four studies, with one showing increasing numbers over nine years (2049). Artificial hollows cut into trees were used by long-eared bats in one study, with eight of 16 hollows occupied (2047). The evidence suggests bat boxes have the broadest and most consistent record of successful occupation.",
