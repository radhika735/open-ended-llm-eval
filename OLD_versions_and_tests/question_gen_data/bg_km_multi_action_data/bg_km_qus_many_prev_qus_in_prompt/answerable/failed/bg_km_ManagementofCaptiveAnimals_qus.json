    "answer": "The most beneficial method found was scattering food throughout the enclosure, which increased feeding and exploratory behaviours in rhesus macaques and activity levels in gorillas [1315]. Other methods rated as 'likely to be beneficial' include hiding food in containers, which increased activity levels and foraging in lemurs and gibbons [1316], presenting food frozen in ice, which increased feeding time and decreased inactivity [1321], and presenting food items whole instead of processed, which increased time spent feeding [1323].",

Implementing an unpredictable feeding schedule reduced pacing in tigers and cheetahs [1904]. Altering the location of food also decreased pacing in cheetahs [1918]. Presenting food frozen in ice decreased stereotypic behaviours in felids generally [1923]. However, some actions have mixed results; feeding whole carcasses reduced pacing in lions and leopards but increased it in tigers [1901], and a bungee-carcass device decreased pacing in cougars but increased it in tigers [1927].",

    "answer": "Studies in Australia have found that manipulating conditions can improve breeding success. One study found that clutch size in frogs increased when sexes were separated in non-breeding periods, mate choice was provided for females, recorded mating calls were played, and females were allowed to gain weight before breeding (1880, 1881, 1882, 1888). Another study found frogs only bred after being moved to an enclosure with various substrates that allowed for temporary flooding, along with manipulating sex ratios and playing mating calls (1873, 1874, 1879, 1881).",
