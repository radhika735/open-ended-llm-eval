    "question": "What is the extent of the evidence base for controlling invasive Ponto-Caspian gobies using physical or chemical interventions?",
    "answer": "The evidence base for controlling Ponto-Caspian gobies is limited. While no evidence was found for many physical and chemical interventions such as applying biocides (1063), netting (1066), electrofishing (1067), or changing the pH (1073), there is evidence for a few methods. A laboratory study found that changing the salinity to 30‰ resulted in 100% mortality of round gobies (1072). Additionally, a field study in the USA demonstrated that an electrical barrier was effective at preventing the movement of round gobies (1074).",

    "answer": "The effects of chemical controls vary by species and chemical agent. For red swamp crayfish, the pyrethrum Pyblast was found to be effective (1036). For American bullfrogs, chemicals including caffeine and chloroxylenol were found to kill them (1048). Rotenone was reported to successfully eradicate black bullhead populations (1050). For skunk cabbage, both glyphosate and 2,4-D Amine were found to kill all plants in one study, though another study found glyphosate to be unsuccessful (1102). In contrast, the herbicide glyphosate was found to be 'Unlikely to be beneficial' for red-eared terrapins, only reducing hatching success at high concentrations (1059), and several chemicals tested on Ponto-Caspian killer shrimp were considered impractical for field application (1095).",

    "answer": "Several actions are available to prevent the spread of these species. For Ponto-Caspian gobies, using electrical barriers to prevent migration is 'Likely to be beneficial', with one study finding a barrier prevented their movement (1074). For Crassula helmsii, decontamination of equipment is a 'Beneficial' action; submerging the plant in hot water was found to be more effective for inducing mortality than drying it out (1308). While surrounding the plant with wire mesh has been suggested as a method to contain fragments, no evidence was captured on its effectiveness (1307). Public education is a potential tool for both species to reduce translocation, but no evidence was captured on its impact (1311, 1075).",

    "answer": "The evidence for the effectiveness of biological control differs between these two species in European habitats. For American bullfrogs, using native predators is rated 'Likely to be beneficial'. A replicated, controlled study in Belgium found that introducing northern pike led to a strong decline in bullfrog tadpole numbers, suggesting a significant benefit in controlling this invasive species (1039). For Procambarus crayfish, encouraging predators is rated 'Unlikely to be beneficial'. Although two studies in Italy found that eels fed on red swamp crayfish and reduced population size, the overall effectiveness rating is low, suggesting limited benefits from this approach (1030).",

    "answer": "For skunk cabbage, both physical removal and chemical herbicides (glyphosate and 2,4-D Amine) have shown to be effective in some studies, with one study showing annual removal over five years removed the entire stock (1101) and another showing two herbicides killed all tested plants (1102). However, a separate study found glyphosate was unsuccessful (1102). For Crassula helmsii, chemical control with glyphosate and diquat has been found to be effective, reducing the plant by up to 98% in one study (1279). Non-chemical methods like using seawater have been shown to eradicate the plant in trials (1288), and covering it with black sheeting or carpet has also severely reduced or eradicated it, although recolonization can occur (1294).",

Direct removal of adults can be challenging and populations may rebound quickly, but shooting metamorphosed individuals as part of a combination treatment was effective in France (1045). Removing juveniles using double fyke nets was also found to be effective in Belgium (1046). Additionally, chemicals like caffeine and chloroxylenol have been shown to kill bullfrogs (1048). For red-eared terrapins, direct removal of adults using traps can be effective but may not achieve eradication (1055).

Changing the water temperature is also effective; a UK lab study found that heating water to >43°C killed all shrimps immediately (1092). Dewatering the habitat can also be effective, with a Polish study finding that lowering water levels in sand killed three species of invasive shrimp (1094).
