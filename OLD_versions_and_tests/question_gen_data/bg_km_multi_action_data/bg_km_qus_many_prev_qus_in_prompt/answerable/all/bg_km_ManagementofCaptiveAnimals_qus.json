    "answer": "Several feeding enrichment actions have been shown to increase foraging and related active behaviours in captive carnivores. Hiding food around the enclosure increased exploring and foraging in species like leopard cats, bush dogs, and sun bears [1915]. Similarly, presenting food inside objects increased these behaviours in bears [1924]. Scattering food increased locomotion in maned wolves [1921], and providing live invertebrate prey increased explorative behaviours in fennec foxes [1926]. Providing bones, hides, or partial carcasses increased activity and manipulation time in felids and foxes [1902].",

One study found that providing a pre-breeding cooling period, along with other interventions like separating sexes and playing mating calls, increased breeding success [1864]. Another study found that frogs only bred after being moved to an indoor enclosure with various substrates that allowed for temporary flooding, along with manipulating sex ratios and playing mating calls [1873, 1874, 1879, 1881]. Increasing caloric intake for females before breeding, separating sexes during non-breeding periods, playing recorded mating calls, and allowing female mate choice have all been associated with increased clutch sizes in Australian frogs, though typically as part of a suite of interventions [1880, 1881, 1882, 1888].",

    "question": "Which dietary interventions are most likely to be beneficial for increasing activity and foraging in captive primates?",
    "answer": "Several interventions are rated as 'Likely to be beneficial'. Hiding food in containers increased activity levels and foraging behaviours in lemurs and gibbons (1316). Presenting food frozen in ice was found to increase feeding time and decrease inactivity (1321). Providing live invertebrates reduced inactivity and increased foraging in captive loris (1333). Finally, offering fresh produce instead of pellet feed increased time spent feeding and reduced inactivity in rhesus macaques (1335).",

    "answer": "Evidence from US-based studies indicates both actions are beneficial for increasing feeding time. One study found that when macaques were presented with whole foods instead of chopped foods, the time they spent feeding increased (1323). Similarly, another study on rhesus macaques found that offering fresh produce instead of pellet feed resulted in more time spent feeding and less time being inactive (1335).",

    "answer": "The evidence base is limited. One replicated, before-and-after study in the USA found that when food was presented in water-filled troughs, monkeys were more active and increased their use of tools (1320). However, a systematic search found no direct, quantitative studies on the effects of presenting food that explicitly requires the use or modification of tools (1319).",

    "answer": "Providing bones is rated as 'Likely to be beneficial', with studies showing it decreased stereotypic behaviours in lions and tigers and increased activity (1902). Feeding whole carcasses has a 'Trade off between benefit and harms'; it reduced pacing in lions, leopards, and snow leopards, but increased pacing in tigers. It also had mixed effects on nutritional indicators in cheetahs (1901).",

    "answer": "Several actions simulating seasonal changes have been studied in Europe. Studies in Italy, Germany, and Austria found that varying enclosure temperature (1864) and using artificial rainfall to simulate wet and dry seasons (1872) stimulated breeding. A UK-based study that varied UV lighting found no difference in clutch size but noted a greater fungal load on frogs that received a UV boost (1865).",

    "answer": "There appears to be variation based on geography and species. Studies in Europe (Switzerland, Ireland, UK) found that an unpredictable feeding schedule reduced stereotypic pacing in tigers and cheetahs (1904). Conversely, a study in the USA found an unpredictable schedule increased territorial behaviour in coyotes and alertness in a black-footed cat, but did not affect travelling or foraging (1904).",

Scattering food was found to increase locomotion in maned wolves in a Brazilian study (1921). Hiding food around the enclosure is rated as beneficial, with studies in the USA and Germany finding it increased exploring and foraging behaviours in maned wolves and Malayan sun bears (1915).",
