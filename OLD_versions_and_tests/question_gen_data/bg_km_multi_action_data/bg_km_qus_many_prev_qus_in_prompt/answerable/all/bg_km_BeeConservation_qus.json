    "question": "For supporting bumblebees on UK farmland, what is the difference in effectiveness between sowing field margins with agricultural nectar mixes versus native wildflower mixes?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests a trade-off depending on the goal. Three replicated trials showed that a mix of agricultural forage plants attracts a greater number of bumblebees than a perennial wildflower mix, at least in the first year (18). However, a separate small trial showed that long-tongued bumblebee species strongly preferred plots of perennial wildflower seed mix over a mix of annual forage plants (19). It is also noted that margins sown with agricultural legume plants can degrade in value for bumblebees and may need to be re-sown every few years (18).",

    "answer": "Different methods are effective for different bee groups. For bumblebees, one trial showed that grassy field margins attract nest-searching queens (12), and for artificial sites, multiple trials indicate that buried underground nest boxes are generally the most effective, showing higher occupancy rates than surface-level wooden boxes (48). For ground-nesting solitary bees, several small trials have shown that artificially created patches of bare soil can be successfully colonized (13). Many other solitary bee species readily occupy artificial nest boxes, such as bundles of hollow stems or blocks of wood drilled with holes (47).",

    "question": "What are the documented effects of managing uncropped field margins on wild bee populations in the UK?",
    "answer": "Various management techniques for uncropped field margins in the UK show different outcomes for bees. Sowing margins with native wildflowers was shown in five trials to support higher abundance and richness of foraging bumblebees compared to cropped, grassy, or naturally regenerated margins (19). In contrast, evidence for simple grassy margins is mixed, with three separate trials showing either enhanced bee abundance, enhanced bumblebee abundance and diversity, or no effect (14). Leaving margins to regenerate naturally resulted in more bumblebees than cropped margins in four trials, but their value can be inconsistent between years and may depend on weed species (20). Finally, two trials showed that leaving crop edges unsprayed (conservation headlands) did not attract more foraging bumblebees than conventional crop fields (29).",

Fourteen trials have shown that planting dedicated floral resources, such as phacelia or perennial herbs, attracts substantial numbers of foraging wild bees, with one trial showing it enhanced reproductive success for a solitary bee species (17). Sowing uncropped field margins with agricultural nectar and pollen mixes has been shown in four replicated trials to attract significantly more foraging bumblebees than grassy or cropped margins (18). Furthermore, four trials in Europe have demonstrated enhanced diversity and/or abundance of foraging wild bees on land managed under various agri-environment schemes compared to conventionally managed land (24).",

    "question": "What factors are associated with the success or failure of providing artificial nest sites for solitary bees?",
    "answer": "Multiple factors affect the success of artificial nest sites. Location is critical; nest boxes must be within the foraging range of bees, which for some species is just 150-600 m from resources (47). Design also matters; a trial found reed stem and wooden grooved-board boxes were more productive than those with plastic components, which had higher parasitism and mould (47). Predation and parasitism are major causes of failure, with mortality rates ranging from 13% to 56% across different studies (47). Competition from non-target species can also be an issue. For instance, two trials found introduced European earwigs occupied nest boxes (47), but another showed that excluding them with a sticky barrier increased usage by native bees (44). Similarly, excluding ants was found to increase offspring production in one trial (46).",

Two trials in North America found more wild bees (either more species or more individuals) in gardens planted with bee forage or native plants compared to conventionally managed gardens (1). A UK trial also noted that some popular non-native or horticulturally modified flowers are not frequently visited by insects (1). The second action is to practice lower-intensity management. A UK study found more species of bumblebee in gardens with less intensive management, which reflected the garden's tidiness and the use of pesticides (2).",

Translocating existing bumblebee colonies has shown negative impacts, including queen death and lower productivity in two out of three small trials (53).

Conversely, a trial in the Netherlands found that bee numbers were not higher in farmland 50-1,500 m away from planted flower patches, suggesting the local benefit did not scale up in that instance (17).

    "question": "What are the documented negative impacts or challenges associated with captive rearing and reintroduction of bumblebees?",
    "answer": "The evidence highlights several challenges. One trial found that over four years of artificial rearing, queen bumblebees gradually decreased in weight (50). When reintroduced to the wild, colonies can suffer high rates of social parasitism by cuckoo bees, with rates of 25-79% reported in two trials. One of these trials showed parasitism was influenced by landscape context and timing of release (52). Furthermore, re-introduced colonies may produce very low numbers of new queens, or none at all, as found in two UK trials (52).",

    "question": "What does the evidence from the USA indicate about how the effectiveness of bee conservation actions varies between agricultural and non-agricultural managed landscapes?",
    "answer": "Evidence from the USA shows varied effectiveness across landscapes. On farmland, results are mixed: one trial on squash farms found reduced tillage increased squash bee numbers, while another found no difference (11), and a separate trial showed responsible pesticide use did not affect foraging bee numbers (27). In non-agricultural landscapes, actions appear more consistently positive. Restoring native prairie vegetation on road verges in Kansas supported a greater number and diversity of bees than mown grass verges (30). Similarly, managing land under power lines in Maryland as scrub resulted in more bee species than mown grassland (31). Providing nest boxes for solitary bees has also been successful, though some trials noted high use by introduced species (47).",

    "question": "Besides habitat creation or restoration, what alternative conservation actions exist for directly managing and boosting populations of rare or declining bees?",
    "answer": "Several direct management actions have been trialled as alternatives to habitat restoration. These include captive rearing programs for declining bumblebee species, although with mixed success in rearing larvae to adulthood for some species (50). Reintroducing laboratory-reared bumblebee colonies has also been attempted, though success in producing new queens can be low (52). For solitary bees, local populations can be increased through management if sufficient floral resources are available (54), and translocation of immature bees has been shown to establish new populations (55). For stingless bees, genetic diversity in small, isolated populations can be maintained by introducing inseminated queens (56).",

    "question": "On UK farmland, which field margin management strategies appear most effective for bumblebees, and which seem least effective?",
    "answer": "Based on UK trials, the most effective strategies involve sowing flower mixes. Five trials showed that margins sown with native wild flowers support a higher abundance and richness of foraging bumblebees compared to cropped, grassy, or naturally regenerated margins (19). Sowing with agricultural nectar and pollen mixes also attracted significantly more foraging bumblebees than grassy or cropped margins in four trials (18). The least effective strategies appear to be conservation headlands (unsprayed crop edges), which two trials showed did not attract more foraging bumblebees than conventional crop fields (29). Evidence for grassy strips (14) and natural regeneration (20) is mixed, with some trials showing benefits and others showing no difference compared to cropped margins.",

    "answer": "Twenty-two trials have documented methods for rearing bumblebees in captivity, including confining mated queens alone, with workers, with male pupae, or using CO2 anaesthetisation (50). The success of rearing is influenced by the pollen diet, with fresh, high-protein pollen leading to better outcomes. An artificial light regime of 8 hours light/16 hours darkness can speed up egg-laying, and specific hibernation regimes can enhance colony formation (50).",
