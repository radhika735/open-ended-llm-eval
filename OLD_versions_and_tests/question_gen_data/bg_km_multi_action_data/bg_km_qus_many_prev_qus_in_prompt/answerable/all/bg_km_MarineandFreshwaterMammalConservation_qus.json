    "answer": "Translocating fur seals away from salmon farms is likely to be ineffective or harmful, as studies found that most seals returned (2776). Using acoustic devices showed mixed results; some studies found they reduced predation by seals and sea lions, while others found no effect on dolphins or seals (2775). Replacing anti-predator nets more frequently was found to reduce salmon losses to harbour seals in one study (2774). No evidence was found to assess the effectiveness of modifying aquaculture gear (2742), modifying anti-predator nets (2743), or minimizing food waste (2744).",

    "question": "Based on the available evidence, what are the most beneficial interventions for directly improving marine mammal survival rates?",
    "answer": "Interventions rated as beneficial or likely to be beneficial for improving survival include setting and enforcing vessel speed limits, which reduced manatee and North Atlantic right whale deaths from collisions (2777), and prohibiting the hunting of species like harbour seals and humpback whales, which led to population increases (2780). Removing derelict fishing gear from entangled Hawaiian monk seals and bottlenose dolphins has also been shown to improve their survival (2892). Legally protecting habitats has been linked to higher survival rates for Hector's dolphins and fewer human-caused strandings for Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (2915). Direct interventions like rescuing and releasing stranded mammals (2924) and rehabilitating injured or sick individuals before release (2925) also show high post-release survival rates for a variety of species.",

    "question": "What are the documented outcomes of modifying fishing nets and pots to reduce marine mammal interactions?",
    "answer": "Modifying fishing gear has shown mixed results. Deploying nets below the surface reduced dolphin entanglements in one study (2793). Using acoustically reflective net materials (e.g., barium sulfate or iron-oxide) was found to reduce harbour porpoise bycatch in two of three studies, though one study on dolphins found no effect (2807). Modifying fishing pots and traps by installing exclusion devices like steel rods or metal frames successfully reduced the number of seals and sea lion pups entering or becoming trapped (2822). Similarly, installing exclusion and escape devices on trawl nets reduced the number of trapped fur seals and dolphins (2823). However, using stiffened fishing nets did not reduce Franciscana dolphin entanglements in one study (2801).",

    "question": "In the North Pacific, what are the documented survival and reproductive outcomes for Hawaiian monk seals following direct interventions like translocation and rehabilitation?",
    "answer": "Several interventions in the North Pacific have targeted Hawaiian monk seal recovery. After removing aggressive male seals that were injuring females, the survival of adult females increased (2929). Translocating weaned pups to areas with better foraging conditions resulted in 50-83% surviving for at least one year, with survival rates similar to or greater than non-translocated pups (2930). Following rehabilitation and release, more than a quarter of seals reproduced (2925). A review of multiple interventions, including reuniting pups with mothers and translocations, found that over a quarter of the seals survived and reproduced (2927, 2930).",

    "question": "To reduce conflicts with seals at fisheries in the North Sea and Baltic Sea, how does modifying fishing gear compare to using acoustic devices?",
    "answer": "Both gear modification and acoustic deterrents have been tested to reduce seal conflicts in this region. Modifying fishing gear, such as using a larger mesh size in trap-nets (2803) or installing steel bars on bag-nets along with strengthened netting (2822), has been found to reduce damage to salmon catches by seals. Modifying pots with metal frames also reduced the number of seals trapped (2822). In comparison, using acoustic devices on fishing gear has also been shown to reduce damage to fish catches and fishing nets caused by seals (2808). However, acoustic devices come with a trade-off, as they can have far-reaching negative effects on non-target species and contribute to noise pollution (2808).",

    "question": "As an alternative to using deterrents, what fishery management strategies can reduce the likelihood of mammal entanglement?",
    "answer": "Several management strategies that alter when, where, or how fishing occurs can reduce entanglement risk without using deterrents. Establishing 'move-on rules' that require vessels to relocate if dolphins are encountered resulted in fewer dolphins being encircled and killed in one Australian fishery (2790). Another strategy is to deploy fishing gear at different depths; one study found that nets deployed 4.5m below the surface had fewer dolphin entanglements than surface nets (2793). Other potential management actions for which no direct evidence on mammal populations was found include deploying gear when mammals are less active (2792), limiting the number of fishing vessels or fishing days in an area (2794), limiting the length of fishing gear (2795), and reducing the time gear is in the water (2796).",

    "question": "What is the evidence for the effectiveness of different approaches to managing tourist behaviour to reduce disturbance to seals at wildlife-viewing sites?",
    "answer": "Several methods for managing tourist behaviour around seals have been studied. Prohibiting human access entirely on a beach resulted in fewer Australian sea lions showing aggression or retreating compared to a beach with partial access restrictions (2917). In New Zealand, the presence of an official-looking volunteer resulted in fewer tourists harassing New Zealand fur seals at a waterfall (2844). Enforcing regulations for tour boats, such as approach distances, led to more seals remaining on shore in a seal colony in the Bass Strait, Australia (2838). In contrast, a study on New Zealand fur seals found that information signs alone did not change the number of tourists who approached and disturbed seals (2843).",
