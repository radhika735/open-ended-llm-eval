    "question": "What actions can I take to reduce human-bear conflict in residential or recreational areas?",
    "answer": "Several actions show potential for reducing human-bear conflict. Providing diversionary feeding was found in two US studies to reduce nuisance behaviour by black bears (2323). Scaring or deterring bears with noise, pain deterrents, or dogs has shown mixed results, with some studies finding it effective and others not (2347). A beneficial action is to prevent bears from accessing food sources, for example by using electric shock devices on bird feeders (2346). In contrast, one US study found that issuing enforcement notices for non bear-proof dumpsters did not reduce garbage accessibility (2345). Translocating problem bears is an option, but studies show many return to their capture locations and can have lower survival rates (2336, 2341). One study found that habituating brown bears to humans reduced their aggression towards visitors (2340).",

    "question": "What are the most effective interventions to reduce predation of wild mammals by domestic cats in residential areas?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests two particularly beneficial actions. Keeping domestic cats indoors, especially at night, was shown in one UK study to reduce the number of dead or injured mammals brought home by cats (2326). Another beneficial intervention is the use of collar-mounted devices. Five studies from the UK, Australia, and the USA found that various devices, including bells, sonic devices, neoprene flaps, and brightly coloured collars, all reduced the rate at which cats predated and returned home with mammals (2332).",

    "answer": "Translocating problem mammals to mitigate conflict often leads to poor population-level outcomes, with the effectiveness rated as 'Likely to be ineffective or harmful' or 'Trade off between benefit and harms'. Studies consistently show reduced survival rates for translocated animals compared to resident populations. This has been documented for grizzly bears, black bears, and white-tailed deer moved from residential areas (2336); predators like cougars and leopards moved away from livestock (2436); and crop-raiding African elephants (2485). In addition to low survival, many translocated animals return to their capture sites or continue to cause nuisance behaviour elsewhere, such as bears returning to residential areas and leopards attacking more humans and livestock post-translocation (2336, 2436).",

On the positive side, supplementary feeding has been found to increase the abundance of species like bank voles and red squirrels, enhance reproduction in striped mice and arctic foxes, and improve survival for mule deer and northern flying squirrels (2367). However, there are also negative or neutral effects. Several studies found no increase in abundance for species such as white-footed mice and Eurasian otters, or survival for white-tailed deer and Iberian lynx. Behavioural changes are also a key impact, with some studies finding that supplementary feeding led to reduced home range sizes for red deer and elk (2367).",

    "answer": "Both non-electric and electric fencing are rated as beneficial for reducing human-wildlife conflict. Non-electric fences have been shown to reduce livestock predation by coyotes and Tibetan brown bears and to reduce crop damage by European rabbits (2415). Electric fencing has also been proven effective in multiple studies for reducing or preventing livestock predation by various carnivores (2417). For crop protection, numerous studies found electric fences deterred crossings by mammals ranging in size from European rabbits to elephants (2439). However, the effectiveness of both types can depend on design and the target species. Some electric fence designs failed to prevent carnivore crossings (2417), and a study found one type of non-electric fencing did not deter wild boar or brown hare (2415).",

Installing electric fencing is also rated as beneficial, with numerous studies finding it reduced or prevented entry to livestock enclosures and predation by carnivores (2417). Other deterrents include flags (fladry) hung from fences, which deterred wolves but not coyotes in several studies (2421), and using devices that emit lights and sound, which were found to deter predators from predating sheep or consuming bait in three US studies (2449). Taste-aversion has shown mixed results, with some studies finding it reduced predation by coyotes while others did not (2429).",

One reported that a social marketing campaign with a hotline increased the reporting of illegal hunting, while another found that displaying educational signs did not reduce black bears' access to garbage (2422). For more targeted education programmes, two studies were found. One study in South Africa found that educating ranchers about reducing livestock losses, alongside stricter hunting policies, was associated with increased leopard populations (2423). However, a US study found that directly visiting households to educate them about bears and garbage did not increase their use of wildlife-resistant dumpsters (2423).",

Using holding pens at the release site prior to release is beneficial for both translocated (2434) and captive-bred (2510) animals, with studies showing increased survival and reproduction. Releasing animals into fenced areas (2467, 2521) or areas where invasive predators have been controlled (2469) is also beneficial. Providing supplementary food after release can increase survival and reproductive success (2470, 2527), as can providing artificial refuges or breeding sites (2453). The structure of the release group matters, with releases in family/social groups (2463) or larger unrelated groups (2462) showing benefits. Finally, the timing of the release can be critical, with studies finding that releasing animals in a specific season can increase survival rates (2447).",

    "answer": "Establishing wild flower areas on farmland appears likely to be beneficial, with studies finding they contained more small mammals compared to set-aside areas, grasslands, and crop margins (2359). Creating uncultivated margins is also beneficial; some studies found these areas had higher numbers of small mammals relative to crops and set-aside, though other studies reported mixed or no effects (2365). In contrast, retaining set-aside areas is only likely to be beneficial, with three studies finding that set-aside did not enhance small mammal numbers relative to cropland or uncultivated field margins (2377). This suggests that actively establishing wildflower or uncultivated margins is more consistently effective for small mammals than simply retaining set-aside areas.",

Using selective harvesting instead of clearcutting is likely to be beneficial, though studies showed mixed results, with only one of six finding more small mammals in selectively harvested stands compared to clearcut stands (2637). Patch retention harvesting is also likely to be beneficial, with studies finding it increased or maintained numbers of some, but not all, small mammal species relative to clearcutting (2639). Thinning forest instead of clearcutting was found in one study to increase use by desert cottontails (2643). Felling trees in groups had mixed effects, increasing the abundance of one of four small mammal species in one study, but having no effect on others (2648). Overall, these less intensive methods can provide better outcomes for some forest mammals than clearcutting.",

The characteristics of the translocated animals also matter; one study on 'nuisance' bears found that younger bears and those moved over greater distances were less likely to return to their capture site, increasing the chance of success (2341). The timing of release can affect survival, with studies showing higher survival for animals released in a particular season (2447). Social factors are also key; releasing mammals in family or social groups (2463) or in larger unrelated groups (2462) has been shown to increase reproductive success and survival.

Numerous studies found that prescribed burning did not increase the abundances of small mammals, and some reported mixed effects depending on the species (2388).
