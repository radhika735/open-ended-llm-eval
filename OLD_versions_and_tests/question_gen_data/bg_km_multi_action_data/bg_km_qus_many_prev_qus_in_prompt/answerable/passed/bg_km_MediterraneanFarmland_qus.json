    "question": "What are the overall effects of growing cover crops on Mediterranean farmland?",
    "answer": "Growing cover crops has varied effects. For soil, it is beneficial, increasing organic matter, nitrogen, soil organisms, and reducing erosion [1345]. For water, it's a trade-off, as it can reduce soil water content but also decrease water loss from runoff and nitrate leaching [1357]. For crop production, it is likely to be ineffective or harmful, with multiple studies finding lower cash crop yields [1351]. For pest regulation, it is likely beneficial, reducing weeds and some pest insects [1394].",

    "question": "What are the potential trade-offs regarding greenhouse gas emissions when adding compost, manure, or slurry to soils on Mediterranean farmland?",
    "answer": "While these amendments can improve soil fertility, there is a trade-off as they often increase greenhouse gas emissions. Multiple studies found that adding compost led to more greenhouse gases in the soil [1362]. Similarly, adding manure was found to increase carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions [1363], and adding slurry was found to increase emissions of carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide while also reducing the soil's absorption of methane [1365].",

    "answer": "Planting or maintaining ground cover is the main action documented for reducing soil erosion and managing water in orchards and vineyards. Six studies found that ground cover reduced soil erosion compared to bare or tilled soils [1367]. However, there are trade-offs for water availability; while six studies found less water was lost as runoff from plots with ground cover, two studies found that the cover crops themselves used more water than bare soil conditions [1382].",

Six studies all found higher crop yields in plots with added pig slurry [1349]. Adding compost also shows promise, with three studies finding higher crop yields, though three other studies found similar yields [1346]. The evidence for manure and sewage sludge is more limited; one study found higher barley yields with sewage sludge [1348] and one of two studies found higher maize yields with manure [1347].",

    "answer": "The effects of grazing management on plants are highly variable and context-dependent, with no single strategy showing consistently positive outcomes. Excluding grazers produced conflicting results, with numerous studies finding both higher and lower plant abundance and diversity [1417]. Using fewer grazers also had mixed effects on plant cover, with no clear impact on diversity [1418]. Rotational grazing was found in one study to increase the cover of native plants [1420], while seasonal grazing studies showed that the timing of grazing significantly altered plant cover and diversity [1421]. Using grazers to manage vegetation also led to mixed results for both plant abundance and diversity [1419].",
