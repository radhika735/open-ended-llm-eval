    "question": "What are the most beneficial methods for controlling invasive Procambarus crayfish populations?",
    "answer": "Several methods are rated as 'Likely to be beneficial' for controlling Procambarus crayfish. Combining trapping with the encouragement of predators significantly reduced red swamp crayfish populations in studies in Switzerland and Italy (1031). Trapping alone, especially when baited with food like tinned meat, was also found to be an effective capture method (1029). Sterilizing males, for example by exposing them to X-rays, was found in a laboratory study to reduce the number of offspring produced (1032). Finally, adding chemicals like the natural pyrethrum Pyblast to the water can kill red swamp crayfish, though its application in drained burrows was not effective (1036).",

    "question": "For controlling skunk cabbage in the UK, what is the comparative effectiveness of physical removal versus chemical herbicides?",
    "answer": "Both physical removal and chemical herbicides have shown some success in controlling skunk cabbage, but results can vary. For chemical control, one UK study found that both glyphosate and 2,4-D Amine killed all skunk cabbage plants, but another UK study found glyphosate to be unsuccessful while 2,4-D amine was effective (1102). For physical control, a study in Switzerland showed that annual removal over five years eradicated a recently established population. In contrast, a study in Germany found that even after four years of twice-yearly removal, a significant number of plants remained (1101). The effectiveness of either method may depend on the specific site conditions and the age of the infestation.",

Biological control, such as introducing native predators like the northern pike, has been shown to cause a strong decline in tadpole numbers (1039). Direct removal of juveniles using double fyke nets was found to be effective in small shallow ponds in one study (1046). Direct removal of adults is also an option, though studies show catchability can be low with nets and populations may rebound quickly after removal (1045).

Increasing water salinity can be effective; a lab study found that high salinities killed 100% of Asian clams (1115), and another study found that increased salinity killed the majority of invasive shrimp, although a separate study found no effect (1091). In contrast, altering pH appears less promising. A laboratory study found that lowering the pH of water did not kill invasive killer shrimp (1093), and no evidence was found for the effect of pH adjustment on Asian clams (1114).

Using salt water has been shown to be 'Likely to be beneficial', with UK studies finding that seawater eradicated the plant in both container and field trials (1288).

    "answer": "Using herbivorous biological controls for invasive aquatic plants can be effective but involves trade-offs, particularly regarding non-target impacts. For water primrose, introducing a host-specific flea beetle was found to be 'Likely to be beneficial', significantly reducing primrose abundance in US and Chinese studies with limited off-target effects noted (1135). For parrot's feather, the use of herbivores is considered a 'Trade off between benefit and harms'. While stocking with non-native grass carp reduced parrot's feather biomass in some studies, they are generalist herbivores that can consume and harm native plants. The release of a more specific leaf-feeding beetle in South Africa also reportedly reduced the growth of parrot's feather (1599). The main benefit is potential long-term control, while the primary trade-off is the risk of harming native species, especially with generalist herbivores.",

    "question": "What is the extent of the evidence base for controlling invasive Ponto-Caspian gobies and bullheads by altering environmental conditions like salinity, pH, or water levels?",
    "answer": "The evidence base varies. For Ponto-Caspian gobies, a beneficial effect was found for changing salinity; one Canadian study showed 100% mortality of round gobies at 30‰ salinity (1072). However, no evidence was captured for controlling gobies by draining waterbodies (1065) or changing pH (1073). For brown and black bullheads, no evidence was found for the effectiveness of draining waterbodies (1078), changing salinity (1084), or changing pH (1085) as control methods.",

    "question": "What are the observed benefits of using host-specific herbivores as biological controls for invasive floating pennywort and water primrose?",
    "answer": "For water primrose, the introduction of a flea beetle has shown beneficial results. One study in China found it caused heavy feeding destruction and was specific to water primrose and one other species (1135). Another US study found that introducing flea beetles to a pond significantly reduced the abundance of large-flower primrose-willow (1135). For floating pennywort, the evidence is less positive. A South American weevil caused more feeding lesions on floating pennywort than other plants in a lab study, but field results found that the weevil did not reduce the plant's biomass, suggesting this method is unlikely to be beneficial (1123).",

    "question": "What are the effects of using physical or electrical barriers to prevent the spread of invasive crayfish and Ponto-Caspian gobies in river systems?",
    "answer": "The use of barriers is likely to be beneficial for both groups. For red swamp crayfish, a study in Spain found that specially designed concrete dams were effective at containing the population's spread upstream (1037). For Ponto-Caspian gobies, a replicated field study in the USA found that an electrical barrier was effective at preventing the movement of round gobies, with effectiveness increasing with higher voltage and pulse duration (1074).",
