    "question": "For pasture management, how does delaying mowing compare to using grazing instead of cutting for natural enemy populations?",
    "answer": "Delaying mowing had mixed or negative effects; one study found fewer predatory spiders, three found no change in insect predators, and one found mixed effects (727). Using grazing instead of cutting also showed mixed effects on natural enemies in two studies, with some species affected on some dates but not others, while a third study found no effect (885).",

Two of three studies found that crop growth was inhibited by these allelopathic plant remains (728).

For planting new hedges, one study found more natural enemies in the hedge than in the crop, but another found this varied, and a third study found no effect on spiders in crops (752). Alley cropping, which involves growing crops between tree lines, found more wasps and spiders but fewer ladybirds in one study (718).",

Seven of eight studies found an increase in predatory insects or spiders, either in the uncut area itself or in the adjacent harvested area (725). One study also found increased predation and parasitism rates in the unharvested strips. However, two studies found an increase in pest numbers in partially cut plots, and two other studies found more pests in the uncut areas themselves, indicating a trade-off (725).",

    "answer": "Two key actions are available for managing ant populations in perennial crops. Where ants are beneficial predators, their colonies can be isolated by pruning trees, which was found in one study to increase the number of trees they occupied, reduce pest damage, and increase yields (773). Conversely, where ants protect pests, they can be excluded by applying adhesive barriers to tree trunks. This has been shown to increase parasitism rates of pests and, in some studies, reduce pest numbers (886).",

Some interventions have shown clear financial benefits: 'push-pull' systems were found to provide greater economic benefits in multiple studies (753), and crop rotation in potato systems was found to increase profit in one study (719). Other strategies can reduce costs; using pesticides only when thresholds are met was found in nine studies to require fewer applications and in three studies to lower production costs, while generally maintaining similar profits to conventional spraying (750). Beetle banks could also provide economic savings if they prevent the need for spraying (729). However, not all strategies are profitable. Alley cropping was found to lower costs but also profit (718), while organic farming only increased profit if a premium price was received, otherwise profit decreased or was unaffected (717).",

Altering timing based on suspected crop susceptibility found mixed effects on yield in two studies and no effect in another, though one study found higher profits (723). Using pest or damage thresholds to trigger spraying resulted in similar yields and profits to conventional spraying in several studies, though one study found increased crop damage. Both approaches generally resulted in fewer pesticide applications (750, 723). One study found threshold-based spraying increased natural enemies, while another found spraying earlier in the season increased them (750, 723).",
