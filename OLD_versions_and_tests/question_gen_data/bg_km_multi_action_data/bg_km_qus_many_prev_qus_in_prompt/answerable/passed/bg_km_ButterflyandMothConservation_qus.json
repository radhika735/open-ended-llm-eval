    "question": "Which fire management strategies appear most beneficial for butterfly populations in open habitats?",
    "answer": "Strategies that create a mosaic of burned and unburned areas seem most beneficial. Leaving unburned patches during prescribed burning was found to increase the abundance of Karner blue butterflies and was associated with higher abundance for six out of nine specialist butterfly species in another study (3879). Rotational burning, for example every 2-5 years, can also be beneficial, with studies finding higher butterfly abundance in prairies burned more than 1-4 years ago compared to recently burned areas (3883). The timing of burns is also important; one study found that early season burning increased caterpillar abundance, whereas late season burning did not (3878). A single prescribed burn can increase the abundance of some species like the heath fritillary, but decrease it for others like the regal fritillary (3882).",

    "question": "How does the effectiveness of converting to organic farming for butterflies vary depending on the surrounding landscape?",
    "answer": "The surrounding landscape context appears to be a key factor in the effectiveness of organic farming. Evidence from Sweden and the UK shows that organic farms had greater butterfly and burnet moth species richness and abundance than conventional farms, but this was only observed in intensively managed landscapes, not in more diverse landscapes (3907). Furthermore, both organic and conventional farms located within a landscape with a high proportion of organic farms had higher butterfly and burnet moth species richness than either farm type in a landscape dominated by conventional farms (3907). This suggests that the benefits of on-farm organic practices are greatest in otherwise simple agricultural landscapes.",

    "question": "What are the general effects of reducing or ceasing management intensity on grassland butterfly and moth populations?",
    "answer": "Reducing or ceasing management on grasslands has mixed effects that vary by species and the specific action. Ceasing grazing or mowing can benefit some species but harm others; one review found that ceasing grazing benefitted 6 out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern (3956). In some cases, abandoned grasslands had a higher abundance of certain butterfly and moth species than grazed or mown grasslands (3956, 3957). Conversely, reducing grazing intensity by lowering stocking density was found to increase the abundance of butterflies and moths in several studies (3959). Similarly, reducing cutting frequency from multiple times a year to once a year was found to increase the abundance of some pollinators, including butterflies (3961). Overall, less intensively managed grasslands (e.g., lower grazing/mowing, no fertilizer) tend to have higher species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths than conventionally managed ones (3958).",

    "answer": "Evidence for managing perennial crops shows mixed results. For orchards, managed and abandoned traditional orchards had similar butterfly and burnet moth species richness, but abundance was lower in managed orchards (3917). For vineyards, encouraging native plants and reducing insecticide use increased butterfly abundance but not richness in one study, while another found reduced chemical use increased richness (3919). For bioenergy crops, planting a diverse mix of species led to greater butterfly species richness and abundance than planting fewer species (3918). In shaded coffee plantations, a greater diversity of caterpillars and butterflies was found compared to sun-grown monocultures (3931).",

    "question": "Which grassland management techniques—grazing, mowing, or prescribed fire—appear to be most and least beneficial for butterfly and moth diversity?",
    "answer": "The evidence does not point to a single best technique, as outcomes are highly context-dependent and results are often mixed. Several studies found that maintaining semi-natural grassland with either light grazing or annual mowing resulted in similar butterfly species richness (3908). However, another study found staggered mowing was best for butterfly richness, while annual mowing was better than grazing for moth richness (3908). Long-term abandonment (ceasing grazing or mowing) often leads to a decline in species richness (3956, 3957). Prescribed fire had mixed results; one study found patch-burning led to lower butterfly richness than rotational grazing (3882). Therefore, no single method is consistently superior, and the optimal approach likely depends on the specific habitat and target species.",

    "answer": "Evidence suggests that several actions can reduce the attraction of moths to artificial lighting. Using 'warmer' red or yellow lighting is less attractive than UV, blue, or conventional lights, and moths spend more time feeding under red lights than under white or green ones (3906). Additionally, using low-intensity lights (3902) and shielded \"full cut-off\" lights that prevent outward light scatter (3904) attract fewer moths.",

Studies found that grasslands with lower stocking densities had greater species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths than those with higher densities (3959). Seasonally removing livestock also led to higher abundance (3960). In contrast, ceasing grazing entirely shows mixed results. While some studies found higher abundance in abandoned grasslands compared to grazed ones, others found lower abundance or no difference, with communities sometimes becoming dominated by generalist species over time (3956). The large blue and silver-studded blue even went extinct in some abandoned meadows (3956).",

In coppiced woodland, butterfly abundance was higher in areas coppiced up to 15 years ago compared to older coppice (3939). For cleared patches, one study found butterfly abundance declined over the first three years post-clearing, while another found peak abundance for heath fritillary at 2-4 years post-clearance (3938). Similarly, under power lines, butterfly species richness and abundance peaked 2-4 years after clearance, with some species only using areas cleared within the last two years (3855). This suggests a rotational cycle of roughly 2-7 years is often needed to maintain optimal conditions.",
