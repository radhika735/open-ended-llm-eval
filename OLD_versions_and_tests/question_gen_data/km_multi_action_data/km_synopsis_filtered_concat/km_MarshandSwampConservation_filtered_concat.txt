Community types (1 study): One before-and-after study in the USA reported that 3–10 years after improving tidal exchange in a degraded marsh, the area of salt marsh community types differed from historical, pre-degradation levels.
Community composition (3 studies): Three before-and-after studies in the USA found that in the four years after improving tidal exchange in degraded brackish/salt marshes, the overall plant community composition significantly differed to that present before intervention. However, in one of the studies this was only true in one of two marshes (the most degraded before intervention). One of the studies also reported that the overall plant community composition became more similar to adjacent natural brackish/salt marshes over two growing seasons after intervention.
Overall richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, before-and-after, site comparison study in the USA/Canada found that overall plant species richness was similar in ≥3-year-old tidally restored salt marshes and nearby natural salt marshes. However, there was also no significant difference between degraded marshes (before tidal restoration) and the natural marshes.
Characteristic plant richness/diversity (1 study): One study of a coastal marsh in the USA reported that over three years after restoring tidal exchange (along with a prescribed burn), the number of salt-tolerant plant species increased, whilst the number of freshwater plant species decreased.

In one study the total cover of salt-tolerant plant species increased, but in the other study it did not. One of the studies also found that tidally restored marshes had lower cover of salt-tolerant plants than nearby natural marshes.
Individual species abundance (5 studies): Five studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. All five studies were in brackish/salt marshes in the USA. Three before-and-after studies reported increases in cover or frequency of smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora in the four years after improving tidal exchange. One replicated, site comparison study found that smooth cordgrass cover was lower in tidally restored areas than in natural salt marshes, 13–54 years after tidal restoration. Two before-and-after studies reported no clear change in frequency or cover of saltmeadow cordgrass Spartina patens in the four years after improving tidal exchange, but one before-and-after study reported an increase in saltmeadow cordgrass cover over two growing seasons after improving tidal exchange. Four studies reported declines in cover or frequency of less salt-tolerant species such as common reed Phragmites australis and cattails Typha spp. in the four years after improving tidal exchange (sometimes along with other interventions). One replicated, site comparison study found that common reed cover was similarly low (&lt;1%) in tidally restored areas and natural salt marshes, 13–54 years after tidal restoration.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community composition (1 study): One before-and-after study in the USA found that directly pumping water into drained marshes and wet meadows generated plant communities characteristic of wetter conditions. This change was reversed in some plots when the pump output was moved further away from the focal wetlands.
Relative abundance (2 studies): One replicated, randomized, controlled study of freshwater marshes in the USA reported that irrigated and non-irrigated marshes supported a similar relative abundance of the most common plant species. One before-and-after study on a floodplain in Cameroon found that the relative abundance of some key plant species changed over four years after restoring wet-season flooding. There was also an increase in the cover of perennial relative to annual herbs.
Overall richness/diversity (4 studies): One before-and-after study of a marsh/swamp in the USA found that overall plant diversity was higher in the autumn following a managed flood/drawdown than in the autumn before. Two before-and-after studies of marshes and wet meadows in the USA reported that plant species richness and/or diversity declined over 5–6 years of water level management (fluctuation or water addition). One study in the USA simply reported the number of plant species that colonized a floodplain, over three weeks after lowering the river level.

For example, one before-and-after study of a marsh/swamp in the USA reported mixed effects of a managed flood/drawdown on species cover, including increased cover of Pacific willow Salix lucida and reduced cover of reed canarygrass Phalaris arundinacea. One controlled study of freshwater marshes in the USA found that irrigated marshes developed a greater biomass of pink smartweed Polygonum pensylvanicum, after one growing season, than marshes that were left dry.

Community types (1 study): One before-and-after study of a lakeshore brackish/salt marsh in Tunisia reported an increase in coverage of bulrush-dominated vegetation over nine years of freshwater releases into the lake (to increase its level and restore winter flooding of the marsh).
Community composition (3 studies): One replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after study of brackish marshes in France reported that artificially flooded marshes developed different plant communities, over five years, to fields with unmanaged flooding. One before-and-after, site comparison study of brackish/salt marshes in the USA reported that the overall plant community composition changed more, over four years, in a marsh directly irrigated with treated wastewater than in downstream marshes. One replicated, paired, site comparison study of brackish/salt marshes in the USA reported that that marshes in which water levels were drawn down each spring/autumn (along with disking soils) shared only 24–34% of plant species with marshes that were not drawn down (or disked).
Overall richness/diversity (5 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies of brackish/salt marshes in the USA found that marshes in which water levels were managed (sometimes along with other interventions) had similar plant species richness and/or diversity to marshes without water level management. One replicated, site comparison study of brackish and salt marshes in the USA reported that marshes in which water levels were managed had similar or higher plant species richness, in winter, than marshes without water level management. One before-and-after, site comparison study of brackish/salt marshes in the USA reported that plant species richness increased, over four years, in marshes directly irrigated with treated wastewater – but only to similar levels as in downstream marshes. One replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after study of brackish marshes in France reported that the effects of artificial flooding on plant species richness depended on whether the marshes were grazed.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (2 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies of brackish and salt marshes in the USA reported that marshes in which water levels were managed typically had similar overall vegetation cover to marshes without water level management. One of the studies also reported that cover of standing dead vegetation was higher in the managed marshes than in the unmanaged marshes.
Individual species abundance (6 studies): Six studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. For example, four replicated, site comparison studies of brackish and salt marshes in the USA reported mixed effects of water level management on the abundance of saltmeadow cordgrass Spartina patens. One replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after study of brackish marshes in France reported that the effects of artificial flooding on the cover of individual plant species depended on the flooding (and grazing) regime.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community composition (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after study in brackish wet grasslands in Estonia found that annual cutting affected overall plant community composition, with significant differences between cut and uncut plots after four years.
Overall richness/diversity (3 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies in France found that cut and uncut reedbeds had similar overall plant species richness. One replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after study in brackish wet grasslands in Estonia found that cut and uncut plots typically had similar plant species richness and diversity over four years.

Overall abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in France found that cut and uncut reedbeds had similar cover of plants other than common reed Phragmites australis.
Individual species abundance (5 studies): Five studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. For example, two replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after studies in brackish marshes or grasslands in South Africa and Estonia found that cutting had mixed effects on the abundance of common reed Phragmites australis after 1–4 years, depending on the water level of the plots. One site comparison study in Denmark found that a fresh/brackish reedbed cut two years previously contained fewer “tall” common reed stems than a reedbed cut seven years previously. Two replicated, site comparison studies in France found that cut reedbeds contained a similar number (and, in one study, biomass) of live reed stems than uncut reedbeds, but far fewer dead stems.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Height (4 studies): Two controlled studies (one also replicated, randomized, before-and-after) in brackish marshes in the USA and South Africa reported that rushes or reeds were shorter in cut plots than in uncut plots, for up to one year after cutting. Two replicated, site comparison studies in France found that live reed stems were a similar height in cut and uncut reedbeds.
Diameter/perimeter/area (3 studies): Two site comparison studies (one replicated) in fresh/brackish reedbeds in Denmark and France found that common reed Phragmites australis stems were a similar diameter in cut and uncut reedbeds. One replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after study in a brackish marsh in South Africa found that cutting reduced the diameter of common reed stems present one year later.
Basal area (1 study): One site comparison study in a fresh/brackish marsh in Denmark found that the basal area of common reed Phragmites australis stems was smaller in a reedbed cut two years previously than in a reedbed cut seven years previously. Only “tall” stems were sampled.

Five studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of using grazing to maintain or restore disturbance in freshwater marshes. Two studies were in the UK. There was one study in each of the Netherlands, Germany and the USA.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community types (2 studies): One study of a riparian wet meadow in Germany reported changes in the area of plant community types over four years of grazing (after cutting trees/shrubs). One replicated, before-and-after study of dune slacks in the UK reported that the plant community type within plots remained stable over 16 years of grazing.
Community composition (3 studies): Two replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, studies in freshwater marshes/wet meadows in the UK and the USA reported that the overall plant community composition was similar in grazed and ungrazed plots after 2–9 years. One replicated study of dune slacks in the Netherlands simply reported changes in the overall plant community composition after resuming grazing (along with other interventions).
Overall richness/diversity (4 studies): Two studies (one replicated, before-and-after) in wetlands in Germany and the UK reported that after resuming grazing (and cutting trees/shrubs in one study), there were increases in total plant species richness and/or diversity. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in the UK reported that grazing had no significant effect on overall plant species richness in wet grassland and flush vegetation: there were similar declines over nine years in grazed and ungrazed plots. One replicated study of dune slacks in the Netherlands simply quantified total plant species richness over three years after resuming grazing (along with other interventions).
Characteristic plant richness/diversity (2 studies): One replicated, before-and-after study in dune slacks in the UK reported that after resuming grazing, the number of dune-slack indicator species increased. One replicated study of dune slacks in the Netherlands simply quantified the richness of characteristic plant species – typical of dune slacks or nutrient-rich marshes – over three years after resuming grazing (along with other interventions).

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (2 studies): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in freshwater marshes/wet meadows in the USA found that grazing typically had no significant effect on overall vegetation biomass after 1–2 years.

Bryophyte abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in the UK reported that grazing had no significant effect on bryophyte cover in wet grassland and flush vegetation: there were similar changes over nine years in grazed and ungrazed plots.
Individual species abundance (1 study): One replicated study of dune slacks in the Netherlands simply quantified the cover of individual species present over three years after resuming grazing (along with other interventions). Only two species had &gt;1% cover in any slack.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Height (2 studies): One site comparison study of a riparian wet meadow in Germany reported that an area grazed by cattle (after cutting trees/shrubs) contained shorter vegetation than an adjacent unmanaged area. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in wet grassland and flush vegetation in the UK found that the maximum vegetation height was typically similar, over four years, in plots grazed by cattle and plots from which cattle were excluded.

Key Messages:

Four studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of using grazing to maintain or restore disturbance in brackish/salt marshes. The studies were in the UK, Denmark, France and the USA.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community composition (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after study of brackish marshes in France reported that the overall plant community composition diverged, over five years, in plots where grazing was maintained and plots where grazing ceased. The precise effect depended on the flooding regime.
Overall richness/diversity (2 studies): One controlled study on a salt marsh in Denmark reported that an area where grazing was maintained had identical plant species richness, after six years, to an area where grazing had ceased. One replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after study of brackish marshes in France reported that the effect of continued grazing on plant species richness depended on the flooding regime.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (3 studies): Two controlled studies on salt marshes in the UK and Denmark reported that areas where grazing was maintained contained less vegetation overall, after 2–6 years, than areas where grazing ceased. This was measured in terms of biomass or cover. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in alkali marshes in the USA found that grazing had no significant effect on total vegetation biomass after 1–2 years.
Individual species abundance (3 studies): Three studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. For example, one replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after study of brackish marshes in France reported that continued grazing strongly limited colonization by common reed Phragmites australis over five years.

Key Messages:

Ten studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of using prescribed fire to maintain or restore disturbance in brackish/salt marshes. Seven studies were in the USA. Two studies were in Argentina but based on the same experimental set-up. One study was in Guadeloupe.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community composition (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in a salt marsh in Argentina reported that burned plots had a different overall plant community composition to unburned plots, five months after burning. The same was true in one of two comparisons 17 months after burning.
Overall richness/diversity (5 studies): Three studies (including one replicated, paired, controlled) in brackish marshes in the USA and Guadeloupe reported that burning had no significant effect on overall plant species richness, measured approximately 10 weeks to 2 years after the latest burn. In one of the studies, the effects of burning and legal protection were not separated. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in brackish marshes in the USA reported that burning typically had no significant effect on changes in plant species richness over two years. One replicated, paired, controlled study in a salt marsh in Argentina reported that burned plots had greater overall plant species richness and diversity than unburned plots, 5–17 months after burning.
Characteristic plant richness/diversity (1 study): One study of a coastal marsh in the USA reported that over three years after restoration – involving a prescribed burn along with restoration of tidal exchange – the number of salt-tolerant plant species increased, whilst the number of freshwater plant species decreased.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (5 studies): Three replicated studies (one also randomized, paired, controlled) in brackish marshes in the USA found that overall vegetation biomass was lower in burned than unburned plots, 10 weeks or 1 year after the latest burn. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in alkali marshes in the USA found that a single prescribed burn had no significant effect on overall vegetation biomass: there was a similar change over two years in burned and unburned plots. One replicated, paired, controlled study in a salt marsh in Argentina found that the effect of a single prescribed burn on the frequency of seedlings depended on the time since burning, but that seedlings were more frequent in burned than unburned plots after 9–12 months.
Characteristic plant abundance (1 study): One study of a coastal marsh in the USA found that over three years after restoration – involving a prescribed burn along with restoration of tidal exchange – the cover of salt-tolerant plant species increased, whilst the cover of freshwater plant species decreased.
Individual species abundance (7 studies): Seven studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. For example, five studies quantified the effects of prescribed burning on the abundance of dominant cordgrasses Spartina sp. in brackish and salt marshes in the USA and Argentina. Two replicated, paired, controlled studies found that cordgrass abundance (biomass or cover) was lower in burned than unburned plots, between 10 weeks and 17 months after the latest burn. However, one replicated, paired, site comparison study found that burning typically had no significant effect on cordgrass biomass or density after 2–8 months. One replicated, before-and-after study found that cordgrass biomass was lower, but cover greater, one year after burning than before. One study reported mixed effects on cordgrass cover across two marshes.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Height (2 studies): Two studies (one controlled, one site comparison) in brackish marshes in the USA and Guadeloupe reported that the height of dominant grass-like plants was lower in burned than unburned areas for up to 1–2 years after the latest burn. The study in the USA reported recovery, to a slightly greater height than in unburned areas, after three years. The study in Guadeloupe also reported that the tallest trees in burned marshes were shorter than the tallest trees in unburned marshes.

Algae/phytoplankton abundance (1 study): One before-and-after, site comparison study in India reported that removing all vegetation from a knotgrass-invaded marsh increased the cover of algae nine months later.
Individual species abundance (3 studies): Three studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species, other than the target problematic species. For example, one before-and-after, site comparison study in India reported that removing all vegetation from a knotgrass-invaded marsh increased the cover of some other common herb species nine months later.

3095: Physically damage problematic plants: freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Key Messages:

Five studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of physically damaging problematic plants in freshwater marshes. There were two studies in Australia and two in Costa Rica. In each country, the two studies were based in one study area but used different experimental set-ups. The final study was in Mexico.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall extent (1 study): One controlled, before-and-after study in a freshwater marsh in Costa Rica reported that crushing (and burning) cattail stands reduced the area of live vegetation present 5–22 months later.
Community composition (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a marsh in Costa Rica found that plots in which cattail-dominated vegetation was crushed had a different overall plant community composition, over the following 15 months, to plots in which vegetation was not crushed.
Overall richness/diversity (3 studies): Two controlled studies (one also replicated, randomized, paired) in one freshwater marsh in Costa Rica reported that in plots where cattail-dominated vegetation was crushed (sometimes along with burning), plant species richness and diversity were not lower than in plots where vegetation was not crushed (or burned). Vegetation was surveyed 2–22 months after intervention. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a freshwater marsh in Mexico found that disking after cutting grass-invaded vegetation increased overall plant diversity, after 4–8 months, compared to cutting alone. However, disking had no significant effect on plant richness.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (2 studies): One controlled, before-and-after study in a freshwater marsh in Costa Rica reported that crushing (and burning) cattail stands reduced live vegetation cover 5–22 months later. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a freshwater marsh in Mexico found that disking after cutting grass-invaded vegetation typically had no significant effect on overall plant density, after 4–8 months, compared to cutting alone.
Herb abundance (1 study): One study of a floodplain marsh in Australia simply reported grass/sedge cover for up to four years after crushing mimosa-invaded vegetation (along with other interventions).
Native/non-target abundance (2 studies): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in a mimosa-invaded wetland in Australia reported that crushing mimosa stands did not reduce – and often increased – cover of non-mimosa vegetation one year later. One study of a floodplain marsh in Australia simply reported non-target vegetation cover for up to four years after crushing mimosa-invaded vegetation (along with other interventions).
Individual species abundance (2 studies): Two studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species, other than the species being controlled. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a freshwater marsh in Costa Rica found that plots in which cattail-dominated vegetation was crushed supported a greater abundance of individual plant species other than cattail, over the following 15 months, than plots in which vegetation was not crushed. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a freshwater marsh in Mexico found that disking after cutting grass-invaded vegetation increased the cover of two of five common native plant species, after 4–8 months, compared to cutting alone.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community composition (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in a cattail-dominated marsh in the USA found that cutting altered the overall plant community composition over the following two years.
Relative abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a grass-invaded marsh in Mexico found that cut and uncut plots supported a similar relative abundance of six common plant species after 4–8 months.
Overall richness/diversity (4 studies): Two replicated, randomized, paired, controlled studies in invaded marshes/wet meadows in the USA found that cut plots typically had greater overall plant species richness and/or diversity than uncut plots, after 1–3 growing seasons. One of the studies carried out other interventions along with cutting. Two replicated, controlled studies in freshwater marshes in the USA and Mexico found that cut and uncut plots had similar overall plant richness and/or diversity, after 1–2 growing seasons.
Native/non-target richness/diversity (2 studies): One controlled, before-and-after study in a reed-dominated freshwater marsh in the USA found that cutting/mowing (along with applying herbicide) increased non-reed species richness three years later. One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in cattail-invaded marshes in the USA found that mown and unmown marshes had similar native plant species richness after 1–12 months

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (3 studies): Two replicated, controlled studies in freshwater marshes in the USA and Mexico found that cut and uncut plots contained a similar amount of vegetation after 1–2 growing seasons. This was true for cover of wetland plants and density of all plants. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in iris-invaded lakeshore marshes in Canada reported that cutting reduced overall vegetation cover, one year later, in a permanently flooded marsh but had no clear effect on cover in an intermittently flooded marsh.
Herb abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a cattail-invaded wet meadow in the USA found that plots in which cattail was cut four times over two growing seasons developed greater cover of sedges Carex than uncut plots, but that cutting cattail only twice had no significant effect on sedge cover.
Native/non-target abundance (3 studies): Two controlled studies (one also replicated, randomized, paired; one also before-and-after) in reed- or canarygrass-dominated wetlands in the USA found that cut plots typically contained more native or non-target vegetation than uncut plots, after 1–3 growing seasons. Both studies carried out other interventions along with cutting. One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in cattail-invaded marshes in the USA found that mown and unmown marshes supported a similar native vegetation density after 1–12 months, and similar native vegetation biomass after 12 months.
Individual species abundance (2 studies): Three studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species, other than the species being controlled. For example, one replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a grass-invaded marsh in Mexico found that five of five monitored native species had similar cover in cut and uncut plots after 4–8 months.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community composition (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in Costa Rica found that amongst plots where cattail-dominated vegetation had been crushed, grazing had no significant effect on the overall plant community composition over 15 months.
Relative abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in a canarygrass-invaded marsh in the USA found that grazing had no significant effect on the relative abundance of the invader: over two years, it declined similarly in grazed and ungrazed plots.
Overall richness/diversity (3 studies): Of three replicated, paired, controlled studies in invaded marshes/wet meadows in the USA and Costa Rica, two found that grazing typically had no significant effect on plant species richness and/or diversity over approximately two years.

Four studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of using prescribed fire to control problematic plants in brackish/salt marshes. All four studies were in the USA. Two studies were based on the same experimental set-up.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall richness/diversity (4 studies): Two replicated, randomized, paired, controlled studies in brackish and salt marshes in the USA reported that burned and unburned plots had similar plant species richness over the following 1–3 years. Two studies in saltgrass- or reed-dominated marshes in the USA reported that burned areas had greater plant species richness than unburned areas, after approximately 1–3 years. In one of the studies, burned areas had also been sprayed with herbicide for nine years – and contained more plant species than a nearby natural marsh.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (3 studies): Three replicated, randomized, paired, controlled studies in brackish and salt marshes in the USA evaluated the effect of prescribed burning on vegetation cover. One study found that autumn-burned plots had lower overall vegetation cover than unburned plots after 11 months, but one found that winter-burned plots had similar overall vegetation cover to unburned plots after one year. Two of the studies reported that winter-burned plots had less standing dead vegetation cover than unburned plots in the following summer or winter.
Individual species abundance (4 studies): All four studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species, other than a species being controlled. For example, three replicated, randomized, paired, controlled studies in brackish and salt marshes in the USA reported mixed effects of burning on cover of saltgrass Distichlis spicata: higher in burned than unburned plots in the following summer, lower in burned than unburned plots in the following winter, or mixed effects amongst marsh types. Two replicated, randomized, paired, controlled studies in brackish and salt marshes in the USA reported that burning did not reduce cover of saltmeadow cordgrass Spartina patens, compared to cover in unburned plots, over the following 1–3 years. One site comparison study of brackish marshes in the USA reported that a marsh that had been burned for three years (and sprayed with herbicide for nine) contained more smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora than an unburned and unsprayed marsh, and a similar amount of smooth cordgrass to a nearby natural marsh.

Overall richness/diversity (1 study): One site comparison study of brackish marshes in the USA reported that a marsh sprayed with herbicide for nine years (and burned for three) contained more plant species than an unburned and unsprayed marsh – but also more plant species than a nearby natural marsh.
Native/non-target richness/diversity (2 studies): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in a pepperweed-invaded marsh in the USA found that applying herbicide did not increase the richness of non-pepperweed species over two years after intervention. The precise effect depended on the herbicide used. One study of an intertidal area in the USA simply counted the number of native salt marsh plant species that colonized after treating smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora stands with herbicide.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Native/non-target abundance (5 studies): Three replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after studies in pepperweed-invaded marshes in the USA found that applying herbicide typically did not increase cover of non-pepperweed vegetation, in the two years following intervention. The precise effect depended on the herbicide used. Two studies on the coasts of South Africa and the USA simply quantified the abundance of native salt marsh vegetation that colonized after treating smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora stands with herbicide.
Individual species abundance (4 studies): Four studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species, other than the species being controlled. For example, one site comparison study of brackish marshes in the USA reported that a marsh sprayed with herbicide for nine years (and burned for three) contained more smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora than an unburned and unsprayed marsh, and a similar amount of smooth cordgrass to a nearby natural marsh.

The problematic vertebrates were birds in five studies, mammals in four studies, fish in one study, and mixed taxa in two studies. Two studies were conducted in the same area, but with different experimental set-ups.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall extent (1 study): One before-and-after study in a freshwater marsh in Canada found that after two years of excluding common carp Cyprinus carpio, the area of emergent vegetation was similar to the area expected based on the water level and historical data (when carp were present).
Community composition (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in freshwater marshes in Australia found that areas fenced to exclude wild mammals typically had a similar overall plant community composition to open areas, over 14 years.
Overall richness/diversity (4 studies): Three replicated, randomized, paired, controlled studies in freshwater marshes in the USA and Australia reported that fencing to exclude wild mammals had no clear or significant effect on total plant species richness. One replicated, paired, controlled study in freshwater marshes in the Netherlands found that fenced plots had higher emergent plant species richness than open plots, but similar diversity.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (7 studies): Seven replicated, controlled studies (three also randomized and paired) involving freshwater marshes in the USA, the Netherlands and Australia found that areas fenced to exclude wild vertebrates contained at least as much vegetation as open areas – and typically more. This was true for biomass (fenced &gt; open in six of six studies), cover (fenced &gt; open in two of two studies) and stem density (fenced similar to open in one of one studies). Vegetation was monitored over the winter immediately after fencing, or after 1–4 growing seasons.
Individual species abundance (8 studies): Eight studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. For example, seven replicated, controlled studies (four also paired, two also randomized) in freshwater marshes in the USA, the Netherlands and Australia found that dominant plant species had similar or greater abundance in areas fenced to exclude wild vertebrates, after 1–3 growing seasons, than in areas open to wild vertebrates. The dominant species included switchgrass Panicum virgatum, cordgrasses Spartina spp. and wild rice Zizania aquatica.

Overall abundance (5 studies): Five replicated, paired, controlled studies involving brackish marshes in France and the USA found that fencing to exclude medium-large vertebrates maintained or increased overall vegetation abundance. Vegetation cover or biomass were compared between fenced and open plots, after 1–2 growing seasons or over the winter after fencing.
Individual species abundance (6 studies): Six studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. The six replicated, controlled studies in brackish and salt marshes in France, Sweden and the USA reported that fencing to exclude medium-large mammals typically maintained or increased the abundance of the dominant herb species over 1–4 growing seasons. Four of the studies found that fenced and open plots contained a similar abundance (biomass, cover or density) of cordgrasses Spartina spp. Three of the studies found that bulrushes Schoenoplectus spp./Scirpus spp. were more abundant in fenced than open plots. However, one study reported no clear difference in bulrush abundance between treatments and one study reported mixed effects depending on moisture levels and which mammals were excluded.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of removing debris from brackish/salt marshes. Both studies were in the USA.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY
 
VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired, site comparison study in a salt marsh in the USA found that overall vegetation cover in patches where debris had been removed remained lower than in undisturbed marsh for one growing season, but had recovered to match undisturbed marsh after two growing seasons.
Individual species abundance (2 studies): Two studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. For example, the two replicated, site comparison studies in salt marshes in the USA found that the abundance of dominant herb species in impacted vegetation patches was typically lower than in undisturbed marsh one growing season after removing debris, but was sometimes similar to undisturbed marsh. The results depended on the species, metric and type of debris removed. One of the studies also monitored until the second growing season after removing debris; at this point, the cover of both dominant herb species had recovered to match undisturbed marsh.

Key Messages:

Five studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of building barriers to protect littoral brackish/salt marshes from rising water levels and severe weather. Three studies were in the USA, one was in Italy and one was in the Netherlands.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall extent (3 studies): Two controlled studies (one also replicated, randomized, paired) in Italy and the USA found that protecting salt marshes with offshore structures had no significant effect on the seaward limit of emergent vegetation, after 17–27 months. It was similar, or retreated at a similar rate, in protected and unprotected marshes. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the USA found that brackish marshes protected with oyster shell reefs receded less, over one year, than unprotected marshes.
Community composition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the Netherlands reported that marshes protected with low sea walls had a similar overall plant community composition to nearby natural salt marshes, 15–22 years after the walls were built.
Overall richness/diversity (2 studies): One controlled study in Italy reported that a salt marsh protected with an offshore fence contained more plant species, after 17 months, than an unfenced marsh. One replicated, site comparison study in the Netherlands recorded 85 plant and algal species across two salt marshes that had developed behind low sea walls, over 15–22 years, compared to 155 species recorded across multiple natural marshes in the region.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (2 studies): Two controlled studies (one also replicated, randomized, paired) in Italy and the USA found that brackish/salt marshes protected with offshore structures contained a similar total amount of vegetation to unprotected marshes. This was true for cover and biomass.
Individual species abundance (2 studies): One replicated, paired, site comparison study in the USA found that salt marshes protected with offshore breakwaters (and planted with cordgrasses Spartina spp.) typically contained less smooth cordgrass S. alterniflora, after 2–3 growing seasons, than nearby natural marshes. One replicated, site comparison study in the Netherlands reported that in marshes protected with low sea walls for 15–22 years and nearby natural salt marshes, the same plant species were the most frequent.

3190: Restore/create freshwater marshes or swamps (specific action unclear)
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Key Messages:

Twenty-five studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of restoring/creating freshwater marshes or swamps using unclear or incompletely described actions. Twenty-three studies were in the USA. Two were in Canada. Two of the studies used the same set of wetlands.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community types (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA reported that created wetlands had greater coverage of herbaceous vegetation after 7–8 years than natural wetlands, but lower coverage of forest and shrubby vegetation.
Community composition (17 studies): Four replicated, site comparison studies in the USA found that the overall plant community composition in created freshwater wetlands differed from the community in natural wetlands, after 1–21 years. Two replicated, site comparison studies in the USA and Canada reported mixed effects of freshwater marsh restoration/creation on overall algal or plant community composition, depending on the habitat and use of mining waste during creation. Of four replicated, site comparison studies in the USA and Canada, three reported lower quality vegetation in restored/created wetlands than in natural wetlands, but one reported similar vegetation quality in created and natural wetlands. Two replicated, site comparison studies in the USA found that created marshes developed a plant community characteristic of similar wetness to natural marshes within 4–21 years – but in one study, this was only true for created marshes &gt;10 years old. Seven replicated studies in the USA simply quantified the composition, quality or wetness of the plant community up to 22 years after wetland restoration/creation.
Overall richness/diversity (17 studies): Eleven replicated studies, in the USA and Canada, compared overall plant richness/diversity in created/restored and natural/unmanaged freshwater wetlands. Five of the studies found that created/restored wetlands typically had similar plant taxonomic richness to natural/unmanaged wetlands. Three of the studies reported lower species richness in created than natural wetlands after 1–18 years. Two of the studies reported higher species richness in created than natural wetlands after 1–21 years. The final study reported mixed effects of marsh creation on plant species richness, depending on the vegetation zone and use of mining waste during creation. Two of the studies reported identical results for plant diversity as for richness (similar or greater in created vs natural wetlands) but one study found that the effect of management on plant diversity depended on the timing of drawdown. Six replicated studies in the USA simply quantified overall plant species richness and/or diversity over 1–16 years after wetland restoration/creation.
Native richness/diversity (3 studies): Of two replicated, site comparison studies of freshwater wetlands in the USA, one found that restored/created wetlands contained more native plant species than natural wetlands after 1–11 years. The other found that restored wetlands contained fewer native plant species than natural wetlands after 2–8 years. One replicated study of swamp restoration sites in the USA simply quantified native plant richness over 1–8 years after intervention.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (7 studies): Six replicated studies, all in the USA, compared overall vegetation abundance in created/restored and natural wetlands. Four of the studies found that created/restored freshwater wetlands contained less vegetation (cover or biomass) than natural wetlands after 1–18 years. Two of the studies found that created and natural fresh/brackish/saline wetlands contained a similar amount of vegetation (overall cover and density; wetland plant cover) after &gt;1 year. One of these studies reported that restored wetlands had lower vegetation cover than natural marshes – but this reflected management goals. One replicated study in the USA simply quantified total vegetation cover and biomass 3–10 years after marsh creation.
Herb abundance (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA reported that created wetlands had greater overall cover of herb species, after 7–8 years, than natural wetlands. One replicated study in the USA simply quantified herb biomass in wetland restoration sites after 7–22 years.
Tree/shrub abundance (1 study): One replicated study in the USA simply quantified the density of woody vegetation in wetland restoration sites after 7–22 years.
Algae/phytoplankton abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that ≤15-year-old restored freshwater marshes contained a similar phytoplankton biomass to natural marshes.
Individual species abundance (9 studies): Nine studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. For example, one replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that created and natural freshwater marshes supported a similar abundance of pickerelweed Pontederia cordata after 1–11 years.

Two site comparison studies in the USA reported similarity in species composition between restored/created and natural wetlands. Similarity ranged from 35% to 79% after 1–5 years. One study in the USA simply quantified the plant community composition of different pools within a marsh, two years after its creation.
Overall richness/diversity (16 studies): Three studies (including one replicated, before-and-after, site comparison) of freshwater wetlands in the USA and Canada reported that multiple restoration actions increased overall or emergent plant species richness over 1–6 years. Another replicated, before-and-after, site comparison study in the USA reported that the effect of restoration on plant species richness varied between years. Two replicated, site comparison studies in the USA found that restored/created wetlands had similar plant species richness to natural or reference wetlands, after 1–8 years. One site comparison study in the USA reported that a created wetland contained fewer plant species than nearby natural marshes, after two years. Nine studies (four replicated, one before-and-after) in the USA and the UK simply quantified overall plant species richness and/or diversity approximately 1–10 years after intervention.
Characteristic plant richness/diversity (6 studies): One replicated, before-and-after, site comparison study of freshwater wetlands in the USA reported that multiple restoration actions increased the richness of wetland-characteristic plant species over three subsequent years.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (4 studies): Two replicated, before-and-after studies (one also a site comparison) of freshwater wetlands in the USA reported that multiple restoration actions reduced overall vegetation cover over the five subsequent years. Two replicated studies in the USA simply quantified overall vegetation cover for up to six years after intervention.
Characteristic plant abundance (3 studies): Two replicated, before-and-after studies (one also a site comparison) of freshwater wetlands in the USA reported that multiple restoration actions did not increase the cover of wetland-characteristic vegetation over three subsequent years. One of the studies also monitored in the fifth (wetter) year after restoration, and reported greater cover of wetland-characteristic vegetation than before restoration. One replicated study on the same set of wetlands in the USA simply quantified wetland-characteristic vegetation cover for up to three years after intervention.
Herb abundance (3 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that restored wet prairies had similar grass and forb cover to remnant prairies after 3–8 years. Another replicated, site comparison study in the USA reported that created dune slacks had greater cover of annual herbs after three years than mature natural slacks, but similar cover of perennial herbs and floating aquatic herbs. One replicated, before-and-after study in the USA reported greater herb cover 1–5 years after restoration of freshwater wetlands than before.
Tree/shrub abundance (3 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA reported that created dune slacks had similar cover of trees and shrubs, after three years, to mature natural slacks. One replicated, before-and-after study in the USA reported lower cover of woody vegetation 1–5 years after restoration of freshwater wetlands than before. One replicated study in the USA simply quantified woody plant cover 1–2 years after intervention.
Individual species abundance (10 studies): Ten studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. For example, the replicated, site comparison study in East Africa reported that the biomass of papyrus Cyperus papyrus in created marshes was within the range of natural marshes in the region after 18 months.

The other study reported that density of the dominant herb species in a reprofiled (and planted) marsh was within the range of nearby natural marshes, after five years. Two studies in the USA and Belgium simply quantified cover of individual plant species over five years after reprofiling (sometimes along with other interventions).

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Overall structure (1 study): One replicated, paired, site comparison study in the USA found that the layout of salt marsh habitat (e.g. patch size and complexity) differed between reprofiled coastal areas, where submerged sediment had been pushed into ridges, and nearby natural areas.
Height (1 study): One site comparison study in the USA reported that California cordgrass Spartina foliosa was shorter in a 5-year-old reprofiled marsh (also planted with cordgrass) than in nearby natural marshes.

Community composition (3 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies in the USA reported that freshwater marshes being restored by removing excess soil/sediment (along with other interventions) typically contained a different overall plant community, after 1–12 years, to both degraded and natural marshes nearby. One replicated study of dune slacks in the Netherlands simply reported changes in the overall plant community composition over four years after stripping topsoil (along with other interventions).
Overall richness/diversity (4 studies): One replicated, site comparison study of dune slacks in the Netherlands reported that overall plant species richness was greater in restored slacks (topsoil stripped five years previously, along with other interventions) than in mature unmanaged slacks. One replicated, site comparison study in the USA reported that freshwater marshes being restored by removing topsoil (along with other interventions) contained fewer wetland plant species, after 1–12 years, than nearby natural marshes. Two studies (including one site comparison) in freshwater marshes in the USA and Japan reported that the effect of removing topsoil on overall plant species richness depended on the amount removed.

Overall structure (2 studies): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, site comparison study in a salt marsh in the USA found that plots planted with herbs contained more canopy layers than unplanted plots after 2–4 growing seasons. One replicated, site comparison study around fresh/brackish lakes in Australia reported that as planted rush stands aged, their width increased – becoming more similar to mature natural stands.
Height (11 studies): Three replicated studies in salt marshes in the USA found that vegetation in areas planted with herbs was at least as tall as vegetation in unplanted areas, 2–4 growing seasons after planting. Of six site comparison studies that compared vegetation height in planted and natural marshes (sometimes along with other interventions), three studies in the USA reported that vegetation was shorter in planted marshes after 2–5 growing seasons. Two studies in the USA and Australia found that vegetation was typically a similar height in planted and natural marshes after 2–11 years. One study in the USA found that vegetation was taller in planted marshes after three growing seasons. Four replicated studies in brackish/saline marshes in the USA simply quantified the height of herbs over 1–5 growing seasons after they were planted; in three of these studies, the average height increased over time.

OTHER

Survival (17 studies): Seventeen studies (including 13 replicated and one systematic review) in the USA, Canada, New Zealand, Spain and multiple countries quantified survival rates of individual herbs planted (or sown) in brackish/saline wetlands. Survival rates ranged from 0% to 100% after 20 days to 2 years. Four studies in the USA, New Zealand and multiple countries reported 0% survival or absence of planted herb species, in at least some cases, after nine months to eight years. Proposed factors affecting survival included elevation/water levels, age of planted individuals, treatment with root dip, planting date, soil pH, damage by waterbirds, salinity and sediment organic matter content.
Growth (2 studies): Two studies monitored true growth of individual herbs (rather than changes in average height of survivors). One replicated study in a brackish marsh in the USA reported that in 8 of 10 cases, rushes/bulrushes grew in both height and circumference over the second year after planting. One replicated study in an estuary in Spain reported growth of planted small cordgrass Spartina maritima and glasswort Sarcocornia perennis over the year after planting.

Seventeen studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of directly planting trees/shrubs in freshwater wetlands. Fifteen studies were in the USA. Two were in Australia. Two of the studies took place in the same site, but used different experimental set-ups.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community composition (2 studies): Two replicated studies of freshwater wetlands in the USA found that planting trees/shrubs (sometimes along with other interventions) had no significant effect on aspects of plant community composition, after 1–11 years. Specifically, planted and unplanted wetlands had a similar proportion of species in different plant groups and relative abundance of different plant groups.
Overall richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after study in depressional wetlands in the USA found that wetlands sparsely planted with tree seedlings contained a similar number of plant species, after 1–4 years, to unplanted wetlands.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (2 studies): Two replicated studies (one site comparison; one randomized, controlled, before-and-after) of freshwater wetlands in the USA found that planting trees/shrubs (sometimes along with other interventions) had no significant effect on overall vegetation cover (both ground and canopy, separately or combined) after 1–11 years.
Herb abundance (1 study): One study in a former firing range in the USA simply quantified herb cover approximately 1–2 years after reprofiling the site and planting trees/shrubs.

Visual obstruction (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that swamps created by planting trees/shrubs (after reprofiling) had less horizontal vegetation cover, after 7–11 years, than nearby swamps recovering naturally from logging.
Height (6 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that swamps created by planting trees/shrubs (after reprofiling) contained shorter woody vegetation, after 7–11 years, than nearby swamps recovering naturally from logging. Herbaceous vegetation, however, was of similar height. Five studies (four replicated) in freshwater wetlands in the USA simply quantified the height of trees and shrubs over 1–6 growing seasons after they were planted; in four of these studies, the average height typically increased over time.
Diameter (1 study): One study in a freshwater wetland in the USA reported an increase in the diameter of surviving trees over the year after they were planted.
Basal area (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that swamps created by planting trees/shrubs (after reprofiling) had a lower vegetation basal area, after 7–11 years, than nearby swamps recovering naturally from logging.

OTHER

Survival (15 studies): Fifteen studies (including eight replicated) in the USA and Australia quantified survival of individual trees/shrubs planted in freshwater wetlands. Survival rates ranged from 0% to 100% after 4–66 months. Seven of the studies (including six replicated) in the USA and Australia reported 0% survival of planted vegetation in at least some cases, after 1–6 growing seasons. Proposed factors affecting survival included elevation/water levels, the season of planting, protection from herbivores, root pruning, extreme weather, and if/how invasive vegetation was removed before planting.
Growth (2 studies): Two studies monitored true growth of individual trees/shrubs (rather than changes in average height of survivors). The two studies, in freshwater wetlands in the USA, reported that planted trees grew in diameter and/or height over their first 1–2 growing seasons.

One replicated, before-and-after study in the USA reported that vegetation biomass developed over 15 months after sowing mixed herb seeds. Biomass included all the sown species.
Characteristic plant abundance (3 studies): Two replicated, controlled studies of recently excavated ephemeral pools in the USA found that native, pool-characteristic species were more common, over seven years, in pools where they were sown than where they were not sown. One of the studies found that this was true when a mixture of characteristic species were densely sown, but not when a single species was sparsely sown. One replicated, before-and-after study in experimental wet basins in the USA quantified the overall density of target sedge meadow species, in the vegetation that developed over 16 weeks after sowing.
Herb abundance (2 studies): Two replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after studies in a floodplain marsh in Australia found that plots sown with herb seeds had similar overall sedge/grass cover to unsown plots, after 1–3 years.
Individual species abundance (8 studies): Eight studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. For example, four replicated, before-and-after studies in Australia and the USA reported that sown herb species were absent from plots in some cases, after 1–3 years. The two studies in Australia reported low abundance (&lt;20% frequency and &lt;2% cover) of wick grass Hymenachne acutigluma 1–3 years after sowing its seeds – although in one of the studies this was greater than in unsown plots.

One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a floodplain marsh in Australia found that sowing herb seeds had no significant effect on the number of invasive mimosa Mimosa pigra seedlings germinating, for up to three years.
Survival (6 studies): Six studies in freshwater wetlands in Australia and the USA reported absence of sown (or planted) herb species, in at least some cases, after one month to seven years. It is not always clear whether this reflects death of seedlings or failure of seeds to germinate.
