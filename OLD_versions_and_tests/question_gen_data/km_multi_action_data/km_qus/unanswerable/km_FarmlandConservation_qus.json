    "question": "What is the most cost-effective method for increasing bird populations on farmland?",
    "answer": "This question cannot be answered by the provided evidence. The database describes the effectiveness of various actions in terms of their impact on wildlife, such as increasing bird numbers, but it does not contain any information on the financial costs associated with implementing these actions. Therefore, it is impossible to determine their relative cost-effectiveness.",

    "question": "Which specific management technique is best for controlling bracken whilst also promoting wildflower growth?",
    "answer": "This question cannot be answered by the database. Action 105, 'Control bracken', has an effectiveness rating of 'Evidence not assessed'. While it mentions that asulam and cutting can reduce bracken abundance, it provides no information on how these control methods affect other plants like wildflowers. A separate action is needed to assess impacts on wildflowers.",
