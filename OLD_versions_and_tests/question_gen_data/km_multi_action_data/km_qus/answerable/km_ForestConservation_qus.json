    "question": "What are the contrasting effects of thinning trees on different components of a forest ecosystem?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests there are trade-offs when thinning forests. Thinning is rated as 'likely to be beneficial' for young trees and understory plants. Six of twelve studies found thinning increased young tree density (1210) and seventeen of twenty-five studies found it increased understory plant cover (1211). However, thinning is rated as a 'trade off between benefit and harms' for mature trees, as it often decreases their density and cover while increasing their size (1209). For non-vascular plants, it is rated 'likely to be ineffective or harmful', with studies finding it decreased epiphytic plant abundance and richness (1212).",

Thinning trees can increase plant species richness but may also decrease plant biomass, while logging can reduce moss diversity (1234). Removing burned trees has been found to increase total plant species richness (1237). In contrast, sowing seeds is likely to be ineffective or harmful, as studies found it can decrease the abundance of native species and the density of tree seedlings (1236).",

    "question": "Which methods are most effective for protecting young or newly planted trees in forest restoration projects?",
    "answer": "Methods for protecting young trees show varying effectiveness. Fencing against large herbivores is often successful; wire fencing is 'likely to be beneficial' for increasing tree density (1230) and electric fencing also showed an increase in tree density in one study (1231). Mechanical thinning after planting is also rated 'beneficial', increasing the survival and size of planted trees in most studies (1261). In contrast, rodent control was found to decrease native plant species richness (1232) and using weed mats had no effect on seedling height in one study (1267).",

    "question": "How does logging or thinning trees affect different components of a forest ecosystem, from mature trees to understory plants?",
    "answer": "Logging and thinning have contrasting effects across forest strata. Logging is often harmful to mature trees, with studies finding it can decrease tree density and species richness (1271), and also harms non-vascular plants like epiphytes (1270). Conversely, logging is often beneficial for understory plants, increasing their density, cover, and species richness (1273). In a restoration context, mechanical thinning after planting has been shown to be beneficial for the survival and size of the planted trees (1261).",
