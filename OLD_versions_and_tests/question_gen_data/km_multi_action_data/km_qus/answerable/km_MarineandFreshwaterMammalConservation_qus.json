At aquaculture systems and on fishing gear, they have sometimes reduced predation by seals and sea lions and lowered mammal entanglement rates, but have been ineffective in other cases (2775, 2808). When used on vessels, they can deter dolphins but may not reduce predation on catches (2815). Similarly, devices on moorings can reduce the activity of some species like porpoises and seals, but not others like humpback whales (2816). They have also been used to successfully deter porpoises and whales from areas with loud construction noise (2896).",

At aquaculture systems, they can reduce predation by seals but may not work for dolphins (2775). On fishing gear, they can reduce entanglement of some cetaceans and reduce damage to catches by seals, but effectiveness can be species-specific or vary by area (2808). On vessels, they can deter dolphins and killer whales, but this effect may diminish with exposure (2815).
