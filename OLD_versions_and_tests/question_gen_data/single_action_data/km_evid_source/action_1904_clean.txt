Three replicated, before-and-after studies in Switzerland, Ireland and Canada, UK, Ireland, Namibia and South Africa and one replicated, controlled study in Ireland found that an unpredictable feeding schedule reduced the frequency of stereotypic pacing behaviours in tigers and cheetahs.
One replicated, before-and-after controlled study in the USA found that an unpredictable feeding schedule increased territorial behaviour in coyotes but did not affect travelling or foraging.
Two before-and-after studies in Switzerland and the USA found that an unpredictable feeding schedule increased behavioural diversity in red foxes and alertness in a black-footed cat.
