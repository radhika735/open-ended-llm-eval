601: Use artificial insemination in captive breeding
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

A review of artificial insemination argued that it could be a useful tool to conservationists, but that there were challenges to its use. Deep and repeated inseminations increased fertility.
Two trials from the USA found that artificial insemination of raptors achieved approximately 50% fertility or 0%.
A review of a houbara bustard Chlamydotis undulata macqueenii captive breeding programme in Saudi Arabia found that artificial insemination increased fertility, whilst another review found that the highest fertility levels were achieved with inseminations of at least 10 million spermatozoa every 4–5 days.
