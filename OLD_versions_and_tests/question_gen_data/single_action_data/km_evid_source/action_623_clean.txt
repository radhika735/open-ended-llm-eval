623: Release captive-bred individuals into the wild to restore or augment wild populations of waders
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:
A review of black stilt Himantopus novaezelandiae releases in New Zealand found that birds had low survival (13–20%) and many moved away from their release sites so, in consequence, that they could not be managed and were unlikely to interact with stilt populations in the wild.
