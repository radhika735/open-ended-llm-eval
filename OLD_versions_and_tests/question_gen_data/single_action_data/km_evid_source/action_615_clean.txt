615: Artificially incubate and hand-rear parrots in captivity
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

Two studies from South America describe the successful hand-rearing of parrot chicks, with ten of 12  yellow-shouldered amazons Amazona barbadensis surviving for a year after release and blue-fronted amazons Amazona aestiva fledging at higher weights than wild birds.
A review of the kakapo Strigops habroptilus management programme found that chicks could be successfully raised and released, but that eggs incubated from a young age had low success.
A study from the USA found that all hand-reared thick-billed parrots Rhynchopsitta pachyrhyncha died within a month of release: significantly lower survival than for wild-caught birds also translocated to the release site.
