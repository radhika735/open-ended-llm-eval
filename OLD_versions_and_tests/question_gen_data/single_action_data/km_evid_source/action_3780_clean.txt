Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Key Messages:

Five studies evaluated the effect on reptile populations of releasing reptiles born/hatched in captivity from wild-collected eggs/wild-caught females without rearing. Four studies were in the USA and one was in Australia.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (5 STUDIES)

Reproductive success (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in the USA found that for plains gartersnakes released as newborns, two of over 350 released snakes were found to be gravid two years after release.
Survival (5 studies): One before-and-after study in the USA found that survival of captive-born desert tortoises released as hatchlings was similar over six months compared to hatchlings that were head-started in indoor or outdoor enclosures. One replicated, controlled study in the USA found that alligator hatchlings released into their mother’s home range had higher survival than those released outside her home range. Three replicated studies (including one controlled study) in Australia and the USA found that 11% of Murray short-necked turtles and 7% of plains gartersnakes survived for 1–3 years after release, and first year survival of gopher tortoise hatchlings released into a predator proof enclosure was around 30%.
Condition (2 studies): One before-and-after study in the USA found that captive-born desert tortoises released as hatchlings grew more slowly over six months than hatchlings head-started in an indoor enclosure. One replicated, controlled study in the USA found mixed effects on growth of alligator hatchlings released inside or outside of their mother’s home range compared to wild hatchlings.
