3741: Rehabilitate and release injured or accidentally caught individuals: Tortoises, terrapins, side-necked & softshell turtles
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Key Messages:

Four studies evaluated the effects of rehabilitating and releasing injured or accidentally caught tortoises, terrapins, side-necked and softshell turtles on their populations. Two studies were in France and one was in each of South Africa and the USA.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (4 STUDIES)

Reproductive success (1 study): One controlled study in France found that some rehabilitated Hermann’s tortoises were observed mating with resident tortoises following release.
Survival (4 studies): One controlled, before-and-after study in France found that survival of rehabilitated and released Hermann’s tortoises was similar compared to wild tortoises over a two-year period. Three studies (including two replicated studies) in South Africa, France and the USA found that Babcock’s leopard tortoises, Herman’s tortoises and ornate box turtles released following rehabilitation survived for varying durations during monitoring periods that ranged from three months to 25 months or until the end of the active season during the year of release.

BEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)

Behaviour change (2 studies): One controlled study in France found that 12 rehabilitated Herman’s tortoises remained within 2 km of their release site over a three-month period. This study also found that daily movement of rehabilitated and released tortoises was similar to residents. One controlled, before-and-after study in France found that rehabilitated tortoises released in autumn took longer to establish a home range than those released in spring.
