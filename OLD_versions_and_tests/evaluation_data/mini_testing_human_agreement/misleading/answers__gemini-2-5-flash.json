    "answer": "The most effective actions for managing human-wildlife conflict with bears involve a combination of strategies, ranging from deterrents to habitat management.\n\nOne particularly beneficial approach is the implementation of electric fencing to safeguard crops from various mammals, which is a general recommendation that can be extended to bear conflict scenarios, despite it being described as 'Beneficial' for crops, it can also be used for reducing human-wildlife conflict (2439). Additionally, a useful technique involves scaring or otherwise deterring mammals from areas occupied by humans; this method aims to reduce conflict by instilling a fear response in animals, although its effectiveness is only 'Likely to be beneficial' for immediate nuisance behavior (2347). Disrupting access to potential food sources or denning sites is another key strategy, preventing animals from becoming habituated to human areas and reducing overall nuisance, rated as 'Likely to be beneficial' (2346). Finally, applying conditioned taste aversion in non-residential areas has shown promise in reducing conflict, by teaching animals to avoid certain areas or foods, and is considered 'Likely to be beneficial' (2384). It is important to note that actions like translocating problem mammals are generally less effective or potentially harmful (2336), and diversionary feeding methods remain of unknown effectiveness (2323).",
