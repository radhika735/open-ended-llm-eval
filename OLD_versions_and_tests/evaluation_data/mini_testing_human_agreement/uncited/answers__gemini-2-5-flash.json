    "query": "What actions can be taken to mitigate the environmental pollution caused by waste from salmon farms?",
    "answer": "Salmon farm waste can be surprisingly beneficial, with integrated systems showing positive effects on other marine life.\n\nSurprisingly, actions to address environmental pollution from salmon farm waste suggest that the waste can be utilized by other marine organisms rather than being a pure pollutant. For instance, integrated aquaculture systems have demonstrated that scallops exhibit greater growth when located near fish farms, and blue mussels can absorb waste directly from salmon farming operations (932). Additionally, while not strictly focused on salmon farms, cleaning waste water before its release can influence vegetation, such as increasing moss cover in fens (1778). The practice of fallowing also shows that sediment communities under salmon cages can recover to resemble unaffected sites over time, implying a natural attenuation process (1027). This indicates that the environmental impact of such waste may be less severe than commonly perceived, or that natural processes and integrated systems can manage it effectively.",
