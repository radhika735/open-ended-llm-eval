    "answer": "The most effective bear conflict reduction strategies include deterrence techniques and preventing access to food sources, while translocation shows mixed results.\n\nScaring or deterring bears using projectiles, noisemakers, guard dogs, or unpleasant substances has proven beneficial in modifying bear behavior and reducing conflicts in human-occupied areas (ref: 2347). Preventing bears from accessing anthropogenic food sources like garbage, crops, and pet food through bear-proof containers or exclusion methods is also likely beneficial for conflict reduction (ref: 2346). Conditioned taste aversion, which involves adding illness-inducing agents to problem foods at non-residential sites like orchards or campsites, shows promise in creating food aversions (ref: 2384). Enforcement measures for bear-proof garbage disposal demonstrate unknown effectiveness due to limited evidence (ref: 2345). Translocation of habituated bears is less recommended because it often leads to trade-offs - bears may return to conflict sites or re-offend after relocation (ref: 2341).",
