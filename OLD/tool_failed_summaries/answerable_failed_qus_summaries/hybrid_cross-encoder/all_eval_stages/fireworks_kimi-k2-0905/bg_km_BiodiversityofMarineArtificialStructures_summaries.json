    "relevant_summary": "Several interventions can increase invertebrate abundance on subtidal artificial structures. Creating hole habitats (>50 mm) increased the abundance of brown crabs on structures, though effects on other mobile invertebrates were mixed (action 3434). Both short (1-50 mm) and long flexible habitats (>50 mm) showed mixed effects on invertebrate abundance depending on species group, habitat density/length, and survey timing (actions 3450, 3451), with long flexible habitats supporting higher biomass when deeper. Creating textured surfaces (\u22641 mm) had mixed effects on invertebrate abundance depending on site conditions (action 3449), while creating groove habitats (1-50 mm) and pit habitats (1-50 mm) showed mixed effects on invertebrate abundances based on species group (actions 3448, 3455). Transplanting or seeding organisms onto structures altered invertebrate community composition and increased species richness (action 3471), with oysters successfully reproducing on transplanted structures. Creating artificial reefs with different 3-D structures and materials showed varying effects - breakwaters made of oyster shell bags recruited more oysters and ribbed mussels compared to ReefBall breakwaters (action 2259), though overall invertebrate abundance often showed no differences between reef types.",

Managing or restricting harvesting of species on subtidal artificial structures has been found to increase fish species richness and support different fish community compositions, with higher seabream abundances around structures with harvesting restrictions (Action ID 3457). Creating long flexible habitats (>50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures had mixed effects on fish abundance depending on species and survey conditions, but seahorses were reported to use these habitats (Action ID 3451). Creating large adjoining cavities or 'swimthrough' habitats (>100 mm) increased overall fish abundance and species richness, though individual species responses varied (Action ID 3456). Creating hole habitats (>50 mm) supported mobile invertebrate and fish species that were absent from structures without these features, and increased brown crab abundance, though overall fish abundance was not consistently increased (Action ID 3434). Transplanting or seeding organisms onto subtidal artificial structures altered combined invertebrate and fish community composition and increased species richness and diversity (Action ID 3471). Creating groove habitats (1-50 mm) supported fish species that were absent from structures without these features (Action ID 3448). Some interventions showed no direct evidence of benefits for fish populations, including creating large protrusions, small ridges or ledges, large ridges or ledges, pit habitats, small protrusions, and reducing slope, as no studies directly evaluated their effects on fish populations.",

Small linear features (1-50 mm) can support species that are absent from flat surfaces and increase species diversity and richness, though effects are variable depending on size, arrangement, shore level, and site. Large linear features (>50 mm) show more consistent benefits, increasing species diversity and abundance, particularly for macroalgae, microalgae, and some invertebrates like mussels and limpets. The effectiveness varies by taxa - while many macroalgae and invertebrates respond positively, fish responses are generally limited, with no consistent increases in fish abundance observed. Community composition is often altered when linear features are present compared with flat surfaces. The effects are context-dependent and may be influenced by the presence of other habitat features, water-retaining covers, and environmental conditions.",
