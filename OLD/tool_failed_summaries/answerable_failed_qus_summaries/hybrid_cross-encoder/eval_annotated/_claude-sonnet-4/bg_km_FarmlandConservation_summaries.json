Sowing uncropped arable field margins with agricultural nectar and pollen mixes significantly attracts more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated, grassy or cropped field margins (action 18). Leaving cultivated, uncropped margins or plots provides benefits to farmland bird species, plants, invertebrates and mammals, including increased species richness of plants and bumblebees, abundance of ground-dwelling invertebrates and ground beetles, and improved northern lapwing hatching success and Eurasian skylark nesting success (action 562). Planting grass buffer strips around arable fields shows wider margins up to 6 meters have greater species richness of butterflies, macro-moths and micro-moths than narrower margins, with floristically enhanced grass buffers supporting higher species richness and abundance of butterflies than standard grass margins (action 3982). Leaving headlands in fields unsprayed (conservation headlands) results in greater species richness and abundance of butterflies and caterpillars compared to headlands sprayed with herbicide and insecticide (action 3898). Taking field corners out of management was positively correlated with grey partridge overwinter survival (action 128). Reducing field size or maintaining small fields leads to higher species richness and abundance of butterflies and burnet moths in landscapes with smaller fields compared to areas with larger fields (action 3974).",

For supplementary food provision, nine studies from France, Sweden and the UK found that providing supplementary food increased farmland bird abundance, breeding population size, density, body mass, hatching, nestling growth and fledging rates, and increased overwinter survival of a declining house sparrow population (Action 648). However, five replicated studies from the UK found no clear effect on farmland bird breeding abundance, overwinter survival of three stable house sparrow populations, or tree sparrow nest box use (Action 648). Four studies from the UK found that use of supplementary food by farmland birds varied between species and region, depended upon the time of year and proximity to other feeding stations and natural feeding areas (Action 648). For cover interventions, fourteen studies from the UK found that fields sown with wild bird cover mix had higher abundance, density, species diversity and species richness of birds than other farmland habitats (Action 594). Thirteen studies from Finland, Switzerland and the UK found that leaving overwinter stubbles provides benefits including higher densities of farmland birds in winter, increased grey partridge productivity, and increased cirl bunting population size (Action 695). Two reviews and two replicated controlled trials from the UK found that leaving uncut strips of rye grass on silage fields resulted in benefits to birds including increased numbers, with seed-eating birds preferring rye grass cut once only (Action 132).

    "relevant_summary": "Several specific actions can be taken on farmland to support invertebrate populations like bees and beetles:\n\n**Beetle Banks**: Create beetle banks, which are raised strips of uncropped land planted with grasses. Studies found that beetle banks provide positive effects on invertebrate densities/numbers and higher ground beetle density and species diversity in spring and summer (Action 651).\n\n**Field Margins with Grasses**: Provide grass strips at field margins, with one trial showing that 6-meter wide grassy field margins enhanced the abundance but not diversity of wild bees at field boundaries, and another trial showing enhanced abundance and diversity of bumblebees within the margin (Action 14).\n\n**Wildflower Margins**: Sow uncropped arable field margins with native wild flower seed mix. Five replicated trials showed that uncropped field margins sown with wild flowers support higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees than cropped field edges, grassy margins, or naturally regenerated uncropped margins. Perennial leguminous herbs in seed mixtures are particularly important forage sources for bumblebees (Action 19).\n\n**Nectar Flower Strips**: Plant nectar flower mixture/wildflower strips. Studies found that sown wildflower strips had higher species richness and diversity of butterflies and moths than conventional field margins, unsown margins, cropped fields or conventional grassland. Multiple studies also found higher abundance of butterflies in sown wildflower strips compared to conventional margins (Action 3932).\n\n**Hedgerow Planting**: Plant hedgerows, which studies found support more bee species in fields with hedgerows or in hedgerows themselves compared to fields or field edges without hedgerows. Native bees showed higher crop visitation rates in fields next to planted hedgerows (Action 1407).\n\n**Set-aside Areas**: Provide or retain set-aside areas in farmland. Of 34 studies comparing set-aside areas with control farmed fields, 20 studies showed benefits to or higher use by all wildlife groups considered, and 12 found some species or groups used set-aside more than crops (Action 156).\n\n**Buffer Strips**: Plant grass buffer strips/margins around arable or pasture fields. Studies found that wider grass margins had greater species richness or diversity of butterflies, macro-moths and micro-moths than narrower margins, and that floristically enhanced grass buffers or wildflower strips had higher abundance of butterflies than standard grass margins (Action 3982).",

Studies found that beetle banks provide positive effects on invertebrate densities/numbers and higher ground beetle density and species diversity in spring and summer (Action 651).\\n\\n**Field Margins with Grasses**: Provide grass strips at field margins, with one trial showing that 6-meter wide grassy field margins enhanced the abundance but not diversity of wild bees at field boundaries, and another trial showing enhanced abundance and diversity of bumblebees within the margin (Action 14).\\n\\n**Wildflower Margins**: Sow uncropped arable field margins with native wild flower seed mix. Five replicated trials showed that uncropped field margins sown with wild flowers support higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees than cropped field edges, grassy margins, or naturally regenerated uncropped margins. Perennial leguminous herbs in seed mixtures are particularly important forage sources for bumblebees (Action 19).\\n\\n**Nectar Flower Strips**: Plant nectar flower mixture/wildflower strips. Studies found that sown wildflower strips had higher species richness and diversity of butterflies and moths than conventional field margins, unsown margins, cropped fields or conventional grassland. Multiple studies also found higher abundance of butterflies in sown wildflower strips compared to conventional margins (Action 3932).\\n\\n**Hedgerow Planting**: Plant hedgerows, which studies found support more bee species in fields with hedgerows or in hedgerows themselves compared to fields or field edges without hedgerows. Native bees showed higher crop visitation rates in fields next to planted hedgerows (Action 1407).\\n\\n**Set-aside Areas**: Provide or retain set-aside areas in farmland. Of 34 studies comparing set-aside areas with control farmed fields, 20 studies showed benefits to or higher use by all wildlife groups considered, and 12 found some species or groups used set-aside more than crops (Action 156).\\n\\n**Buffer Strips**: Plant grass buffer strips/margins around arable or pasture fields. Studies found that wider grass margins had greater species richness or diversity of butterflies, macro-moths and micro-moths than narrower margins, and that floristically enhanced grass buffers or wildflower strips had higher abundance of butterflies than standard grass margins (Action 3982).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"651\",\n    \"14\",\n    \"19\",\n    \"3932\",\n    \"1407\",\n    \"156\",\n    \"3982\"\n  ]\n}"

Managing ditches to benefit wildlife results in increased invertebrant biomass or abundance, plant species richness, emergent plant cover, amphibian diversity and abundance, bird visit rates and higher numbers of some bird species in plots with ditches managed under agri-environment schemes (action 135). Creating ponds for amphibians shows that amphibians used some or all created ponds, with created ponds having similar or higher numbers of species or breeding species compared to natural ponds, and amphibians establishing stable populations in 50-100% of created ponds (action 869). Created wetlands show similar numbers of amphibian species, amphibian abundance or communities to natural wetlands, with four to 15 amphibian species using or colonizing created wetlands (action 880). Creating artificial water sources shows that bat activity is similar or higher over farm ponds, retention ponds, and drainage ditches compared to natural wetlands and surrounding areas (action 959). Providing buffer strips to reduce pesticide and nutrient run-off into waterways and ponds shows greater abundance of moths than conventionally managed margins (action 3894). However, there are documented drawbacks: raising water levels results in a net loss of plant species and does not affect lapwing foraging rate, and re-wetting soils on old arable fields is not an effective method of reducing nutrient levels and restoring species-rich grassland (action 121). Ditch management can have negative or no clear effects on some farmland bird species or plants (action 135). Additionally, unflooded pastures contained a high biomass of soil macroinvertebrates of importance to breeding wading birds, suggesting that flooding may reduce this important food source (action 121).",

Planting new or maintaining existing hedgerows on farmland has also demonstrated positive effects, with a UK study finding that establishing hedgerows alongside arable land increased small mammal abundance (action 2383).\n\nPlanting crops to provide supplementary food for mammals has shown effectiveness, with studies in the UK and Spain finding that crops grown to provide food for wildlife resulted in higher abundance of small mammals in winter, and increased European rabbit abundance (action 2394). \n\nReducing the intensity of grazing by domestic livestock shows promise, with six of nine studies in the USA, Denmark, the UK, China, Netherlands and Norway finding that reductions in livestock grazing intensity were associated with increases in abundances of small mammals (action 2408).\n\nReducing pesticide or fertilizer use through organic farming showed mixed results, with one UK study finding increased wood mouse abundance while an Italian study found no increase in European hare abundance (action 2539).

Positive effects included increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms, greater abundance of some invertebrates other than earthworms, increased numbers of some weeds and/or weed species, higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying date and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields, and greater abundance of some birds - including Eurasian skylark, seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in late winter on non-inversion or conservation tillage.

    "relevant_summary": "Several specific actions are available to protect ground-nesting birds like lapwings and skylarks on farmland. Creating skylark plots increases skylark population size, breeding density, duration or success and lowers the likelihood of skylarks abandoning their territory, with plots being used by skylarks more than expected based on availability (actions 540, 214). Leaving cultivated, uncropped margins or plots, including specific 'lapwing plots', benefits northern lapwing hatching success, Eurasian skylark nesting success, and provides breeding sites for northern lapwing, Eurasian skylark, grey partridge and yellow wagtail (action 562). Direct per-clutch payments for farmland birds result in higher hatching success of northern lapwing and black-tailed godwit on participating farms (actions 146, 196). Sowing crops in spring rather than autumn benefits farmland birds, with northern lapwings nesting on spring-sown crops more than expected based on availability, and skylarks using winter and spring sown crops for different broods (actions 137, 207). Reduced tillage increases Eurasian skylark nest density, enables earlier laying dates, and provides shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields (action 126). Leaving overwinter stubbles increases grey partridge productivity and benefits Eurasian skylark and Eurasian linnet among farmland bird species (action 695). Planting wild bird seed or cover mixture increases abundance, density, species diversity and species richness of birds on farmland, with grey partridge populations increasing substantially on farms implementing these measures (action 594). Maintaining species-rich, semi-natural grassland supports birds of conservation concern, with five species increasing after implementation of appropriate management (action 218).",

    "relevant_summary": "Evidence for the effectiveness of linear features like hedges and beetle banks for farmland wildlife is mixed but generally positive. For beetle banks, 14 reports from eight studies found that beetle banks provide some benefits to farmland biodiversity (651). Five reports from two replicated studies found positive effects on invertebrate densities/numbers, distribution, or higher ground beetle density and species diversity in spring and summer but not winter (651). Two reviews and one replicated controlled trial found positive effects on bird numbers in combination with other farmland conservation measures or evidence that birds used beetle banks (651). One controlled study and a review found beetle banks acted as nest sites for harvest mice (651), with one replicated study specifically finding higher densities of harvest mouse nests on beetle banks than field margins (2393). However, five replicated studies found lower or no difference in invertebrate densities or numbers on beetle banks relative to other habitats (651), and one replicated study found no farmland bird species were associated with beetle banks (651).\n\nFor hedges, newly planted hedges showed higher abundance, species richness or diversity of beetles or spiders than crop fields or field margins in studies from France and the UK (538). A replicated study also found vascular plant species diversity and grass species richness were higher in newly planted hedges than recently established grass field margins (538). Five of six studies found that the abundance of butterflies, moths, macro-moths and gatekeepers was higher along hedgerows than on beetle banks, grass margins without hedgerows, in field interiors, or 5-10 metres away from hedgerows (3976). Three of four site comparison studies found that established hedgerows had a higher species richness of butterflies and macro-moths than in-field beetle banks, crops or pasture (3976). For mammals, establishing hedgerows alongside arable land increased small mammal abundance (2383), and retaining and enhancing hedgerows along with other field boundary features was associated with higher brown hare density in arable sites but not in grassland sites (2383). For reptiles, reptile communities in cultivated areas with hedges were more similar to those found in forests than were communities from cultivated areas without hedges (3519). However, no evidence was found for the effects of managing stone-faced hedge banks (73, 179).",
