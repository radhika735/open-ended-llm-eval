    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available research evidence, removing topsoil entirely before seeding shows superior outcomes compared to simply disturbing the soil in most cases. A replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the UK found that removing turf before sowing seeds increased both grass species richness and forb species richness in most cases compared to disturbing the soil before sowing (Action 3415). \n\nRegarding the outcomes of each method individually:\n\nRemoving topsoil entirely demonstrates multiple positive effects. Studies found that removing topsoil before sowing seeds increased plant community similarity to that of intact steppe, increased plant species richness, and increased the species richness of sown plants (Action 3415). Additionally, removing topsoil before planting seedlings led to higher cover of planted species and increased the survival of seedlings and plants in studies conducted in the USA (Action 3415).\n\nSimply disturbing soil before seeding also shows positive but more variable outcomes. Studies found that disturbing soil before sowing seeds increased plant and seedling species richness in some cases, with one study showing increased richness while another found no change (Action 3413). A study in the UK found that rotovating soil before sowing seeds increased both grass species richness and forb species richness in most cases compared to harrowing before sowing (Action 3413). Four of five studies found that disturbing soil before sowing seeds increased plant emergence in most cases compared to sowing alone (Action 3413).\n\nThe direct comparison studies indicate that topsoil removal is generally more effective than soil disturbance alone for achieving desired grassland restoration outcomes, particularly for species richness of both grasses and forbs.",
