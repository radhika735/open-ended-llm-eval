    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available research, several timber harvesting methods show effectiveness for increasing understory plant diversity. Thinning trees within forests shows strong positive effects, with 17 of 25 studies finding that thinning increased the density and cover of understory plants, and 13 of 19 studies finding that thinning increased species richness and diversity of understory plants (action 1211). Shelterwood harvesting also demonstrates effectiveness, with 6 of 7 studies finding that it increased abundance, species richness and diversity of understory plants (action 1223). Additionally, shelterwood harvest resulted in higher plant diversity compared with clearcutting (action 1214). Group-selection harvesting shows mixed but generally positive results, with 4 of 8 studies finding that it increased cover and diversity of understory plants, though 2 studies found it decreased understory species richness (action 1224). Clearcutting can increase understory diversity in some cases, with 8 of 12 studies finding that it increased the cover and species richness of understory plants, though results are mixed (action 1222). Specialized thinning methods like girdling also show promise, with one study finding that thinning trees by girdling increased understory plant species richness, diversity and cover (action 1226). The removal of woody debris after timber harvest shows less consistent effects, with only 1 of 6 studies finding increased understory vegetation cover (action 1213).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, prescribed fire as a forest management tool in North America shows several benefits and negative impacts:\n\nBenefits of prescribed fire include: Fire risk control when combined with mechanical shrub control (Action 37). Prescribed fire increased herbaceous plant cover in subsequent years (Action 37). Some studies found prescribed fire increased amphibian abundance or numbers of species (Action 877), though eight of 14 studies found no effect. Prescribed fire increased butterfly species richness in coniferous forest restored 1-2 years after burning and in pine forest burned once within the last 20 years compared to unburned forest (Action 3877). Bird species richness was higher in sites with prescribed burning and tree thinning compared to control sites, with open habitat species being more abundant in burned areas of pine forest (Action 318). Red-cockaded woodpecker populations increased following intensive management including prescribed burning (Action 318). Prescribed fire increased young tree density and biomass in some studies (Action 1220). Large herbivore use of areas increased after prescribed burning, with bighorn sheep, mule deer, elk, and bison showing increased use of burned areas (Action 2388).\n\nNegative impacts include: Prescribed fire decreased tree cover, density and diversity in four of eight studies and increased tree mortality in seven studies from the USA (Action 1217). Some studies found fire decreased new tree density (Action 1220). Ten studies found total bird densities or densities of some species were the same or lower in sites with prescribed burning, with closed-forest species and ground nesters appearing adversely affected (Action 318). One study found northern bobwhite chicks had lower foraging success in burned areas (Action 318). Five of 10 replicated studies found prescribed burning did not increase small mammal abundances (Action 2388). One study found abundance of amphibians decreased with fires (Action 877). A study found fewer Eltham copper caterpillars after selective burning (Action 3877).",

Three replicated, controlled studies in Sweden and the USA found that shelterwood harvesting resulted in higher plant diversity, lower grass cover and higher density of tree species compared with clearcutting (Action 1214). Additionally, six of seven studies in Australia, Iran, Nepal and the USA found that shelterwood harvesting increased abundance, species richness and diversity of understory plants, as well as the growth and survival rate of young trees, though one study found it decreased plant species richness and abundance, and one found no effect on tree abundance (Action 1223). For moth species recovery, one study found that moth species richness recovered faster after shelterwood harvesting than after group selection harvesting or clearcutting (Action 3871). However, regarding tree density specifically, three studies in Canada found that partial retention harvesting instead of clearcutting decreased the density of young trees (Action 1215). The evidence also indicates that partial harvest methods generally result in smaller reductions in certain animal populations compared to clearcutting, as shown by a meta-analysis of 24 studies in North America which found that partial harvest (including shelterwood harvesting) resulted in smaller reductions in salamander populations than clearcutting (Action 844).",
