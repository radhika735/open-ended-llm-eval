    "relevant_summary": "Several methods are available to control disease and sea lice in Atlantic salmon farms. Fallowing systems have shown mixed results, with one Scottish study recording lower lice numbers on salmon (Action 1026). Natural control agents such as cleaner wrasse can be effective - one controlled study found corkwing and goldskinny cleaner wrasse were as effective as chemical treatments at controlling lice infestation, though rockcook cleaner wrasse were ineffective (Action 738). Probiotics and immunostimulants have demonstrated benefits, with one Scottish study showing increased salmon survival when fed probiotics before bacterial exposure, and a Norwegian study finding 28% reduction in lice infection when salmon were fed diets with beta-glucans (Action 732). Vaccinations have proven effective against multiple diseases including Aeromonas salmonicida, Yersinia ruckeri, marine flexibacteriosis, bacterial kidney disease, and infectious salmon anaemia, with higher survival rates in vaccinated salmon across studies from Iceland, Norway, Australia, and Canada (Action 733). Selective breeding for resistance traits has also been successful, with a Norwegian study showing increased survival in salmon bred for high resistance to infectious pancreatic necrosis (Action 735). Additionally, lighting modification can help control sea lice, with a Norwegian study reporting lower lice numbers on salmon kept in low intensity artificial light or natural lighting (Action 741).",
