    "relevant_summary": "Reduced tillage systems on European farms show mixed evidence for their effects on biodiversity and farm productivity. Benefits include: increased earthworm biomass, species richness and abundance in 21 studies from nine European countries (action 126); higher soil organic carbon levels compared to conventionally tilled soils in 12 studies including from Europe (action 906); maintained or increased soil organic matter in eight studies from Europe (action 906); reduced soil loss and runoff in seven trials from Europe (action 906); and some positive effects on farmland birds including higher Eurasian skylark nest density and greater abundance of seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in late winter (action 126). For crop yields, nine replicated controlled studies from France, Spain, Turkey and Egypt found higher cereal yields with reduced tillage in some comparisons, though three studies also found lower yields in some cases (action 1359). \n\nHarms and challenges include: higher soil compaction under reduced tillage found in three replicated European trials (action 906); negative or no consistent effects on some invertebrates, earthworms, and weed species in 26 studies from nine European countries (action 126); potential for increased soil loss when no crop cover is present (action 906); and mixed effects on crop yields with lower yields possible, as documented in a Canadian study (action 906). Some studies found that crop type affected weed numbers under different tillage regimes (action 126), and three studies could not distinguish between effects of reduced tillage versus reduced pesticide and fertilizer inputs (action 126).",

Thirty-four studies (of which 21 were replicated and controlled and seven also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found some positive effects on earthworms, some invertebrates (other than earthworms), weeds or farmland birds, of reducing tillage compared to conventional management. Positive effects included increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms, greater abundance of some invertebrates other than earthworms, increased numbers of some weeds and/or weed species, higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying date and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields, and greater abundance of some birds - including Eurasian skylark, seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in late winter on non-inversion or conservation tillage. A review found tillage had negative effects on invertebrate numbers and no-till systems had more invertebrate bird food resources.\\nTwenty-six studies (of which 13 replicated and controlled and three also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found reducing tillage had either negative, no effect or no consistent effects on abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates (other than earthworms), earthworm abundance, biomass, or species richness, number of different plant species found as seeds, number of some weed species, mammal abundance, some bird species, and one study found bird preferences for conservation tillage fields decreased over time. Two studies found that crop type affected the number of weeds under different tillage regimes.\\nOne small replicated trial in the UK compared bird numbers under two different forms of reduced tillage, and found more birds from species that make up the \\u2018Farmland Bird Index\\u2019 on broadcast than non-inversion tillage fields.\\nTwo studies looked at the long-term effects of reduced tillage on earthworms (after ten years).

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done.

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, cover crops grown between crop rows in orchards and vineyards showed mixed effects on crop yields. Two studies from France found lower grape yields with grass cover between vine rows compared to bare soil, while six studies found similar yields between treatments. For crop quality, five studies found similar sugar content in grapes with or without ground cover, though some found differences in titratable acidity. \n\nIn contrast, studies of cover crops in arable fields (when fields would otherwise be empty/fallow) showed that six studies found lower cash crop yields following winter cover crops, three found higher yields, and eight found inconsistent results. For soil health, twelve studies found more organic matter in soils with winter cover crops, and twenty-one studies showed varying nitrogen effects. Water-related studies found that cover crops can both use more water and reduce water loss, depending on conditions.\n\nBetween-row cover crops in orchards showed more consistent results for biodiversity: one study found more birds and higher bird diversity in vineyards with resident vegetation between rows compared to bare soil. However, in arable field conditions, studies showed more variable outcomes in terms of pest regulation, with some finding fewer weeds but others finding inconsistent effects on pest numbers. The key difference appears to be that between-row cover crops in perennial systems tend to have more predictable biodiversity benefits, while cover crops in annual systems show more variable effects on subsequent crop yields and soil properties.",
