In coppiced woodland, communities of butterflies and moths differed with coppice age, coppiced sites contained more unique macro\u2011moth species than mature forest but had lower macro\u2011moth richness and abundance, while butterfly species richness and abundance were higher in coppiced than unmanaged woodland, with several studies reporting higher butterfly abundance 2\u201315 years after coppicing; persistence of some fritillary populations was greater in coppiced/young woodland, and increases were also reported following coppicing alongside other measures [3939]. With thinning, several studies (often with additional treatments such as prescribed burning, mulching, or nearby felling) found increased butterfly richness and abundance 1\u20134 years after management; partially cleared plots had higher butterfly but lower moth species richness than closed\u2011canopy forest, while in one tropical site fruit\u2011feeding butterflies had similar richness and abundance to unmanaged forest but rarer species were less frequently caught in thinned forest [3940].",

A review across the UK and Ireland reported that 25% of translocated/released populations survived \u22653 years, 38% died out within 3 years, and only 8% were known to survive >10 years; large copper reintroductions survived up to 38 years but ultimately died out or required supplementation [3909]. For captive-bred releases, several populations persisted 2\u201328 years and increased, but others died out within 1\u201312 years or needed further releases; in one replicated case, 3 of 10 barberry carpet moth releases established and at least one persisted 5 years; the same UK/Ireland review found 25% survived >3 years and 8% >10 years [3914]. Survival of released captive-bred large copper caterpillars was lower than that of captive, wild, or translocated caterpillars in site-comparison studies [3914]. Translocations outside of known range showed variable longevity: some populations (small skipper, marbled white, Gillette\u2019s checkerspot) persisted and increased over 8\u201328 years, while another Gillette\u2019s checkerspot introduction died out within one year [3911].",
