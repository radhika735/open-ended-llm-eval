One before-and-after study of a freshwater marsh and wet meadow in China\\u00a0found that vegetation was taller five years after planting herbs than in the year before planting. One site comparison study of wet meadows in the USA\\u00a0reported that sedge tussocks in a restored meadow were shorter than sedge tussocks in natural meadows, 11\\u201314 years after planting (along with other interventions). One replicated study in wet basins in the USA\\u00a0simply reported an increase in the average height of a herb species over three growing seasons after it was planted.\\nDiameter/perimeter/area (1 study): One site comparison study of wet meadows in the USA\\u00a0reported that sedge tussocks in a restored meadow had a smaller perimeter than sedge tussocks in natural meadows, 11\\u201314 years after planting (along with other interventions).\\nBasal area (1 study): One site comparison study of wet meadows in the USA\\u00a0reported that the basal area of sedge tussocks was lower in a restored meadow than in natural meadows, 11\\u201314 years after planting (along with other interventions).\\nIndividual plant size (2 studies): Two replicated studies in wet meadow restoration sites in the USA\\u00a0reported that the size of Carex stricta seedlings increased over two months or three growing seasons after planting. This was true for the average number of shoots/plant\\u00a0and biomass/plant.\\n\\nOTHER\\n\\nSurvival (14 studies): Nine studies (eight replicated) in the USA\\u00a0and Israel\\u00a0quantified survival rates of individual herbs planted in freshwater wetlands. Survival rates ranged from 0% to 100% after 1\\u20133 growing seasons. Eight studies (including five replicated and two before-and-after) in Guam, the USA, the Netherlands\\u00a0and Israel\\u00a0reported 0% survival or absence of planted (or sown) herb species, in at least some cases, after three months to seven years. Proposed factors affecting survival included elevation/water levels, herbivory, time of planting\\u00a0and plug type.\\nGrowth (2 studies): Two studies monitored true growth of individual herbs (rather than changes in average height of survivors). The\\u00a0two studies (one replicated) in Ireland\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0reported that herbs grew over 1\\u20132 growing seasons after planting.\"\n}"
