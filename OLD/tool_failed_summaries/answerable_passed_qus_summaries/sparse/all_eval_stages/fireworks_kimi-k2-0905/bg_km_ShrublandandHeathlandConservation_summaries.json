However, results were mixed regarding heather cover, with two studies finding no increase in heather cover despite bracken reduction.\n\nCutting alone also proved effective at reducing bracken cover and biomass in several studies (action 1653), with some evidence of increased heather cover and biomass, though results were inconsistent across studies. One study found cutting increased species richness of heathland plants.\n\nThe combination of cutting followed by herbicide application (action 1654) showed consistent effectiveness in reducing bracken biomass and cover across three studies. This combined approach appeared to have more reliable positive effects on heather, with one study finding increased heather cover and another showing increased plant species richness compared to herbicide followed by cutting.\n\nA systematic review (action 105) found that the herbicide asulam reduced bracken abundance when applied repeatedly, but suggested that cutting may be equally effective.",
