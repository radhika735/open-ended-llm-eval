For reducing pesticide, herbicide or fertiliser use, four studies from Mexico, Portugal, Germany and Colombia were found (Action 2013). These studies found that farms using few or no chemicals had different compositions of bat species, higher diversity of insect-eating bat species, more bat species recorded over grassland, higher overall bat activity, and improved body condition in great fruit-eating bats compared to areas with high chemical inputs. For organic farming instead of conventional farming, twelve studies were found from Europe, USA, Canada and Chile (Action 961). Results were mixed, with five of seven studies finding no difference in bat species richness between organic and non-organic farms, while two studies found more species on organic farms. For bat abundance, five of nine studies found no difference, while four studies found higher bat activity, feeding activity, and activity of specific species on organic farms. However, for several related actions there is no evidence available: no studies were found evaluating the effects of preventing pollution from agricultural land or forestry from entering watercourses (Action 2015), planting riparian buffer strips (Action 2016), or educating pest controllers about illegal pesticide use in bat roosts (Action 2043).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from multiple studies, several key design and placement factors influence the successful use of bat boxes by bats. Regarding design factors, bat box color significantly affects usage, with bats using black bat boxes more than grey, white or wooden boxes (action 1024). Box size matters, as one of two studies found higher occupancy rates in larger bat boxes (action 1024). Material choice influences occupancy timing, with resin bat boxes becoming occupied more quickly than wood boxes, though both materials are used by bats (action 1024). Concrete bat boxes showed higher occupancy rates than wooden ones (action 1024). Design complexity also affects usage, with bat boxes having two compartments being occupied by more bats than single compartment boxes during breeding season, and standard and four/five chamber bat boxes being occupied by breeding colonies while flat bat boxes were used by individuals (action 1024). For placement factors, orientation and sunlight exposure affect bat occupancy according to three studies, though one study found orientation had no significant effect (action 1024). Height influences occupancy according to two studies, while two other studies found no effect of height (action 1024). Location type is important, with higher occupancy rates found for bat boxes placed on buildings compared to trees (action 1024). Habitat context affects success, with higher occupancy in farm forestry sites than native forest, higher occupancy in pine relative to mixed deciduous stands, and higher occupancy in forest fragments than in pasture (action 1024). Prior bat presence increases success rates, with higher occupancy in areas where bats were known to roost before box installation (action 1024). Installation strategy matters, as bat boxes are more likely to be occupied when a greater number are installed across a site (action 1024). Occupancy rates vary considerably, with 22 studies finding bats occupying less than half of provided bat boxes (0-49%) while nine studies found bats occupying more than half (54-100%) (action 1024).",

These studies found that bat activity (relative abundance) was similar or higher over reservoirs and waste water treatment pools, heliponds and drainage ditches, retention ponds and farm/cattle ponds compared to over natural wetlands, nearby vineyards, surrounding forest or grassland/crops, trees and orchards (Action 959). One study in South Africa found a similar number of bat species over farm ponds and in grassland/crops, trees, vineyards or orchards (Action 959). Additionally, managing livestock water troughs as drinking resources shows promise, with two studies in the USA demonstrating that removing livestock modifications from water troughs resulted in bats drinking from them more frequently, and that larger, full water tanks surrounded by sparse vegetation had more bats drinking from them than smaller, half full tanks surrounded by no or dense vegetation (Action 1951). Small dams can also provide effective habitat, with one study in Portugal finding that reservoirs created using small dams had greater activity of four bat species than the streams feeding into them (Action 1997). Wetland restoration showed positive results in one USA study, where restoring wetlands increased overall bat activity and restored wetlands had similar bat activity to undisturbed wetlands (Action 2036). However, no studies were found that specifically evaluated managing natural water bodies in arid areas to prevent desiccation for bat populations (Action 2027).",

Organic farming shows mixed but generally positive results compared to conventional farming, with four of nine studies finding higher overall bat activity, bat feeding activity, Brazilian free-tailed bat activity, and activity of four of seven bat species on organic farms (Action 961). Additionally, two studies found higher activity of Myotis species over water and rivers on organic farms, and one study found higher activity for two of three bat species over organic fields compared to conventionally managed fields (Action 961). \n\nAgroforestry systems, particularly those with varied shade cover, demonstrate clear benefits for bats. Coffee plantations with varied shade cover had more bats captured and higher activity of forest bat species compared to plantations with single shade species (Action 963). Shaded coffee, cacao and banana plantations had more bat species and higher bat diversity than plantations with single shade species or no shade (Action 963). Silvopastoral systems using agroforestry combined with no chemicals resulted in great fruit-eating bats with higher body weights and body condition scores compared to conventional farming areas (Action 963).\n\nReducing chemical inputs benefits bat populations, with farms using few or no chemicals showing different bat species compositions, higher diversity of insect-eating bat species in coffee agroforestry plantations, and higher overall bat activity compared to farms with high chemical inputs (Action 2013). Agricultural landscapes with smaller fields had higher activity of six of seven bat species compared to landscapes with larger fields (Action 1939). \n\nHedge management also shows benefits, with hedges trimmed three or more years prior having more bat species and higher activity of two of eight bat species compared to recently trimmed hedges (Action 1943). However, tree plantations on agricultural land showed mixed results, with bat activity generally lower in plantations compared to original forest and woodland remnants (Action 958).",
