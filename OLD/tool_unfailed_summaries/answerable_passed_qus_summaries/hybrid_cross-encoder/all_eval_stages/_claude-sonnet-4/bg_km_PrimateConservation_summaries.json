Specific mining-related conservation actions for primates have no evidence supporting their effectiveness. These include using 'set-aside' areas of natural habitat for primate protection within mining areas (Action 1453), minimizing ground vibrations caused by open cast mining activities (Action 1451), implementing a minimum number of roads needed to reach mining extraction sites (Action 1462), certifying mines and marketing their products as 'primate friendly' (Action 1454), and establishing no-mining zones in/near watersheds to preserve water levels and water quality (Action 1452). For each of these actions, no studies have been found that directly and quantitatively tested these interventions during systematic journal and report searches, making it impossible to assess whether they are effective or have harmful impacts. The only evidence found for post-extraction habitat restoration (Action 3862) relates to butterflies and moths after mining and quarrying, with studies from the Czech Republic, UK and New Zealand showing mixed results for restored versus naturally recovering sites, but contains no evidence specific to primates. One study on reducing surface feature size during extraction (Action 3845) found that narrow corridors used for oil prospecting had lower butterfly species richness and abundance than wide corridors but were similar to undisturbed forest, though again this provides no evidence for primate populations.",

The most promising evidence comes from Action 1581, which found that black howler monkey numbers increased by 138% over 13 years after the protection of forest along property boundaries and across cleared areas in Belize. Action 1580 similarly found that black howler monkey numbers increased by 138% over 13 years after the protection of a forest corridor alongside other interventions. Action 1457 provides evidence that pole bridges can be effective connectivity structures, with studies showing that black lion tamarins and capuchins used a pole bridge to cross a road in Brazil, black howler monkey populations increased after construction of pole bridges over man-made gaps in Belize, and all six monitored lemur species used bridges to cross roads and pipelines in Madagascar. However, many potentially relevant actions lack evidence: no studies were found evaluating the effects of maintaining/restoring habitat connectivity on farmland (Action 2381), creating natural habitat islands within agricultural land (Action 1425), using fences as biological corridors (Action 1426), installing green bridges (Action 1456), incorporating forested corridors into logged areas (Action 1495), or restoring habitat corridors (Action 1583) specifically on primate populations.",

Continuous supplementary feeding shows mixed results: two studies in China and The Gambia found population increases after regular provision of supplementary food, while two studies in Thailand and Malaysia found population declines (Action 1526). Three studies in Brazil, South Africa, and Indonesia found that the majority of primates survived with continuous feeding, and one study in Liberia found that the majority of introduced chimpanzees survived for at least one year (Action 1526). However, one controlled study in Madagascar found that continuously fed black-and-white ruffed lemurs showed different diets compared to wild groups (Action 1526). \n\nFeeding during resource scarce periods only appears to show more positive outcomes: studies found that the majority of chimpanzees in the Republic of Congo survived for at least five years, wild olive baboons in Kenya survived for at least 17 years after drought period feeding, and black-and-white ruffed lemurs in Madagascar maintained diets similar to wild individuals (Action 1527).\n\nLimited-time feeding strategies show variable results: one study in Tanzania found population increases after two months of supplementary feeding following reintroduction, while one study in Brazil found population decline after one year of feeding (Action 1528). Four studies found that only a minority of reintroduced primates survived after limited supplementary feeding, though three studies in Gabon, South Africa and Vietnam found that a majority of primates survived reintroduction with supplementary feeding (Action 1528).
