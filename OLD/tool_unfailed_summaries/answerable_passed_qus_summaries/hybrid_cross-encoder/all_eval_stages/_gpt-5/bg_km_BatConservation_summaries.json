Managing livestock water troughs affected bat use and drinking success: removing livestock modifications increased drinking frequency and reduced the number of approaches before successful drinking; larger, full tanks with sparse surrounding vegetation had more bats drinking than smaller, half-full tanks with no or dense vegetation (1951). Creating or maintaining small dams: a replicated site comparison in Portugal found reservoirs created by small dams had greater activity of four bat species than the streams feeding them (1997). Wetland restoration: a replicated, controlled, before\u2013after study in the USA found restoring wetlands increased overall bat activity, and restored wetlands had similar activity to undisturbed wetlands (2036).
