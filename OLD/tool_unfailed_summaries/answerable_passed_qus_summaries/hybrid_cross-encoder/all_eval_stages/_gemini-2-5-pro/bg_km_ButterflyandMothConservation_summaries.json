    "relevant_summary": "The success of captive breeding and release programs for butterflies and moths is influenced by several factors. Releasing captive-bred individuals has led to populations persisting for 2-28 years and increasing in abundance (3914). However, other studies show populations dying out within 1-12 years, with one review indicating that only 25% of released populations survive for more than three years, and only 8% for more than ten years (3914). Similarly, translocated populations have been reported to persist for between 2 and 49 years, while others have died out in as little as 0-7 years (3909). The success of these programs can be dependent on continued releases to supplement the population (3914, 3909). \n\nHabitat management at the release site is a significant factor. Practices such as coppicing, selective felling, planting, fencing, host plant translocation, invasive plant removal, sheep grazing, and scrub clearance have been associated with the persistence and increased abundance of translocated populations (3909). For example, captive-bred pearl-bordered fritillaries released into coppiced woodland successfully bred at least once (3914). The life stage at which individuals are released varies, with releases of eggs, caterpillars, pupae, and adults all being recorded (3914). The specific conditions of the release site are also important; for instance, the survival of large blue caterpillars was higher when they were translocated into nests of the ant Myrmica sabuleti that did not have a queen present (3909). Comparative studies have found that translocated large copper caterpillars had a higher survival rate than captive-bred ones (3909), and that released, captive-bred large copper caterpillars had lower survival rates than their captive, wild, or translocated counterparts (3914). Nineteen years after translocation, a population of large blue butterflies in the UK showed similar genetic diversity to its Swedish source population (3909). Following a release of captive-bred large coppers, the number of eggs laid per female increased over the first three years (3914).",

    "relevant_summary": "Planting new hedges and managing existing ones provides numerous benefits for butterfly and moth conservation on farmland. Studies in the UK, Ireland, and Canada have shown that established hedgerows support a higher species richness of butterflies and macro-moths compared to other farm habitats like beetle banks, crops, or pastures (3976). The abundance of butterflies and moths is also greater along hedgerows than in open fields or on grass margins (3976). The composition of the hedge is important, as planting species like gorse, oak, and blackthorn can support a higher number of arthropod species, including caterpillars, than the more commonly planted hawthorn (3976).\n\nThe management of existing hedgerows also plays a crucial role. Hedgerows with a more complex structure, such as those with trees, have a higher diversity of butterflies and moths (3975). Management practices like cutting hedgerows less frequently (every 2-3 years), cutting in autumn, or allowing for incremental growth can increase the abundance of butterflies, moths, and their caterpillars (3975). The height and shape of the hedge also matter; hedgerows kept between 1-2 meters tall in Italy and those with scalloped edges in Belgium have been found to support more butterflies and their eggs (3975). Laid or coppiced hedges in the UK also had a higher abundance of butterflies than unmanaged ones (3975). Furthermore, providing training and advice to landowners about agri-environment schemes has resulted in the management of large areas of farmland for the benefit of species like the marsh fritillary butterfly (3846).",

In contrast, traditional hay meadows mown once a year supported a higher abundance of heath fritillary adults and caterpillars than old, abandoned meadows (3908). Summer-grazed or mown grasslands were found to have a lower abundance of woodland butterflies and burnet moths than abandoned grasslands (3908). Additionally, after a reduction in management, the abundance of two butterfly species decreased, and 12 species of moth showed a preference for more intensively managed grasslands (3958).\n\nPotential benefits of abandoning or reducing management intensity on grasslands include a higher species richness of butterflies and moths (3958). Less intensively managed grasslands may also support more specialist moth species, species of conservation concern, and butterfly species with specific host plant requirements (3958). Several studies found that the abundance of butterflies, micro-moths, and declining macro-moths was higher in low-input or unfertilized, ungrazed grasslands (3958). One study found that butterflies were less abundant in managed grasslands compared to unmanaged ones (3908).

    "relevant_summary": "In European forests, comparing the effects of coppicing and clearing patches on butterfly and moth communities reveals varied impacts.\n\nIn terms of community composition, coppiced woodland and wider woodland rides were found to have more unique species of macro-moths than mature forest or standard width rides (3938, 3939). Different aged coppiced woodlands supported different communities of butterflies and moths (3939).\n\nFor species richness and diversity, cleared patches in forests showed a greater species richness of butterflies but a lower species richness of moths when compared to unmanaged patches, coppiced woodland, or closed-canopy forests (3938). One study noted a decline in butterfly species richness over the first three years after clearing (3938). In contrast, coppiced woodland was found to have a greater species richness of butterflies than unmanaged woodland (3939). However, it also had a lower species richness of macro-moths than mature forest, and the age of the coppice did not affect this (3939). Another study found that woodland coppiced two years prior had a greater butterfly species richness than woodland coppiced more than 15 years prior (3939). The species richness of moths was similar in woodland that was coppiced 1-4, 5-8 and 12-20 years ago (3939).\n\nRegarding population abundance, cleared forest patches that were also coppiced and grazed had a higher abundance of butterflies in general, including species like the chequered blue, woodland brown, high brown fritillary, and small pearl-bordered fritillary, compared to unmanaged or solely coppiced areas (3938). However, the abundance of butterflies in these cleared patches declined over the first three years after clearing (3938). Larger cleared patches supported a higher abundance of butterflies than undisturbed forest (3938), while wider rides had a lower abundance of macro-moths than standard width rides or mature forest (3938). In coppiced woodlands, a higher abundance of butterflies, particularly the heath fritillary, was observed compared to unmanaged woodland (3939). Populations of pearl-bordered fritillary and small pearl-bordered fritillary were also more likely to persist in coppiced woodland (3939). Conversely, the abundance of macro-moths was lower in coppiced woodland than in mature forest, with no change in abundance based on the age of the coppice (3939). The timing of coppicing was also a factor, with higher butterfly abundance found in woodlands coppiced 2, 2-4, 5-7, or 12-15 years ago compared to those coppiced 5-11 or over 15 years ago (3939). After coppicing along with other management like scrub control and grazing, the abundance of high brown fritillary and small pearl-bordered fritillary increased (3939). Across Europe, clearing small patches in forests was reported to benefit 19 out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern (3938).",
