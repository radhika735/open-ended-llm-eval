One study evaluated retaining riparian buffers on agricultural land (Action 2284), finding no difference in pipistrelle activity between waterways with vegetation buffers on agri-environment scheme farms and conventional farms.

    "relevant_summary": "Research on bat box effectiveness has identified several key design and placement factors that influence successful use by bats. Design factors include: color (black boxes used more than grey, white, or wooden boxes), size (larger bat boxes showed higher occupancy rates), material (concrete boxes had higher occupancy than wooden ones; resin boxes became occupied more quickly than wood), compartment configuration (two-compartment boxes occupied by more bats than one-compartment during breeding season), and specific design variants (rocket boxes preferred over wooden boxes or bark-mimic roosts by Indiana bats). Placement factors include: orientation and sun exposure (affects occupancy with orientation and sunlight amount being important), height (studies show mixed results with some finding height affects occupancy while others found no effect), location type (higher occupancy on buildings than trees in some studies), habitat context (farm forestry sites vs native forest, pine vs mixed deciduous stands), and prior bat presence (higher occupancy in areas where bats were known to roost before installing boxes). Additional factors include the number of boxes installed (greater numbers across a site increase occupancy likelihood) and microclimate management (modifying roost temperatures can increase bat numbers). However, 22 studies found bats occupying less than half of provided boxes (0-49%), while nine studies found occupancy rates above 50% (54-100%), indicating that even optimally designed and placed boxes may not always be used.",

For livestock water troughs specifically, two studies in the USA demonstrated that management matters - removing livestock modifications resulted in bats drinking more frequently and approaching troughs fewer times before successfully drinking (Action 1951). One study in Portugal found that small dam reservoirs created greater activity for four bat species than the streams feeding into them (Action 1997).

Twelve studies found that organic farming resulted in higher bat activity and species richness compared to conventional farming in some cases, with five of nine studies showing higher overall bat activity on organic farms. Agroforestry systems that retain or plant native trees and shrubs amongst crops (action ID 963) showed varied results across eight studies, with some finding higher bat species diversity and abundance in plantations with varied shade cover. Reducing pesticide, herbicide and fertiliser use (action ID 2013) demonstrated positive effects in four studies, with farms using fewer chemicals showing higher bat activity and species diversity. Managing hedges specifically for bats (action ID 1943) showed limited but positive effects in two UK studies, with hedges trimmed less frequently having more bat species and higher activity. However, there is currently no evidence available for several potentially beneficial practices including increasing semi-natural habitat (action ID 1938), retaining remnant forest (action ID 1947), managing ditches for bats (action ID 1944), practicing integrated farm management (action ID 169), or planting in-field trees (action ID 1946).",
