However, one study found no population establishment from captive-bred and head-started toads. For Puerto Rican crested toads, survival was notably low with 25% being predated within two days of release.\n\nIn terms of captive breeding success, Mallorcan midwife toads achieved 85% survival to metamorphosis, though toads bred for nine or more generations showed slower tadpole development and decreased genetic diversity.
