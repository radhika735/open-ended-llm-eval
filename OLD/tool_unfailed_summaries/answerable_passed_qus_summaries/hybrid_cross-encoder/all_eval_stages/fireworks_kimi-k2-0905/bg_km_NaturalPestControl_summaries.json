Action 123 provides evidence for controlling weeds without damaging other plants in conservation areas, showing that specific management regimes can reduce pernicious weeds, with cutting and fungal pathogen infection being effective for controlling creeping thistle, and lenient grazing providing long-term control. Mixed pasture (Action 721) was found to reduce weeds in two studies from the USA, with both randomized, replicated trials showing reduced weeds compared to monoculture pasture. Delaying mowing or first grazing date on pasture or grassland (Action 131) resulted in benefits including higher plant species richness and higher densities of rare arable weeds according to studies from the Netherlands, Sweden and the UK. Reducing chemical inputs in permanent grassland management (Action 459) was tested as an approach, though the evidence showed no increase in foraging birds attracted to pasture plots with no fertiliser compared to controls. Additional vegetation management approaches include using prescribed fire to maintain or restore disturbance in grasslands (Action 3882) and managing vegetation using livestock grazing (Action 2545), though these were primarily studied for their effects on butterflies/moths and mammals respectively rather than specifically for weed control.",

Eight studies were in the USA, three were in the UK, one was in South Africa\\u00a0and one was a review across Europe.\\n\\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)\\n\\nCommunity composition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA\\u00a0found that pastures managed by patch-burning had a similar butterfly community to rotationally or continuously grazed pastures.\\nRichness/diversity (3 studies): Two replicated, before-and-after studies (including one randomized, controlled study and one paired sites, site comparison study) in the USA\\u00a0found that shrubland plots\\u00a0and grass field margins\\u00a0managed by burning had a similar species richness of butterflies to those which were unburned. One replicated, site comparison study in the USA\\u00a0reported that pastures managed by patch-burning had a lower species richness of butterflies than rotationally grazed pastures, a similar richness to rotationally grazed and mown pastures, and a higher species richness than continuously grazed pastures.\\n\\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (12 STUDIES)\\n\\nAbundance (12 studies): Four of nine studies (including six replicated studies, two randomized studies, two paired sites studies, three controlled studies, two before-and-after studies, and five site comparison studies) in the UK, South Africa\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0found that the abundance of heath fritillary adults, marsh fritillary caterpillar webs\\u00a0and Fender\\u2019s blue caterpillars and eggs\\u00a0was higher (sometimes after initial reductions in abundance) on heathland, fen meadows\\u00a0and prairies\\u00a0one or more years after management by burning than before burning, or compared to unburned\\u00a0or grazed\\u00a0land, although the total population of Fender\\u2019s blue declined in adjacent burned and unburned areas. Three studies found that the abundance of Brenton blue butterfly eggs and adults, rosy marsh moth caterpillars\\u00a0and regal fritillary adults\\u00a0was lower on a bog\\u00a0and prairies\\u00a0managed by burning than on unburned land, at least one\\u00a0and five\\u00a0years after burning. One study found that grass field margins managed by burning had a similar abundance of butterflies to unburned field margins. The seventh study found that abundance of Powershiek skipperling to burning, along with haying and idling, depended on the site\\u2019s vegetation characteristics. Two replicated, site comparison studies in the USA\\u00a0found that two prairie specialists (regal fritillary and arogos skipper)\\u00a0and three out of nine butterfly species\\u00a0were less abundant in prairies\\u00a0or pastures\\u00a0managed by burning than in prairies managed by haying\\u00a0or grazed pastures. These studies also found that the abundance of generalist and migrant species, and of purplish copper, was higher in burned prairies\\u00a0or pastures\\u00a0than hayed prairies\\u00a0or grazed pastures. One review across Europe\\u00a0reported that occasional burning on grassland benefitted 10 out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern.\\nSurvival (1 study): One replicated, paired sites, controlled study in the USA\\u00a0found that in prairie plots burned one year before, Fender\\u2019s blue butterfly caterpillars had lower survival than in unburned plots.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\\n\\nUse (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the UK\\u00a0found that a similar proportion of fen meadows were occupied by marsh fritillary caterpillars whether they were managed by burning, grazing or were unmanaged.\"\n}"
