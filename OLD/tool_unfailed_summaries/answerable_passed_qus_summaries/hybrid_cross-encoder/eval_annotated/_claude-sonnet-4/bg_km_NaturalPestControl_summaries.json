    "relevant_summary": "Studies have documented varied effects of using chemical or plant-based attractants to enhance natural enemy populations. For plant-based attractants, four studies from China, Germany, India and Kenya found that growing non-crop plants that produce chemicals attractive to natural enemies resulted in higher numbers of natural enemies in three studies, while one study found no effect on parasitism when the plant used was not found to be attractive to natural enemies in lab studies (Action 724). All four studies found decreased pest populations or pest damage, and one replicated, randomised, controlled study found increased crop yield (Action 724). Push-pull systems using trap and repellent crops showed that two randomised, replicated, controlled studies from Kenya found increased parasitism of stem borer larvae, and studies from Kenya and South Africa found more natural predators in push-pull systems (Action 753). For chemical attractants, one review and two of five studies from Asia, Europe and North America found that attractive chemicals increased parasitism, while two studies found greater parasitism for some but not all chemicals, crops, sites or years, and one study found no effect (Action 754). Five of 13 studies found more natural enemies while eight found positive effects that varied between enemy groups, sites or study dates (Action 754). Regarding pest control, three of nine studies found fewer pests, although the effect occurred only in the egg stage in one study, while two studies found more pests and four found no effect (Action 754). For flower plantings, three replicated studies from Italy and the USA found greater pest reduction or higher proportions of parasitized pests in fields with planted flower strips, and multiple studies found more natural enemies in fields with planted flower strips compared to fields without them (Action 1400). However, some studies also found inconsistent effects, with one study finding more damage by caterpillars in tomatoes next to planted flower strips and another finding more pests on tomatoes next to planted flower strips (Action 1400).",

    "relevant_summary": "Delaying herbicide use results in mixed effects on pest control systems. According to action 774, delaying herbicide treatments increased natural enemies in two studies from Australia and Denmark, though benefits varied by natural enemy group and were less pronounced early in the season. However, delaying herbicides led to increased weed pressure and had mixed effects on insect pests, with one study finding more insect pests for some groups while another found fewer pests in specific experiments and crop varieties. Crop damage was reduced in some but not all varieties and study years, while yields either decreased or showed no effect. In contrast, altering insecticide timing shows different patterns. Action 723 indicates that applying insecticides earlier rather than later in the growing season increased natural enemies in one UK study. Early insecticide application reduced pests or disease damage in two of four studies, though effects varied with insecticide type, while two studies found no effect on pests or damage. Yield effects were mixed when insecticides were applied early, with one study finding higher yields when applications were timed to periods of suspected crop susceptibility. One study found higher profits and similar costs when insecticides were applied only during times of suspected crop susceptibility. The evidence suggests that both timing alterations affect natural enemies, pest control, and yields differently, with herbicide delays generally showing more consistent benefits for natural enemies but potential negative impacts on weed control and yields, while insecticide timing changes show more variable effects depending on application timing relative to crop growth stages.",

Mixed pasture systems can reduce weeds, as two studies from the USA found reduced weeds in mixed compared to monoculture pasture (Action 721). Livestock grazing can be used to manage vegetation, with studies showing that introduction of livestock grazing increased the abundance of certain species and that sheep-grazed pasture was used more by feeding animals than ungrazed pasture (Action 2545). For specific weed control without damaging other plants, various methods are effective including cutting, infection with fungal pathogens, and lenient grazing for long-term control of creeping thistle, while grass-specific herbicide treatments can eliminate black grass and reduce grass diversity while increasing broadleaved plants (Action 123). Modifying grazing regimes in grassland and shrubland can affect vegetation management, with different grazing intensities showing various effects on plant and animal communities (Action 3490). Additionally, removing problematic vegetation can be effective for invasive species control in grassland areas (Action 432). Some studies also found that grazing herbivores on pasture instead of providing artificial foods can be beneficial for wildlife populations (Action 2398), and grassland restoration or creation can support various species while involving management practices like mowing and weeding or herbicide application (Action 3943).",
