A Hungarian study found that grazing after sowing seeds did not alter the cover of target plant species compared to sowing without grazing. UK studies also examined different livestock types, finding that grazing with cattle after sowing seeds increased sown species richness compared to grazing with sheep, but reduced the cover of sown species compared to sheep grazing. One UK study found that winter grazing after sowing resulted in higher survival of cut-leaved cranesbill seedlings. In contrast, the single USA study found that grazing with cattle after sowing seeds increased native plant species richness compared to sowing without grazing, but reduced the cover of native plant species compared to sowing without grazing.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence, multiple actions can increase the abundance of sown or planted species in grassland restoration projects. \n\n**Seeding strategies and timing:** Sowing seeds at a higher density can increase the cover of individual plant species like thickspike wheatgrass and increase the number of purple needlegrass seedlings, though effects on overall sown species cover are mixed (Action 3405). Sowing seeds at the start of the growing season increased the cover of sown grass and forb species compared to autumn sowing and increased the number of sown species (Action 3407). Increasing the number of species in seed mix showed mixed effects, with one study finding increased cover of sown plant species while another found no change (Action 3406).\n\n**Site preparation methods:** Applying herbicide before seeding increased the cover of sown grass species and increased sown species richness (Action 3418). Disturbing soil before sowing seeds increased plant emergence in most cases and improved seedling survival in some studies (Action 3413). Removing leaf litter before seeding showed mixed effects on seedling emergence of sown species (Action 3414).\n\n**Soil amendments and treatments:** Adding fertilizer to soil before or after seeding showed mixed results, with some studies finding increased cover and density of sown species while others found no change (Action 3427). Inoculating soil with mycorrhiza before seeding increased the abundance of target species considered a local conservation priority and increased cover of some native prairie species (Action 3429).\n\n**Post-establishment management:** Mowing after seeding increased the abundance of sown forb species and increased sown species richness, with more frequent mowing increasing abundance of five of seven sown forb species (Action 3419). Using erosion blankets after seeding showed mixed effects on vegetation (Action 3431).\n\n**Direct planting approaches:** Plant grassland plants increased species richness of grasses in 50% of cases and forbs in 83% of cases, with planted species having mixed effects on abundance (Action 3399). Sowing native grass and forb seeds increased the abundance of sown species in most cases, with five of six studies finding positive effects (Action 3432).\n\n**Spatial strategies:** Sowing seeds in prepared gaps within vegetation led to greater cover of sown target plant species when using large gaps compared to smaller gaps (Action 3409). Sowing grassland seeds from a local source increased the abundance of some characteristic plant species and increased cover of target plant species when combined with increased species diversity (Action 3400).\n\n**Water management:** Irrigating after seeding showed limited evidence, with one study finding no change in vegetation cover (Action 3430).",

Soil disturbance before seeding was found to increase plant emergence in most cases compared to sowing alone, with four of five studies across the USA, Germany, China and Spain demonstrating increased emergence, while one of two studies found that disturbing soil before sowing increased seedling survival (action 3413). Topsoil or turf removal before seeding showed positive effects on survival, with two studies in the USA finding that removing topsoil before planting California oatgrass or sowing and planting purple needlegrass increased the survival of seedlings and plants (action 3415). Herbicide application before seeding demonstrated benefits for emergence, with one study in Germany finding that spraying with herbicide before sowing seeds increased seedling emergence for five of eight wildflower species (action 3418). In direct comparisons within European studies, removing turf before sowing seeds increased both grass and forb species richness in most cases compared to disturbing the soil before sowing in a UK study (action 3415). One UK study found that rotovating soil before sowing seeds increased both grass and forb species richness compared to harrowing before sowing (action 3413). French studies showed that removing topsoil before sowing seeds increased plant species richness and community similarity to intact steppe (action 3415).",

Three replicated studies from Sweden and the UK (one also controlled and two site comparisons) found that restored grassland had a lower diversity and frequency of certain plant species, and attracted fewer foraging queen bumblebees than continuously grazed or unmanaged grasslands.\\nWe captured 40 studies (including 19 replicated and controlled studies of which six were also randomized, and six reviews) from nine European countries that found ten different techniques used alone or in combinations were effective for restoring species-rich grassland. Effective techniques included: grazing, introducing plant species, hay spreading and mowing.\\nWe found 22 studies from seven European countries that included information on the length of time taken to restore grassland communities (including 16 replicated trials of which nine also controlled and three reviews). Six studies saw positive signs of restoration in less than five years, 11 studies within 10 years and two studies found restoration took more than 10 years.

No other grassland seeding or planting interventions had any evidence for effects on vegetation structure - this includes sowing seeds at higher density (Action 3405), increasing the number of species in seed mix (Action 3406), sowing seeds in prepared gaps within vegetation (Action 3409), removing vegetation before seeding/planting (Action 3416), adding topsoil before seeding/planting (Action 3420), removing leaf litter before seeding/planting (Action 3414), and irrigating before or after seeding/planting (Action 3430). These interventions showed evidence for effects on vegetation community composition, species richness/diversity, vegetation abundance, and germination/emergence, but no studies measured vegetation structure outcomes.

    "relevant_summary": "Post-seeding management practices in grasslands show distinct effects on vegetation outcomes. Mowing after seeding/planting increased plant species richness compared to grazing with livestock in UK studies (Action 3419). Specifically, cutting vegetation yearly after sowing seeds resulted in higher plant species richness than livestock grazing (Action 3419). Mowing also increased the richness of sown species after seeding, with one UK study showing that mowing after sowing seeds increased sown species richness (Action 3419). Additionally, cutting sown plots each year and removing cut vegetation increased sown grass and forb species richness compared to cutting without removing vegetation (Action 3419). \n\nFor grazing effects, one UK study found that grazing with cattle after sowing seeds increased sown species richness compared to grazing with sheep (Action 3423). However, the same study also found that grazing with cattle reduced the cover of sown species compared to sheep grazing (Action 3423). Grazing with livestock after sowing seeds generally reduced plant species richness compared to cutting vegetation after sowing (Action 3423).\n\nRegarding mowing frequency, cutting vegetation three times per year after sowing seeds increased the richness of characteristic grassland species compared to cutting once per year in German studies (Action 3419). More frequent mowing also increased the abundance of five of seven sown forb species (Action 3419).\n\nThe timing of management also matters, as studies showed that delaying mowing dates resulted in higher plant species richness in some cases (Action 131).",

A further four of the studies found that in grasslands which had been abandoned for &gt;10 years, many years\\u00a0or an unspecified number of years, and in one case with burning, abundance or density was mixed depending on butterfly\\u00a0and moth\\u00a0species compared to grasslands grazed by cattle\\u00a0or unspecified grazers\\u00a0or grazed with cattle and burned. The other study found that butterfly density was higher in grasslands where grazing ceased 2\\u20139 years ago than those abandoned &gt;10 years ago or those currently grazed. Two replicated studies (including one controlled, before-and-after study and one site comparison study) in Spain\\u00a0and Germany\\u00a0found that grasslands which had been abandoned for 1\\u20136 years\\u00a0or an unspecified time period\\u00a0had a higher abundance of woodland and hedgerow butterflies\\u00a0and burnet moths, but a lower abundance of grassland\\u00a0or farmland\\u00a0species, than grasslands managed by grazing and/or mowing (results not distinguished). Two studies also found that the large blue\\u00a0and silver-studded blue\\u00a0went extinct in some abandoned meadows. One replicated, site comparison study in Sweden\\u00a0found that grasslands which were ungrazed for the year had a lower abundance of clouded Apollo butterflies than lightly grazed grasslands, but a higher abundance than heavily grazed grasslands. One review in Europe\\u00a0reported that ceasing grazing on grassland benefitted six out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (3 STUDIES)\\n\\nUse (3 studies): One replicated, paired, site comparison study in Germany\\u00a0found that grassland which had been abandoned for &gt;5 years had a similar occurrence of hoary bell moth caterpillars to grassland grazed by sheep. One replicated, site comparison study in the UK\\u00a0found that a similar proportion of grasslands which had been abandoned for one year, and grazed grasslands, contained &gt;20 marsh fritillary caterpillar webs. One replicated, site comparison study in Spain\\u00a0found that grizzled skipper and painted lady occurred less frequently, but small pearl-bordered fritillary occurred more frequently, in meadows which had been abandoned for at least 1\\u20132 years than in meadows managed by grazing or mowing (results not distinguished).\"\n}"
