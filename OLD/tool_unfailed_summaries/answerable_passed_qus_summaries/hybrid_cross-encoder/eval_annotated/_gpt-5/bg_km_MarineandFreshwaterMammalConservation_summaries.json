Rehabilitating and releasing injured, sick, or weak marine mammals resulted in 10\u2013100% survival during monitoring periods ranging from three days to five years across multiple species and locations, with more than a quarter of rehabilitated Hawaiian monk seals reproducing; behaviour of some rehabilitated harbour porpoises and harbour seals was similar to wild animals, but at least a quarter of California sea lions treated for toxic algae poisoning died or were euthanized and released individuals showed altered movements, reduced time diving or hauled out, and shorter, shallower dives compared to wild conspecifics [2925]. Rescuing and releasing stranded or trapped marine mammals yielded 17\u2013100% survival over three weeks to three years in multiple dolphin, whale, and seal species, with reproduction documented in a rescued bottlenose dolphin and more than a quarter of Hawaiian monk seals surviving and reproducing when rescue/release was combined with at least seven other survival-enhancing interventions [2924]. Releasing captive-bred manatees led to survival of two of three Antillean manatees and two of 14 Florida manatees for at least one year without further intervention [2933]. No studies were found evaluating outcomes of rehabilitating and releasing marine mammals following oil spills [2871].",

One study in the Shannon Estuary\\u00a0found that a stranded common bottlenose dolphin that was rescued and released was observed with a calf a year later.\\nSurvival (11 studies): Seven studies (including one review) in the North Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean\\u00a0and the Shannon Estuary\\u00a0found that 17\\u2013100% of rescued and released Atlantic white-sided dolphins, short-beaked common dolphins, common bottlenose dolphins, long-finned pilot whales, short-finned\\u00a0pilot whales, and Cape fur seals\\u00a0survived during post-release monitoring periods, which ranged in length from three weeks\\u00a0to three years. Three studies in the South Atlantic Ocean, the Cachoeira estuary\\u00a0and the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that a trapped rough-toothed dolphin, two stranded tucuxi dolphins\\u00a0and seven stranded sperm whales\\u00a0were successfully rescued and released, although long-term survival was not reported.
