    "relevant_summary": "Besides adding organic amendments like compost or manure, several other management practices can improve soil aggregation and stability on Mediterranean farmland. Reduced tillage and no-tillage systems have been shown to increase soil aggregate water-stability compared to conventional tillage, with seven replicated studies finding that soils without tillage were more stable than tilled soils. Growing cover crops beneath main crops or between crop rows increases soil stability, with studies from France showing reduced erosion under cover crops and controlled studies demonstrating highest soil stability under grass covers. Maintaining ground cover in orchards and vineyards also significantly improves soil aggregation, with four replicated randomized controlled studies from Chile and Spain finding that soil aggregates were more water-stable in plots with seeded cover crops compared to tilled or bare soils. Retaining crop residues on fields reduces soil erosion and improves aggregation, as shown by a Canadian replicated site comparison study that found mixed effects on soil physical properties including the size of soil aggregates. Adding mulch to crops increases soil stability and reduces erosion, with five studies from India, France, Nigeria and the UK finding that mulches increased soil stability and reduced both soil erosion and runoff. Crop rotation practices can also enhance soil structure, with one replicated controlled study from Syria finding higher water-stability in soils with crop rotations compared to continuous crops.",

Six studies (including three replicated controlled trials of which two randomized) found that excluding or delaying summer grazing increased plant species diversity, invertebrate abundance and benefited breeding Eurasian skylark. A review found a study that showed that removing autumn grazing after a silage cut increased the winter abundance of seed-eating birds. A review and a replicated controlled study from the UK\\u00a0found that reduced grazing intensity or seasonal removal of livestock increased the number of invertebrates, plant seed heads and foraging skylark, and that some bird species preferred plots with seasonal removal of livestock.\\nThree studies (including one randomized, replicated, controlled trial) from the Netherlands and the UK found no benefit to plants or invertebrates from reduced grazing intensity. One randomized, replicated controlled trial excluded grazing in autumn/winter and another study excluded grazing in the summer. A further study found that reducing grazing intensity throughout the year did not increase plant diversity.\\nNine studies from France, Germany and the UK reported mixed results for some or all species or wildlife groups considered (including one randomized, replicated, controlled trial and two reviews and a systematic review). Of these, eight studies found that reduced grazing intensity throughout the year benefited some species but not others, one found that the impact depended on the type of vegetation grazed, and one found benefits to bee and wasp abundance but not species richness. One study found that the response of birds to removal of summer grazing varied between functional groups and depended on time of year. A UK review found that reduced grazing benefited invertebrates, plants, rodents and some but not all birds. \\nA systematic review of the effects of grazing intensity on meadow pasture concluded that intermediate levels of grazing are usually optimal for plants, invertebrates and birds but that trade-offs are likely to exist between the requirements of different taxa.\"\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence reviewed, several actions can increase crop yields on Mediterranean farmland. Reduced tillage in arable fields can lead to higher cereal yields in some cases, with studies from Egypt, France, Spain, and Turkey showing positive results (Action 1359). No tillage can also increase crop yields, with studies from Italy and Spain demonstrating higher yields compared to conventional tillage (Action 1355). Growing cover crops in arable fields can increase cash crop yields, particularly when legumes are used as winter cover crops compared to non-legumes (Action 1351). Crop rotations can increase crop yields compared to monocultures, with studies from Italy, Spain, and Turkey showing positive results (Action 1354). Soil amendments also show positive effects - adding compost to soil can increase crop yields, with studies from Italy, Spain, and the USA demonstrating higher yields in plots with added compost (Action 1346). Using organic fertilizer instead of inorganic can increase crop yields, with studies from Italy and Spain showing higher yields in some comparisons (Action 1350). Adding slurry to the soil can increase crop yields, with studies from Spain finding higher yields in plots with added pig slurry (Action 1349). Soil amendments with crops grown as green manures can increase grain yields, with studies from India and Pakistan showing increased yields when green manures were grown (Action 908). Amending the soil with bacteria or fungi can increase crop yields, with studies from India and Turkey finding higher yields (Action 888). Using organic fertilizer instead of inorganic can also improve soil conditions that support crop production, including increased organic matter, nutrients, and microbial biomass (Action 1366).",

Organic fertilizer use (Action 1366) also demonstrated effectiveness, with 8 out of 13 replicated studies from France, Italy, Spain, Turkey, and Mediterranean countries showing increased soil organic matter, which is associated with improved crop quality. Cover crops (Actions 1351 and 1345) showed mixed but promising results, with some studies indicating higher crop yields and improved soil quality, particularly when legumes were used as cover crops compared to non-legumes.\n\nThe least effective actions include no tillage (Action 1355), which showed inconsistent results across 23 studies with 7 studies finding lower crop yields compared to conventional tillage, particularly in Mediterranean conditions. Crop rotations (Action 1368) demonstrated limited effectiveness, with 5 out of 9 studies showing reduced organic matter in soils compared to continuous crops, though results varied significantly across different Mediterranean regions.

Studies from Spain and Italy found that applying compost increased crop yields in some comparisons (action IDs 1346, 889, 891), with one Italian trial showing that high rates of compost increased fruit yield (action ID 889). Manure applications also demonstrated yield benefits, with studies from Greece and Turkey showing higher crop yields when manures or compost were applied (action IDs 911, 1347). Specifically, pig slurry applications in Spain consistently resulted in higher crop yields compared to plots without slurry (action ID 1349). When comparing organic versus inorganic fertilizers, studies from Mediterranean countries including Italy, Spain, and Greece showed mixed results: some found higher yields with organic fertilizers in certain comparisons, while others found similar yields between organic and inorganic treatments (action ID 1350). A direct comparison between compost and manure in Italy found that compost applications resulted in more organic matter, nutrients, and microbial biomass than manure (action ID 1366).

No-tillage shows more variable results, with some studies finding more weeds than conventional tillage while others show inconsistent differences (Action 1397). When comparing the two conservation systems directly, four studies found fewer weeds with no-till compared to reduced tillage, though results vary by location (Action 1398).

Thirty-four studies (of which 21 were replicated and controlled and seven also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found some positive effects on earthworms, some invertebrates (other than earthworms), weeds or farmland birds, of reducing tillage compared to conventional management. Positive effects included increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms, greater abundance of some invertebrates other than earthworms, increased numbers of some weeds and/or weed species, higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying date and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields, and greater abundance of some birds - including Eurasian skylark, seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in late winter on non-inversion or conservation tillage. A review found tillage had negative effects on invertebrate numbers and no-till systems had more invertebrate bird food resources.\\nTwenty-six studies (of which 13 replicated and controlled and three also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found reducing tillage had either negative, no effect or no consistent effects on abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates (other than earthworms), earthworm abundance, biomass, or species richness, number of different plant species found as seeds, number of some weed species, mammal abundance, some bird species, and one study found bird preferences for conservation tillage fields decreased over time. Two studies found that crop type affected the number of weeds under different tillage regimes.\\nOne small replicated trial in the UK compared bird numbers under two different forms of reduced tillage, and found more birds from species that make up the \\u2018Farmland Bird Index\\u2019 on broadcast than non-inversion tillage fields.\\nTwo studies looked at the long-term effects of reduced tillage on earthworms (after ten years).

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done.

Planting or maintaining ground cover in orchards and vineyards has been shown to provide benefits, with studies from Mediterranean olive orchards in Greece finding more bee species and deposited pollen grains in managed orchards with ground cover compared to abandoned orchards (1404). Reducing cutting frequency on grasslands has demonstrated positive effects for pollinators including butterflies and moths, with studies from Italy and Germany showing meadows cut once/year had higher species richness compared to those cut multiple times/year (3961). Vineyard management practices that encourage native plants and reduce chemical inputs have been shown to increase butterfly abundance in Spain (3919). No-tillage practices in arable fields have evidence of benefit, with studies finding more pollinators in plots with no tillage compared to deep tillage (1405, 2516). Creating or retaining hedgerows provides significant benefits for pollinator communities, with studies showing higher bee species richness and abundance in fields with hedgerows (2515). Managing landscapes to enhance floral resources has shown positive correlations with pollinator abundance (362), and providing set-aside areas in farmland has been documented to benefit various wildlife groups including pollinators (156). Diversifying ground vegetation and canopy structure around woody crops like olive groves has shown higher reptile diversity and abundance, indicating ecosystem benefits that could extend to pollinators (3526).",

However, several studies from US grasslands provide relevant evidence on grazing management impacts on invertebrate and mammal biodiversity:\n\nFor invertebrates, studies show mixed effects: Two replicated studies in US grasslands found more invertebrates in sheep-, goat-, or cattle-grazed plots compared to ungrazed plots in some comparisons (Action 1419). However, one replicated, randomized, controlled study found fewer invertebrates in plots with simulated grazing compared to ungrazed plots, though similar numbers of invertebrate species were found (Action 1419). One replicated, randomized, controlled before-and-after study in wet grasslands found more aquatic invertebrate species in continuously grazed plots compared to seasonally grazed plots in some comparisons (Action 1421).\n\nFor mammals, studies demonstrate varied responses: Two replicated, controlled studies in US grasslands found that abundances of some or all rodents were higher or increased more on sheep- or cow-grazed plots compared to ungrazed plots, though some species were less abundant or had lower monthly survival on grazed plots (Action 1419). Four studies examining grazer exclusion found mixed results, with two site comparisons in US grasslands finding more mammal species and higher mammal abundance in areas with cattle or sheep excluded compared to grazed areas in some comparisons (Action 1417).\n\nThe evidence primarily comes from grassland systems, though specific Mediterranean climate conditions are not explicitly addressed in these action documents.",

However, most studies appear to be from non-Mediterranean regions, particularly the USA. For birds generally, two replicated site comparisons from Spain found similar numbers of species in restored versus remnant sites, while studies from other regions showed mixed results including some finding fewer species in restored riparian sites. For amphibians and reptiles, one replicated site comparison found similar numbers of species in restored and remnant sites. Fish studies showed differences in communities following river flow changes. Invertebrate studies showed varied results with some finding similar numbers of freshwater invertebrates in restored versus reference sites after restoration. Plant studies showed varied outcomes including lower plant cover in restored versus remnant sites in some cases, while other measures like species diversity showed mixed results. Implementation options studied included the effects of restoration age, with some evidence that older restored plots had better outcomes for vegetation structure and bird populations.",

Sewage sludge application demonstrated higher barley yields in Spanish studies, with low amounts being more effective than high amounts (action 1348). Slurry application showed the most consistent results, with six Spanish studies finding higher crop yields with pig slurry application compared to no slurry, though results varied by comparison (action 1349).

    "relevant_summary": "Based on multiple studies conducted in Mediterranean countries and similar climates, the most beneficial tillage practices for increasing soil organic matter in arable fields include reduced tillage and no-tillage systems. A meta-analysis from multiple Mediterranean countries found that both reduced tillage and no-tillage systems consistently increased soil organic matter compared to conventional tillage. Specifically, 14 studies found more organic matter in soils with reduced tillage versus conventional tillage, while a meta-analysis and 14 additional studies found more organic matter in no-tillage soils compared to tilled soils.\n\nConservation tillage practices are most effective when combined with crop residue retention and cover cropping. Retaining crop residues on fields was shown to increase soil organic carbon and nitrogen levels in multiple studies from Australia and China. Growing winter cover crops in arable fields significantly increased soil organic matter (measured as carbon) in Mediterranean-type climates, with a meta-analysis and ten controlled studies from Italy, Spain, and the USA demonstrating consistent benefits.\n\nThe research indicates that the combination of no-tillage or reduced tillage with residue retention and cover crops creates optimal conditions for soil organic matter accumulation. These practices work synergistically to reduce soil erosion, improve soil aggregation, and enhance microbial biomass. Implementation should be long-term, as studies showed higher soil quality and greater organic matter accumulation in plots with long-term conservation tillage compared to short-term implementations.",

Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil.

Regarding crop yield, the evidence from Spain and Italy shows mixed results: six studies found lower cash crop yields with winter cover crops compared to plots without them, while three studies found higher yields, eight studies showed inconsistent differences (sometimes higher, sometimes lower), and seven studies found no yield differences. The yield impacts varied by cover crop type, with legumes generally providing better outcomes than non-legumes.\n\nFor water availability, the evidence reveals several trade-offs: seven studies found less water in soils with winter cover crops, while two found more water in some comparisons. However, five studies found that less water was lost through drainage, runoff, or evaporation from plots with cover crops. Two Spanish studies showed conflicting results on water use - one found cover crops used more water than bare fallows, while another found no difference. The water content effects also varied with implementation, as Spanish studies found more water in soils with long-term versus short-term cover crops, and differences in water availability between different cover crop types.\n\nAdditional Mediterranean-specific findings include reduced nitrate leaching in Spanish studies with cover crops, and implementation options matter significantly - legume cover crops generally performed better for both yield and water conservation outcomes compared to non-legumes.",

Creating beetle banks provides habitat for beneficial insects including ground beetles and other invertebrate natural enemies. Growing non-crop plants that produce chemicals attractive to natural enemies has been shown to increase parasitism and natural enemy numbers while reducing pest populations. Using reduced tillage practices may support natural enemy populations by preserving soil habitat, though effects vary by species. Allowing natural regeneration of ground cover beneath crops provides habitat and increases natural enemy numbers, with some studies finding more natural enemies in natural ground cover compared to bare ground.

Flower planting also increased wild bee species and individuals in some comparisons, though results varied for different pollinator groups (action 1406). Implementation studies from Italy and Spain showed that pollinator response to flower strips depended on the number and type of flower species planted, with some species being more attractive than others (actions 2468, 1406).\n\nPlanting hedgerows showed different benefits, with studies primarily from the USA (as no Mediterranean-specific hedgerow studies were found) demonstrating increased native bee species richness and crop visitation rates by native bees adjacent to hedgerows, though honey bee and syrphid fly responses were inconsistent (actions 1407, 2515). Hedgerows supported more bee species, syrphid fly species, and specialist bees compared to field edges without hedgerows (actions 1407, 2515). The effectiveness of hedgerows increased with age, with older hedgerows supporting more bee and syrphid fly species than younger ones (actions 1407, 2515).\n\nNeither intervention showed consistent effects across all pollinator groups, with flowers showing more variable results and hedgerows primarily benefiting native bees. The evidence base is limited for Mediterranean contexts, with most hedgerow studies originating from the USA.",
