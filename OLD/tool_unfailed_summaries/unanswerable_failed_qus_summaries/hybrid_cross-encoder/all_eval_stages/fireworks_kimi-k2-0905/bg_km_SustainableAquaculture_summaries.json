    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence, cleaner wrasse (738) show potential as a cost-effective biological control method, with one controlled study finding they were as effective as chemical treatments at controlling lice infestation. Altering lighting (741) is another potential cost-effective approach, with a replicated, controlled study in Norway showing lower lice numbers on salmon kept in low intensity artificial light or natural lighting. Probiotics and immunostimulants (732) reduced lice infection levels by 28% in salmon fed a diet with added beta-glucans compared to controls. Fallowing systems (1026) showed mixed results, with one study in Scotland recording lower lice numbers on Atlantic salmon when using fallowing, while another found no difference in Australia. Freshwater bathing (739) provided mixed evidence for treating other diseases but specific effectiveness against sea lice was not clearly established. No evidence was found specifically comparing the costs of these different methods, but biological controls and management practices like lighting alterations may offer more sustainable and potentially cost-effective alternatives to repeated chemical treatments.",
