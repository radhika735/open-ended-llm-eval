    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence, providing bat boxes appears to be the most promising cost-effective method for increasing bat populations in agricultural landscapes. Research shows that bats successfully use bat boxes installed in farmland and related habitats, with 44 studies demonstrating that bats occupied bat boxes in these environments. Installation of bat boxes in farm forestry sites showed higher occupancy rates compared to native forest locations, indicating their effectiveness in agricultural settings. The number of bats using bat boxes increased by 2\u201310 times within 10 years after installation, providing measurable population benefits. While agri-environment schemes involving farmer engagement have shown mixed results, bat boxes offer a more direct and proven approach, with studies indicating that 72 bat species have used bat boxes worldwide, and different designs can be selected based on local bat species requirements.",

One study in the USA\\u00a0found that Indiana bats used rocket boxes more than wooden bat boxes or bark-mimic roosts.

According to action ID 1024, 44 studies evaluated bat box effectiveness across Europe, North America, Australia, and South America, with 72 bat species using them (though only 18 species commonly used them). Studies found bats occupied 0-100% of provided bat boxes, with optimal design factors including black coloration, larger size, concrete construction over wood, and proper placement on buildings rather than trees. Action ID 95 covers bat boxes, bat grilles, and roost improvements, though no specific cost data was captured. For more complex installations, action ID 2049 shows artificial caves/hibernacula were used by up to four bat species in UK and German studies, while action ID 949 indicates alternative roosts within developments had variable success rates (13-74% occupancy at development sites). The simpler bat box approach appears most cost-effective given the extensive evidence base and higher success rates compared to more elaborate artificial cave systems.",
