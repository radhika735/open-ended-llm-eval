    "model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro",
    "provider": null,
    "relevant_summary": "Several studies have examined the effects of different mowing strategies on farmland wildlife.\n\nRegarding mowing techniques, one trial found that mowing from the center of the field outwards allowed 68% of corncrake chicks to escape, compared to 45% with conventional inward mowing (698). The use of bar mowers and double chop mowers was found to cause less damage to amphibians and invertebrates than other machinery types (698). Conversely, rotary disc mowers with conditioners killed twice as many small mammals as double blade mowers (698). Using a mechanical processor or conditioner was also found to kill or injure more invertebrates (698). However, one study found that mower-conditioners led to higher Eurasian skylark nest survival compared to using a tedder (698). Additionally, skylark chick survival was four times higher with wider mowing machinery (698). Wildlife-friendly mowing techniques have been associated with lower mortality for corncrakes and Eurasian skylarks (192), and a scheme promoting such techniques coincided with a large increase in the UK corncrake population (192).\n\nIn terms of mowing height, a UK review and a study found that raised mowing heights benefited Eurasian skylarks with increased productivity and were less damaging to amphibians and invertebrates (138). However, a randomized, replicated, controlled trial in the UK found that raising mowing height did not attract more foraging birds (222, 138) or affect the number of invertebrates (138). Furthermore, one study noted that northern lapwing and common starling chicks foraged more successfully in shorter grass (138). Another UK review suggested that while raising mowing height might increase skylark productivity, it was not sufficient to maintain the local population (222).\n\nDelaying the date of mowing has also been studied. Eight studies found that delaying mowing or grazing resulted in benefits such as higher plant species richness, more insect species, greater abundance of some spiders and ground beetles, and increased breeding densities of wading birds and Eurasian skylark productivity (131). The introduction of measures including delayed mowing dates coincided with an increase in the UK corncrake population (131). However, six other studies found that delaying mowing had no clear effect on plant species richness, ground beetle communities, the abundance of some insects and spiders, or the population trends of wading bird species (131).",

Another five replicated trials in Europe showed that field margins sown with an agricultural nectar and pollen seed mix, particularly those with perennial leguminous flowering plants, attract significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated, grassy, or cropped field margins [18]. Perennial leguminous herbs in seed mixes have been identified as important forage sources for bumblebees, especially long-tongued species [19]. In fact, one trial showed that common long-tongued bumblebees have a strong preference for perennial wildflower seed mixes over annual forage plants [19]. However, another three trials found that a mix of agricultural forage plants, including legumes, can attract a greater number of bumblebees than a perennial wildflower mix, at least in the first year [18]. It is worth noting that three trials in the UK suggest that margins sown with agricultural legume plants may degrade in their value to bumblebees over time and would require re-sowing every few years [18]. There is no captured evidence on the effects of these management practices on solitary bees in either of the studied approaches [18, 19].",
