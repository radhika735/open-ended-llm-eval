For water primrose, triclopyr TEA at 0.25% killed 100% of young cultivated plants in a lab study, glyphosate achieved 97% mortality with a non\u2011oil sticking agent and 100% with TopFilm in a UK field study, and halosulfuron\u2011methyl significantly reduced coverage without apparent toxicity to rice (IDs: 1139). Adjuvants and formulation influence efficacy: adding specific sticking agents (non\u2011oil vs TopFilm) altered water primrose mortality from 97% to 100% (ID: 1139). Application context matters: plant age (young plants) and setting (laboratory vs field; presence of rice crop) were linked to different effectiveness and selectivity outcomes (ID: 1139). Integrating chemical applications with other methods can affect results: glyphosate plus the surfactant Cygnet\u2011Plus followed by mechanical removal achieved a 75% kill rate of water primrose in California, and a broader program combining herbicide, physical removal, native plant promotion, and mulching reduced Peruvian primrose\u2011willow coverage by 85\u201390% in Australia (ID: 1140).",

For Ponto-Caspian gammarids, laboratory studies reported that movement slowed or stopped in water exposed to predatory fish cues, and that carbonated water could stun invasive killer shrimp [1088]. Cleaning equipment to prevent transfer of Ponto-Caspian gammarids has been proposed but no studies directly evaluated this action [1096]. Exchanging ballast water to limit transfer of Ponto-Caspian gammarids has been proposed but no studies directly evaluated this action [1097]. Cleaning hulls, anchors and chains of vessels has been proposed to limit invertebrate transfer, but no studies directly evaluated effects on subtidal invertebrate populations [2166]. Implementing biosecurity measures to prevent introductions of problematic species has been proposed, but no studies directly evaluated their effects in the evidence base cited [1767]. Trapping and removal of red swamp crayfish can reduce numbers locally; in one study, food-baited traps caught the most individuals compared to pheromone-baited or unbaited traps [1029].",
