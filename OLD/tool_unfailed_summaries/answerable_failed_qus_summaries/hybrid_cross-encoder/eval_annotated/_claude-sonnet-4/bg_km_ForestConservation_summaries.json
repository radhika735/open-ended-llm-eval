    "relevant_summary": "According to studies from European and North American forests, several alternative harvesting methods to clearcutting have documented effects. Shelterwood harvesting shows mixed results across different taxa: for butterflies and moths, one study found higher macro-moth species richness compared to clearcutting (action ID 3871), another found moth species richness recovered faster after shelterwood harvesting than after clearcutting (action ID 3871), while a third found similar moth species richness between shelterwood and clearcutting but lower than unharvested forest (action ID 3871). For salamanders, shelterwood harvesting resulted in higher, similar, or initially higher then similar abundance compared to clearcutting (action ID 851), with a meta-analysis finding that partial harvest including shelterwood resulted in smaller reductions in salamander populations than clearcutting (action ID 851). For plants, shelterwood harvesting in Sweden and USA resulted in higher plant diversity, lower grass cover, and higher density of tree species compared to clearcutting (action ID 1214), and generally increased abundance, species richness, and diversity of understory plants as well as growth and survival rate of young trees (action ID 1223). Partial retention harvesting in Canada decreased the density of young trees compared to clearcutting (action ID 1215). Selective harvesting showed mixed results for mammals, with one study finding no higher small mammal species richness compared to clearcutting (action ID 2637), while results for abundance varied by species and study, with a systematic review finding that partially harvested forests had more red-backed voles but not deer mice than clearcut forests (action ID 2637). Group harvesting studies found that compared to clearcutting, harvesting trees in small groups did not result in higher amphibian or salamander abundance (action ID 844), though a meta-analysis found partial harvest methods including group harvesting resulted in smaller reductions in salamander populations than clearcutting (action ID 844).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence, different forest restoration methods using biological materials show mixed effectiveness. Regarding seed sowing methods, one study in Brazil found that sowing tree seeds increased the density and species richness of new trees (1244), while three studies in the USA examining post-wildfire seed sowing found it decreased the number and cover of native species and tree seedling density, with no effect on total plant cover or species richness (1236). Combining sowing seeds with planting individual plants showed no increased benefit over either method alone (1700).\n\nFor direct planting approaches, replanting native trees in logged areas showed some promise, with similar species richness but lower diversity compared to naturally regenerating secondary forest after nine years (3874). Studies on replanting native vegetation across multiple countries found generally similar species richness and diversity to reference habitats, though some showed lower abundance than remnant native habitat (3933). \n\nRegarding beneficial organism inoculation, soil mycorrhiza inoculation before seeding/planting showed mixed results - one study found it initially increased vegetation cover but showed no difference after three years, while another found it increased abundance of target conservation species (3429). Studies specifically examining mycorrhizal fungi addition to tree seedlings found no effect on growth and survival in most cases, though one study showed increased growth for red balau seedlings (1841). Research on root-associated fungi for tree seedlings found no evidence of effectiveness (1160, 3350).\n\nSoil preparation methods like scarification or ploughing showed positive effects, with studies finding increased cover and diversity of understory plants and mixed effects on tree species density (1251). Artificial methods to encourage natural seed dispersal, such as building bird perches, showed no significant effect on seedling abundance (1817).",

    "relevant_summary": "Several actions are available to protect newly planted trees from competition and other threats in restoration projects. For competition management, selective thinning after restoration planting can be used (action 1238), and mechanical thinning before or after planting has shown positive results in five of six studies across multiple countries, increasing survival and size of planted trees (action 1261). Ground preparation before tree planting has demonstrated effectiveness, with six of seven studies finding increased survival and growth rates of planted trees (action 1263).\n\nTo protect against vegetation competition, covering the ground with plastic mats after restoration planting can decrease the cover of herbaceous plants and grasses (action 1239), while covering with techniques other than plastic mats, such as mulch, increased total plant cover (action 1240). Adding mulch before or after seeding/planting has shown mixed results, with some studies finding increased seedling numbers and target plant species cover (action 3425). Weed mats showed no effect on seedling height in one study (action 1267).\n\nFor physical protection, fences or barriers can be used to protect planted vegetation, particularly in wetland environments. Studies in freshwater wetlands found that fencing to exclude deer increased tree seedling height and sometimes improved survival, though effects varied by season, elevation, and site (action 3330). In brackish/saline wetlands, full-length plastic shelters increased survival rates and growth of red mangrove propagules (action 3331). Plastic guards increased height and diameter growth rates in baldcypress seedlings (action 3330).\n\nAdditional protection methods include using shading for planted trees, which increased survival rates of native tree seedlings in one study (action 1269). However, some proposed actions lack research evidence, including using tree tubes/small fences/cages to protect individual trees (action 2630), removing competing vegetation in brackish/saline wetlands (action 3335), and planting mixtures of tree species to enhance survival (action 1159).",

Species richness of macro-moths was higher after shelterwood harvesting than after patch-cutting or clearcutting, with richness similar to thinned and unharvested forests (Action 3871).

Forests managed by group selection harvesting had similar moth species richness to those managed by single tree harvesting or clearcutting, but lower species richness than unharvested forest (Action 3868).\n\nThinning instead of clearcutting resulted in higher macro-moth species richness compared to patch-cutting or clearcutting, with richness similar to unharvested forests (Action 3868).\n\nWoody debris removal produced variable effects: one study found it increased understory vegetation cover, while three studies found no effect or mixed effects on cover (Action 1213). Four studies found no effect or mixed effects on understory vegetation species richness and diversity, and two found no effect on cover and species diversity of trees (Action 1213). For young trees specifically, one study found debris removal increased young tree density, another found it decreased density, and three studies found mixed effects or no effect on young tree density (Action 1213). One study in Canada found that removal of woody debris increased survival rate of planted trees (Action 1257), while one study in the USA found mixed effects of removing, chopping and burning woody debris on the size of planted trees (Action 1257).\n\nLogging trees within forests increased density and cover of understory plants in five studies, while five studies found no effect or mixed effects (Action 1273). Four studies found that logging increased species richness and diversity of understory plants, while three studies found no effect (Action 1273).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, several alternative methods to herbicides can be used to control vegetation competition for seedlings and young trees:\n\nPhysical/Mechanical Methods: Manual control and removal of midstorey and ground-level vegetation including mowing, chaining, and cutting can be used for vegetation management (Action 337). Cutting and mowing can be specifically applied to control problematic herbaceous plants (Action 3106). Rotovating can be used to control grass vegetation (Action 1648). Physical damage to problematic plants through methods like ploughing and disking has been studied, with some studies finding that managed plots using cutting, disking and herbicide applications contained more non-planted tree seedlings than unmanaged plots (Action 3097).\n\nManual Weeding: Selective hand weeding can be used to manage vegetation (Action 3714). This involves physically removing competing plants by hand rather than using chemical treatments.\n\nProtective Materials: Weed mats can be used to protect planted trees from vegetation competition (Action 1267). Adding mulch before or after seeding/planting can help control competing vegetation, with some studies finding that mulch increased cover of target plant species and increased seedling numbers (Action 3425).\n\nSite Preparation: Removing vegetation before seeding/planting can improve establishment conditions, with studies showing this increased germination rates of sown species and increased seedling numbers for some species (Action 3416).\n\nThese methods provide physical barriers, mechanical removal, or site preparation alternatives to chemical herbicide applications for managing vegetation competition around seedlings and young trees.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available action documents, several forest management interventions have been studied in Australia with documented benefits and impacts:\n\n**Tree Thinning in Forests and Woodlands:** Four studies in Australia found that thinning trees generally increased bat activity and diversity compared to unthinned forests (Action 991). Forest thinned up to 20 years previously had higher bat diversity than unthinned forest, though sites thinned more than 20 years previously did not differ. Forest thinned up to eight years previously or more than 20 years previously had higher bat activity than unthinned forest, but sites thinned 8-20 years previously did not differ. One study found the same bat species in thinned and unthinned forest, except for the chocolate wattled bat, which was not recorded in forests with unthinned regrowth.\n\n**Prescribed Fire Management:** Studies in Australia documented several effects of prescribed burning. In eucalyptus forest, selective burning resulted in fewer Eltham copper caterpillars in the spring following burning compared to before burning (Action 3877). Three studies in Australia found that prescribed burning in forest, open woodland and savanna had mixed effects on reptile populations (Action 3646). One study found that reptile abundance increased with time since burning, while others found similar reptile species richness in burned versus unburned areas. One study found that areas of woodland managed by burning and vegetation thinning had higher reptile species richness than unmanaged areas (Action 3655).\n\n**Burning Timing Effects:** One study in Australia found that in forest burned early in the dry season, northern brown bandicoot survival rate declined less than in forests burned late in the dry season (Action 2416).\n\n**Woody Debris Addition:** A randomised, replicated, controlled study from Australia found that brown treecreeper numbers were higher in plots with large amounts of dead wood added, compared to control plots or those with less debris added (Action 344).\n\n**Grazing Cessation:** Two studies in Australia examining the cessation of livestock grazing in forest, open woodland and savanna found mixed results for reptiles (Action 3511). Studies found that ungrazed and grazed areas had similar reptile species richness and diversity, though grazing had mixed effects on reptile abundance.\n\n**Combined Management Approaches:** Studies in Australia found that areas managed by burning in combination with vegetation cutting had mixed effects on reptile populations, with some showing similar abundance compared to burning only or unmanaged areas (Action 3655).",

One study found the same bat species in thinned and unthinned forest, except for the chocolate wattled bat, which was not recorded in forests with unthinned regrowth.\\n\\n**Prescribed Fire Management:** Studies in Australia documented several effects of prescribed burning. In eucalyptus forest, selective burning resulted in fewer Eltham copper caterpillars in the spring following burning compared to before burning (Action 3877). Three studies in Australia found that prescribed burning in forest, open woodland and savanna had mixed effects on reptile populations (Action 3646).
