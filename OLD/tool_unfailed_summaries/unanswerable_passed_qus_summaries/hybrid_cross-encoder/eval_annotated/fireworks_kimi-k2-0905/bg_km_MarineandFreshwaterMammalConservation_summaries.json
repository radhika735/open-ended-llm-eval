Several studies examined marine mammal education campaigns more broadly, with three before-and-after studies finding that educational whale-watching tours and exhibitions improved participants' willingness to support marine conservation, donate money, or cut fishing nets to save dolphins, but again these did not specifically address plastic litter ingestion by river dolphins in South America.",
