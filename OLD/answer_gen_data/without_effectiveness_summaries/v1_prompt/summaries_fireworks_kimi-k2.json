    "relevant_summary": "Based on evidence from various wildlife management studies, the most beneficial actions for reducing human-wildlife conflict with bears include:\n\n**Physical Barriers and Prevention Methods**:\n- Electric fencing has proven effective in excluding bears from accessing food sources and human-occupied areas. Studies found electric shock devices prevented black bears from accessing or damaging bird feeders, and electric fencing successfully excluded martens from buildings and prevented polar bear entry to compounds.\n- Preventing access to potential food sources and denning sites through secure waste management and physical barriers significantly reduces conflict situations.\n\n**Behavioral Modification Techniques**:\n- Conditioned taste aversion showed promising results, with studies finding that lacing foodstuffs with illness-inducing substances led to black bears avoiding these foods long-term.\n- Various deterrent methods including noise, pain deterrents, and chasing with dogs have mixed effectiveness - some studies showed reduced returns to urban areas while others found bears eventually returned.\n\n**Population Management - Translocation**:\n- Translocating problem bears shows limited success with significant drawbacks. Studies indicate that most translocated bears return to their original capture locations, often continuing nuisance behavior. Success rates are higher when bears are translocated as younger individuals over greater distances or across geographic barriers. However, survival rates are lower for translocated bears compared to non-translocated populations.\n\n**Supplementary Management**:\n- Diversionary feeding has been shown to reduce nuisance behavior by black bears, but this may create dependency issues.\n- Education programs alone have not demonstrated effectiveness in changing human behavior regarding bear-resistant garbage management.\n\nThe evidence suggests that preventing access to food sources through physical barriers combined with conditioned taste aversion offers the most reliable long-term solution, while translocation should be considered a last resort due to poor success rates and potential negative impacts on bear population survival.",
