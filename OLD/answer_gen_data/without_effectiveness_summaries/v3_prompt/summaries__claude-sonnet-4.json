    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, several approaches have been evaluated for reducing human-wildlife conflict with bears. Diversionary feeding showed positive results, with two before-and-after studies in the USA finding that diversionary feeding reduced nuisance behaviour by black bears. Electric barriers and shock devices proved effective, with a replicated, controlled study in the USA finding that electric shock devices prevented American black bears from accessing or damaging bird feeders. Conditioned taste aversion showed promise, with two studies in the USA finding that lacing foodstuffs with substances that induce illness led to these foods being avoided by coyotes and black bears. Scaring and deterrent methods had mixed effectiveness - two of four studies found that noise and pain deterrents did not prevent black bears from returning to urban areas, while the other two studies found that such actions did deter them from seeking food at human-occupied sites. Two of three studies found that chasing nuisance black bears with dogs caused them to stay away longer from human occupied areas. Translocation methods showed limited success, with studies finding that almost half of translocated 'nuisance' black bears returned to their capture locations, and that black bears were less likely to return if translocated as younger bears, over greater distances, or across geographic barriers. However, translocation also showed mixed results for conflict reduction, with some studies finding that most translocated bears returned to their capture area and continued to cause nuisance. Enforcement notices requiring appropriate dumpster use did not reduce garbage accessibility to black bears according to one study.",

Integrated aquaculture systems show promise, with studies finding that blue mussels can absorb waste from salmon farms and enhanced algal growth when placed adjacent to fish farms. Fallowing practices can help reduce pollution impacts, as a trial in Tasmania found that sediment community structure under Atlantic salmon cages became more similar to non-impacted sites over two fallowing cycles. Studies on leaving fallow periods during fish farming found that after a fallow period, abundances of pollution-indicator polychaete worms decreased, and invertebrate community composition became similar to that occurring before fish were added, though communities remained different from sites without fish farms. Cleaning wastewater before it enters the environment has shown some benefits, with one study finding that after input water began to be cleaned, cover of mosses characteristic of low nutrient levels increased and vascular plant biomass decreased. While specific actions like improving fish food and pellets to reduce aquaculture waste production and minimizing food waste at aquaculture systems are mentioned as potential strategies, no studies were found that directly evaluated their effectiveness on environmental impacts.",

    "relevant_summary": "For increasing soil organic carbon on loamy soils, multiple methods have proven effective. No-tillage and reduced tillage systems consistently increase soil organic carbon compared to conventional tillage, with all 12 studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA showing higher soil organic carbon under these systems. Five of six studies found increased soil organic matter or carbon when nitrogen or phosphorus fertilizers were applied, with one study showing higher carbon levels when NPK fertilizers were applied with straw than when applied alone. Applying manures and agricultural composts was effective, with four studies from India, Japan and the UK finding higher soil carbon levels when manures were applied. Cover crops also increased soil carbon levels, with studies from Denmark and Japan showing this effect, particularly when legumes were included. Converting to organic farming showed mixed results, with two replicated trials in Italy and the USA showing higher soil carbon levels in organically managed orchards, though one trial found lower soil carbon under organic management compared to alley cropping. Green manures also showed promise, with studies from India and Pakistan finding higher soil organic carbon when these were grown.\n\nFor reducing bat fatalities at wind turbines, several interventions have demonstrated effectiveness. Increasing the wind speed at which turbines become operational (cut-in speed) was the most consistently effective method, with 10 of 12 studies in the USA and Canada showing reduced bat fatalities. Preventing turbine blades from turning at low wind speeds (feathering) was also effective, with five of six studies in the USA and Canada showing fewer bat fatalities. Slowing the rotation of turbine blades at low wind speeds reduced bat fatalities in one study in Canada. Automatically reducing turbine blade rotation when bat activity is high resulted in fewer bat fatalities in studies from Germany and the USA. Ultrasonic deterrents showed mixed results, with three studies in the USA finding varying effectiveness depending on the species and signal type, ranging from 21-51% fewer fatalities in some cases to mixed effects in others.",
