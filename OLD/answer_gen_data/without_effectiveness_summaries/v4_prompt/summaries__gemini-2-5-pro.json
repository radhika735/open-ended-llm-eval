    "relevant_summary": "Studies have evaluated several actions to reduce human-wildlife conflict with bears. Two before-and-after studies in the USA found that providing diversionary feeding for black bears reduced their nuisance behaviour (2323). A study in the USA found that using conditioned taste aversion by lacing foodstuffs with substances that induce illness led to black bears avoiding these foods (2384). A replicated, controlled study in the USA found that electric shock devices on bird feeders prevented American black bears from accessing or damaging them (2346). While two of four studies in the USA found that noise and pain deterrents were not effective in preventing black bears from returning to urban areas, two other studies found that such actions did deter them from seeking food at human-occupied sites (2347). Additionally, two of three studies in the USA and Canada found that chasing nuisance black bears with dogs caused them to stay away from human-occupied areas for longer (2347). In contrast, issuing enforcement notices for non-bear-proof dumpsters was not found to be effective in reducing garbage accessibility to black bears in a US study (2345), and translocation of problem bears was often unsuccessful, with many returning to their original capture locations and some having lower survival rates (2336).",
