    "query": "What are the most effective interventions for reducing bat fatalities at wind turbines?",
    "answer": "To reduce bat fatalities at wind turbines, combined curtailment (raising cut-in speed during peak activity) with thermal cameras has proven most effective, cutting deaths by up to 93 % while minimizing energy loss. The best-documented strategy is smart curtailment, in which turbines are feathered at wind speeds below ~6.5 m s\u207b\u00b9 during the night-time hours and seasons of greatest bat activity; when paired with thermal cameras that let operators shut down machines within minutes of detecting a bat swarm, studies report fatality reductions of 60\u201393 % with an energy loss of only 1 % [action 970] [action 1960]. Automatically reducing turbine rotation when bat activity is high adds another layer of protection, further lowering collisions [action 971]. Complementary deterrent devices, such as ultrasound emitters, may provide additional safeguards when combined with curtailment [action 968]. Finally, slowing blade rotation at low wind speeds can reduce impact severity for any bats that do approach turbines [action 2939].",
