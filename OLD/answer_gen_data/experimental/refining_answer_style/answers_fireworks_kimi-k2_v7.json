    "query": "What are the most effective interventions for reducing bat fatalities at wind turbines?",
    "answer": "The most effective interventions for reducing bat fatalities at wind turbines involve operational changes including feathering turbine blades at low wind speeds, increasing cut-in speeds, and automatically adjusting turbine operations when bat activity is high.\n\nResearch demonstrates that preventing turbine blades from turning at low wind speeds through feathering significantly reduces bat fatalities, as this prevents the slow blade rotations that attract bats during periods of low wind when bats are most active. Additionally, increasing the wind speed at which turbines become operational - known as raising the cut-in speed - has proven highly effective, with ten out of twelve studies across the USA and Canada confirming substantial reductions in bat fatalities. The evidence also supports automatically reducing turbine blade rotation during periods of high bat activity, which has been shown to significantly reduce fatalities for all bat species combined. While slowing the rotation of turbine blades at low wind speeds shows promising results, the evidence base is currently smaller, making it \"likely to be beneficial\" rather than definitively proven. These operational changes are much more effective than other potential interventions like using ultrasound or radar to deter bats, which have shown unknown or no evidence for effectiveness.",
