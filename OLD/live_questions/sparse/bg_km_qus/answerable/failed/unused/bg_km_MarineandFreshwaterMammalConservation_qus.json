    "question": "What actions can be taken to reduce predation by marine mammals at aquaculture systems?",
    "answer": "Evidence was found for three interventions. Replacing anti-predator nets more frequently was found in one study to result in fewer salmon losses to harbour seal predation (2774). The use of acoustic deterrent devices was found to reduce predation in four of six studies, but this action has a trade-off due to potential harms to both target and non-target species (2775). Translocating fur seals away from salmon farms was found to be likely ineffective as the majority of seals returned to the farms (2776).",

    "answer": "Based on the evidence, some gear modifications are more effective than others. Increasing the visual detectability of fishing gear (2805) and using acoustically reflective gear materials (2807) are both rated as 'Likely to be beneficial' for reducing mammal interactions or entanglements. In contrast, attaching acoustically reflective objects like bead chains to gear was found to be 'Unlikely to be beneficial' as it did not reduce dolphin entanglements in one study (2806). Using acoustic devices on gear has a 'Trade off between benefit and harms' as they can reduce entanglements but may also deter mammals from important habitats (2808).",

Introducing a 'code of conduct' for releasing trapped dolphins, along with avoiding them during fishing, resulted in lower mortality of short-beaked common dolphins (2829). Another study found that introducing 'move-on rules' if dolphins were encountered also led to fewer dolphins being killed (2790). Deploying fishing nets 4.5 m below the water surface was also found to reduce dolphin entanglements in one study (2793).",

    "question": "How does the evidence for mitigating seal predation differ between aquaculture systems and wild fisheries?",
    "answer": "For aquaculture systems, one study found that frequently replacing anti-predator nets reduced salmon losses to harbour seals (2774), and four of six studies found acoustic devices reduced predation by grey and harbour seals (2775). Translocating fur seals from salmon farms was found to be ineffective as most returned (2776). For wild fisheries, modifying fishing pots with exclusion devices reduced the number of grey and harbour seals entering or getting trapped and also reduced damage to catches (2822). In contrast, one study found that installing a 'cork line' barrier (2824) and another found switching off artificial lights (2825) did not deter harbour seals from feeding on salmon at a wild fishery.",
