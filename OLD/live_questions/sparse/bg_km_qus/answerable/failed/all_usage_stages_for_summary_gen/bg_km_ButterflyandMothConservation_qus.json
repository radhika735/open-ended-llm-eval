Converting to organic farming generally resulted in greater abundance of butterflies and moths compared to conventional farms (3907). On a landscape scale, farms with a greater proportion of semi-natural habitat (3910) or with smaller fields (3974) had higher butterfly abundance. At the field level, planting nectar flower mixtures or wildflower strips (3932) and creating floristically enhanced grass margins (3982) were found to increase butterfly abundance more than unenhanced grass margins or cropped areas.",

    "question": "What are the alternative management strategies to prescribed burning for maintaining open grassland habitats for butterflies?",
    "answer": "Alternatives to prescribed burning for maintaining open grasslands include mowing and grazing, though their effects vary. Mowing regimes can be altered; for example, one study found mowing in November did not reduce moth caterpillar abundance, unlike August mowing (3945). Grazing is another key alternative. Employing rough grazing on semi-natural habitats like fens and dunes was found to increase the abundance of some butterfly species, such as the large copper (3944). However, completely ceasing management is also an option; abandoning grazing can benefit some species but may lead to a decline in grassland specialists as succession progresses (3956). Similarly, ceasing mowing can lead to higher abundance of some butterflies, but lower abundance of others (3957).",

    "answer": "Improving habitat connectivity provides several benefits for butterfly populations. Restoring connectivity between habitat patches has been found to increase the abundance of multiple species, including Karner blue, marsh fritillary, and regal fritillary (3934). It also encourages movement, with studies showing common buckeye and variegated fritillary butterflies were more likely to move between connected patches (3934). Retaining existing connectivity is also important, as it helped Alcon large blue populations persist in low-quality habitat patches and encouraged common buckeye butterflies to colonize more distant patches (3832).",

Studies found that less intensively managed grasslands had a higher abundance of butterflies and moths compared to conventionally managed ones (3958). Specifically, reducing grazing intensity by lowering stocking densities of sheep or cattle (3959), or by removing livestock seasonally (3960), has been shown to increase the abundance of butterflies and caterpillars.

Converting to organic farming, which excludes synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, has been found in seven of eleven studies to result in greater species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths compared to conventional farms (3907). Even without full conversion, generally reducing the use of pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers leads to greater species richness and abundance (3897). More targeted actions are also effective; leaving field headlands unsprayed with herbicides and insecticides resulted in greater butterfly richness and abundance in four of five studies (3898), and restricting specific herbicides like glyphosate also led to higher butterfly richness and abundance in field margins (3896).",

Clearing or opening patches in forests has been found to increase the abundance and species richness of butterflies, though some studies note a decline in richness over the first few years after clearing (3938). Coppicing woodland, a traditional management technique, also had a higher abundance of butterflies in some studies compared to unmanaged woodland (3939). Thinning trees, which reduces canopy density, was found to increase butterfly species richness and abundance compared to unmanaged woodland, especially when combined with other actions like mulching (3940). While prescribed burning in forests can also increase butterfly richness and abundance (3877), these other methods provide viable alternatives.",

A majority of studies found that farms and habitats managed under AES had higher species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths compared to conventionally managed land (3915). However, some studies found similar or even lower abundance and richness, particularly when comparing AES grasslands to unmanaged, abandoned grasslands.

Uncultivated margins that were wider or managed without summer cutting also showed benefits for butterfly abundance and richness (3981). Conversely, creating beetle banks was found to support lower butterfly species richness than hedgerows (3927), and results for uncropped cultivated margins were mixed (3923).",

    "question": "What does the evidence show about the timeframe for butterfly and moth population response to woodland coppicing or clearing?",
    "answer": "The response occurs over several years and varies over time. After clearing patches in forests, one study found butterfly species richness and abundance declined over the first three years, while another found heath fritillary abundance was greatest in patches cleared 2–4 years ago (3938). For coppicing, studies found higher butterfly abundance in woodland coppiced 2, 2-4, 5-7, or 12-15 years ago compared to woodland coppiced more than 15 years ago. Species richness was greater in woodland coppiced two years ago than in older coppice (3939). This suggests an initial benefit that peaks within a few years and then declines as the woodland regrows.",

    "answer": "Several alternatives to field margins exist for increasing in-field habitat heterogeneity. Reducing field sizes, which increases the density of edge habitat, has been found to increase the species richness and abundance of butterflies on farms (3974). Creating beetle banks in the middle of fields can provide habitat, although one study found they supported a lower abundance of butterflies than hedgerows (3927). Providing temporary set-aside areas can also increase butterfly species richness compared to cereal fields, with second-year set-aside showing greater benefits than first-year (3980).",

Haying was found to support a higher abundance of prairie specialist butterflies compared to prescribed burning, although generalist species were more abundant in burned areas (3945, 3882). Another study found specialist butterfly abundance was higher in prairies managed by haying in some areas, and by grazing in others (3908).

For coffee plantations, shade-grown systems consistently supported greater caterpillar abundance and richness than sun-grown monocultures (3931). In vineyards, reduced chemical use and encouraging native plants were associated with higher butterfly abundance or richness (3919). The evidence for orchards is mixed; one study found abandoned orchards had higher butterfly abundance than managed ones, while another found unmanaged orchards supported more caterpillar diversity than commercial ones (3917). Growing native trees within coffee plantations did not show a clear benefit over non-native shade trees in one study (3920).",

    "answer": "Several actions can improve agricultural field boundaries for butterflies and moths. Margins can be created by leaving them uncultivated, with wider margins and less frequent cutting providing greater benefits (3981). A more proactive approach is to sow grass buffer strips, which are most effective when they are wider and floristically enhanced with wildflowers (3982, 3932). For existing hedgerows, management can be improved by reducing cutting frequency to every 2-3 years, avoiding summer cutting, filling in gaps, and creating a more complex structure, for instance by retaining trees or creating scalloped edges (3975).",

Studies on converting to organic farming, which eliminates synthetic chemical inputs, found that organic farms typically had greater species richness of butterflies and moths than conventionally managed farms (3907). Similarly, a general reduction in the frequency or amount of pesticide, herbicide, or fertiliser application was found to increase butterfly and moth species richness in a range of agricultural landscapes (3897). More specifically, restricting the use of certain herbicides like glyphosate on field margins also resulted in greater butterfly species richness compared to sprayed margins (3896).",

Several studies comparing mowing and grazing on semi-natural grasslands found they could support similar butterfly species richness, although some specific mowing or grazing regimes were found to be better than others (3908). Prescribed fire is another alternative, but studies in US prairies found that burned areas had lower butterfly species richness than rotationally grazed pastures and lower abundance of some specialist butterflies compared to hayed (mown) prairies (3882, 3945). Therefore, mowing or haying appears to be a common and often effective alternative to grazing for maintaining butterfly communities (3908, 3945).",
