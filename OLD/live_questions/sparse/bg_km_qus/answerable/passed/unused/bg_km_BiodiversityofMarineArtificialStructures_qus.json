    "question": "How do the effects of creating hole habitats versus pit habitats on intertidal artificial structures compare for biodiversity?",
    "answer": "Both creating hole habitats (>50 mm) and pit habitats (1\u201350 mm) can increase combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness and/or diversity on intertidal artificial structures (3467, 3475). Studies on hole habitats found they supported species absent from other surfaces and increased diversity/richness, but two studies reported they did not increase overall invertebrate abundance (3467). Studies on pit habitats also found they supported species absent from other surfaces and increased richness/diversity, with some studies showing increased invertebrate abundance while others found mixed effects or no effect (3475).",

In Israel, using ECOncrete\u2122 (sometimes with added habitats like grooves and holes) altered community composition, increased species richness/diversity, and had mixed effects on fish and invertebrate abundance (3470). In the UK, using quarried rock instead of concrete had mixed effects on species richness depending on the site, while different recycled-cement concretes also had mixed effects on richness but did not alter community composition (3470).

Thirteen studies found that created rock pools supported different communities and species absent from other surfaces (3476).

For large swimthroughs, studies report they supported fish species absent from other surfaces, increased fish richness and abundance, and were used by juvenile lobsters and groupers (3456). In contrast, for intertidal structures, studies on small swimthroughs (\u2264100 mm) found no change in mobile invertebrate community composition, richness or diversity, but did find an increase in abundance (3468).

    "answer": "Evidence exists for creating pits, holes, and grooves, but not for crevices. Three studies found that creating hole habitats (>50 mm), often with other features, altered community composition and, in two studies, increased species richness (3434). Two studies found that creating groove habitats (1\u201350 mm) altered community composition and had mixed effects on abundance (3448). One study found that creating pit habitats (1\u201350 mm), in combination with other features, altered community composition and increased diversity (3455). In contrast, no studies were found that evaluated the effect of creating crevice habitats (>50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures (3454).",

    "question": "What biodiversity outcomes have been observed from interventions on intertidal artificial structures in Australian estuaries?",
    "answer": "Studies in Australian estuaries have shown varied outcomes. Creating 'rock pools' (3476) and hole habitats (3467) successfully increased species richness and supported species not found on unmodified surfaces. Transplanting organisms like oysters also supported species absent elsewhere but had mixed effects on richness and abundance (3472). In contrast, creating short flexible habitats altered community composition but was found to decrease richness at low tide in one study (3459), and creating grooves did not increase richness (3473). Other actions, such as reducing the slope of structures (3461) and using different rock types (3469), produced mixed results.",

    "question": "What are the effects of creating protrusions, ridges, or ledges on mobile invertebrate abundance on artificial marine structures?",
    "answer": "The available evidence comes primarily from intertidal structures. Creating large protrusions (>50 mm) (3463) and large ridges or ledges (>50 mm) (3465) on intertidal structures was found to increase the abundance of limpets and/or mussels. Conversely, one study on small ridges or ledges (1\u201350 mm) found they supported lower mobile invertebrate abundance than the grooves created between them (3464). When small protrusions, ridges, or ledges were created in combination with grooves, studies found mixed effects on the abundance of various invertebrates, with outcomes dependent on factors like habitat size, shore level, and location (3474). No evidence was found for the isolated effects of these features on mobile invertebrates on subtidal structures.",

    "question": "Which habitat creation interventions most consistently alter community composition on subtidal artificial structures?",
    "answer": "Creating hole habitats (>50 mm) appears to be one of the most consistent interventions, with three studies finding it altered the overall community composition (3434). Creating textured surfaces (\u22641 mm) also showed consistent effects, altering community composition in two out of three studies (3449). Using environmentally-sensitive materials, often with added habitat features, altered community composition in six of eleven studies (3470). Other actions such as creating grooves (3448) or long flexible habitats (3451) also altered community composition but have been tested in fewer studies. Creating small adjoining cavities (3436) or short flexible habitats (3450) had mixed effects.",
