    "question": "In restored forest areas, what are some alternatives to using herbicides for controlling competing vegetation after tree planting, and how effective are they?",
    "answer": "Alternatives to herbicides exist with varied effectiveness. Mechanical removal of understory vegetation was found to have no effect on planted seedlings in five studies, though one found it increased seedling biomass and another found it increased growth rate (1256). Covering the ground with plastic mats decreased the cover of herbaceous plants and grasses in one study (1239). Using straw as a ground cover was found to increase the growth rate of planted trees and shrubs (1266). However, weed mats had no effect on seedling height in another study (1267). For comparison, using herbicides after planting was found to decrease plant species richness and diversity in one study (1241).",

    "question": "What evidence exists regarding the effectiveness of legal frameworks and public engagement initiatives for forest conservation?",
    "answer": "The evidence base for these interventions is limited. No evidence was found for the effects of raising public awareness through campaigns, providing education programmes, providing legal protection from development, or adopting protected species legislation (1157, 1158, 1169). However, two site comparison studies in Nigeria and Iran found that legal protection of forests increased tree species richness, diversity, and the density of young trees, while a study in Mexico found no effect on seed density and diversity (1233).",

    "question": "What are the documented negative impacts of timber harvesting activities, such as thinning or logging, on non-vascular plants in forests?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests that timber harvesting can be harmful to non-vascular plants. Three of four studies on thinning found it decreased the abundance and species richness of epiphytic plants (1212). Two of three studies on logging found it decreased epiphytic plant abundance and fern fertility (1270). Additionally, one study found that logging after a wildfire decreased the species richness and diversity of mosses (1234).",

    "question": "What management actions are available to aid forest recovery after a wildfire, and what is known about their effectiveness?",
    "answer": "Several actions have been studied. Thinning trees after a wildfire showed mixed results: two studies in Spain found it increased plant species richness, while one study in the USA found it decreased plant biomass (1234). Sowing tree seeds was found to be likely ineffective or harmful, with studies showing it decreased native species numbers and tree seedling density (1236). Removing burned trees was found to increase total plant species richness in two studies (1237). No evidence was found for the effects of planting trees after a wildfire (1235).",

    "answer": "The effectiveness of community-based forest management appears to vary geographically. In studies from Ethiopia and Nepal, forest cover increased more in community-managed forests than in other forests (1152). In contrast, a study in Colombia found that deforestation rates in community-managed forests were not different from rates in forests not under community management or in uninhabited national parks (1152).",
