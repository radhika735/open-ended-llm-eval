    "question": "What are the effects on butterflies and moths of different methods for managing linear features like road verges and power lines?",
    "answer": "Management of linear features like road verges and power lines significantly affects butterfly and moth communities. For road verges, altering mowing regimes to be less frequent was found to increase butterfly and moth richness, diversity, and abundance (3841). Restoring or maintaining species-rich grassland along verges also resulted in higher butterfly richness and abundance compared to verges dominated by non-native vegetation (3854). For land under power lines, management by mechanical cutting led to higher species richness and abundance of butterflies compared to unmanaged land. The time since management was also important, with butterfly abundance often peaking 2-4 years after clearance (3855).",

However, a negative impact was recorded in an Australian study where there were fewer Eltham copper caterpillars after a fire (3877).

Clearing or opening patches in forests has been shown to increase the abundance of several butterfly species, including the high brown fritillary and small pearl-bordered fritillary (3938). Coppicing woodland, a traditional management technique, also increases the abundance of butterflies like the heath fritillary compared to unmanaged woodland (3939). Thinning trees within forests, which reduces tree density, has been found in several US and Finnish studies to increase the species richness and abundance of butterflies compared to unmanaged woodland (3940). For comparison, prescribed burning in forests has also been shown to increase butterfly species richness and abundance (3877).",

Similarly, three controlled studies in the UK found that removing cattle or sheep from grasslands during the summer or winter resulted in a higher abundance of butterflies and caterpillars than year-round grazing (3960).

    "question": "To benefit butterflies on productive grasslands, how does reducing livestock density compare with seasonal livestock removal or reducing mowing frequency?",
    "answer": "Reducing livestock stocking densities has been found to increase species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths in multiple studies (3959). Reducing grazing intensity by seasonal removal of livestock has also been shown to increase the abundance of butterflies and caterpillars (3960). Reducing the cutting frequency of grasslands from multiple cuts to one per year has shown more mixed results; some studies found higher species richness of butterflies and other pollinators, while others found similar abundance of butterflies compared to more frequently cut meadows (3961).",

    "answer": "Planting new hedges provides significant benefits, with studies showing that established hedgerows have higher species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths compared to open fields or in-field beetle banks (3976). Managing existing hedgerows also provides benefits. Actions such as cutting hedgerows less frequently (every 2-3 years), allowing incremental growth, or maintaining a complex structure with trees have been shown to increase the abundance of adult butterflies, moths, their caterpillars, and the eggs of specific species like the brown hairstreak (3975).",

Set-aside areas can support greater butterfly species richness than cereal fields, though some studies found no difference compared to other farm habitats (3980). In the UK, beetle banks were found to have similar caterpillar abundance to other field-edge habitats but lower butterfly abundance than hedgerows (3927). Similarly, uncropped cultivated margins showed inconsistent results, with some studies finding no significant increase in butterfly or moth richness compared to conventional farms (3923).",

    "question": "What are the potential benefits and negative consequences of abandoning management on grasslands for butterfly and moth populations?",
    "answer": "Abandoning grassland management can have both positive and negative effects. A potential benefit is an increased abundance of certain species; some studies found that grasslands abandoned for 1-25 years had a higher abundance of some butterflies and moths than grazed or mown grasslands (3956, 3957). However, negative consequences are also well-documented, including a long-term decline in species richness, a shift in community composition towards generalist or woodland species, and the local extinction of specialist grassland species like the large blue and silver-studded blue (3956, 3957).",

    "answer": "Butterfly and moth communities can respond to forest management over various timescales. Following clearing or thinning, butterfly abundance and richness can increase within 1-4 years (3940, 3938). However, the optimal conditions may be short-lived, with butterfly abundance in cleared patches peaking 2-4 years post-management and declining thereafter (3938). Similarly, coppiced woodlands show higher butterfly abundance 2-7 years after cutting compared to older coppice (>15 years) (3939). Longer-term forest restoration can take much longer; one study found a restored forest's butterfly community only resembled that of a remnant forest after 54 years (3936).",

    "question": "In European forests, how do the effects of coppicing and clearing patches compare for butterfly and moth communities?",
    "answer": "Both coppicing and clearing patches in European forests can benefit butterflies, but effects differ. In the UK, coppiced woodland was found to have greater butterfly species richness than unmanaged woodland, and higher abundance of species like the heath fritillary (3939). However, clearing patches in forests was also found to increase butterfly species richness and abundance compared to unmanaged or even coppiced areas, although moth richness could be lower (3938). The age since management is important, with studies for both actions showing that abundance can be highest a few years after the intervention (3938, 3939).",

Several studies report that both translocated (3909, 3911) and captive-bred (3914) populations have persisted for years or even decades, often increasing in abundance. However, other attempts have failed, with populations dying out within a few years or requiring continuous releases to be sustained (3909, 3914). A review across the UK and Ireland found that while 25% of reintroduction projects survived for at least three years, 38% died out in that time, and only a small minority were known to have survived for over 10 years (3909, 3914).",

    "question": "What are the most effective ways to manage field margins in arable landscapes for increasing butterfly abundance?",

Sown wildflower strips or nectar flower mixtures consistently show higher butterfly abundance compared to conventional field margins, unsown margins, cropped fields, or standard grass margins (3932). Standard grass margins (3982) and uncultivated margins (3981) generally have lower butterfly abundance than those sown with wildflowers. Leaving headlands unsprayed with herbicides and insecticides has also been shown to increase butterfly abundance compared to sprayed headlands (3898).",

At a landscape level, areas with smaller fields generally support higher species richness and abundance of butterflies and burnet moths than areas with larger fields (3974). At the field level, the width of margins is important. Studies have found that wider grass margins (3982) and wider uncultivated margins (3981) support a greater species richness, diversity, and abundance of butterflies and moths than narrower margins.",
