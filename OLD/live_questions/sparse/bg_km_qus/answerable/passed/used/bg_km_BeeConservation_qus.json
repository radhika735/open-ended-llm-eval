    "question": "What are the most effective ways to manage uncropped field margins on European farmland to support bumblebees?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests that sowing uncropped field margins is more effective than leaving them to naturally regenerate. Sowing margins with a native wild flower seed mix was shown in five UK trials to support a higher abundance and often species richness of foraging bumblebees compared to cropped or grassy margins (19). Similarly, four trials showed that margins sown with agricultural nectar and pollen mixes (e.g., perennial legumes) attract significantly more foraging bumblebees than grassy or cropped margins (18). In contrast, evidence for uncropped grassy margins is mixed (14), and the value of naturally regenerated margins can be inconsistent and reliant on weed species (20).",

    "question": "How do different management approaches for uncropped arable field margins in Europe, such as sowing mixes versus natural regeneration, compare in their benefits for bumblebees?",
    "answer": "Sowing margins with an agricultural nectar and pollen mix, often containing perennial legumes, attracts significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated margins (18). However, the value of these sown margins can degrade and may require re-sowing every few years (18). Sowing with native wild flowers has also been shown to support a higher abundance and richness of foraging bumblebees compared to naturally regenerated margins, with perennial leguminous herbs being particularly important for long-tongued species (19). In contrast, while naturally regenerated margins can support more bumblebees than cropped areas, their value for bees can be inconsistent from year to year and may depend on the presence of weed species like thistles (20).",

    "answer": "Evidence shows that the attractiveness of phacelia to wild bees varies geographically. Across ten trials in Europe and North America, all but one found that sowing phacelia on farmland attracted substantial numbers of wild bees, especially bumblebees (17). However, a replicated trial conducted in Greece found that phacelia was not very attractive to wild bees in that specific location (17).",

    "question": "What are the documented benefits of controlling or excluding competitor or predator species from bee nesting sites?",
    "answer": "There is evidence that excluding other species can benefit bees. One trial showed that excluding ants from solitary bee nests increased the production of offspring (46). Another trial found that using a sticky barrier to exclude introduced European earwigs from solitary bee nest boxes led to increased use of the boxes by native bees (44). At a larger scale, an attempt to eradicate invasive buff-tailed bumblebees in Japan resulted in an increase in the numbers of two native bumblebee species, even though the eradication itself was unsuccessful (38).",

    "question": "What actions can be taken to support wild bee populations in urban areas and along infrastructure corridors like roads and power lines?",
    "answer": "In urban gardens and parks, planting native plants or specific bee forage has been found to increase the number of wild bee species and individuals (1). Practising lower-intensity gardening, with less tidiness and pesticide use, was also found to support more bumblebee species in one UK study (2). Along infrastructure corridors, restoring road verges with native prairie vegetation supported more bees and a greater diversity of species than frequently mown grass verges in one US trial (30). Similarly, a trial found more bee species under power lines managed as scrub compared to those managed as annually mown grassland (31).",

    "question": "What are the documented outcomes and challenges of rearing bumblebees in captivity for reintroduction?",
    "answer": "Twenty-two trials have documented methods for captive rearing of bumblebees, with some success in inducing declining North American species like B. vagans and B. terricola to rear adults (50). Challenges in captivity include the importance of pollen diet, as fresh pollen led to better queen survival and larger colonies than dried pollen (50). When reintroduced to the wild, the success of laboratory-reared colonies is variable. Of four trials that monitored colonies until new queens were produced, two found very low or zero queen production, while two had good numbers (52). A significant challenge upon release is parasitism by cuckoo bees, with rates reported as high as 79% in one UK trial (52). There is currently no evidence available on the effects of reintroducing just the queens (51).",
