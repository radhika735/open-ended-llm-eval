    "question": "When managing pastureland for natural pest control, is it better to delay mowing/grazing or to use grazing instead of cutting?",
    "answer": "The evidence suggests neither action is clearly beneficial for natural enemies. Delaying mowing or grazing has 'Unknown effectiveness'; one study found fewer predatory spiders, while others found no change or mixed effects on insect predators (727). Using grazing instead of cutting is rated 'Likely to be ineffective or harmful', with studies finding mixed or no effects on natural enemy populations (885).",

    "question": "What are the overall effects of altering pesticide application strategies to benefit natural enemies?",
    "answer": "Altering pesticide strategies can benefit natural enemies. Delaying herbicide use (774) and altering the timing of insecticide use (723) have both been shown to increase natural enemy numbers in some studies. Switching to a threshold-based spraying regime can also increase natural enemies, though effects may be temporary. This approach consistently leads to fewer pesticide applications and can lower production costs without necessarily reducing profit (750).",
