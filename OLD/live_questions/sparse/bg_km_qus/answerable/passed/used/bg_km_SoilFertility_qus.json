    "question": "What are the documented benefits and harms of adopting reduced tillage systems on European farms?",
    "answer": "Evidence from Europe and other regions indicates that reduced tillage can have both positive and negative effects. Benefits include increased numbers of microbes and higher soil organic carbon and matter (906). However, a potential harm is higher soil compaction under reduced tillage (906). A related action, delaying ploughing until spring, was found in two European studies to reduce soil loss and nitrate leaching (712).",

    "question": "How do the effects of growing cover crops between crop rows compare to growing them when a field is empty?",
    "answer": "Both methods of growing cover crops show benefits for soil. Growing cover crops between main crop rows (living mulches) was found to increase bacterial numbers and reduce soil loss (897). Growing cover crops when fields are empty improved soil structure, reduced nitrate leaching, and increased soil carbon levels in several studies (898). One study on empty-field cover crops also found more diverse nematode communities (898).",
