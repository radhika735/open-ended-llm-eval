    "question": "How does the evidence for using acoustic devices to reduce human-wildlife conflict at aquaculture systems compare to their use on fishing gear?",
    "answer": "Both interventions are rated as a 'Trade off between benefit and harms'. At aquaculture systems, four of six studies found that acoustic devices reduced predation on caged salmon by seals and sea lions (2775). For wild fisheries, acoustic devices on fishing gear were found to reduce damage to fish catches and/or nets in five of six studies (2808). While effective for reducing conflict, both interventions carry the risk of causing hearing damage or excluding mammals from important habitats.",

    "question": "How does the evidence for using acoustically reflective materials on fishing gear compare to attaching acoustically reflective objects for reducing marine mammal entanglement?",
    "answer": "Using fishing gear made from acoustically reflective materials is rated as 'Likely to be beneficial'. Two out of three controlled studies found that nets made from iron-oxide or barium sulfate resulted in fewer entanglements of harbour porpoises (2807). In contrast, attaching acoustically reflective objects like metallic bead chains to gear is rated 'Unlikely to be beneficial', as one controlled study found this method did not reduce dolphin entanglements (2806).",
