    "question": "What are the effects on butterfly and moth communities of opening up forest canopies through clearing, coppicing, or thinning?",
    "answer": "Opening up forest canopies has shown varied effects. Clearing patches in forests was found to increase butterfly species richness and abundance, but could lower moth species richness (3938). Similarly, thinning trees (often combined with other management like prescribed burning) increased both species richness and abundance of butterflies in coniferous woodland (3940). Coppicing woodland also increased the species richness and abundance of some butterflies, like the heath fritillary, but studies found it could lower the richness and abundance of macro-moths when compared to mature forest (3939).",

    "question": "How does rotational burning compare to leaving unburned patches during prescribed fires for butterfly populations in US prairies?",
    "answer": "Evidence from US prairies suggests that leaving unburned patches during prescribed fires may be more consistently beneficial than rotational burning. Leaving unburned areas was found to increase the abundance of Karner blue butterflies and was beneficial for six out of nine specialist butterfly species (3879). In contrast, rotational burning had mixed effects; while some species like the regal fritillary could have higher abundance, the abundance of prairie specialists was often higher in areas that had not been burned for several years, and some grass-skipper populations showed stronger declines in rotationally burned sites compared to unmanaged areas (3883).",

    "question": "What actions are available to mitigate the negative impacts of artificial lighting on moth populations?",
    "answer": "Several modifications to artificial lighting can reduce its negative impact on moths. Studies found that using 'warmer' colored lights, such as red or yellow, attracted fewer moths than conventional, UV, or blue lights (3906). Reducing light intensity also proved effective, with low-intensity lights attracting fewer moths than high-intensity ones (3902). Additionally, using shielded \"full cut-off\" lights, which prevent light from scattering upwards and outwards, was shown to attract fewer individual moths and species compared to conventional unshielded lights (3904).",

    "question": "What does the evidence say about the long-term success of re-establishing butterfly populations through translocation or captive-release?",
    "answer": "The evidence for long-term success is mixed. While some re-establishment projects have been successful, with populations persisting for over 28 years after translocation outside the native range (3911) or release of captive-bred individuals (3914), failure is also common. Reviews across the UK and Ireland found that only 8% of translocated and captive-bred butterfly populations were known to have survived for more than 10 years, with 38% dying out within three years (3909, 3914). Some translocated populations died out within a year (3911), while others required repeated supplementation to survive (3909, 3914).",

    "question": "What actions can be taken in urban environments to support butterfly and moth populations?",
    "answer": "Several actions show potential benefits for butterflies and moths in urban areas. Protecting undeveloped land like native forests and grasslands has been found to support higher butterfly species richness than urban parks or non-native plantations (3836). Altering mowing regimes in greenspaces, such as mowing less frequently, can increase the species richness, diversity, and abundance of butterflies and moths (3841). Additionally, planting parks and gardens with appropriate native species has been shown in several studies to increase the species richness and abundance of both adult butterflies and caterpillars compared to areas with non-native plants (3842). Conversely, one study found that establishing 'green infrastructure' like green roofs resulted in lower butterfly species richness and abundance compared to urban parks (3837).",

    "question": "How do different methods of harvesting timber, such as selective logging and shelterwood harvesting, compare to clearcutting in their impact on moth diversity in US forests?",
    "answer": "Studies from the USA show that alternative timber harvesting methods have different impacts on moth diversity compared to clearcutting. Forests managed by shelterwood harvesting or thinning had higher or similar moth species richness to clearcut areas, and in one study moth richness recovered faster after shelterwood harvesting than clearcutting (3871, 3868). In contrast, forests harvested by single tree selection or group selection had a similar species richness of moths to clearcut forests, but all had lower richness than unharvested forest (3867, 3868).",
