    "question": "What actions can I take to specifically increase soil organic matter in my Mediterranean vineyard?",
    "answer": "Maintaining ground cover is a beneficial action, with multiple studies finding more organic matter in soils with ground cover [1367]. Adding compost is also beneficial, with twelve studies showing more organic matter in treated soils [1362]. Adding manure is likely beneficial, with five studies finding more organic matter [1363]. Using organic fertilizer instead of inorganic may also help, with eight studies showing an increase [1366].",

    "question": "What are the overall effects of growing cover crops in arable fields on Mediterranean farmland, considering soil health and crop production?",
    "answer": "The effects represent a trade-off. For soil health, growing cover crops is 'Beneficial', with studies showing increases in organic matter, nutrients like nitrogen, soil organisms, and soil aggregation, along with reduced erosion [1345]. However, for crop production, the action is 'Likely to be ineffective or harmful', with six studies finding lower cash crop yields and many others finding inconsistent or no differences [1351].",
