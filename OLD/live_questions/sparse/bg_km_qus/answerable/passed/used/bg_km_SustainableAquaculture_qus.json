    "question": "What methods are available to control disease and sea lice in Atlantic salmon farms?",
    "answer": "Several non-chemical methods to control disease and parasites have been studied. Fallowing farm sites was associated with lower sea lice numbers in a Scottish study (1026). Biological controls, such as using cleaner wrasse, were found to be as effective as chemical treatments for lice in one study, though another found them ineffective (738). Altering environmental conditions, such as using low-intensity lighting, also resulted in lower numbers of lice in a Norwegian study (741). Additionally, dietary changes, such as feeding salmon a probiotic, increased survival when exposed to disease-causing bacteria (732).",

    "question": "How do plant-based and bacterial protein alternatives to fish meal compare in terms of their effect on Atlantic salmon growth rates in Norway?",
    "answer": "Evidence from studies in Norway shows different outcomes for plant-based versus bacterial protein alternatives. Six studies found that including plant-based proteins in feed led to decreased salmon growth rates (924). In contrast, the evidence for bacterial protein is mixed; two studies found similar growth rates when replacing up to 25% of fish meal with bacterial protein, while another reported higher growth rates in salmon fed diets containing 18% and 36% bacterial protein compared to a fish meal control (918).",
