    "question": "For large captive carnivores like felids and bears, what are the most effective food-based enrichment strategies to reduce stereotypic behaviours?",
    "answer": "Several strategies are effective for reducing stereotypic behaviours. Providing bones was found to decrease these behaviours in lions and tigers (1902). Presenting food frozen in ice also decreased abnormal or stereotypic behaviours in bears and felids (1923). Similarly, hiding food reduced stereotypic pacing in leopard cats and black bears (1915), and presenting food inside objects decreased stereotypic behaviours in sloth and spectacled bears (1924).",

    "question": "How do the effects of scattering food throughout a primate's enclosure compare with hiding it in containers?",
    "answer": "Both methods appear to be beneficial for encouraging natural behaviours in primates. Scattering food was found to increase feeding and exploratory behaviours in rhesus macaques and gorillas, while also reducing abnormal behaviours and aggression in other species (1315). Hiding food in containers such as boxes or baskets was also found to increase activity levels and foraging behaviours in lemurs and gibbons (1316).",
