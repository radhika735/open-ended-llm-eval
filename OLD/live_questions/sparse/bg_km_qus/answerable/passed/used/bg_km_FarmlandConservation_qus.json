    "question": "In UK silage fields, what is the comparative evidence for leaving uncut strips of rye grass versus raising the mowing height to benefit wildlife?",
    "answer": "Leaving uncut strips of rye grass on silage fields is rated as 'Likely to be beneficial', with UK studies finding it increased bird numbers and invertebrate diversity (132). In contrast, raising the mowing height is rated as 'Unknown effectiveness'. While some UK studies found it increased Eurasian skylark productivity, other trials found it had no effect on foraging birds or invertebrates (138).",

    "question": "What are the documented benefits and potential drawbacks of reducing tillage on European farmland?",
    "answer": "Reducing tillage is considered 'Likely to be beneficial'. Numerous European studies found positive effects, including increased biomass and diversity of earthworms, greater abundance of some other invertebrates, increased numbers of some weed species, and benefits for birds like Eurasian skylarks (126). However, the evidence is not universally positive; twenty-six studies found that reducing tillage had negative, no, or inconsistent effects on the abundance and diversity of some invertebrates, plants, and mammals (126).",

    "question": "In European agricultural landscapes, what management techniques are available to restore or create species-rich wet meadows?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests several techniques are successful for restoring wet meadow plant communities. These include topsoil removal, the introduction of target plant species (e.g., through hay spreading), raising water levels, grazing, and mowing (119). Specifically, raising water levels in ditches or grassland has been found to increase bird numbers, invertebrates, and plant species that favour wet conditions (121).",

    "question": "To mitigate the impacts of intensive arable farming, what are the effects of taking land out of production, either as set-aside or by converting it to grassland?",
    "answer": "The effects differ significantly depending on the approach. Retaining set-aside areas is rated as 'Beneficial'. Studies showed higher use by various wildlife groups and increased nest survival for some birds compared to control fields (156). Conversely, converting arable land to permanent agricultural grassland has 'Unknown effectiveness', with multiple studies finding no clear benefit to wildlife. One study even documented a significant fall in grey partridge numbers following such a conversion (561).",
