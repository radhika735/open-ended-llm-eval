    "question": "When restoring grasslands, how do the outcomes of simply disturbing the soil before seeding compare to removing the topsoil entirely?",
    "answer": "Both methods of site preparation can benefit grassland restoration, but evidence suggests removing topsoil may have more comprehensive positive effects. Disturbing soil before sowing was found to increase plant and seedling species richness in one of two studies and increase forb cover in another study (3413). In contrast, removing topsoil before seeding was found to increase plant species richness, the species richness of sown plants, and the plant community's similarity to intact steppe. It also increased the survival of seedlings and plants in two studies (3415).",

    "question": "What are the documented effects of adding soil amendments like charcoal, sulphur, or carbon before or after seeding on grassland vegetation?",
    "answer": "Studies show varied effects from these soil amendments. One study found adding charcoal before sowing increased the cover of legumes but did not alter overall plant biomass or grass cover (3422). Adding sulphur before sowing reduced plant species richness and overall vegetation cover in one of two studies, although low amounts did increase the cover of some sown species (3428). Adding carbon to soil after sowing either reduced or did not alter the density of sown forb species, according to two studies in the USA (3433).",
