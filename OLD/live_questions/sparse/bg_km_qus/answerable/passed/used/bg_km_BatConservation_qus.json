    "question": "What evidence exists for the effectiveness of different strategies to combat white-nose syndrome in bats?",
    "answer": "There is limited but emerging evidence for treating bats directly, but no evidence for the effectiveness of most other preventative strategies. Two studies found that treating infected little brown bats with a probiotic bacterium increased survival in lab or field settings, although results on disease severity were mixed (2008). In contrast, no studies were found that evaluated the effects of vaccinating bats (1011), culling infected bats (1012), restricting human access to caves to reduce spread (1010), decontaminating equipment (2006), treating hibernacula environments (2007), or using captive breeding to supplement affected populations (2009).",

    "question": "To mitigate the impact of road and railway developments, what structures can be installed to help bats cross safely?",
    "answer": "A variety of crossing structures can be installed, with varying effectiveness. Underpasses and culverts are used by bats, though often a proportion of bats still cross over the road at traffic height (976). Overpasses are also used, but again, studies found many bats crossed elsewhere or below traffic height (977). One study found a green bridge was used by 97% of bats crossing a road (979). In contrast, bat gantries were found to be unlikely to be beneficial, with most bats crossing below them at a dangerous height (978). Additionally, maintaining existing roosts within road bridges (1966) or creating new roosting spaces (1967) can support bat populations affected by such infrastructure.",

    "question": "How do different methods for restricting public access to bat hibernation sites, such as gates versus fences, compare in their effects on bat populations?",
    "answer": "There is a trade-off between benefits and harms for restricting access. Installing gates at cave (999) or mine (1963) entrances can lead to fewer bats, fewer species, and altered flight behaviour. However, some studies found bat populations increased or stabilized after gates were installed (999). Regarding fences, one study in Spain found no difference in population growth or occupancy rates for bats in caves with or without fencing or gates (1991). In contrast, a study in the USA found that significantly more bats emerged from a cave after a gate was replaced with a fence, suggesting fences may be less disruptive in some contexts (1991).",

    "question": "To mitigate impacts from onshore wind farms, what are the most effective operational adjustments to turbines to reduce bat fatalities?",
    "answer": "Adjusting turbine operation based on wind speed is the most effective strategy with supporting evidence. Increasing the wind speed at which turbines become operational ('cut-in speed') was found to be 'beneficial', with ten of twelve studies showing it resulted in fewer bat fatalities (1960). Similarly, preventing turbine blades from turning at low wind speeds ('feathering') is also 'beneficial', with five of six studies finding it reduced fatalities (970). Slowing the rotation of blades at low wind speeds was also found to be 'likely to be beneficial' in one study (2939). Finally, automatically reducing turbine rotation when bat activity is high is 'likely to be beneficial', with two studies showing it led to fewer bat deaths (971).",

    "question": "Instead of culling, what alternative non-lethal actions can be used to manage human-bat conflicts?",
    "answer": "Several non-lethal alternatives to culling exist, although evidence for their impact on bat populations is limited. To prevent fruit bats from damaging orchards, non-lethal measures such as organic deterrent sprays, hanging plastic flags, and netting tree branches were found to be 'likely to be beneficial' in reducing fruit damage (1953). For managing rabies risk from vampire bats, alternatives like vaccinating livestock or humans have been suggested, but no studies were found that evaluated the effects of replacing culling with these methods on vampire bat populations (1950, 1979). Broader strategies include public education campaigns to dispel myths and improve perceptions of bats, which studies have found can result in more positive attitudes (1000).",

    "answer": "Evidence for the effectiveness of public education varies. Engaging farmers and landowners directly to manage land for bats is rated 'Unknown effectiveness' but showed positive results in one UK study, leading to management agreements and an increase in the greater horseshoe bat population (1936). Informing local communities about the negative impacts of hunting and associated disease risks also has 'Unknown effectiveness' but led to fewer hunters intending to hunt bats in a study in Ghana (1973, 1974). For general public education aimed at improving perception of bats, no studies were found that assessed the effect on human behaviour towards bats, so the effectiveness rating is 'No evidence found (no assessment)' (1000).",

    "question": "Besides avoiding illumination entirely, what alternative lighting strategies can be used to minimize disturbance to bats?",
    "answer": "While avoiding illumination of key habitats like commuting routes (2017) and foraging sites (2018) is rated 'Likely to be beneficial', some alternative strategies show promise. Using red lighting is also 'Likely to be beneficial', as studies found it resulted in higher activity for some bat species compared to white or green light and that more bats emerged from a roost under red light than white light (2021). Using ultraviolet filters on lights has 'Unknown effectiveness'; one study found it increased activity for soprano pipistrelles but not common pipistrelles compared to unfiltered light (1020). There is currently no evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of other strategies, such as using 'warm white' instead of 'cool' LED lights (2020), directing lighting away from bat habitats (2019), or using glazing treatments on buildings to reduce light spill (2022).",
