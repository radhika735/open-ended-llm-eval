    "question": "How do the effects of creating short versus long flexible habitats on subtidal artificial structures compare for fish and invertebrate populations in Australia?",
    "answer": "In Australian estuaries, creating long flexible habitats (>50 mm) had mixed effects on fish species richness and abundance (3451). In contrast, creating short flexible habitats (1-50 mm) had mixed effects on seahorse abundance and invertebrate community composition, but no effect on mobile invertebrate abundance in one study (3450, 3451).",

    "question": "What are the observed outcomes of transplanting or seeding organisms onto intertidal artificial structures in Australian estuaries?",
    "answer": "In Australian estuaries, transplanting oysters onto intertidal structures supported macroalgae, invertebrate, and fish species that were otherwise absent (3472). This action had mixed effects on overall species richness but increased mobile invertebrate richness. It also increased the abundance of oyster recruits and mobile invertebrates while decreasing barnacle abundance. Transplanting oysters and/or coralline algae did not increase overall fish abundance or richness (3472).",

    "answer": "Creating rock pools is a highly effective method, with nine studies showing they supported higher species richness and/or diversity (3476). Creating pits (3475) and combinations of grooves and small ridges/ledges (3474) also consistently increased species richness and/or diversity in multiple studies. Creating hole habitats (3467) and small protrusions (3462) were also found to be effective, each increasing richness in several studies.",

    "question": "In European marine environments, how do the outcomes of creating textured surfaces on intertidal structures vary?",
    "answer": "The outcomes vary by location and specific intervention. In the UK, creating textured surfaces along with using environmentally-sensitive material had mixed effects on species richness, depending on the texture type and site (3466). In the Netherlands, creating textured surfaces did not increase macroalgal abundance in two studies, and had mixed results for invertebrate abundance across four studies in the UK and Netherlands, with one study finding increased barnacle abundance (3466).",

    "question": "What actions can enhance fish communities on subtidal artificial structures?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests several actions can benefit fish communities. Creating small (\u2264100 mm) or large (>100 mm) swimthrough habitats can support fish species that are absent from structure surfaces without them, and large swimthroughs can increase overall fish richness and abundance (3436, 3456). Managing or restricting harvesting can lead to different fish community compositions and higher species richness (3457). Creating long flexible habitats can support fish species absent from other surfaces but may have mixed effects on richness and abundance (3451). Transplanting oysters can alter fish community composition and increase richness and diversity (3471).",
