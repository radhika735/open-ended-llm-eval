    "question": "How do long-term and temporary fishery closures compare in their effects on marine fish abundance?",
    "answer": "Evidence for a direct comparison is limited and neither action consistently showed strong positive effects across all species. Studies on long-term closures found mixed results, with some showing a higher abundance for only one of seven species monitored and others showing increases only for young salmon (2655). For temporary closures, one study found no increase in the biomass of spawning cod compared to fished areas (2664).",

    "question": "What are the observed effects on fish abundance and diversity from prohibiting most or all fishing within Marine Protected Areas?",
    "answer": "Prohibiting all fishing in 'no-take' Marine Protected Areas generally has positive effects. A majority of studies found higher fish species richness, diversity, and abundance compared to fished areas (2682). In contrast, MPAs where limited fishing exceptions are permitted showed less benefit, with studies finding lower species richness and similar or lower fish biomass and density compared to unprotected areas (2681). Ceasing just commercial fishing yielded mixed results on abundance and diversity (2667).",
