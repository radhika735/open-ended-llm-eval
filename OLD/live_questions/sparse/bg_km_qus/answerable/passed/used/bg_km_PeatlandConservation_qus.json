    "question": "To restore peatlands afforested for commercial forestry, how does simply cutting the trees compare to cutting trees and also rewetting the peat?",
    "answer": "Both actions are rated as likely to be beneficial. Cutting forest plantations alone was evaluated in four studies, which found it increased cover of some herbs like cottongrass and sedges, and increased overall plant species richness in fens (1731). Combining tree removal with rewetting has been evaluated in eleven studies and was found to change plant community composition, increase wetland-characteristic plants, and increase cover of Sphagnum moss and herbs like cottongrass. However, effects on overall plant richness were mixed in these studies (1732).",

    "question": "What does the evidence say about the effectiveness of creating or retaining habitat corridors for conserving peatland vegetation?",
    "answer": "The evidence base is very limited. No studies were found that evaluated the effects of creating habitat corridors in developed areas (1720), in areas of energy production or mining (1739), or across service corridors (1742). One study in a tropical peat swamp in a farmed area found that a forest corridor contained a high density of trees and 18-29 tree species, but the effectiveness is rated as unknown (1730).",
