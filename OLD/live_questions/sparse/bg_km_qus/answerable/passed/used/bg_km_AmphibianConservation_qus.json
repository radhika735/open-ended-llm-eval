    "question": "What actions can be taken to mitigate the impacts of roads on amphibian populations?",
    "answer": "Several actions have been studied. Installing culverts or tunnels, often with barrier fencing, can decrease road deaths (884, 756). Road closures during migration periods are also protective (842). Modifying gully pots can significantly reduce the number of newts that fall in (782). In contrast, using volunteers to assist amphibians across roads has been found to be unlikely to be beneficial, with populations still declining (784), and the effectiveness of warning signage is unknown (841).",

    "question": "How do different partial harvesting methods in USA forests compare to clearcutting in their impact on salamander populations?",
    "answer": "A meta-analysis found that partial harvesting, including shelterwood harvesting and thinning, resulted in smaller reductions in salamander populations than clearcutting (851, 852). Studies comparing specific methods found shelterwood harvesting resulted in similar or higher salamander abundance than clearcutting (851). However, other methods like leave-tree harvesting or harvesting in small groups did not result in higher salamander abundances compared to clearcutting (846, 844). Both partial harvesting and clearcutting typically decreased salamander abundance compared to unharvested forest (844, 846, 851, 852).",

    "answer": "Controlling fish can be beneficial for amphibians. Eliminating fish by drying out ponds or catching them has been shown to increase amphibian species numbers, abundance, and breeding success (826, 827). However, the methods used can have harmful side effects. Using rotenone to eliminate fish can cause mortality in frogs and negative effects in newts (828). Additionally, fish removal by catching is not always successful, with populations sometimes remaining or returning quickly (827).",

Success varies by species; for example, translocated wood frogs established breeding populations in 25-50% of ponds (856), while great crested newts established populations in 37-75% of cases (858). For captive-bred releases, one review found 41% of programmes showed evidence of breeding for multiple generations (871). However, success is not guaranteed, with some programmes, like those for the green and golden bell frog, failing to establish stable populations (872).",

Adding salt to ponds has been shown to keep frog populations free of chytridiomycosis for a period (762). Other approaches include attempting to remove the fungus from ponds by drying them, though one study found this did not eradicate the disease (766). Adding certain antifungal bacteria to the soil has been found to reduce infection rates in salamanders (764). Sterilizing equipment between sites is also a key preventative measure to avoid spreading the fungus, although its direct effect on disease spread between populations has not been assessed (768).",

However, specific legislative regulation targeting the amphibian trade was found to allow the recovery of over-exploited frog populations (785). Financial incentive schemes, such as paying farmers to undertake conservation measures, appear beneficial, with studies showing they can increase amphibian populations and lead to higher species abundance in managed habitats like ditches (818).",

Negative impacts include habitat disturbance, trampling, erosion, and reduced water quality (746). However, grazing can also be beneficial. For example, one study found that excluding livestock caused temporary pools to dry out much earlier, and other studies found certain frog and toad species were more abundant with grazing (746). While one study found lower toad abundance in grazed plots, five other studies found that management regimes incorporating grazing increased or maintained populations of natterjack and green toads (780).",

Temperature treatment is rated as likely to be beneficial, with studies showing that increasing enclosure temperatures to 30\u201337\u00b0C cured frogs and toads of the disease (770). Antifungal treatments, such as itraconazole, are also beneficial for curing or increasing survival, but they can cause negative side effects in some amphibians (882). In contrast, antibacterial treatments (763) and the use of antifungal skin bacteria or peptides (764) are considered unlikely to be beneficial. Immunizing amphibians was found to be ineffective in one study (765), and while treating wild individuals with fungicide reduced infection levels, it did not eradicate the disease (767). The effectiveness of adding salt to ponds is unknown, though one study showed a population remained disease-free for six months after treatment (762).",

Ten site comparison studies in Canada and the USA found that restored wetlands often had similar amphibian abundance, species numbers, and composition to natural wetlands (879). Similarly, five site comparison studies in the USA found that created wetlands had similar numbers of amphibian species and abundance as natural wetlands (880). A global review that combined both interventions found that in 89% of cases, restored and created wetlands had similar or higher amphibian abundance or species numbers compared to natural wetlands (879). However, some studies for both interventions noted that species composition could still differ from natural sites (879, 880).",

In contrast, the effects in forests are more varied. Eight of 14 studies in North America found no effect of prescribed forest fires on amphibian abundance or species numbers, while others reported mixed effects, increases, or decreases depending on the species and context (877).
