    "question": "To control Crassula helmsii, how do chemical methods like herbicides compare in effectiveness to physical methods like using lightproof barriers or salt water?",
    "answer": "Applying herbicides like glyphosate and diquat has been found to reduce or eradicate Crassula helmsii [1279]. Similarly, physical methods have shown success; covering the plant with black sheeting or carpet strips can eradicate or severely reduce its cover, and using seawater has also been shown to eradicate it in several trials [1294, 1288]. However, one study noted that after initial eradication with black sheeting, Crassula helmsii progressively recolonized the site [1294].",

    "question": "What are the most beneficial actions for controlling American bullfrog populations in small ponds?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests several beneficial actions. Introducing native predators like the northern pike can lead to a strong decline in bullfrog tadpole numbers [1039]. Direct removal of juveniles using methods like double fyke nets in small, shallow ponds can be effective, especially as part of a combined treatment [1046]. Direct removal of adults through methods like shooting can also significantly reduce their numbers, although populations may rebound rapidly following intensive removal [1045]. Finally, certain chemicals like caffeine or chloroxylenol have been found to kill American bullfrogs in controlled studies [1048].",

    "question": "What are the observed outcomes of using herbivores as a biological control for invasive aquatic plants like floating pennywort, water primrose, and parrot's feather?",
    "answer": "The outcomes of using herbivores for biological control are mixed. For floating pennywort, a South American weevil caused feeding lesions but did not reduce the plant's biomass in field trials, making it unlikely to be beneficial [1123]. In contrast, for water primrose, a flea beetle was found to cause heavy feeding destruction and significantly reduce its abundance, suggesting this approach is likely to be beneficial [1135]. For parrot's feather, the introduction of grass carp reduced its abundance in some studies, but not in others, while a leaf-feeding beetle reduced its growth, indicating a trade-off between benefits and harms [1599].",

    "question": "What is the evidence for effective control methods for Ponto-Caspian gobies in North American and European waterways?",
    "answer": "The evidence base for controlling Ponto-Caspian gobies is limited but points to two potentially beneficial methods. A laboratory study in Canada found that high salinity (30%) resulted in 100% mortality of round gobies within 48 hours [1072]. Additionally, a field study in the USA demonstrated that an electrical barrier successfully prevented the movement of round gobies [1074]. For many other potential control methods, such as using native predators, biocides, netting, or electrofishing, no direct evidence was found [1061, 1063, 1066, 1067].",

    "question": "What actions are available to control or contain invasive Procambarus crayfish populations?",
    "answer": "Several actions are available with varying effectiveness. Trapping baited with food has been shown to be effective for capture, though its ability to manage populations is questionable [1029]. Encouraging predators like eels may reduce population size, though this action is rated as unlikely to be beneficial on its own [1030]. A combination of trapping and encouraging predators has been shown to be more effective than predation alone and can significantly reduce crayfish populations [1031]. Other likely beneficial actions include sterilizing males by exposing them to X-rays to reduce offspring numbers [1032], adding chemicals like the pyrethrum Pyblast to the water [1036], and creating physical barriers like specially designed concrete dams to contain their spread upstream [1037].",

    "question": "Besides adding chemicals, what are some effective, alternative methods for managing invasive Asian clam populations in industrial water systems?",
    "answer": "In industrial settings, there are several beneficial, non-chemical alternatives. Mechanical removal and regular cleaning of industrial pipes can permanently remove or reduce clam numbers, as can the addition of a sand filter [1119]. Altering water conditions is another option: exposing clams to high temperatures (36\u00b0C or higher), which may be feasible in industrial facilities, leads to high mortality [1116]. Other methods shown to be effective in wider settings include mechanical suction dredging, which can reduce clam densities by 96% [1120], and placing gas-impermeable barriers on the bed of a waterbody [1117].",
