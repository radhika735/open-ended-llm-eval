    "question": "To mitigate primate crop-raiding, what is the relative effectiveness of chasing primates with loud noises versus using bright lights?",
    "answer": "There is evidence suggesting that chasing primates with loud noises is an effective deterrent, while there is no evidence for the effectiveness of using bright lights. One study found that using noise deterrents, along with other measures, reduced crop raiding by orangutans (1449). In contrast, no studies were found that tested the effects of humans chasing primates using bright light (1450).",

    "question": "What is the evidence base for conservation actions designed to mitigate the impacts of commercial logging on primate populations?",
    "answer": "The evidence base for mitigating logging impacts is limited. Using selective logging instead of clear-cutting has 'Unknown effectiveness'; one study found higher primate densities in low-intensity logged forest, another found an increase in lemurs after selective logging, while a third found similar densities regardless of logging intensity (1485). Avoiding or minimizing the logging of important primate food tree species also has 'Unknown effectiveness', though one study found a howler monkey population increased when this was done alongside other interventions (1494). For many other actions, such as providing domestic meat to logging company workers (1501) or closing non-essential roads after operations (1496), no studies were found that directly tested their effects on primate populations.",
