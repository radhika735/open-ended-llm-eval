    "answer": "This question cannot be answered from the provided text. While several actions to reduce conflict are assessed for their effectiveness, such as removing 'problem' animals (1422) or chasing primates with noise (1449), the database contains no information on the financial costs or overall cost-effectiveness of these interventions. Therefore, a comparison on this basis is not possible.",
