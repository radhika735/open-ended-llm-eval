The document presents evidence for 'Create textured surfaces (â‰¤1 mm) on subtidal artificial structures' (ID 3449) and 'Transplant or seed organisms onto subtidal artificial structures' (ID 3471) separately. For textured surfaces, studies found mixed or no effects on invertebrate abundance. For transplanting organisms, the results focused on the survival and condition of the transplanted species and their localized effects, not a broad increase in overall invertebrate abundance. The studies for each action were conducted in different contexts and locations, and the synopsis does not provide a direct comparison of their relative effectiveness.",
