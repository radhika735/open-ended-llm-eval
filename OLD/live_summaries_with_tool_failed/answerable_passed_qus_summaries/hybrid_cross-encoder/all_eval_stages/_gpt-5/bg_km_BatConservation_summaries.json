Ultraviolet filtering on lights increased soprano pipistrelle activity at hedges compared to unfiltered lights, with no increase for common pipistrelle (1020). Measures that can change insect attraction include using low-intensity, narrow yellow/low-UV lighting, which attracted fewer moths than higher-intensity, broader-spectrum UV\u2011including lights in Germany (3902), and using shielded \u201cfull cut\u2011off\u201d lights fitted with blinds and shorter\u2011wavelength filters, which attracted fewer individual moths and species than conventional lights in Slovenia (3904). Additional strategies suggested but with no direct bat-population studies found include directing lighting away from bat access points or habitats (2019), using glazing treatments to reduce light spill from inside buildings (2022), and choosing \u2018warm white\u2019 rather than \u2018cool\u2019 LEDs (2020).",

Managing livestock water troughs affected bat use and drinking success: removing livestock modifications increased drinking frequency and reduced the number of approaches before successful drinking; larger, full tanks with sparse surrounding vegetation had more bats drinking than smaller, half-full tanks with no or dense vegetation (1951). Creating or maintaining small dams: a replicated site comparison in Portugal found reservoirs created by small dams had greater activity of four bat species than the streams feeding them (1997). Wetland restoration: a replicated, controlled, before\u2013after study in the USA found restoring wetlands increased overall bat activity, and restored wetlands had similar activity to undisturbed wetlands (2036).
