One study found that ringing bells in lychee trees deterred most Madagascan flying foxes. Diversionary feeding has shown success with other mammals, with studies demonstrating that providing alternative food sources reduced nuisance behavior by black bears in the USA. Conditioned taste aversion techniques, where foodstuffs are laced with substances that induce illness, led to food avoidance by coyotes and black bears in the USA. Other non-lethal approaches include providing training to wildlife control operators on least harmful ways of removing bats from their roosts, educating farmers and communities to reduce indiscriminate culling, carrying out disease surveillance to prevent spread to humans, and providing alternative bat boxes and roost improvements.",

Using ultraviolet filters on lights has also demonstrated benefits, with a UK study showing higher soprano pipistrelle activity under ultraviolet filtered lights compared to unfiltered lights.

    "provider": "fireworks/fp8",
    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence, there is a clear difference in the amount and quality of evidence for managing existing hedgerows versus planting new ones specifically for bat conservation.\n\n**Evidence for managing existing hedgerows for bats:**\nTwo studies evaluated the effects of managing hedges to benefit bat populations, both conducted in the UK. These studies found that hedgerow management can positively affect bat communities, with one replicated site comparison study showing that hedges trimmed \u22653 years prior had more bat species recorded along them than hedges trimmed during the previous winter. The same study found that hedges trimmed \u22653 years prior had higher activity of two of eight bat species/species groups than recently trimmed hedges. However, one replicated paired sites study found that pipistrelle activity did not differ between hedges managed for wildlife on agri-environment scheme farms and hedges on conventional farms.\n\n**Evidence for planting new hedgerows for bats:**\nNo studies have been found that directly evaluated the effects of planting new hedges on bat populations. The systematic searches conducted for these actions found no evidence to assess whether planting new hedgerows is effective or has any harmful impacts on bats.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThere is moderate evidence supporting the benefits of managing existing hedgerows for bats, with two UK studies demonstrating positive effects on bat species richness and activity levels. In contrast, there is currently no direct evidence available for the effects of planting new hedgerows on bat populations, as no studies have evaluated this specific intervention.

The evidence primarily documented human behavior changes rather than population responses: development licenses for bats more than doubled over three years, but 81% of licensees did not conduct required post-development monitoring. Most concerning, 68% of bat roosts were ultimately destroyed despite licensing requirements, with only 31-67% of compensation roosts being used by bats after development.

Studies of artificial caves/hibernacula found that up to four bat species used these structures, with usage increasing over nine years in one UK study (action ID: 2049). For bat boxes, which are the most studied artificial roost type, successful factors included design characteristics such as black coloration being preferred over grey, white or wooden boxes, larger boxes having higher occupancy rates, and concrete boxes having higher occupancy than wooden ones (action ID: 1024). Box design with multiple compartments was more successful than single compartment designs, and different species showed preferences for different designs. Position factors also influenced success, with orientation and sunlight exposure affecting occupancy in some studies, and height showing mixed results. Bat boxes on buildings had higher occupancy than those on trees in two studies. Location was important, with boxes in farm forestry sites used more than native forest, and areas with known prior bat roosts showing higher occupancy rates. The number of boxes installed also mattered - sites with more boxes were more likely to have occupied boxes. However, success rates were variable, with studies showing occupancy rates ranging from 0-100% of boxes provided, though most studies found bats occupying less than half of the boxes provided. A review of 109 studies found that while 72 bat species used bat boxes, only 18 species commonly used them (action ID: 1024).",

Design factors include: color (black boxes used more than grey, white, or wooden boxes), size (larger bat boxes showed higher occupancy rates), material (concrete boxes had higher occupancy than wooden ones; resin boxes became occupied more quickly than wood), compartment configuration (two-compartment boxes occupied by more bats than one-compartment during breeding season), and specific design variants (rocket boxes preferred over wooden boxes or bark-mimic roosts by Indiana bats). Placement factors include: orientation and sun exposure (affects occupancy with orientation and sunlight amount being important), height (studies show mixed results with some finding height affects occupancy while others found no effect), location type (higher occupancy on buildings than trees in some studies), habitat context (farm forestry sites vs native forest, pine vs mixed deciduous stands), and prior bat presence (higher occupancy in areas where bats were known to roost before installing boxes). Additional factors include the number of boxes installed (greater numbers across a site increase occupancy likelihood) and microclimate management (modifying roost temperatures can increase bat numbers). However, 22 studies found bats occupying less than half of provided boxes (0-49%), while nine studies found occupancy rates above 50% (54-100%), indicating that even optimally designed and placed boxes may not always be used.",

One study in the USA\\u00a0found that Indiana bats used rocket boxes more than wooden bat boxes or bark-mimic roosts. One study in Spain\\u00a0found that more bats occupied bat boxes that had two compartments than one compartment in the breeding season.

Green bridges appear to be the most effective, with one study finding that a green bridge was used by 97% of bats crossing a road (Action ID 979).

Bat species adapted to cluttered habitats used small culverts and underpasses more than species adapted to open or edge habitats. Overpasses show mixed results, with studies indicating that while some bat species use them, up to three-quarters of bats still cross the road below at traffic height or at other nearby locations - vegetated overpasses with planters were used by two-thirds of crossing bats, while unvegetated overpasses were not used at all (Action ID 977). Bat gantries or bat bridges appear to be the least effective, with studies finding that fewer bats used them than crossed the road below at traffic height, and some gantries were not used at all (Action ID 978).

Agroforestry systems that retain or plant native trees and shrubs amongst crops (action ID 963) showed varied results across eight studies, with some finding higher bat species diversity and abundance in plantations with varied shade cover. Reducing pesticide, herbicide and fertiliser use (action ID 2013) demonstrated positive effects in four studies, with farms using fewer chemicals showing higher bat activity and species diversity. Managing hedges specifically for bats (action ID 1943) showed limited but positive effects in two UK studies, with hedges trimmed less frequently having more bat species and higher activity. However, there is currently no evidence available for several potentially beneficial practices including increasing semi-natural habitat (action ID 1938), retaining remnant forest (action ID 1947), managing ditches for bats (action ID 1944), practicing integrated farm management (action ID 169), or planting in-field trees (action ID 1946).",

Two studies found that two of five and two of three bats born in captivity successfully gave birth to live young. Seven studies found that 20-100% of bat pups born in captivity survived from 10 days to adulthood. However, no studies evaluated the effects of releasing captive-bred bats back to the wild. Four studies evaluated rehabilitation of injured/orphaned bats. One study in Brazil found two hand-reared orphaned greater spear-nosed bats survived over three months in captivity and reached normal species size after 60 days. Two studies in the UK and Italy found 70-90% of hand-reared pipistrelle bats survived 4-14 days after wild release, with six of 21 bats joining wild colonies. One UK study found 13% of ringed hand-reared pipistrelle bats were found alive in bat boxes 38 days to four years after release. Another UK study found bats that flew in large flight cages for longer periods survived longer and were more active after release. Importantly, no studies evaluated breeding bats specifically to supplement wild populations affected by white-nose syndrome.",
