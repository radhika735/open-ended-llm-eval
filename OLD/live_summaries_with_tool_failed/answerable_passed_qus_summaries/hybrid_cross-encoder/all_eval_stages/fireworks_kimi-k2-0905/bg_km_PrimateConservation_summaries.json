One controlled, replicated, before-and-after study in Indonesia found that areas using noise deterrents along with tree nets experienced reduced crop raiding by orangutans (action 1449). Additionally, one study in the Democratic Republic of Congo found that chasing gorillas with random noise resulted in gorillas returning from plantations to areas near protected forest (action 1449). However, for bright lights specifically used to chase primates, no evidence was found for effects on primate populations or crop-raiding deterrence (action 1450), meaning no studies have directly and quantitatively tested this action. The evidence base for loud noises also extends beyond primates - five of six studies across the USA, Namibia, Kenya and India found that loud noises activated when animals were nearby reduced or partially reduced crop damage by various mammals (action 2460).",

Community-based hunting control measures (1482) showed positive results: a site comparison in Democratic Republic of Congo found community control more effective at reducing illegal bushmeat hunting than national park management, a before-and-after study in Cameroon reported no gorilla poaching incidents for three years following community control implementation, and a site comparison in Nigeria found higher gorilla and chimpanzee numbers in areas managed by community conservation organizations. However, numerous proposed mitigation strategies currently lack evidence of effectiveness, including using forest set-asides (1497), incorporating forested corridors or buffers (1495), road closure timing (1496), providing domestic meat to loggers (1501), forest certification schemes (1500), and road block inspections for illegal bushmeat (1470).",

However, species-specific responses vary - mountain brushtail possums and common ringtail possums used rope bridges, while koalas and squirrel gliders did not.\n\nNo evidence was found for the effects of green bridges (overpasses) specifically on primate populations, as no studies have directly tested this intervention.",

One study found a temporary increased in prairie vole abundance.

In India, rhesus monkeys remained at release sites following translocation from development sites.\n\nFor relocating 'problem' animals, studies showed positive outcomes: translocated 'problem' rhesus monkeys in India survived and remained at release sites for at least four years alongside other interventions. In Kenya, most crop-raiding olive baboons translocated from farmland survived for 16 years with similar survival rates to non-translocated populations. A study across Republic of Congo and Gabon found that 84% of 'problem' western lowland gorillas survived for at least four years after relocation.\n\nTranslocation from abundant populations to uninhabited areas showed promise, with one study in Belize finding that the majority of black howler monkeys survived for at least 10 months after translocation.

However, not all outcomes were positive - one study in Kenya found that Tana River red colobus and crested mangabey numbers decreased despite tourism projects with human presence (action 1512), and an intensive tourism project in China for Tibetan macaques that included food provisioning actually increased stress levels with infant mortality reaching 100% in some years (action 1512). A tourism project in Madagascar had mixed results where two lemur species declined while one increased (action 1512). Habituation to human presence as a specific intervention also shows varied results - a golden lion tamarin population in Brazil declined after habituation (action 1519), while introduced lemur species in Madagascar showed good survival rates over 30 months after habituation (action 1519).

    "relevant_summary": "The evidence for primate relocation effects on primate populations and human-wildlife conflict management is severely limited. For relocating primates to non-residential areas specifically, the action documents found no evidence for effects on primate populations (Action 1423). When examining broader mammal relocation studies, including primates, several key findings emerge:\n\nPotential benefits from successful cases show that some primate species do survive and remain at release sites. A replicated study in Belize found the majority of black howler monkeys survived for at least 10 months after translocation from abundant population areas to an uninhabited site (Action 1559). A before-and-after study in India found that rhesus monkeys remained at their release sites following translocation from development areas (Action 1558). Additionally, a replicated, before-and-after study in India found that 'problem' rhesus monkeys that were translocated survived and remained at the release sites for at least four years (Action 1422).\n\nHowever, significant drawbacks are evident from studies of other mammal species. Translocation studies across multiple species show serious survival issues, with one replicated study in the USA finding that fewer than half of black bears translocated from conflict situations survived after one year (Action 2336). A controlled study in the USA found that grizzly bears translocated away from conflict situations had lower survival rates than non-translocated bears (Action 2336). Return behavior is another major drawback - studies found that many animals return to their original capture locations and continue to cause nuisance, with some black bears returning up to six times following translocation (Action 2336). Furthermore, a before-and-after study in India found that leopards translocated away from human-dominated areas attacked more humans and livestock than before translocation, potentially making conflicts worse (Action 2336).",

A controlled study in the USA found that grizzly bears translocated away from conflict situations had lower survival rates than non-translocated bears (Action 2336). Return behavior is another major drawback - studies found that many animals return to their original capture locations and continue to cause nuisance, with some black bears returning up to six times following translocation (Action 2336). Furthermore, a before-and-after study in India found that leopards translocated away from human-dominated areas attacked more humans and livestock than before translocation, potentially making conflicts worse (Action 2336).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"1423\",\n    \"2336\",\n    \"1559\",\n    \"1558\",\n    \"1422\"\n  ]\n}"

Medium-term monitoring revealed survival patterns over 2-7 years, with some populations showing persistence for 4-7 years while others experienced higher mortality rates. Long-term population changes have been tracked over extended periods, with one chimpanzee population in The Gambia showing increase over 25 years, black-and-white ruffed lemurs in Madagascar showing population persistence over 55 years, and orangutan populations in Malaysia showing decline over 33 years.

Rope bridges between canopies were used by 3-25 species across nine studies in Australia, Brazil and Peru, with arboreal marsupials not suffering high predation rates when using them. For general road mortality reduction, barrier fencing along roads reduced mammal vehicle collisions in three controlled studies in the USA, Germany and Brazil, with two before-and-after studies in the USA finding that roadside fencing with one-way gates reduced deer-vehicle collisions. A review across the USA, Canada and Sweden found that longer roadside fencing led to greater reduction of collisions between large mammals and cars. However, road mitigation effectiveness varies by species and design, with some studies showing no significant effects. No evidence was found for primate-specific measures like speed limits in high primate density areas, speed bumps, or primate road signage.",

A review across the USA, Canada and Sweden found that longer roadside fencing led to greater reduction of collisions between large mammals and cars. However, road mitigation effectiveness varies by species and design, with some studies showing no significant effects. No evidence was found for primate-specific measures like speed limits in high primate density areas, speed bumps, or primate road signage.\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"1457\",\n    \"2556\",\n    \"2567\",\n    \"3507\",\n    \"2524\",\n    \"2600\"\n  ]\n}"
