For using grazing instead of cutting, studies showed mixed effects on natural enemies with some species affected on some dates but not others, while pest responses varied between different groups and sampling periods.

Growing competitive plants is an effective approach, with nine studies from Australia, Slovakia, the UK, and USA finding that planting competitive species reduced weed plant weight and ground cover, while five studies also found reduced weed reproduction and survival (Action 722). Incorporating plant remains that produce weed-controlling chemicals (allelopathic residues) into soil showed mixed results, with six studies finding reduction in weed growth in some cases, though effects varied between years, weed groups, and residue types (Action 728). Cover crops can help suppress weeds, with four studies from Israel and Italy finding fewer weeds in plots with cover crops, though effects can vary by crop type and season (Action 1394). Mechanical methods such as rotovating and turf stripping have been tested but showed limited effectiveness for weed control specifically (Actions 1648, 1647). For invasive non-native plants on farmland, manual removal methods like cutting flower heads can be effective, with two studies from Czech Republic finding that removing all flower heads of giant hogweed at peak flowering time dramatically reduced seed production (Action 104). Additionally, organic farming systems generally promote various non-chemical weed management approaches (Action 717).",

Pests and diseases: One of eight studies (including five randomised, replicated, controlled tests) found that organic farming reduced pests or disease, but two studies found more pests. Three studies found mixed effects and two studies found no effect. Crop damage: One of seven studies (including five randomised, replicated, controlled tests) found less crop damage in organic fields but two studies found more. One study found a mixed response and three studies found no or inconsistent effects.

    "relevant_summary": "Evidence from multiple studies demonstrates varying effectiveness of manipulating field structure through linear features. Alley cropping showed mixed effects: studies from Kenya, the Philippines and the UK found increased pest numbers in some cases, while effects on parasitism varied between sites and sampling dates (Action ID: 718). Parasitism effects were inconsistent, with two of four studies showing varied results while two found no effect. Natural enemy responses were also mixed, with one study finding more wasps and spiders but fewer ladybirds, with some groups affected by tree species choice. One study found lower egg predation and another found reduced yield, while costs were lower but profits also decreased (Action ID: 718). However, Canadian research found alley cropping increased arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi diversity (Action ID: 903).\n\nBeetle banks demonstrated more consistently positive effects. Six studies showed that predators increased in adjacent crops, though one found effects varied with time and another found no effect (Action ID: 729). Four studies found more invertebrate predators on beetle banks than surrounding crops, with effects varying temporally. For pest control, a randomised study and review found largest pest reductions closest to beetle banks, with fewer pests in fields containing beetle banks (Action ID: 729). Economic analysis showed beetle banks could provide savings if they prevented pests reaching spray thresholds or causing 5% yield loss (Action ID: 729). Studies on butterflies and moths found beetle banks and agri-environment scheme field margins had higher micro-moth species richness and abundance compared to conventionally managed margins, though butterfly abundance was lower than along hedgerows (Action ID: 3927). Beetle banks also supported higher harvest mouse nest densities than field margins (Action ID: 2393).\n\nHedgerows showed consistent benefits for biodiversity and pest regulation. Multiple studies found hedgerows supported higher butterfly, moth and macro-moth abundance and species richness compared to beetle banks, crops or pasture (Action ID: 3976). Five of six studies found higher butterfly and moth abundance along hedgerows than other field-edge habitats. For pest regulation, replicated studies found higher proportions of pest eggs were parasitized in tomato fields with hedgerows, though pest damage was similar to fields with weedy edges (Action ID: 1401). Studies found more natural enemies in fields with hedgerows and in the hedgerows themselves compared to weedy edges, with fewer pests in fields or edges containing hedgerows (Action ID: 1401). Newly planted hedges supported higher beetle and spider abundance, species richness and diversity compared to crop fields or field margins (Action ID: 538).",

Alley cropping showed mixed effects: studies from Kenya, the Philippines and the UK found increased pest numbers in some cases, while effects on parasitism varied between sites and sampling dates (Action ID: 718). Parasitism effects were inconsistent, with two of four studies showing varied results while two found no effect. Natural enemy responses were also mixed, with one study finding more wasps and spiders but fewer ladybirds, with some groups affected by tree species choice. One study found lower egg predation and another found reduced yield, while costs were lower but profits also decreased (Action ID: 718). However, Canadian research found alley cropping increased arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi diversity (Action ID: 903).\\n\\nBeetle banks demonstrated more consistently positive effects. Six studies showed that predators increased in adjacent crops, though one found effects varied with time and another found no effect (Action ID: 729). Four studies found more invertebrate predators on beetle banks than surrounding crops, with effects varying temporally. For pest control, a randomised study and review found largest pest reductions closest to beetle banks, with fewer pests in fields containing beetle banks (Action ID: 729). Economic analysis showed beetle banks could provide savings if they prevented pests reaching spray thresholds or causing 5% yield loss (Action ID: 729). Studies on butterflies and moths found beetle banks and agri-environment scheme field margins had higher micro-moth species richness and abundance compared to conventionally managed margins, though butterfly abundance was lower than along hedgerows (Action ID: 3927). Beetle banks also supported higher harvest mouse nest densities than field margins (Action ID: 2393).\\n\\nHedgerows showed consistent benefits for biodiversity and pest regulation. Multiple studies found hedgerows supported higher butterfly, moth and macro-moth abundance and species richness compared to beetle banks, crops or pasture (Action ID: 3976). Five of six studies found higher butterfly and moth abundance along hedgerows than other field-edge habitats. For pest regulation, replicated studies found higher proportions of pest eggs were parasitized in tomato fields with hedgerows, though pest damage was similar to fields with weedy edges (Action ID: 1401). Studies found more natural enemies in fields with hedgerows and in the hedgerows themselves compared to weedy edges, with fewer pests in fields or edges containing hedgerows (Action ID: 1401).

Three studies found mixed effects with higher numbers of some natural enemy groups but not others. For canopy-level enhancement, farmers can isolate colonies of beneficial ants, with one Australian study finding that predatory ants occupied more cashew trees when colonies were kept isolated, resulting in lower pest damage and higher yields. Additional ground-level options include creating beetle banks, which studies found can increase predator numbers in adjacent crops, and planting flowers for pest regulation. For integrated approaches that affect both ground and canopy, farmers can grow non-crop plants that produce chemicals attracting natural enemies, with four studies finding higher numbers of natural enemies and decreased pest populations or damage.

A review found that specific management regimes can reduce the abundance of pernicious weeds in nature conservation areas. Four replicated controlled studies (one also randomized) from Denmark and Germany found cutting and infection with fungal pathogens were effective methods for controlling creeping thistle and one replicated, randomized, controlled trial from the UK found long-term control was achieved by lenient grazing. A replicated, controlled and randomized study in Germany found weevils could be used to infect creeping thistle with systemic rust. One study found a non-native beetle was unsuitable for controlling creeping thistle because it had poor survival in the UK climate. A replicated controlled study found that spraying a high concentration of herbicide killed less than half of broad-leaved dock plants. A replicated, controlled, randomized study found black grass was eliminated with a December treatment of grass-specific herbicide.

Organic farming systems demonstrated increased weeds in some studies, but this effect varied between crops and years. Biological control using introduced organisms shows promise, with a replicated field study in the USA finding that flea beetle introduction significantly reduced large-flower primrose-willow abundance. Reduced tillage systems in European studies showed increased numbers of some weeds and weed species. Delaying herbicide use led to more weeds in randomized, replicated, controlled studies.

Thirty-four studies (of which 21 were replicated and controlled and seven also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found some positive effects on earthworms, some invertebrates (other than earthworms), weeds or farmland birds, of reducing tillage compared to conventional management. Positive effects included increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms, greater abundance of some invertebrates other than earthworms, increased numbers of some weeds and/or weed species, higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying date and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields, and greater abundance of some birds - including Eurasian skylark, seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in late winter on non-inversion or conservation tillage. A review found tillage had negative effects on invertebrate numbers and no-till systems had more invertebrate bird food resources.\\nTwenty-six studies (of which 13 replicated and controlled and three also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found reducing tillage had either negative, no effect or no consistent effects on abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates (other than earthworms), earthworm abundance, biomass, or species richness, number of different plant species found as seeds, number of some weed species, mammal abundance, some bird species, and one study found bird preferences for conservation tillage fields decreased over time.

For pest control, two of four studies found fewer pests or less disease damage when insecticides were applied early, though effects varied with insecticide type and two studies found no effect.

Action 123 provides evidence for controlling weeds without damaging other plants in conservation areas, showing that specific management regimes can reduce pernicious weeds, with cutting and fungal pathogen infection being effective for controlling creeping thistle, and lenient grazing providing long-term control. Mixed pasture (Action 721) was found to reduce weeds in two studies from the USA, with both randomized, replicated trials showing reduced weeds compared to monoculture pasture. Delaying mowing or first grazing date on pasture or grassland (Action 131) resulted in benefits including higher plant species richness and higher densities of rare arable weeds according to studies from the Netherlands, Sweden and the UK. Reducing chemical inputs in permanent grassland management (Action 459) was tested as an approach, though the evidence showed no increase in foraging birds attracted to pasture plots with no fertiliser compared to controls. Additional vegetation management approaches include using prescribed fire to maintain or restore disturbance in grasslands (Action 3882) and managing vegetation using livestock grazing (Action 2545), though these were primarily studied for their effects on butterflies/moths and mammals respectively rather than specifically for weed control.",
