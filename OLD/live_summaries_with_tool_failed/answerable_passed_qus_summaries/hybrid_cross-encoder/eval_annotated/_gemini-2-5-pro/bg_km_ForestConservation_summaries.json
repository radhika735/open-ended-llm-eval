However, a separate study in Colombia found no difference in deforestation rates between community-managed forests, unmanaged forests, and national parks (1152). In Belize, the implementation of a multimedia campaign and a wildlife education museum, among other interventions, was followed by a 61-138% increase in black howler monkey populations over 3-13 years (1571). Similarly, in India, an education and awareness program, along with other interventions, was associated with a 66% increase in hoolock gibbon numbers over five years (1571). A study in Madagascar suggested that the distribution of conservation books in primary schools may have led to the cessation of poaching of certain lemur species (1571). Education programs in Brazil and Colombia improved attitudes toward and knowledge of tamarins (1571). Furthermore, a study in four African countries showed that an education program at a primate sanctuary increased visitors' knowledge (1571). Multimedia campaigns in the Republic of Congo informed a large number of people about lowland gorillas (1571). General awareness campaigns have also shown some success; in Estonia and the UK, such campaigns, combined with other actions, led to an increase in natterjack toad numbers and the creation of 1,023 amphibian ponds (831). In Mexico, an awareness campaign increased tourists' knowledge of axolotls (831). However, not all campaigns are effective; a study in Taiwan found that press conferences for frog conservation had no effect on a green tree frog project (831).",

Logging or removing trees in forests increased the density and cover of understory plants in five of ten studies, and increased species richness and diversity in four of seven studies [1273]. Some studies for both thinning and logging found no effect or mixed effects [1211, 1273]. One study found that thinning trees decreased the abundance of herbaceous species [1211].\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"1211\",\n    \"1273\"\n  ]\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "A replicated, randomized, controlled study in the USA found that light-colored plastic tree shelters resulted in higher survival rates for planted tree seedlings, but dark-colored ones did not. Additionally, a study in Hong Kong noted that tree guards led to increased tree height after 37 months, but this effect was not observed at 44 months (1268). In Panama, a replicated, controlled study demonstrated that shading improved the survival rate of planted native tree seedlings (1269). One study in a coastal swamp in Brazil indicated that adding manure to plots with planted tree seedlings had varied effects on survival and growth over three years, depending on the tree species and the amount of manure used (3311). Another study reports that the impact of soaking black willow cuttings before planting on their survival depended on the post-planting water regime; however, all cuttings soaked for 15 days died within 42 days of planting (3361). Seven replicated studies in peat swamp forests in Southeast Asia and bogs in Canada have shown that a majority of planted trees and shrubs survived over periods ranging from 10 weeks to 13 years (1820). Two studies in Canadian bogs reported conflicting results regarding fertilizer use: one found that it increased the survival of two tree species, while the other found it had no effect on three species and reduced the survival of one (1826). In the UK, Germany, and Canada, five studies in bogs indicated that fertilizer generally enhanced the growth of planted vegetation, including trees. However, in some cases, it had no impact on growth (1826). Another study in the Netherlands showed that liming typically lowered the survival of planted fen herbs after two growing seasons (1825).",
