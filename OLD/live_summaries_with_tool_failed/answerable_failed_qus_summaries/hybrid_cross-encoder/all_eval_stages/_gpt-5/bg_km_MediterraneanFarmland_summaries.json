Compost increased soil nutrients in some or all comparisons in several studies, with inconsistent nitrogen responses and no phosphorus difference in one USA study; pH was often similar [1362]. Manure increased nitrogen in some comparisons, potassium in two studies, and showed mixed results for phosphorus and pH [1363]. Compost frequently increased microbial biomass in some or all comparisons, with some studies showing no difference and shifts in bacterial communities [1362]; manure showed similar microbial biomass to controls in two studies [1363], whereas other studies reported higher microbial biomass or respiration when manure or compost was applied [911]. Both compost and manure were associated with reduced erosion and/or higher soil stability in some studies [1362, 1363], and one study found lower soil loss and runoff when manure was applied with other treatments [911]. Greenhouse gas responses differed: compost sometimes increased emissions and sometimes showed no difference across studies [1362], while manure increased carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions in individual studies [1363]. In nutrient retention and loss, one trial reported reduced nutrient loss and higher nitrogen with farmyard or poultry manure, though another found higher nitrate leaching [911]; a trial applying high rates of cotton gin compost and poultry manure improved soil structure and reduced soil loss but increased nutrient loss [891]. Several studies found higher crop yields when manures or compost were applied [911].",

    "relevant_summary": "Across Mediterranean studies, both no-tillage and reduced tillage often increased soil organic matter compared to conventional tillage: meta-analyses from Mediterranean countries and multiple studies from Spain and Italy reported higher organic matter under no-tillage, and another meta-analysis from multiple Mediterranean countries reported higher organic matter under reduced tillage [1369, 1371]. For nutrients, Mediterranean evidence was mixed for both practices: under no-tillage, studies from Italy, Spain, and Portugal found more nitrogen in some comparisons and less in others, and phosphorus was sometimes higher and sometimes lower; under reduced tillage, studies from Italy and Spain reported more nitrogen or phosphorus in some comparisons, with other studies in Spain and Syria finding similar or lower nitrogen in some cases [1369, 1371]. Soil biological responses were also mixed but frequently positive: no-tillage increased microbial biomass in some studies from Italy and Spain, with other Spanish studies finding similar or lower biomass; reduced tillage similarly showed increases in microbial biomass in some studies from Italy and Spain, with some Spanish and Syrian studies reporting similar or lower biomass [1369, 1371]. Soil structure tended to improve under both systems in Mediterranean contexts but with variability: no-tillage commonly produced more stable soils in Spain (with some mixed results), while reduced tillage in Spain increased aggregate water-stability or large aggregates in some comparisons, with other studies reporting similar or lower stability [1369, 1371]. Regarding water-related soil health indicators, no-tillage in Spain often increased soil water content and improved water-use efficiency for barley in some comparisons; reduced tillage in Egypt and Spain often increased soil water content and improved crop water-use efficiency in Spain and Turkey, though Lebanon studies reported lower water content under both practices in some comparisons [1384, 1386]. Greenhouse gas fluxes relevant to soil processes showed mixed outcomes in Mediterranean studies for both practices, with some Spanish and Italian studies finding higher or lower CO2 under no-tillage, and Spanish studies reporting higher, lower, or similar CO2 and N2O under reduced tillage [1369, 1371]. Overall, Mediterranean evidence indicates both no-tillage and reduced tillage can improve aspects of soil health relative to conventional tillage, with direction and magnitude varying by indicator and study [1369, 1371, 1384, 1386].",

Regarding nutrients, studies from Spain reported reduced nutrient loss and higher soil nitrogen when manure was applied [911]. For slurry, replicated, randomized studies from Spain and Portugal reported mixed effects on soil nitrate (higher in some Spanish studies; similar in others) and inconsistent effects on ammonium (one Spanish study higher; another similar) [1365]. Comparing compost and manure directly, a study from Italy found plots fertilized with compost had more soil organic matter, nutrients, and microbial biomass than those with manure [1366]. With compost additions, Mediterranean studies also reported greater nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium) and organic matter in runoff from Spanish plots, and greater nitrate leaching in one of four comparisons in Portugal [1377].",
