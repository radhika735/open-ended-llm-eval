Raising water levels in ditches or grassland was associated with increased bird numbers and breeding bird numbers, increases in wet-favouring plant species, and higher invertebrate numbers or biomass; more rapid establishment of species typical of wet grassland than vegetation management; and agri-environment options controlling water levels were suggested as more effective for wading birds than easier options [121]. Creating scrapes, pools, or ditch\u2011fed ponds increased site use or breeding populations of birds, with newly created wet features used by lapwing chicks and higher chick condition where many footdrains were present [359]; scrapes and pools provided habitat for a range of plant, invertebrate, and bird species, increased aquatic macroinvertebrate diversity, and supported locally or nationally scarce plant and water beetle species [153]. Creating or restoring ponds led to reptile presence and pond occupancy by multiple reptile species in several regions [3730], and created ponds were widely used and colonized by amphibians, with species numbers sometimes similar or higher than in natural ponds and stable populations established in many cases; pond age, permanence, vegetation, surrounding landscape, distance to existing ponds, and fish presence affected use or success [869]. Artificial water sources (e.g., farm/cattle ponds, retention ponds, drainage ditches) were associated with similar or higher bat activity relative to natural or surrounding habitats in several studies [959]. Reported drawbacks or limits include: ditch management had negative or no clear effects on some farmland bird species or plants in some studies [135]; raising water levels resulted in a net loss of plant species in one study, did not affect lapwing foraging rate in another, re\u2011wetting old arable soils was reported as not effective for reducing nutrient levels and restoring species\u2011rich grassland in a review, and unflooded pastures contained high biomass of soil macroinvertebrates important to breeding waders in one study [121]; created ponds sometimes had different species composition than natural ponds, numbers of species were similar or lower depending on water permanence, and populations in created ponds were less stable in one study [869]; songbirds did not appear to be affected by pond creation in one case [359]; constructed wetlands had fewer fish species than natural wetlands in one study [153]. An evidence gap was identified for managing ditches specifically to benefit bats, with no studies found evaluating effects on bat populations [1944].",

    "relevant_summary": "\u2022 Beetle banks: In the UK, beetle banks had higher densities of harvest mouse nests than field margins (population: abundance) [2393]. Across four UK studies on Lepidoptera, beetle banks had lower butterfly richness than hedgerows and similar macro\u2011moth richness to conventionally managed margins; caterpillar abundance was similar to field margins and crop fields; adult butterfly abundance was lower than along hedgerows; micro\u2011moth richness and abundance were higher than on conventionally managed margins under agri\u2011environment management, while macro\u2011moths were similar [3927].\n\u2022 Planting/providing/maintaining hedgerows: In Madagascar cultivated areas, reptile communities with hedges were more similar to forests, and more reptile species occurred only where hedges were present, than in areas without hedges (community composition) [3519]. In the UK, Ireland and Canada, established hedgerows had higher species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths than beetle banks, crops, pasture or grass margins without hedgerows; one study found similar butterfly richness to grass banks; planting certain shrubs (gorse, oak, blackthorn) within hedgerows supported more arthropod species than hawthorn; moths flew parallel to hedgerows more often near them (behaviour) [3976]. For mammals, UK and Switzerland studies found that retaining/enhancing or establishing hedgerows alongside arable land was associated with higher brown hare density in arable sites (not grassland) and increased small mammal abundance, while Irish hare numbers did not increase [2383].\n\u2022 Managing hedgerows: Across studies from the UK and Switzerland, hedge management for wildlife was associated with increased berry yields, plant and invertebrate diversity/richness, and farmland bird diversity/abundance, but other studies found no effects on plant richness, bumblebee queens, or farmland birds; some mixed/adverse effects included reduced hawthorn berry yield when fruit\u2011bearing wood was removed [116]. For bats in the UK, hedges trimmed \u22653 years prior had more bat species recorded and higher activity for two of eight species/groups than hedges trimmed the previous winter; pipistrelle activity did not differ between agri\u2011environment managed and conventional hedges [1943]. No studies were found on managing hedgerows for mammals [2382].\n\u2022 Stone\u2011faced hedge banks: No evidence was found on effects of managing stone\u2011faced hedge banks for farmland wildlife [73].",

    "relevant_summary": "Technique: Across Germany, Ireland, Switzerland and the UK, specific wildlife\u2011friendly mowing techniques reduced mortality or injury in birds, mammals, amphibians and invertebrates, and UK corncrake populations increased during periods when Corncrake Friendly Mowing schemes were introduced [698]; UK evidence also reports lower mortality of corncrakes and Eurasian skylarks with wildlife\u2011friendly mowing, alongside population increases following schemes that delayed mowing and promoted corncrake\u2011friendly techniques [192]. Mowing from the centre outwards allowed 68% of corncrake chicks to escape vs 45% with conventional edge\u2011in mowing [698]. Machinery choice affected outcomes: bar mowers and double\u2011chop mowers caused less damage or lower mortality for amphibians/invertebrates than alternatives, rotary disc mowers with conditioners killed about twice as many small mammals as double\u2011blade mowers, using a conditioner increased invertebrate injury/mortality in some studies, mower\u2011conditioners yielded higher Eurasian skylark nest survival than using a tedder, wider mowing machinery was associated with fourfold higher skylark chick survival, and swather mowers/forage harvesters had the highest skylark nest survival [698].\n\nTiming: Delaying mowing or first grazing often benefited some plants, invertebrates and birds (e.g., higher plant richness, more flower\u2011visiting insects, greater abundance of some spiders/ground beetles, increased breeding wader densities, and increased Eurasian skylark productivity), and UK corncrake populations increased after measures including delayed mowing were introduced, though several studies found no clear effects for some taxa or metrics [131]. In arable/grass systems, delayed cutting produced mixed to neutral effects on predatory insects and pests, with outcomes varying among groups and studies [727]. Changing mowing date/regime altered Lepidoptera responses: August mowing reduced Fisher\u2019s estuarine moth caterpillars whereas November mowing or no mowing did not; haying yielded higher prairie specialist butterfly abundance but lower generalist/migrant abundance than burning; mowing produced Karner blue abundances similar to unmanaged or burned sites [3945].\n\nHeight: Raising cutting height (around 9\u201310 cm vs 5\u20136 cm) resulted in similar butterfly richness and abundance, similar caterpillar abundance and survival, and similar damage rates to wax model caterpillars in replicated randomized/controlled studies in the UK and Switzerland [3968].",

    "relevant_summary": "Sown nectar flower mixtures/wildflower strips often had higher butterfly and moth species richness and diversity than conventional or unsown margins, cropped fields or conventional grassland, with several studies also reporting higher abundances; some studies found similar richness or mixed abundance responses, and strips were used by multiple butterfly and moth species (3932). Field margins sown with agricultural nectar and pollen mixes attracted significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated, grassy or cropped margins; mixes of agricultural forage plants (including legumes) attracted more bumblebees than perennial wildflower mixes in the first year, but margins with agricultural legumes degraded in value over time and required re-sowing every few years (18). Uncropped margins sown with native wild flower seed mixes supported higher abundance (and in several trials higher species richness) of foraging bumblebees than cropped edges, grassy margins or naturally regenerated margins; perennial leguminous herbs were important forage, and some long\u2011tongued bumblebees preferred perennial wildflower mixes over annual forage mixes (19). Planting nettle strips in arable margins increased the number of aphid predator species relative to crops, with some predator families only found on nettles, although nettle strips had fewer predators than crops and natural nettle patches had more predators than crops (118). For birds, some studies found more birds used nectar/wildflower strips than crops or other managements, while others found no winter increase; skylarks were more likely to nest, and less likely to abandon nests, in patches sown with annual weeds than in crops, and margin management influenced bird use more than seed mix (189).",
