    "relevant_summary": "The evidence shows both fencing and individual tree guards/shelters can be effective for protecting newly planted trees from herbivores, but with varying results. For fencing to exclude large herbivores, five of ten studies found that using wire fencing increased the cover and size of understory plants, while six studies found no effect (Action 1230). Specifically for tree protection, two of three studies examining wire fencing effects on young trees found increased biomass in one case and decreased density in another, with one study showing mixed effects depending on species (Action 1230). Two replicated controlled studies found that wire fencing increased tree density (Action 1230). For fencing after tree planting, four of five studies found that using fences to exclude grazing increased survival, size and cover of planted trees, while two studies found no effect on survival rate and one found mixed effects depending on fence structure (Action 1254). For individual tree guards and shelters, one study found that light-colored but not dark-colored plastic tree shelters increased survival rates of planted tree seedlings, and tree guards increased tree height after 37 but not 44 months (Action 1268). In freshwater wetlands, fencing to exclude deer had no significant effect on total tree seedling density after three years but resulted in taller tree seedlings compared to unfenced plots (Action 3330). Plastic guards increased both height and diameter growth rates of planted baldcypress seedlings over one growing season (Action 3330). In coastal wetlands, full-length plastic shelters increased survival rates and growth of red mangrove propagules compared to no shelter, while bamboo shelters and below-ground plastic shelters had no clear effect (Action 3331).",

Five studies in Canada, USA, France, Panama and Sweden found no effect of controlling understory vegetation on emergence, survival, growth rate or frost damage in planted seedlings, though one found removing competing herbs increased seedling biomass (Action 1256). One controlled study in Canada found that removal of sheep laurel shrubs increased growth rate and height of planted black spruce seedlings (Action 1256). One study in Ghana found that removal of invasive weed species increased tree seedling height (Action 1228).\n\nRegarding forest biodiversity effects, vegetation removal combined with mechanical soil disturbance increased cover and diversity of understory plants in Portugal and France, while decreasing understory shrub cover (Action 1274). However, mechanical removal of invasive plants showed mixed biodiversity effects: one study in Hawaii found increased understory plant biomass following invasive grass removal, while one USA study found no effect of invasive shrub removal on understory plant diversity (Action 1228).\n\nTree thinning, which affects vegetation dynamics, generally promotes understory biodiversity: seventeen of 25 studies found that thinning trees increased density and cover of understory plants, and thirteen of 19 studies found increased species richness and diversity of understory plants (Action 1211). Similarly, logging trees in forests increased understory plant density and cover in five of ten studies, and increased species richness and diversity in four of seven studies (Action 1273).\n\nFor mammal biodiversity, one study in Chile found that areas retaining understorey vegetation had more species and visits from medium-sized mammals compared to areas cleared of understorey vegetation (Action 2645).",

    "relevant_summary": "Several interventions are available to improve soil conditions and enhance tree growth in degraded forest areas. Ground preparation before tree planting increases survival and growth rates of planted trees according to six of seven studies (Action ID: 1263). Soil scarification or ploughing enhances germination, with two of three studies finding increased density of young trees, though effects vary by species (Action ID: 1251). Soil disturbance techniques (excluding scarification) have been used to enhance germination (Action ID: 1252).\n\nFertilizer applications show mixed results for tree growth enhancement. Applying fertilizer after tree planting increased tree size in two studies, though three other studies found no effect on tree size, survival rate or health (Action ID: 1260). General fertilizer use increased total plant cover, understory plant biomass, and size of young trees in six of eight studies (Action ID: 1248). Adding fertilizer alongside planting/seeding increased cover of shrubs and trees and vegetation biomass (Action ID: 1704).\n\nOrganic matter amendments provide soil improvement options. Adding organic matter such as leaf litter increased species richness of young trees in one study and increased total plant cover (Action ID: 1250). Mixed organic and inorganic soil amendments showed positive results, with studies finding higher microbial biomass and activity, increased soil organic carbon content, and improved soil structure (Action ID: 902).\n\nBiological soil amendments offer additional benefits. Soil inoculation with bacteria or fungi resulted in higher microbial diversity, increased soil organic matter content, and higher crop yields (Action ID: 888). Mycorrhizal inoculation before seeding/planting can increase vegetation cover initially and enhance abundance of target conservation species (Action ID: 3429).\n\nCombined vegetation removal with mechanical soil disturbance increased cover and diversity of understory plants and increased density of young trees (Action ID: 1274). However, soil enhancers excluding fertilizer showed mixed effects on tree seedling survival and height with no effect on seedling health (Action ID: 1153).",

    "relevant_summary": "The evidence regarding the effectiveness of managing public access and tourism to mitigate human disturbance in forests is extremely limited. Most management interventions have no direct scientific evidence supporting their effectiveness. Action 2330 provides the only substantive evidence, showing that excluding or limiting visitor numbers to protected areas resulted in higher populations of medium-sized and large mammals compared to unrestricted access areas, fewer bears being killed to protect humans, and increased use of protected areas by grizzly bears and leopards. Action 312 found that fewer birds, but not fewer species, were observed as visitor numbers increased in Spanish forests, with effects largely due to decreases in collared dove and serin abundance. Action 311 showed that two wader species nested closer to or at higher densities near a path following resurfacing that resulted in fewer people leaving the path. Action 1619 found that closing paths in Australian alpine shrubland did not alter shrub cover but increased plant species numbers. For most other interventions including creating managed paths/signs to contain disturbance (Action 1170), re-routing paths or controlling access (Action 1171), restricting pedestrian access (Action 3022), installing boardwalks to prevent trampling (Action 3024), adopting ecotourism principles (Action 3025), providing paths to limit disturbance to mammals (Action 2337), voluntary agreements with locals (Action 2339), limiting recreational access (Action 2152), and restricting recreational activities to particular areas (Action 3850), no studies were found that evaluated their effectiveness.",

Studies on preventing livestock grazing were conducted in Brazil, UK, Costa Rica, and Israel, with two of three studies finding increased survival, species richness and diversity of understory plants in Brazil, UK and Costa Rica, while the Israeli study showed increased density of oak seedlings and saplings (Action 1206). For shortening grazing periods, effectiveness varied by location: a study in Spain found increased abundance and size of regenerating oak trees, while an Australian study found no effect on native plant species richness, and a UK study found higher tree seedling numbers following summer compared to winter grazing (Action 1208). Studies using wire fences to exclude livestock from specific forest sections spanned Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Israel, New Zealand, Spain, West Africa and the USA, with four of eight studies finding increased biomass, species richness, density and cover of understory plants, while four showed mixed or no effects. Tree regeneration studies in Mexico, Kenya, Israel and Panama showed three of four studies finding increased size and density of regenerating trees when livestock were excluded (Action 1205). Modified grazing regimes in forest, open woodland and savanna showed mixed results across six studies in Australia and one in the USA, with varying effects on reptile diversity and abundance (Action 3492). Livestock exclusion from semi-natural habitats including woodlands showed generally positive effects across six studies in the USA, two in Spain, and one in Australia, with most studies finding higher small mammal abundances when livestock were excluded (Action 2407).",

Shelterwood harvesting is an effective technique that resulted in higher plant diversity, lower grass cover and higher density of tree species compared with clearcutting (Action 1214), and six of seven studies found it increased abundance, species richness and diversity of understory plants, as well as the growth and survival rate of young trees (Action 1223). Group-selection harvesting showed mixed results, with four of eight studies finding it increased cover and diversity of understory plants and the density of young trees, while two studies found it decreased understory species richness and biomass (Action 1224). \n\nTree thinning is another effective technique where seventeen of 25 studies found that thinning trees in forests increased the density and cover of understory plants, and thirteen of 19 studies found it increased species richness and diversity of understory plants (Action 1211). Thinning by girdling (cutting rings around tree trunks) increased understory plant species richness, diversity and cover (Action 1226). General logging and tree removal within forests showed more variable effects, with five of ten studies finding it increased the density and cover of understory plants, and four of seven studies finding it increased species richness and diversity of understory plants (Action 1273).\n\nSelective or reduced impact logging had different effects on wildlife, with one review of 41 studies finding that reduced impact logging had a smaller effect on bat abundance than conventional logging (Action 989). Thinning within forests also benefited other wildlife, with five of six studies finding higher overall bat activity in thinned or thinned and burned forest than unthinned forest (Action 991), and four studies finding that coniferous woodland thinned with prescribed burning, mulching or nearby felling had greater species richness of butterflies than unmanaged woodland (Action 3940).",

Group-selection harvesting showed mixed results, with four of eight studies finding it increased cover and diversity of understory plants and the density of young trees, while two studies found it decreased understory species richness and biomass (Action 1224). \\n\\nTree thinning is another effective technique where seventeen of 25 studies found that thinning trees in forests increased the density and cover of understory plants, and thirteen of 19 studies found it increased species richness and diversity of understory plants (Action 1211). Thinning by girdling (cutting rings around tree trunks) increased understory plant species richness, diversity and cover (Action 1226). General logging and tree removal within forests showed more variable effects, with five of ten studies finding it increased the density and cover of understory plants, and four of seven studies finding it increased species richness and diversity of understory plants (Action 1273).\\n\\nSelective or reduced impact logging had different effects on wildlife, with one review of 41 studies finding that reduced impact logging had a smaller effect on bat abundance than conventional logging (Action 989). Thinning within forests also benefited other wildlife, with five of six studies finding higher overall bat activity in thinned or thinned and burned forest than unthinned forest (Action 991), and four studies finding that coniferous woodland thinned with prescribed burning, mulching or nearby felling had greater species richness of butterflies than unmanaged woodland (Action 3940).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"1214\",\n    \"1223\",\n    \"1224\",\n    \"1211\",\n    \"1226\",\n    \"1273\",\n    \"989\",\n    \"991\",\n    \"3940\"\n  ]\n}"

For salamanders, shelterwood harvesting resulted in higher, similar, or initially higher then similar abundance compared to clearcutting (action ID 851), with a meta-analysis finding that partial harvest including shelterwood resulted in smaller reductions in salamander populations than clearcutting (action ID 851). For plants, shelterwood harvesting in Sweden and USA resulted in higher plant diversity, lower grass cover, and higher density of tree species compared to clearcutting (action ID 1214), and generally increased abundance, species richness, and diversity of understory plants as well as growth and survival rate of young trees (action ID 1223). Partial retention harvesting in Canada decreased the density of young trees compared to clearcutting (action ID 1215). Selective harvesting showed mixed results for mammals, with one study finding no higher small mammal species richness compared to clearcutting (action ID 2637), while results for abundance varied by species and study, with a systematic review finding that partially harvested forests had more red-backed voles but not deer mice than clearcut forests (action ID 2637). Group harvesting studies found that compared to clearcutting, harvesting trees in small groups did not result in higher amphibian or salamander abundance (action ID 844), though a meta-analysis found partial harvest methods including group harvesting resulted in smaller reductions in salamander populations than clearcutting (action ID 844).",

Regarding seed sowing methods, one study in Brazil found that sowing tree seeds increased the density and species richness of new trees (1244), while three studies in the USA examining post-wildfire seed sowing found it decreased the number and cover of native species and tree seedling density, with no effect on total plant cover or species richness (1236). Combining sowing seeds with planting individual plants showed no increased benefit over either method alone (1700).\n\nFor direct planting approaches, replanting native trees in logged areas showed some promise, with similar species richness but lower diversity compared to naturally regenerating secondary forest after nine years (3874). Studies on replanting native vegetation across multiple countries found generally similar species richness and diversity to reference habitats, though some showed lower abundance than remnant native habitat (3933). \n\nRegarding beneficial organism inoculation, soil mycorrhiza inoculation before seeding/planting showed mixed results - one study found it initially increased vegetation cover but showed no difference after three years, while another found it increased abundance of target conservation species (3429). Studies specifically examining mycorrhizal fungi addition to tree seedlings found no effect on growth and survival in most cases, though one study showed increased growth for red balau seedlings (1841). Research on root-associated fungi for tree seedlings found no evidence of effectiveness (1160, 3350).\n\nSoil preparation methods like scarification or ploughing showed positive effects, with studies finding increased cover and diversity of understory plants and mixed effects on tree species density (1251). Artificial methods to encourage natural seed dispersal, such as building bird perches, showed no significant effect on seedling abundance (1817).",

    "relevant_summary": "Several actions are available to protect newly planted trees from competition and other threats in restoration projects. For competition management, selective thinning after restoration planting can be used (action 1238), and mechanical thinning before or after planting has shown positive results in five of six studies across multiple countries, increasing survival and size of planted trees (action 1261). Ground preparation before tree planting has demonstrated effectiveness, with six of seven studies finding increased survival and growth rates of planted trees (action 1263).\n\nTo protect against vegetation competition, covering the ground with plastic mats after restoration planting can decrease the cover of herbaceous plants and grasses (action 1239), while covering with techniques other than plastic mats, such as mulch, increased total plant cover (action 1240). Adding mulch before or after seeding/planting has shown mixed results, with some studies finding increased seedling numbers and target plant species cover (action 3425). Weed mats showed no effect on seedling height in one study (action 1267).\n\nFor physical protection, fences or barriers can be used to protect planted vegetation, particularly in wetland environments. Studies in freshwater wetlands found that fencing to exclude deer increased tree seedling height and sometimes improved survival, though effects varied by season, elevation, and site (action 3330). In brackish/saline wetlands, full-length plastic shelters increased survival rates and growth of red mangrove propagules (action 3331). Plastic guards increased height and diameter growth rates in baldcypress seedlings (action 3330).\n\nAdditional protection methods include using shading for planted trees, which increased survival rates of native tree seedlings in one study (action 1269). However, some proposed actions lack research evidence, including using tree tubes/small fences/cages to protect individual trees (action 2630), removing competing vegetation in brackish/saline wetlands (action 3335), and planting mixtures of tree species to enhance survival (action 1159).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on documented studies in the USA, several post-harvesting management techniques have been evaluated for their effects on young trees and understory vegetation:\n\nShelterwood harvesting increased abundance, species richness and diversity of understory plants, as well as the growth and survival rate of young trees according to studies including those from the USA (Action 1223). Species richness of macro-moths was higher after shelterwood harvesting than after patch-cutting or clearcutting, with richness similar to thinned and unharvested forests (Action 3871). Moth species richness recovered faster after shelterwood harvesting than after group selection harvesting or clearcutting (Action 3871).\n\nGroup-selection harvesting showed mixed results, with some studies finding increased cover and diversity of understory plants and density of young trees, while others found decreased understory species richness and biomass, and still others found no effect on understory species richness and diversity or tree density and growth-rate (Action 1224). Forests managed by group selection harvesting had similar moth species richness to those managed by single tree harvesting or clearcutting, but lower species richness than unharvested forest (Action 3868).\n\nThinning instead of clearcutting resulted in higher macro-moth species richness compared to patch-cutting or clearcutting, with richness similar to unharvested forests (Action 3868).\n\nWoody debris removal produced variable effects: one study found it increased understory vegetation cover, while three studies found no effect or mixed effects on cover (Action 1213). Four studies found no effect or mixed effects on understory vegetation species richness and diversity, and two found no effect on cover and species diversity of trees (Action 1213). For young trees specifically, one study found debris removal increased young tree density, another found it decreased density, and three studies found mixed effects or no effect on young tree density (Action 1213). One study in Canada found that removal of woody debris increased survival rate of planted trees (Action 1257), while one study in the USA found mixed effects of removing, chopping and burning woody debris on the size of planted trees (Action 1257).\n\nLogging trees within forests increased density and cover of understory plants in five studies, while five studies found no effect or mixed effects (Action 1273). Four studies found that logging increased species richness and diversity of understory plants, while three studies found no effect (Action 1273).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, several alternative methods to herbicides can be used to control vegetation competition for seedlings and young trees:\n\nPhysical/Mechanical Methods: Manual control and removal of midstorey and ground-level vegetation including mowing, chaining, and cutting can be used for vegetation management (Action 337). Cutting and mowing can be specifically applied to control problematic herbaceous plants (Action 3106). Rotovating can be used to control grass vegetation (Action 1648). Physical damage to problematic plants through methods like ploughing and disking has been studied, with some studies finding that managed plots using cutting, disking and herbicide applications contained more non-planted tree seedlings than unmanaged plots (Action 3097).\n\nManual Weeding: Selective hand weeding can be used to manage vegetation (Action 3714). This involves physically removing competing plants by hand rather than using chemical treatments.\n\nProtective Materials: Weed mats can be used to protect planted trees from vegetation competition (Action 1267). Adding mulch before or after seeding/planting can help control competing vegetation, with some studies finding that mulch increased cover of target plant species and increased seedling numbers (Action 3425).\n\nSite Preparation: Removing vegetation before seeding/planting can improve establishment conditions, with studies showing this increased germination rates of sown species and increased seedling numbers for some species (Action 3416).\n\nThese methods provide physical barriers, mechanical removal, or site preparation alternatives to chemical herbicide applications for managing vegetation competition around seedlings and young trees.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available action documents, several forest management interventions have been studied in Australia with documented benefits and impacts:\n\n**Tree Thinning in Forests and Woodlands:** Four studies in Australia found that thinning trees generally increased bat activity and diversity compared to unthinned forests (Action 991). Forest thinned up to 20 years previously had higher bat diversity than unthinned forest, though sites thinned more than 20 years previously did not differ. Forest thinned up to eight years previously or more than 20 years previously had higher bat activity than unthinned forest, but sites thinned 8-20 years previously did not differ. One study found the same bat species in thinned and unthinned forest, except for the chocolate wattled bat, which was not recorded in forests with unthinned regrowth.\n\n**Prescribed Fire Management:** Studies in Australia documented several effects of prescribed burning. In eucalyptus forest, selective burning resulted in fewer Eltham copper caterpillars in the spring following burning compared to before burning (Action 3877). Three studies in Australia found that prescribed burning in forest, open woodland and savanna had mixed effects on reptile populations (Action 3646). One study found that reptile abundance increased with time since burning, while others found similar reptile species richness in burned versus unburned areas. One study found that areas of woodland managed by burning and vegetation thinning had higher reptile species richness than unmanaged areas (Action 3655).\n\n**Burning Timing Effects:** One study in Australia found that in forest burned early in the dry season, northern brown bandicoot survival rate declined less than in forests burned late in the dry season (Action 2416).\n\n**Woody Debris Addition:** A randomised, replicated, controlled study from Australia found that brown treecreeper numbers were higher in plots with large amounts of dead wood added, compared to control plots or those with less debris added (Action 344).\n\n**Grazing Cessation:** Two studies in Australia examining the cessation of livestock grazing in forest, open woodland and savanna found mixed results for reptiles (Action 3511). Studies found that ungrazed and grazed areas had similar reptile species richness and diversity, though grazing had mixed effects on reptile abundance.\n\n**Combined Management Approaches:** Studies in Australia found that areas managed by burning in combination with vegetation cutting had mixed effects on reptile populations, with some showing similar abundance compared to burning only or unmanaged areas (Action 3655).",

One study found the same bat species in thinned and unthinned forest, except for the chocolate wattled bat, which was not recorded in forests with unthinned regrowth.\\n\\n**Prescribed Fire Management:** Studies in Australia documented several effects of prescribed burning. In eucalyptus forest, selective burning resulted in fewer Eltham copper caterpillars in the spring following burning compared to before burning (Action 3877). Three studies in Australia found that prescribed burning in forest, open woodland and savanna had mixed effects on reptile populations (Action 3646).
