For water primrose, herbicide type and adjuvant use significantly affect control outcomes. Triclopyr TEA applied at 0.25% concentration achieved 100% mortality within two months (Action ID: 1139). Glyphosate effectiveness was enhanced when combined with adjuvants, showing 97% mortality when mixed with a non-oil based sticking agent and 100% mortality when combined with TopFilm (Action ID: 1139). Halosulfuron-methyl (Sempra) also proved effective for water primrose control without apparent toxicity to rice plants (Action ID: 1139). For parrot's feather, multiple herbicide types have demonstrated effectiveness, including 2,4-D, carfentrazone-ethyl, and endothall, with laboratory studies consistently showing growth reduction (Action IDs: 1676, 1681, 1606). The combination of 2,4-D with MCPA completely eliminated parrot's feather in field studies (Action ID: 1606), while 2,4-D combined with carfentrazone-ethyl showed improved short-term control compared to dichlobenil (Action ID: 1606). However, timing of application appears important, as endothall-treated parrot's feather showed initial reduction but later regained pre-treatment coverage levels (Action ID: 1681).",

Evidence indicates that trapping with food bait (tinned meat) is more effective than using pheromones or unbaited traps, with over half of all crayfish caught in food-baited traps (Action 1029). Creating physical barriers using concrete dams specifically designed with features to prevent crayfish from crawling over them has been shown to effectively contain population spread upstream in Spain (Action 1037). Combining trapping with predator encouragement has demonstrated significant population reductions - a Swiss study found that introducing predators combined with trapping significantly reduced crayfish populations, and an Italian study showed this combination was more effective than predation alone (Action 1031). Natural predation by eels has been shown to reduce crayfish populations in Italian studies, and pike also predate on red swamp crayfish according to French research (Action 1030). Sterilization of males through X-ray exposure reduced offspring production by 43% in laboratory studies (Action 1032). However, no evidence was found for the effectiveness of draining waterways (Action 1034), electrofishing (Action 1035), or removal of food sources (Action 1033).",
