A study in Mexico discovered a higher diversity of insect-eating bat species in agroforestry plantations with reduced chemical use, and a study in Germany reported more bat species over grasslands with moderate or no fertilizer use (2013). Additionally, two studies in Portugal and Germany observed higher overall bat activity on farms or grasslands with limited chemical inputs (2013). A study in Columbia found that great fruit-eating bats in 'silvopastoral' areas without chemicals had higher body weights and body condition scores (2013). The effectiveness of organic farming, as a method of reducing chemical use, has also been studied. While five of nine studies found no difference in overall bat activity between organic and non-organic farms, four studies did report higher activity on organic farms (961).

One study also found higher occupancy rates in concrete than wooden bat boxes (1024). In terms of size and design, one study found higher occupancy rates in larger bat boxes, and another found that more bats occupied bat boxes with two compartments than one during the breeding season (1024). Additionally, one study in the USA found that Indiana bats used rocket boxes more than wooden bat boxes or bark-mimic roosts (1024). Different bat box designs may be used by different species (1024). The location of the roost also affects occupancy, with studies finding higher occupancy of bat boxes on buildings than on trees and in areas where bats were known to roost prior to installation (1024). Other types of artificial roosts include purpose-built bat walls, bat lofts, and bat barns, though studies found mixed results in their use by bats (949). One review found that new bat boxes or lofts built to replace destroyed roosts were four times less likely to be used by returning bats than roosts that were retained during development (949).",

In terms of design, black bat boxes were found to be used more than grey, white, or wooden boxes [1024]. One study found higher occupancy rates in larger bat boxes, and another found that bat boxes with two compartments were more occupied than those with one during the breeding season [1024]. The material of the bat box also plays a role, with studies showing that resin boxes were occupied more quickly than wood, and concrete boxes had higher occupancy than wooden ones [1024]. Specific designs such as rocket boxes and those that simulate tree trunks have also been shown to be effective [1024]. One study found that different bat species use different designs of bat boxes [1024].\n\nPlacement of bat boxes is also a key factor. The orientation of the box and its exposure to sunlight were found to affect occupancy in three studies, although one study found no significant effect from orientation [1024]. The effect of height on occupancy is unclear, with some studies finding it to be a factor and others not [1024]. Higher occupancy rates were found in bat boxes placed on buildings compared to trees, in farm forestry sites over native forests, in pine stands relative to mixed deciduous stands, and in forest fragments over pasture [1024]. Additionally, higher occupancy rates were observed in areas where bats were already known to roost. Installing a larger number of bat boxes across a site was also found to increase the likelihood of occupation [1024]. In addition to bat boxes, a study showed that artificial hollows cut into trees were used by roosting bats [2047].",
