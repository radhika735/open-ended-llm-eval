Repeated same as response2, but got the same one question response.
Prompt again same as response1.

Attached is a file containing conservation actions, their effectiveness and key messages relating to them. This has been gathered by hand and forms part of the Conservation Evidence living evidence database. Each action is prefixed with a numerical id.
You will be generating synthetic questions for use in an experiment. Generate four questions which CANNOT be answered by any of the actions in this database. Keep the questions short. Include a model answer to this question, explaining clearly why the question is unanswerable.

Here are some example reasons why a particular question may be unanswerable:
a) Answering the question requires drawing on actions for which there has been no supporting evidence.
b) The question asks about a factor which is not recorded in the database (e.g. cost-effectiveness)
c) None of the actions in the database are relevant enough to answer the question.
d) The question is too broad / not relevant to the database.

Potential question types:
a) Effects/outcomes of specific conservation actions
b) Actions to achieve specific conservation objectives/outcomes
c) Alternatives to achieve a particular conservation goal
d) Trade-offs between different conservation actions
e) Geographical and contextual variations in action effectiveness
f) Scaling of actions and their impacts
g) Timeframes for expected outcomes
h) Factors associated with success or failure of conservation efforts

  "answer": "The provided text contains information on the effectiveness of several methods for reducing amphibian road mortality, including tunnels, barrier fencing, and road closures. However, it does not include any data on the financial costs associated with implementing or maintaining these interventions. Without cost data, it is impossible to compare these actions based on cost-effectiveness.",
  "question": "What is the most cost-effective method for reducing amphibian road mortality?"
