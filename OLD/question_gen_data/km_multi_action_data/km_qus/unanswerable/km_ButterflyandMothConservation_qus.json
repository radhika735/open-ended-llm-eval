    "question": "What is the most cost-effective method for increasing butterfly species richness on farmland?",
    "answer": "This question cannot be answered by the provided evidence. The database assesses the ecological effectiveness of conservation actions on butterfly and moth populations, such as changes in species richness, but it does not contain any information on the financial costs associated with implementing these actions. Without cost data, it is impossible to determine the cost-effectiveness of any method.",

    "answer": "This question cannot be answered using the provided information. The database includes actions related to habitat management, predator control, and pesticide use, but it does not contain any actions or studies that evaluate methods for the direct veterinary treatment or management of diseases and parasites in wild butterfly or moth populations.",

    "answer": "This question is unanswerable with the given text. The provided evidence database focuses on the ecological outcomes of conservation interventions on butterflies and moths. It does not contain any data or studies on sociological factors such as public perception, opinion, or engagement levels for different conservation strategies.",

    "question": "How effective is captive breeding and release for species whose ranges are shifting due to climate change?",
    "answer": "This question cannot be answered from the provided document. While there are actions evaluating captive breeding (3914, 3916) and translocation (3909, 3911), none of the studies explicitly assess these interventions in the context of climate-change-induced range shifts. The database does not evaluate actions specifically for climate change adaptation.",
