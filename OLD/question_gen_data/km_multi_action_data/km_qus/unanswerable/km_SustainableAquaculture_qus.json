    "question": "What is the most cost-effective method for reducing parasites in Atlantic salmon aquaculture?",
    "answer": "The provided text details several actions for reducing parasites, such as using vaccinations (733), cleaner wrasse (738), and fallowing (1026). However, none of the associated evidence includes information on the financial costs of implementation, making it impossible to assess their relative cost-effectiveness.",

    "question": "Which is more effective for reducing Amoebic Gill Disease in Atlantic salmon: bathing them in freshwater or keeping them in larger cages?",
    "answer": "This question cannot be directly answered. Action 739 provides mixed evidence for freshwater bathing in reducing amoebae on gills. Action 742 states that larger cages were associated with lower levels of the disease. The studies do not provide comparable quantitative data that would allow a direct comparison of effectiveness between these two actions.",

    "question": "What are the regulations governing the use of plant-based oils in salmon feed in Norway?",
    "answer": "This question is unanswerable as the provided database focuses on the effectiveness of conservation actions, not on the legal or regulatory frameworks governing them. While Action 926 discusses using plant-based oils and mentions multiple studies in Norway, it provides no information on regulations.",

    "question": "What is the impact of using krill as an alternative protein source on the growth of farmed trout?",
    "answer": "This question cannot be answered as the provided evidence relates exclusively to Atlantic salmon. Action 916 details the use of krill as an alternative protein source, but all the associated studies and key messages relate specifically to Atlantic salmon, not trout.",
