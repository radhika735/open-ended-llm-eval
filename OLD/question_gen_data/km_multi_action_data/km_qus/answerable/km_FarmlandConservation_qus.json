    "answer": "Several actions show conflicting results. Protecting individual nests with exclosures can increase hatching rates for species like northern lapwing but may also lead to higher predation of adult birds (108). 'Mosaic management' in the Netherlands benefited northern lapwing and black-tailed godwit populations but Eurasian oystercatchers did less well under this scheme (130). Similarly, leaving uncropped cultivated margins can increase northern lapwing hatching success but was associated with a lower proportion of young grey partridges in the population (562).",

    "answer": "The timeframe for results varies by habitat. For restoring species-rich grassland, some positive effects on wildlife can be seen in less than five years, though more complete restoration can take over a decade (133). In contrast, newly planted hedges can provide rapid benefits, with studies finding higher beetle and spider abundance compared to crop fields (538). The restoration of upland heathland, however, is considered to be a very slow process (650).",

Actively sowing mixes appears to offer more consistent benefits. Planting nectar flower or wildflower strips is beneficial for invertebrates, birds, and small mammals (442). Sowing wild bird seed mixes increases bird abundance and benefits invertebrates like butterflies and bees (594).

Using wildlife-friendly mowing techniques, such as mowing from the centre of a field outwards or using bar mowers, is proven to reduce mortality for birds, mammals, and invertebrates (698). Delaying the first mowing date can increase plant species richness and benefit breeding wading birds and Eurasian skylarks (131). Raising the mowing height has also been found to increase skylark productivity (138). In contrast, simply reducing grazing intensity has shown mixed results; it can benefit some plant and invertebrate species, but is not consistently positive and intermediate grazing levels are often considered optimal (704).",

    "question": "What are the overall effects and potential trade-offs of reducing tillage on farmland wildlife?",
    "answer": "Reducing tillage is rated as 'likely to be beneficial'. A large number of studies (34) found positive effects on wildlife, including increased biomass and richness of earthworms, greater abundance of some other invertebrates, and benefits for several farmland birds like the Eurasian skylark (126). However, there are potential trade-offs, as 26 other studies found that reducing tillage had negative, no, or inconsistent effects on the abundance and richness of some other invertebrate, plant, and bird species (126).",

    "question": "How effective is creating new unmanaged habitat features like hedges or field corners for farmland wildlife?",
    "answer": "The effectiveness varies by the type of feature and the species group. Planting new hedges was found to support a higher abundance and diversity of beetles and spiders compared to crop fields (538). In contrast, taking field corners out of management was positively correlated with overwinter survival for grey partridge but had no effect on their brood size or population density (128).",
