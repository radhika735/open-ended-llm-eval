887: Add mulch to crops
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Key Messages:
Biodiversity: Three replicated trials from Canada, Poland and Spain (including one also controlled, one also randomized and one also controlled and randomized) showed that adding mulch to crops (whether shredded paper, municipal compost or straw) increased soil animal and fungal numbers, diversity and activity. Of these, one trial also showed that mulch improved soil structure and increased soil organic matter.
Nutrient loss: One replicated study from Nigeria found higher nutrient levels in continually cropped soil. 
Erosion: Five studies from India, France, Nigeria and the UK (including one controlled, randomized, replicated trial, one randomized, replicated trial, two replicated (one also controlled), and one controlled trial) found that mulches increased soil stability, and reduced soil erosion and runoff. One trial found that some mulches are more effective than others.
Drought: Two replicated trials from India found that adding mulch to crops increased soil moisture.
Yield: Two replicated trials from India found that yields increased when either a live mulch or vegetation barrier combined with mulch was used.
 
SOIL TYPES COVERED: clay, fine loam, gravelly sandy loam, sandy, sandy-clay, sandy loam, sandy silt-loam, silty, silty loam.
