579: Connect areas of natural or semi-natural habitat
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

All four studies (including one site      comparison and two replicated trials) from the Czech Republic, Germany and the Netherlands investigating the effects of habitat      corridors or restoring areas of natural or semi-natural habitat between      existing patches found some degree of colonization of these areas by invertebrates      or mammals. However for invertebrates one unreplicated site comparison      reported that the colonization process was slow (Gruttke 1994), and three studies found that the extent of      colonization varied between invertebrate taxa. 
One small, replicated study from the Czech Republic investigated      colonization of two bio-corridors by small mammal species. It found more small      mammal species in the bio-corridors than in an adjacent forest or arable      fields.
All three studies from Germany and the Netherlands looking at the effects on      invertebrates found mixed results. One replicated study found more species      of some wasps (cavity-nesting wasps and caterpillar-hunting wasps) in      grass strips connected to forest edges than in isolated strips. An unreplicated study found that the abundance of      three ground beetle species substantially increased in an arable field      undergoing restoration to heathland but that typical heathland species      failed to colonize over the 12 year period.      One study found that two out of 85 ground beetle species used a meadow      and hedge-island strip extending from semi-natural habitats into arable      farmland. In the      same study the habitat strip did not function well for ground      beetles and harvestmen but was colonized by snails and spiders.
