Behaviour change (2 studies): A before-and-after study in Denmark found that sound from acoustic road markings did not alter fallow deer behaviour. A controlled study in Australia found that Roo-GuardÂ® sound emitters did not deter tammar wallabies from food and so were not considered suitable for keeping them off roads.
