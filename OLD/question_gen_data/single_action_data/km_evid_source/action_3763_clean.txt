3763: Alter incubation temperatures to achieve optimal/desired sex ratio: Snakes & lizards
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Key Messages:

Four studies evaluated the effects of altering incubation temperatures to achieve optimal/desired sex ratios on snake and lizard populations. Two studies were in each of the USA and China.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Reproductive success (3 studies): Two replicated studies (including one randomized study) in China and the USA found that toad-headed agama hatching success was lowest at the highest incubation temperature tested and southern alligator lizard hatching success was highest at intermediate temperatures.One randomized study in the USA found that survival of garter snake offspring was highest when females were maintained at intermediate temperatures.

BEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)
OTHER (4 STUDIES):

Offspring sex ratio (4 studies): Three replicated studies (including two randomized studies) in China and the USA found that hatchling sex ratio of stripe-tailed ratsnakes, toad-headed agamas and southern alligator lizard was not affected by incubation temperature. One randomized study in the USA found that sex ratio of live garter snake offspring was not affected by the temperature females were maintained at.
