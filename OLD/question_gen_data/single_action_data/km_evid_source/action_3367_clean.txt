3367: Chill seeds of non-woody plants before sowing: freshwater wetlands
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Key Messages:

Six studies evaluated the effects – on emergent, non-woody plants typical of freshwater wetlands – of chilling their seeds before sowing. All six studies were in the USA. Five of the studies were in laboratories or greenhouses.

Germination/emergence (6 studies): All six replicated, controlled studies in the USA found that chilling (at 1–10°C) seeds of herbaceous plants before sowing either increased or had no significant effect on their germination rate. Within studies, the direction and/or size of the effect depended on factors such as the duration of chilling, species, conditions (light/temperature) after sowing, and sowing site (restored vs natural meadows). One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the USA found that freezing sawgrass Cladium jamaicense seeds before sowing reduced their germination rate.
