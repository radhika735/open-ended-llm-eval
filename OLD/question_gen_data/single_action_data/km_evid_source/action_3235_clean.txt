3235: Deposit soil/sediment to form physical structure of freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of depositing soil/sediment to form the physical structure of freshwater marshes (without introducing vegetation). One study was in the USA and one was in the Netherlands.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community types (1 study): One replicated, paired, site comparison study in the Netherlands reported that marshes created by depositing sand at lake margins contained fewer plant community types, after 8–16 years, than mature natural marshes.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (2 studies): One site comparison study in the USA reported that plant stem density was similar, after 4–10 years, in marshes created by depositing sediment and in natural marshes, but that vegetation cover was lower in the created marshes. One replicated, paired, site comparison study in the Netherlands reported that marshes created by depositing sand at lake margins contained similar vegetation biomass to nearby natural marshes after 8–16 years.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Height (1 study): One site comparison study in the USA reported that a freshwater marsh created by depositing sediment contained vegetation of a similar height to nearby natural marshes after 4–10 years.
