Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Key Messages:

One before-and-after study in Australia found that grassland restoration that included leaving unmown buffers around ponds increased numbers of frog species.
One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that retaining buffers along ridge tops within harvested forest increased Red Hills salamander abundance, body condition and genetic diversity. One replicated, controlled study in the USA found that retaining unmown buffers around ponds had mixed effects on tadpole survival and mass depending on species and site.
One replicated study in the USA found that 30 m buffer zones around wetlands were not sufficient to protect marbled salamanders.
