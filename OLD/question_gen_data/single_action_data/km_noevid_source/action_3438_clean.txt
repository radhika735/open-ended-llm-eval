3438: Create large adjoining cavities or ‘swimthrough’ habitats (>100 mm) on intertidal artificial structures
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of creating large adjoining cavities or ‘swimthrough’ habitats on intertidal artificial structures on the biodiversity of those structures.

This means we did not find any studies that directly evaluated this intervention during our literature searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
