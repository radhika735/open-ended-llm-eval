    "answer": "The provided information summarizes the effectiveness of various actions on wildlife, such as creating skylark plots (Action 540) which is rated as beneficial for skylarks. However, the database does not contain information on the financial costs or cost-effectiveness of implementing these conservation measures. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the most cost-effective method based on the text.",

For Action 100, 'Avoid use of lead shot', and Action 109, 'Erect predator-proof fencing around important breeding sites for waders', the effectiveness rating is 'No evidence found (no assessment)'. This means no studies were found that quantitatively tested these actions, so their effectiveness cannot be compared.",

The effectiveness of actions varies significantly across different species and groups. For example, while 'Plant nectar flower mixture/wildflower strips' (Action 442) is beneficial for invertebrates, small mammals, and some birds, its impact might not be as significant for other groups.
