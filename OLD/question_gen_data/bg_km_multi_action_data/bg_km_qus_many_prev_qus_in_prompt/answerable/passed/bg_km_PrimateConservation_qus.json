    "question": "What is the evidence for the effectiveness of installing rope or pole canopy bridges compared to green bridges for connecting fragmented primate habitats?",
    "answer": "There is a notable difference in the evidence base for these two interventions. Installing rope or pole (canopy) bridges is rated as ‘likely to be beneficial’ (1457). Studies have found that black lion tamarins, capuchins, and multiple lemur species used such bridges to cross roads or pipelines, and one study in Belize found a black howler monkey population increased after pole bridges were constructed. In contrast, for installing green bridges (overpasses), no evidence was found, and therefore no assessment of its effectiveness could be made (1456).",

    "answer": "The evidence on supplementary feeding during reintroduction shows mixed outcomes, and its effectiveness is rated as 'unknown'. Regularly and continuously providing supplementary food was associated with primate population increases in two studies but declines in two other studies (1526). Providing food only during resource-scarce periods was linked to high survival rates for reintroduced chimpanzees and translocated baboons in two separate studies (1527). Providing supplementary food for a limited time only also yielded mixed results; it was associated with a chimpanzee population increase in one study, a tamarin population decline in another, and a minority of primates surviving in four other studies (1528).",

Implementing local no-hunting community policies is rated as ‘likely to be beneficial’, with studies documenting population increases or protection for various primate species including lowland gorillas, black howler monkeys, and drills under local hunting bans (1478). Similarly, implementing community control of patrolling and snare removal is also ‘likely to be beneficial’. Evidence includes a study where community control was more effective at reducing illegal hunting than a national park, and another that found higher densities of gorillas and chimpanzees in a community-managed area (1482). The evidence for strengthening local taboos that forbid killing primates is less certain, with an ‘unknown effectiveness’ rating, though one study found higher gibbon densities in an area with a hunting taboo (1479).",

    "question": "What are the documented benefits and negative impacts of running tourism projects focused on habituated primates?",
    "answer": "The evidence for tourism projects shows a trade-off between benefits and harms (1512). On the positive side, several studies found that mountain gorilla numbers increased after tourism projects were initiated. One study also found an increase in black howler monkey numbers. On the negative side, tourism has been associated with decreases in Tana River red colobus and crested mangabey numbers, and declines in population, body size, or group size for some lemur species. A study on Tibetan macaques found that an intensive tourism project increased their stress levels and led to very high infant mortality. Habituation itself (1519) has been part of successful gorilla population increases but also a tamarin population decline. The risks associated with tourism and habituation have led to management actions like keeping a safety distance from animals (1538) and implementing no-feeding policies (1502).",

    "answer": "Several non-lethal deterrents are available as alternatives to translocation (1422). One of the most effective appears to be humans chasing primates using random loud noise, which is rated 'likely to be beneficial' and has been shown to reduce crop raiding by orangutans and move gorillas out of plantations (1449). Using nets to keep primates out of fruit trees has 'unknown effectiveness', though one study did find this reduced crop-raiding (1442). A range of other deterrents have been considered, but currently have no evidence to support their effectiveness. These include installing mechanical barriers like fences and ditches (1436), planting unpalatable buffer crops (1438), using loud-speakers to broadcast threat sounds (1446), and strategically laying out predator scents (1448).",
