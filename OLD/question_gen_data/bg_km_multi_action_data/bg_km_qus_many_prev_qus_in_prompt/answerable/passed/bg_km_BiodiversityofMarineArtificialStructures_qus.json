    "question": "How do the effects of creating pits versus grooves (both 1-50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures compare in terms of enhancing biodiversity?",
    "answer": "Studies show varied outcomes for both interventions. Creating pits (1-50 mm) has been found to increase overall species richness/diversity in eight of twelve studies, and to increase invertebrate abundance in some cases (3475). Creating grooves (1-50 mm) increased overall species richness/diversity in three of six studies, but did not increase invertebrate abundance in three of four studies (3473). In one study in Singapore, creating both pits and grooves together increased fish richness and abundance (3473, 3475).",

    "question": "What are the documented effects of ceasing or altering maintenance activities on artificial marine structures?",
    "answer": "Evidence is limited. For subtidal structures, two studies found that reducing the frequency or area of cleaning did not alter overall community composition, richness, or abundance, but did increase macroalgal and seahorse abundance in specific cases (3447). No studies were found that evaluated the effects of ceasing or altering maintenance activities on intertidal artificial structures (3440).",

    "question": "What factors influence the survival of organisms transplanted onto artificial marine structures?",
    "answer": "Survival of transplanted organisms is highly variable. In subtidal zones, survival of transplanted canopy algae was affected by wave-exposure, surrounding habitat, and the presence and mesh size of protective cages (3471). Survival of transplanted corals varied by species (3471). In intertidal zones, survival of transplanted macroalgae was higher at mid- and high-shore levels (3472). Survival of transplanted invertebrates (e.g., oysters, limpets, corals) varied depending on the species, site, and the presence and size of habitat features like grooves and ledges on the structure surface (3472).",

    "answer": "In subtidal zones, using ECOncrete™ (sometimes with added habitat features) was found to alter community composition and increase species richness/diversity in three studies (3470). Other modified concretes (e.g. with recycled-cement or shell) had mixed or no effects on species richness and abundance (3470). In intertidal zones, using ECOncrete™ (with added habitat features) increased species richness and diversity in one study, while other modified concretes (hemp, shell, reduced-pH) had mixed or no effects on richness, though some increased overall or specific invertebrate abundance (3469).",
