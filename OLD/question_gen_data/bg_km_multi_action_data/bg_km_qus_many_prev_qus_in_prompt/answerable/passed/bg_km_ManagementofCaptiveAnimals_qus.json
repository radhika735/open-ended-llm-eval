    "question": "What actions are available to increase natural foraging behaviours in captive carnivores?",
    "answer": "Several feeding enrichment actions have been shown to increase foraging and related active behaviours in captive carnivores. Hiding food around the enclosure increased exploring and foraging in species like leopard cats, bush dogs, and sun bears [1915]. Similarly, presenting food inside objects increased these behaviours in bears [1924]. Scattering food increased locomotion in maned wolves [1921], and providing live invertebrate prey increased explorative behaviours in fennec foxes [1926]. Providing bones, hides, or partial carcasses increased activity and manipulation time in felids and foxes [1902].",

    "question": "For captive breeding programs in Australia, what are the observed effects of simulating seasonal environmental changes to induce amphibian breeding?",
    "answer": "Evidence from Australian studies suggests that several simulated changes, often in combination, can improve breeding outcomes. One study found that providing a pre-breeding cooling period, along with other interventions like separating sexes and playing mating calls, increased breeding success [1864]. Another study found that frogs only bred after being moved to an indoor enclosure with various substrates that allowed for temporary flooding, along with manipulating sex ratios and playing mating calls [1873, 1874, 1879, 1881]. Increasing caloric intake for females before breeding, separating sexes during non-breeding periods, playing recorded mating calls, and allowing female mate choice have all been associated with increased clutch sizes in Australian frogs, though typically as part of a suite of interventions [1880, 1881, 1882, 1888].",

For primates, puzzle feeders were found to increase foraging behaviour and tool use, but also led to increased aggression [1318]. For carnivores, presenting food inside objects like Boomer balls decreased stereotypic behaviours in bears [1924]. However, devices simulating live prey, such as a carcass on a bungee, increased walking in cougars but also initially increased pacing in tigers [1927].",

In contrast, commercial diets decreased crude protein digestibility in African wildcats and led to similar likelihood of gastritis in cheetahs as horse meat (1900).
