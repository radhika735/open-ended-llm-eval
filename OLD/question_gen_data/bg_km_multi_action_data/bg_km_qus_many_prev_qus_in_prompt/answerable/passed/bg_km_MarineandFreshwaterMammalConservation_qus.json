    "question": "How does using acoustic devices on fishing gear compare to using them on fishing vessels for deterring marine mammals?",
    "answer": "Evidence exists for both interventions, and both are rated as a 'Trade off between benefit and harms'. Studies on acoustic devices attached to fishing gear found they could reduce entanglements of porpoises, dolphins, and whales, and also reduce damage to catches (2808). Studies on acoustic devices deployed from vessels found they caused avoidance behaviour in dolphins and killer whales, but one study found they did not reduce predation of squid catches by Risso's dolphins (2815). Both methods carry risks of causing hearing damage or excluding animals from important habitats.",

    "answer": "Several measures have been proposed to mitigate risks to marine mammals at renewable energy sites, but for each of them, no studies were found that evaluated their effects on mammal populations. Proposed actions include modifying the design of underwater turbines to reduce collision risk (2747), using acoustic devices to deter mammals from the area (2748), and using real-time automated tools to detect mammals, which would allow operations to be stopped or modified to prevent collisions (2749).",

Modifying fishing gear, such as using a larger mesh size in trap-nets (2803) or installing steel bars on bag-nets along with strengthened netting (2822), has been found to reduce damage to salmon catches by seals. Modifying pots with metal frames also reduced the number of seals trapped (2822). In comparison, using acoustic devices on fishing gear has also been shown to reduce damage to fish catches and fishing nets caused by seals (2808). However, acoustic devices come with a trade-off, as they can have far-reaching negative effects on non-target species and contribute to noise pollution (2808).",

In New Zealand, the presence of an official-looking volunteer resulted in fewer tourists harassing New Zealand fur seals at a waterfall (2844). Enforcing regulations for tour boats, such as approach distances, led to more seals remaining on shore in a seal colony in the Bass Strait, Australia (2838).
