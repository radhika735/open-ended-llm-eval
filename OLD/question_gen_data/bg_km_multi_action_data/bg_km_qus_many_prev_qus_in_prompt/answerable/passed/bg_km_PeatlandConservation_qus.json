Simply cutting or removing forest plantations was found in four studies to increase herb cover and overall plant richness (1731). When removal is combined with rewetting, eleven studies found this increased the abundance of wetland-characteristic plants, Sphagnum moss cover in some cases, and herb cover.

Cutting or mowing herbaceous plants is 'Likely to be beneficial,' with studies showing it alters plant community composition, increases cover of characteristic plants and mosses, and boosts species richness (1759). Similarly, cutting large trees/shrubs is 'Likely to be beneficial,' increasing herb cover and the abundance of fen meadow species (1761). Using grazing to restore disturbance has a 'Trade off between benefit and harms,' as it can increase some herb groups but reduce Sphagnum cover and species richness compared to mowing (1762).

While one study in Sweden found liming increased survival and growth of planted fen mosses, another study in the Netherlands reported that it typically reduced survival of planted fen herbs (1825). When added without planting, one study in a fen meadow found liming increased overall vegetation biomass, mostly grass (1790). Adding inorganic fertilizer to planted areas has a 'Trade off between benefit and harms' because while it can increase growth, there is a risk of undesirable long-term nutrient increases (1826).
