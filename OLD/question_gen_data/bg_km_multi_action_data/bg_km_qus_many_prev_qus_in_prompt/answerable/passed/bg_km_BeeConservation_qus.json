    "question": "What are the documented effects of managing uncropped field margins on wild bee populations in the UK?",
    "answer": "Various management techniques for uncropped field margins in the UK show different outcomes for bees. Sowing margins with native wildflowers was shown in five trials to support higher abundance and richness of foraging bumblebees compared to cropped, grassy, or naturally regenerated margins (19). In contrast, evidence for simple grassy margins is mixed, with three separate trials showing either enhanced bee abundance, enhanced bumblebee abundance and diversity, or no effect (14). Leaving margins to regenerate naturally resulted in more bumblebees than cropped margins in four trials, but their value can be inconsistent between years and may depend on weed species (20). Finally, two trials showed that leaving crop edges unsprayed (conservation headlands) did not attract more foraging bumblebees than conventional crop fields (29).",

    "question": "What factors are associated with the success or failure of providing artificial nest sites for solitary bees?",
    "answer": "Multiple factors affect the success of artificial nest sites. Location is critical; nest boxes must be within the foraging range of bees, which for some species is just 150-600 m from resources (47). Design also matters; a trial found reed stem and wooden grooved-board boxes were more productive than those with plastic components, which had higher parasitism and mould (47). Predation and parasitism are major causes of failure, with mortality rates ranging from 13% to 56% across different studies (47). Competition from non-target species can also be an issue. For instance, two trials found introduced European earwigs occupied nest boxes (47), but another showed that excluding them with a sticky barrier increased usage by native bees (44). Similarly, excluding ants was found to increase offspring production in one trial (46).",

A trial in Kansas showed that road verges planted with native prairie vegetation supported a greater number and diversity of bees than frequently mown grass verges (30).

One large trial showed that the abundance of long-tongued bumblebees was positively correlated with the number of pollen and nectar agri-environment agreements in a 10 km grid square, demonstrating a landscape-scale benefit (21). Conversely, a trial in the Netherlands found that bee numbers were not higher in farmland 50-1,500 m away from planted flower patches, suggesting the local benefit did not scale up in that instance (17). Furthermore, two landscape-scale trials in the UK found bumblebee populations were not enhanced on farmland managed under agri-environment schemes (24).",

    "answer": "The evidence suggests colonization can be rapid. Artificially exposed areas of bare soil can be successfully colonized by ground-nesting solitary bees and wasps in the first or second year (13). Similarly, set-aside areas left for two years or more showed higher species richness of bees (7). Many species of solitary bee readily nest in artificial nest boxes, often in the first year of provision, and populations can double over three years with repeated provision (47).",

Sticky barriers can reduce introduced earwigs in nest boxes (44). For parasites and diseases, some antibiotics and pathogens can control infections in commercial colonies (42), and excluding ants from nest sites can increase offspring production (46).
