    "answer": "Marking both fences and power lines appears to be beneficial for reducing bird collisions. A study in the UK found marking deer fences with orange netting reduced collisions (238). Similarly, eight studies worldwide found that marking power lines significantly reduced collision rates for species like cranes and swans (265).",

    "answer": "Controlling both avian and mammalian predators on islands is generally beneficial for bird populations. For mammalian predators, control or eradication led to increased species richness and abundance, population recoveries, and recolonisations (373). Specifically for seabirds, 16 studies found positive responses like large population increases or higher reproductive success following mammalian predator control (375). For waders, one study found a population increase in Chatham Island oystercatchers after cat removal (378). Controlling avian predators has also led to increased population sizes and reproductive success for seabirds on islands (372).",

Providing set-aside areas is beneficial, with studies showing higher productivity for waders and skylarks compared to other habitats (175). Leaving uncropped, cultivated plots, such as 'lapwing plots', is likely to be beneficial, with studies finding higher nesting success than in crops (213). Creating smaller 'skylark plots' within cereal fields is also likely to be beneficial, with studies showing higher skylark productivity in fields with plots (214).

In pine forests, there's a trade-off: some open habitat species become more abundant, but closed-forest and ground-nesting species can be adversely affected (318). In deciduous forests, it is rated as likely to be ineffective or harmful, with one study finding no difference in wood thrush nest survival and another finding a reduction in hummingbird nests (317). In Australian sclerophyll forests, the effectiveness is unknown; studies found differences in species assemblages but no consistent change in species richness (319).",

Using non-electric fencing is likely beneficial, with studies showing fewer predated nests (183). Electric fencing is also likely beneficial, with studies showing higher nest survival and productivity (188). Individual nest exclosures or barriers are also likely beneficial for a range of species, increasing fledging or hatching success (397, 398, 399, 400).

Placing bird feeders very close to windows has been shown to reduce the number of fatal collisions [557]. For power lines, burying or isolating them can dramatically increase survival [262]. Other effective measures include removing earth wires [263] and marking power lines to increase their visibility [265].

Selective harvesting has mixed results, with some species increasing and others decreasing; one study found it resulted in lower species richness of cavity-nesting birds compared to clearcuts [331].

Creating uncultivated margins can provide habitat for some birds, though winter use may be limited [190]. Planting grass buffer strips has been shown to lead to higher bird populations and more positive population trends for some species [191]. Sowing nectar or wildflower strips can attract more birds than conventional crops and can provide nesting habitat for species like the Eurasian skylark [189]. Managing existing hedges to be more wildlife-friendly, such as by reducing cutting frequency, has also been found to benefit some species [177].
