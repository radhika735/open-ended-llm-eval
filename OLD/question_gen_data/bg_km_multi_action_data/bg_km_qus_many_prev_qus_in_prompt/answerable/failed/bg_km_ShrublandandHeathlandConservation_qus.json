    "question": "What management actions are available to control problematic tree species in shrubland habitats?",
    "answer": "Several actions to control problematic tree species have been studied, though their effectiveness is often uncertain. Methods include applying herbicide to trees (1629), cutting trees (1630), and using grazing by livestock (1634). More intensive approaches involve cutting trees and then removing leaf litter (1631), removing seedlings (1632), applying herbicide (1636), or using prescribed burning (1637). Prescribed burning can be used on its own (1721) or in combination with increased livestock numbers (1722). Most of these interventions are rated as having 'Unknown effectiveness', with studies showing mixed results on shrub cover and plant diversity.",

Applying herbicide increased heather seedlings in one trial but failed to increase heather cover in two other studies (1652).

A combination of cutting and applying herbicide also yielded mixed results, increasing heather cover in one study but having no effect in another (1654).

Reducing or stopping grazing is often beneficial, with studies showing that excluding livestock with fences (1545) or reducing livestock numbers (1607) can increase shrub cover, biomass, and height. Conversely, increasing livestock numbers can have negative effects on shrubs, with studies finding it can decrease dwarf shrub cover (1628). However, increasing livestock can also have benefits, such as increasing the number of plant species (1628). Using grazing specifically to control trees (1634) or grass (1646) has shown mixed or uncertain results on shrubland vegetation.",

    "answer": "The evidence suggests that cutting or mowing may be an alternative to burning, but results for both are mixed. In European heathlands, using prescribed burning to control purple moor grass was found to reduce the cover of common heather without affecting the grass itself (1723). Reinstating traditional burning showed an initial decrease in plant cover, which later increased (1625). As an alternative, cutting or mowing to mimic grazing had mixed effects on heather cover in studies from Spain and Italy, but it tended to increase grass cover (1627). Specifically cutting to control grass in the UK did not alter cover of common heather in several studies (1638).",

Adding manure was found to increase plant cover and species richness in one study (1695), and adding fertilizer alongside planting increased shrub cover and biomass in others (1704).

The addition of peat alongside seeding increased heather cover and density in the UK, though seedling survival was sometimes low (1705).

    "question": "What are the observed effects of reducing grazing or browsing pressure from livestock and large wild herbivores on shrubland vegetation?",
    "answer": "Reducing grazing and browsing pressure generally has positive effects on shrub cover, though results vary. Reducing livestock numbers is rated 'Beneficial', with several studies documenting an increase in shrub abundance and cover (1607). Similarly, using fences to exclude livestock is 'Likely to be beneficial', with multiple studies finding increased shrub cover, abundance, or biomass, although some studies found no change or even a decrease (1545). For large wild herbivores, reducing their numbers led to increased shrub or heather cover in two studies (1663). Fencing to exclude deer was found to increase shrub height but not cover in one study (1662). Effects on other vegetation like grasses were mixed across all interventions (1545, 1607, 1663).",
