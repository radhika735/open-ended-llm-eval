Additionally, incorporating straw (910) or applying manure and compost (911) can lead to better soil structure and larger soil aggregations.

Adding mulch reduced erosion on sandy, sandy-clay, sandy-loam and silty-loam soils [887]. On clay and loamy soils, reducing grazing intensity reduced sediment erosion [901]. Changing tillage practices has shown mixed results, with seven trials on various soils (including clay, sandy loam, and silt loam) showing reduced soil loss under reduced tillage, but two trials showing increased soil loss with no-tillage in the absence of crop cover [906].",

Using crop rotation can increase water infiltration and improve soil properties such as porosity and hydraulic conductivity [857]. Controlling farm traffic can lead to a higher number of soil pores and less compaction [899]. Excluding sheep for 2.5 years allowed compacted clay soils to recover in one study [901].
