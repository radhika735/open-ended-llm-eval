    "answer": "Several actions involve modifying trawl gear to reduce unwanted catch. These include using a square mesh instead of a diamond mesh codend (2714), fitting mesh escape panels (2716), or installing size-sorting escape grids in trawls for both fish (2720) and prawns/shrimp (2721). Another approach is fitting a mesh funnel or sieve net to prawn/shrimp trawls (2722). Alternative trawl designs such as separator trawls (2711) or topless trawls (2712) can also be used to separate and release unwanted species.",

A randomized study found no reduction in unwanted catch from closing areas to trawling for seven years (2673). Controlling human activity with zonation systems resulted in larger fish in more restricted zones and varied effects on abundance (2674). Protected areas fished only periodically had greater fish biomass than openly fished areas (2679). One study found that after at least 10 years, a no-take zone had similar abundance for four of six fish groups compared to fished zones (2682).",

Prohibiting midwater drift netting was found to increase the weights of young returning salmon (2669). Closing areas to non-towed static gears showed greater shark length for two of five species/groups (2670).

These include ceasing all mobile and static fishing gears that catch bottom species, which may protect communities from overexploitation and preserve habitats (2654). A more targeted alternative is to prohibit only mobile fishing gears that are dragged across the seafloor, such as trawls, which can also reduce fishing mortality and habitat damage (2673). Additionally, establishing long-term fishery closures for key overexploited species can help depleted populations recover (2655).",

Using a larger mesh size improved post-capture survival for skates and rays in one study, but had no effect on haddock, whiting, or small herring in two other studies (2697). Regarding handling, reducing air exposure before release did not increase the survival of small-spotted catshark in one study (2690).

Similarly, another study found that real-time area closures reduced the annual amount of cod caught (2664). Setting catch limits or quotas specifically for non-targeted commercial species has also proven effective, reducing unwanted catch in two of three cases in one review and reducing unwanted halibut catch in another study (2693). Finally, using technology to communicate near real-time catch information to fishers enabled avoidance of unwanted catch in two of three cases reviewed (3826).",

    "question": "In longline fisheries, which modifications are most effective for reducing unwanted catches of sharks and rays?",
    "answer": "Based on available evidence, modifying the longline configuration appears most promising for reducing unwanted catches of sharks and rays. One study and a global review found that modifications such as using nylon instead of wire hook attachments or increasing the sinking rate of mid-water longlines reduced catches of unwanted sharks and/or rays (2699). In contrast, two systematic global reviews found that using different bait types did not affect the number of unwanted sharks and rays caught (2700). Evidence for changing hook type is mixed, with multiple studies and global reviews finding it did not reduce the unwanted catch of sharks and rays (2698).",

    "answer": "Increases in fish abundance following fishing prohibitions have been observed over a range of timeframes, though results are not always consistent or immediate. Some studies found higher fish abundances in areas protected for five years (2667) and 15 years (2654). A large body of evidence from no-take marine protected areas shows that higher fish abundances are frequently found in areas protected for periods up to 25 years or more (2682). However, positive effects are not guaranteed in the short-term; some studies found no effect on fish densities after 2-7 years of protection (2654) or even lower abundance after two years (2667).",

    "answer": "The evidence for increased fish abundance appears stronger when prohibiting all fishing within a Marine Protected Area (2682) compared to a general prohibition of all commercial fishing (2667). Prohibiting all fishing in MPAs resulted in higher fish abundance in 30 out of 54 site comparison studies (2682). In contrast, prohibiting all commercial fishing showed mixed results, with two of four site comparison studies finding higher abundances for some species, while others found mixed effects, no increase, or even lower abundance for most species after closure (2667).",

Ten studies examined using different hook types, finding that some could reduce injuries and mortality for certain species (2698). Six studies focused on the live release of protected species, showing that while many individuals survived, factors like injury were critical (2691). Other actions have less evidence: two studies found shorter gear deployments improved survival for some flatfish but not others (2686), while only one of three studies on using larger mesh size found a survival benefit (2697). In one study, reducing air exposure did not improve survival for catsharks (2690).",

For bans on bottom-contacting gears, effects may not be apparent in the short term (2-10 years), with positive changes seen in areas closed for 15 years (2654, 2673). In contrast, prohibiting spearfishing can yield results more quickly, with increased abundance observed in as few as two to seven years (2672). Prohibiting all commercial fishing has shown variable results over time, with studies noting lower abundance after two years but higher abundance after five to 40 years (2667). Prohibiting all fishing in Marine Protected Areas has consistently shown positive effects, with higher abundance documented over various timeframes up to 25 years (2682).",
