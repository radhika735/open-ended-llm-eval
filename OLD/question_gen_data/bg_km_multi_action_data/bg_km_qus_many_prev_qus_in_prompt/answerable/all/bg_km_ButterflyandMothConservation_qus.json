    "question": "What actions are available to improve butterfly and moth habitats in urban areas?",
    "answer": "Several actions have been studied. Altering mowing regimes on greenspaces to be less frequent has been found to increase butterfly species richness and abundance (3841). Planting parks and gardens with appropriate native species can also increase the richness of butterflies and moths (3842). Protecting existing greenfield sites like native forests and grasslands in urban areas has been shown to support higher butterfly species richness than urban parks or non-native plantations (3836). In contrast, establishing 'green infrastructure' like green roofs was found to support lower butterfly richness and abundance compared to urban parks (3837). Wildlife-friendly gardening practices have shown mixed results, with some studies finding no increase in butterfly abundance from actions like reduced weeding (3834).",

    "answer": "Evidence suggests these methods can benefit different parts of the lepidopteran community. Clearing patches in forests was found to increase butterfly species richness but could decrease moth species richness compared to closed-canopy forest (3938). Coppiced woodlands were found to have greater butterfly species richness than unmanaged woodland but lower macro-moth richness than mature forest (3939). Thinning trees, often along with prescribed burning, was found to increase the species richness and abundance of butterflies compared to unmanaged woodland (3940). Different communities of butterflies and moths were supported by coppiced woodland of different ages (3939), and wider woodland rides created by clearing contained more unique macro-moth species than standard rides or mature forest (3938).",

Sown wildflower strips are particularly effective, showing higher abundance of butterflies compared to conventional field margins or cropped fields (3932). Similarly, grass margins managed with restrictions on fertilizer and pesticide use showed greater moth abundance than conventional margins (3894).

Leaving unburned patches during prescribed burning was found to increase the abundance of Karner blue butterflies and was associated with higher abundance for six out of nine specialist butterfly species in another study (3879). Rotational burning, for example every 2-5 years, can also be beneficial, with studies finding higher butterfly abundance in prairies burned more than 1-4 years ago compared to recently burned areas (3883). The timing of burns is also important; one study found that early season burning increased caterpillar abundance, whereas late season burning did not (3878). A single prescribed burn can increase the abundance of some species like the heath fritillary, but decrease it for others like the regal fritillary (3882).",

Evidence from Sweden and the UK shows that organic farms had greater butterfly and burnet moth species richness and abundance than conventional farms, but this was only observed in intensively managed landscapes, not in more diverse landscapes (3907). Furthermore, both organic and conventional farms located within a landscape with a high proportion of organic farms had higher butterfly and burnet moth species richness than either farm type in a landscape dominated by conventional farms (3907). This suggests that the benefits of on-farm organic practices are greatest in otherwise simple agricultural landscapes.",

When restoring arable land to permanent grassland, butterfly communities showed increasing similarity to high-quality grasslands over the first 10 years (3929). However, another study on grassland restoration found that species richness was higher on grasslands created less than 10 years ago compared to those over 20 years old (3929). For restored forests, one study found a 54-year-old restored forest had a similar butterfly community to remnant forest, while 11–22-year-old restored forests did not (3936).",

Ceasing grazing or mowing can benefit some species but harm others; one review found that ceasing grazing benefitted 6 out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern (3956). In some cases, abandoned grasslands had a higher abundance of certain butterfly and moth species than grazed or mown grasslands (3956, 3957). Conversely, reducing grazing intensity by lowering stocking density was found to increase the abundance of butterflies and moths in several studies (3959). Similarly, reducing cutting frequency from multiple times a year to once a year was found to increase the abundance of some pollinators, including butterflies (3961). Overall, less intensively managed grasslands (e.g., lower grazing/mowing, no fertilizer) tend to have higher species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths than conventionally managed ones (3958).",

For vineyards, encouraging native plants and reducing insecticide use increased butterfly abundance but not richness in one study, while another found reduced chemical use increased richness (3919). For bioenergy crops, planting a diverse mix of species led to greater butterfly species richness and abundance than planting fewer species (3918).

Similarly, managing land under power lines, typically by mechanical cutting, was found to increase butterfly richness and abundance, with effectiveness depending on the time since management (3855).

Methods like group selection harvesting and shelterwood harvesting also had mixed effects on moth species richness compared to unharvested forest, but recovery of richness was faster after shelterwood harvesting than clearcutting (3868, 3871).

Some translocated populations have persisted for over a decade and increased in abundance, particularly when the reintroduction is combined with habitat management such as coppicing, planting of host plants, or invasive species removal (3909, 3911). However, a significant proportion of projects fail, with populations dying out within a few years (3909). For specialist parasitic species like the large blues, the success is highly dependent on the presence and condition of specific host ant colonies at the release site; for example, caterpillar survival was found to be higher in host ant nests that did not contain a queen (3909).",

Several studies found that maintaining semi-natural grassland with either light grazing or annual mowing resulted in similar butterfly species richness (3908). However, another study found staggered mowing was best for butterfly richness, while annual mowing was better than grazing for moth richness (3908). Long-term abandonment (ceasing grazing or mowing) often leads to a decline in species richness (3956, 3957). Prescribed fire had mixed results; one study found patch-burning led to lower butterfly richness than rotational grazing (3882).

    "question": "What are the benefits and negative impacts of using prescribed fire in forest and open grassland habitats for butterfly and moth conservation?",
    "answer": "Prescribed fire has both benefits and drawbacks. In forests, burning can increase the species richness and abundance of butterflies compared to unburned forest (3877). However, it can also cause short-term population declines, as seen with Eltham copper caterpillars (3877). In open grasslands, the effects are also mixed. While some studies found burning increased the abundance of species like the heath fritillary, others found it reduced the abundance of species like the Brenton blue butterfly and regal fritillary (3882). Fire can also reduce caterpillar survival in the year following a burn (3882).",

    "answer": "The evidence for legally protecting habitat shows varied effectiveness depending on location and habitat type. In Singapore, protected forests had higher butterfly species richness than unprotected fragments (3831). In the UK and Ireland, results were mixed: some studies found protected sites had higher butterfly abundance, while others found similar richness and abundance to unprotected sites (3831). In Ireland, protected raised bogs had similar moth species richness to unprotected ones (3831). In the USA, sites with the highest levels of protection saw stable butterfly abundances, whereas abundances decreased at sites with lower protection (3831).",

    "answer": "The response timeframe to woodland management varies. After patch clearing, butterfly species richness and abundance can be higher than in unmanaged areas but may decline over the first three years post-clearing (3938). The abundance of heath fritillary was found to be greatest in patches cleared 2-4 years previously, compared to more recent or older clearings (3938). For coppicing, butterfly abundance was higher in woodland coppiced two years ago compared to woodland coppiced over 15 years ago (3939). Another study found butterfly and moth abundance was highest in woodland coppiced 2-7 years ago compared to older coppice (3939).",

    "question": "In grassland habitats, what are the comparative effects on butterfly populations of reducing grazing intensity by lowering stocking density versus seasonally removing livestock?",
    "answer": "Reducing stocking density appears to have more consistently positive evidence for species richness than seasonal removal. Five of eight studies found lower stocking densities led to greater species richness of butterflies and moths, and eight studies found it resulted in greater abundance (3959). In contrast, two of three studies found that seasonally removing livestock resulted in a similar species richness to year-round grazing, although three studies did find higher abundance (3960). A review that did not distinguish between the two methods reported that reducing grazing intensity in general benefitted 41 out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern (3959, 3960).",

Ten studies found they supported higher butterfly abundance compared to conventional margins, cropped fields, or grassland, and two studies found they outperformed grass-only margins (3932). Floristically enhanced grass margins also had higher abundance than standard grass margins in four studies (3982, 3932). In contrast, uncultivated margins often had lower abundance than sown margins (3981). Evidence for set-aside areas and beetle banks was mixed or showed no significant increase in abundance compared to other habitats (3980, 3927).",

    "answer": "Actions are available to restore various open habitats with varying outcomes. For grasslands and savannas, restoration has been shown to increase butterfly abundance in some cases (3943). For heathlands, restoration can help moth communities recover and support translocated butterfly populations (3946). Peatland restoration by re-wetting has increased the abundance of specialist species, but one study found it could also lower the winter survival of caterpillars (3948). Wetland and floodplain restoration has shown mixed results, with one study finding increased egg abundance for a target species but another finding lower survival for eggs and caterpillars (3949).",

    "answer": "The benefits of disturbance management in wooded habitats appear to peak and then decline over time, suggesting a need for rotational management. In coppiced woodland, butterfly abundance was higher in areas coppiced up to 15 years ago compared to older coppice (3939). For cleared patches, one study found butterfly abundance declined over the first three years post-clearing, while another found peak abundance for heath fritillary at 2-4 years post-clearance (3938). Similarly, under power lines, butterfly species richness and abundance peaked 2-4 years after clearance, with some species only using areas cleared within the last two years (3855). This suggests a rotational cycle of roughly 2-7 years is often needed to maintain optimal conditions.",

In agricultural settings, general reductions in chemical inputs were linked to greater species richness and abundance in eight and six studies, respectively (3897). Specifically, not spraying headlands (3898) or converting to organic farming (3907) led to higher butterfly and moth numbers in the majority of studies. Restricting specific herbicides like glyphosate also resulted in greater butterfly richness and abundance (3896). In urban areas, restricting herbicide use on road verges was also found to increase butterfly richness and abundance in one study (3899).",

For instance, the benefits of organic farming for butterfly and moth richness and abundance were found to be greater in intensively managed agricultural landscapes than in already diverse landscapes (3907). In another example, legal protection of habitat does not guarantee positive outcomes; one study found that protected grasslands in 'Favourable' condition had worse population trends for several butterfly species than those in 'Unfavourable' condition, highlighting that the specific management within the protected area is critical (3831).",
