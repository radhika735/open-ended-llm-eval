    "answer": "Creating rock pools (3476), hole habitats (3467), pits (3475), and grooves (3473) have all been found to increase species richness on intertidal structures, sometimes in combination with other features like using environmentally-sensitive material. Creating small protrusions (3462) and creating grooves along with small ridges/ledges (3474) have also shown increases in species richness in some studies.",

    "question": "To boost invertebrate populations on intertidal structures in the UK, what is the most effective type of small depression to create: pits, holes, or grooves?",
    "answer": "Evidence from the UK suggests creating pits may be effective. One study found creating pits, along with using environmentally-sensitive material, increased barnacle and mobile invertebrate abundance (3475). Conversely, UK studies on creating grooves found they did not increase invertebrate or limpet abundance (3473). There is no specific UK evidence in the synopsis for creating hole habitats on intertidal structures (3467). Therefore, based on the available UK studies, creating pits appears more promising than grooves for this purpose.",

    "question": "What are the community-level effects of adding flexible habitats, like artificial turf or ropes, to marine structures?",
    "answer": "Adding flexible habitats generally alters community composition. On subtidal structures, long flexible habitats (>50 mm) altered non-mobile invertebrate communities and supported species absent from bare surfaces (3451), while short flexible habitats (1-50 mm) had mixed effects on invertebrate community composition (3450). On intertidal structures, both short (3459) and long (3460) flexible habitats altered the community composition of macroalgae and invertebrates, with long flexible habitats also supporting species not found on bare surfaces.",

    "answer": "The evidence for benefits is limited and mixed, with no negative impacts reported. On intertidal structures in the UK, creating natural topography did not increase overall species richness and had mixed effects on invertebrate abundance, but limpets were observed using the created features (3435). On subtidal structures in Italy, the intervention did not increase the abundance of juvenile macroalgae that settled on the surface (3446).",

    "question": "Besides creating swimthrough habitats, what other interventions show potential for enhancing fish populations on subtidal artificial structures?",
    "answer": "Several alternatives exist. Creating hole habitats (>50 mm), along with other features, altered the fish community and supported species absent from bare surfaces, although effects on abundance were mixed (3434). Similarly, creating grooves and pits alongside holes had mixed effects on fish abundance but altered community composition (3448, 3455). Managing or restricting harvesting on subtidal structures in Italy increased fish species richness and the abundance of some species like seabream (3457). Transplanting oysters onto subtidal structures in the USA increased overall fish species richness and diversity (3471).",

    "answer": "There is a large body of evidence showing material choice can alter community composition on subtidal structures (3470). Six of eleven replicated, controlled studies found that using materials such as shell-concrete, quarried rock, or proprietary products like ECOncreteTM altered the macroalgae and invertebrate community compared to standard concrete. Three of these studies also reported that modified surfaces supported species absent from controls. However, the effect is not guaranteed, as three studies found no effect on community composition, and one found mixed results.",

    "question": "What factors influence the survival of organisms transplanted onto artificial marine structures?",
    "answer": "Multiple factors affect transplant survival. For subtidal transplants, survival of canopy algae depended on wave-exposure, the presence and mesh size of protective cages, and the surrounding habitat (3471). For intertidal transplants, survival varied significantly by species, site, shore level, and the presence of microhabitats like grooves and ridges (3472). For example, transplanted oysters had higher survival in grooves than on ridges, and macroalgae survived better at mid- and high-shore levels than low-shore (3472).",

    "answer": "On subtidal structures in the USA and Italy, creating textured surfaces altered community composition in two of three studies but did not consistently increase overall abundance (3449). On intertidal structures, studies from the UK and the Netherlands show mixed results. One UK study found creating textured surfaces had mixed effects on species richness and invertebrate abundance, depending on the type of texture and site, while another found increased barnacle abundance (3466). However, two studies in the Netherlands reported that creating textured surfaces did not increase macroalgal or invertebrate abundance (3466). This suggests effectiveness varies by location and context, not just tidal zone.",

Creating pits, grooves, and ridges had mixed effects on community composition and abundance, depending on the size and arrangement of the habitats and the site (3475, 3474, 3464, 3462). One study found that creating small protrusions and ridges increased species richness (3462). Another found that adding pits and grooves together increased fish species richness and abundance (3473, 3475). In one case, varying the size and arrangement of grooves and ridges increased species richness, but in another study, the effect on richness depended on the shore level (3474, 3464).",
