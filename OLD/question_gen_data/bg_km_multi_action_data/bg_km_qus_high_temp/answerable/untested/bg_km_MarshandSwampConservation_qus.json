        "answer": "The database provides evidence for abandoning cropland to allow freshwater marshes or swamps to recover (2952), which is rated as 'Likely to be beneficial'. Evidence shows abandoned rice, soybean, or pasture lands saw plant communities become more like natural marshes over time, with increased species richness and biomass. There is also evidence for abandoning aquaculture facilities to allow brackish/saline swamps to recover (2983), where an abandoned shrimp pond developed a mangrove forest over 14 years, though with a shorter canopy than a natural forest. No evidence was found for abandoning cropland for brackish/saline marshes (2953), abandoning plantations (2956), or abandoning aquaculture for freshwater habitats (2982).",

Studies found that cutting increased plant species richness, and grazing also led to increases in plant species richness and diversity. In contrast, using prescribed fire (3054) has a 'Trade off between benefit and harms'. While it can increase plant richness in the long term, some studies found it had no effect or even reduced richness in the short term, and could also reduce overall vegetation biomass.",

        "answer": "Reducing livestock grazing intensity is rated as 'Likely to be beneficial' for both freshwater (2970) and brackish/salt marshes (2971). In three studies of freshwater marshes, lighter grazing resulted in taller vegetation and greater cover of some native sedges compared to heavier grazing. In nine studies of brackish/salt marshes, lower grazing intensities also resulted in taller vegetation and, in some cases, increased plant species richness, although several studies found no difference in richness between grazing intensities. No evidence was found for freshwater or brackish/saline swamps (2972, 2973).",

Raising the water level to restore degraded freshwater marshes (3026) was found in one study to lead to lower total plant species richness and cover over nine years. Another study reported that rewetted marshes became dominated by a non-native wetland shrub. Similarly, using prescribed fire (3054) in freshwater marshes sometimes resulted in a short-term reduction in plant species richness or diversity, and one study found that burned plots contained less vegetation biomass than unburned plots after a year.",

Grazing was also found to affect community composition and, in some cases, limit colonization by common reed, although it could reduce overall vegetation abundance compared to ungrazed areas.
