    "question": "What actions can be taken to restore vegetation on peatlands after mining or peat extraction?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests a couple of approaches. Replacing blocks of vegetation after mining has been shown to be effective, with transplanted blocks retaining their original peatland plant community in both bogs and fens [1738]. Another approach is to fill or block ditches created during extraction. Studies show that blocked or filled ditches can be colonized by herbs and bryophytes within a few years, with one study in a fen finding vegetation cover was restored to undisturbed levels [1805].",

For mowing, studies in fens and bogs found it had no significant effect on overall plant community composition in some cases, but did increase Sphagnum moss cover and reduce purple moor grass in one study [1770]. Prescribed fire has been shown to reduce heather cover in bogs and increase cottongrass cover, but also reduce overall plant species richness [1774]. Notably, using fire carries a 'Trade off between benefit and harms' rating, while mowing's effectiveness is rated as 'Unknown'.",

However, a key factor for greater success appears to be combining tree removal with rewetting the peat [1732]. This combined action is also rated 'Likely to be beneficial' and has been shown to increase the abundance of wetland-characteristic plants, Sphagnum mosses, and herbs like cottongrasses and sedges.

    "question": "What are the general effects of rewetting on different vegetation groups in drained peatlands?",
    "answer": "Rewetting drained peatlands is rated as a 'beneficial' action with wide-ranging effects on vegetation (1756). Based on thirty-six studies, the most consistent positive effects are on mosses and herbs. Twelve of nineteen studies reported an increase in Sphagnum moss cover. Twenty-one of twenty-five studies found rewetting increased the cover of at least one herb group, most notably cottongrasses and sedges. The effect on woody plants is less clear; seven of thirteen studies reported that rewetting reduced tree and/or shrub cover, while six reported no effect.",

    "question": "What are the documented benefits and harms of using prescribed fire for peatland management?",
    "answer": "The evidence indicates a trade-off between benefits and harms. When used to control problematic plants like heather in bogs (1774), prescribed fire can increase moss cover but may also reduce overall plant species richness. When used to maintain or restore disturbance, primarily in fens (1763), fire can reduce tree and shrub cover and sometimes increase species richness. However, it can also have negative effects, such as reducing the cover of certain herb groups or having no effect on fen-characteristic mosses. Therefore, while fire can be a tool to control dominant vegetation, it risks harming other components of the plant community.",

    "question": "Besides total livestock exclusion, what other management actions can be used to restore vegetation on degraded peatlands impacted by grazing?",
    "answer": "There are several alternatives to complete livestock exclusion (1734). One option is to reduce grazing intensity (1735); a single study in bogs found that lower intensity grazing led to greater vegetation, shrub, and cottongrass cover. Another approach is to use grazing as a managed disturbance (1762), which has shown mixed results in fens: some studies found increased herb cover, while others reported reduced Sphagnum cover and species richness. A non-grazing alternative is to introduce cutting or mowing to restore disturbance (1759). In fens and fen meadows, this has been shown to be likely beneficial, increasing characteristic plants, moss cover, and species richness.",

    "answer": "Several interventions have been studied for controlling problematic plants in fens. Physically removing problematic plants, specifically moss carpets, increased cover of fen-characteristic plants (1768). Cutting or mowing was found in one study to make plant communities different from unmown plots and could reduce purple moor grass cover (1770). A parasitic plant introduced to a fen meadow reduced the dominant sedge and increased species richness (1777). Cutting large trees/shrubs also changed the plant community and increased fen-characteristic plants (1772). Applying herbicide to shrubs in fens changed the plant community but couldn't prevent shrub cover increase over time and prevented increases in species richness (1776).",

    "answer": "Several interventions rated as beneficial or likely to be beneficial have been studied. Spreading mosses (1821) or mixed vegetation fragments (1822) onto the peatland surface is rated as 'Beneficial', with multiple studies showing they establish successfully, increasing moss and vascular plant cover. Restoring peatland vegetation using the moss layer transfer technique, which includes rewetting, reprofiling, and adding plant fragments, is rated as 'Likely to be beneficial' for restoring bog vegetation (1804). Removing the upper layer of soil from fens or fen meadows is also rated as 'Likely to be beneficial', as studies found it increased cover of wetland-characteristic plants (1809).",

When used to restore historic disturbance, it was found to reduce tree/shrub cover and, in two of three studies, increase plant species richness. However, herb cover results were mixed (1763).

When combined with rewetting, studies also reported increased cover of herbs and increased species richness, but additionally reported changes to the plant community composition and increased Sphagnum cover (1732). There is more evidence available for the combined action, with eleven studies compared to four for tree removal alone (1732). One study in rich fens found that while tree removal increased plant species richness, the effect was much smaller in rewetted plots than in drained plots (1731).",
