    "question": "What are the comparative effects on natural enemies of allowing natural regeneration of ground cover versus using grazing for pasture management?",
    "answer": "Allowing natural regeneration of ground cover was found to increase natural enemies in two of five studies, though three found mixed effects (720). In contrast, using grazing instead of cutting for pasture management had mixed effects on natural enemies in two studies and no effect in another (885).",

    "answer": "Push-pull systems (753) and growing non-crop plants that produce attractive chemicals (724) appear beneficial. Two studies found push-pull systems had more natural predators (753), and three of four studies found planting chemically-attractive non-crop plants increased natural enemies (724). Using manufactured attractive chemicals directly also showed positive effects, but they were more variable (754).",

    "answer": "The effects are varied. Adding hedges had no effect on crop spiders in one study (752). Alley cropping increased some natural enemies (wasps, spiders) but decreased others (ladybirds) and was found to increase pests in two studies (718). Beetle banks were found to increase predators in adjacent crops in a review, but other studies showed slow movement or no effect on predation, while pests were sometimes reduced (729).",

Organic farming was found to have a negative effect on yield in one study and decreased profit in another without a price premium (717). Alley cropping was found to lower both yield and profit in one study (718). Incorporating plant remains that produce weed-controlling chemicals can inhibit crop growth and negatively affect yield (728).",

    "question": "Besides converting to organic farming, what are alternative strategies for reducing insecticide applications while maintaining pest control?",
    "answer": "One alternative is to apply pesticides only when pests reach damaging threshold levels; this reduced the number of applications in nine studies (750). Another is to alter the timing of insecticide use, for example by spraying earlier in the season (723). For specific crops like potatoes, using crop rotation has been shown to reduce the need for insecticide treatments (719).",

    "answer": "Leaving part of a pasture uncut was found to increase the abundance of predatory insects or spiders in three studies, although two other studies found differing effects between species (725). Conversely, delaying mowing was found in one study to reduce predatory spider numbers, with other studies finding no change or mixed effects on different predator groups (727).",

    "question": "What actions involving the addition of non-crop vegetation can be used to increase natural enemy populations in and around crop fields?",
    "answer": "Several actions can be used. Creating beetle banks (raised grass strips) was found to increase predator numbers on the banks themselves, and in some cases, in adjacent crops (729). Planting new hedges can provide habitat, with some studies finding more natural enemies in hedges than in adjacent crops (752). Another approach is to grow non-crop plants that produce attractive chemicals, which was found in three studies to increase the numbers of natural enemies (724).",

    "answer": "The evidence is mixed. Incorporating plant remains that produce weed-controlling chemicals was found to reduce weed growth in five of eight studies, but three of these found the effects varied with conditions, and two studies found the effect was short-lived (728). This practice can also have negative impacts, with two of three studies finding it inhibited crop growth (728). Organic farming, which can involve similar practices, was found in three out of four studies to result in more weeds (717).",
