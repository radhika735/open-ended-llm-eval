    "answer": "Evidence suggests that using salt water and lightproof barriers are the most effective non-chemical methods. Two container trials and two field trials found that seawater eradicated Crassula helmsii (1288). Similarly, five studies found that covering the plant with black sheeting or carpet strips eradicated or severely reduced it (1294). In contrast, other non-chemical methods have been found to be unlikely to be beneficial, including using hot foam (1286), aquatic dyes (1293), grazing (1301), and hydrogen peroxide (1281).",
