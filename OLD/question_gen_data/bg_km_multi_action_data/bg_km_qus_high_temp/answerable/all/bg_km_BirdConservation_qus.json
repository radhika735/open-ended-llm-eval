    "answer": "Several methods have been trialled to reduce seabird bycatch from longlines. These include setting lines at night (283), although this can increase bycatch of some night-hunting species. Using streamer lines has strong evidence for reducing bycatch (285). Other techniques with some evidence of effectiveness include weighting lines to make them sink faster (296), using bait throwers (291), dyeing bait blue (293), thawing bait before use (298), and strategically releasing offal away from the lines during setting (299). Conversely, using a line shooter was found to be ineffective or harmful (290).",

In US pine forests, burning benefits open habitat species but can negatively affect closed-forest and ground-nesting species (318).

For grasslands, some species increase in density while others decrease, and the effects can depend on the time since the fire (322).

Individual exclosures or barriers are also likely to be beneficial, with studies showing higher productivity and hatching rates for waders and songbirds (398, 400).
