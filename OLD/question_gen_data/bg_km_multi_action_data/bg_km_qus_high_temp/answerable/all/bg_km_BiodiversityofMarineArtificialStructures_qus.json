Creating small protrusions (3462) and creating grooves along with small ridges/ledges (3474) have also shown increases in species richness in some studies.",

    "question": "To boost invertebrate populations on intertidal structures in the UK, what is the most effective type of small depression to create: pits, holes, or grooves?",
    "answer": "Evidence from the UK suggests creating pits may be effective. One study found creating pits, along with using environmentally-sensitive material, increased barnacle and mobile invertebrate abundance (3475). Conversely, UK studies on creating grooves found they did not increase invertebrate or limpet abundance (3473). There is no specific UK evidence in the synopsis for creating hole habitats on intertidal structures (3467). Therefore, based on the available UK studies, creating pits appears more promising than grooves for this purpose.",

Six of eleven replicated, controlled studies found that using materials such as shell-concrete, quarried rock, or proprietary products like ECOncreteTM altered the macroalgae and invertebrate community compared to standard concrete.

    "answer": "Multiple factors affect transplant survival. For subtidal transplants, survival of canopy algae depended on wave-exposure, the presence and mesh size of protective cages, and the surrounding habitat (3471). For intertidal transplants, survival varied significantly by species, site, shore level, and the presence of microhabitats like grooves and ridges (3472). For example, transplanted oysters had higher survival in grooves than on ridges, and macroalgae survived better at mid- and high-shore levels than low-shore (3472).",

However, two studies in the Netherlands reported that creating textured surfaces did not increase macroalgal or invertebrate abundance (3466).

Creating pits, grooves, and ridges had mixed effects on community composition and abundance, depending on the size and arrangement of the habitats and the site (3475, 3474, 3464, 3462). One study found that creating small protrusions and ridges increased species richness (3462). Another found that adding pits and grooves together increased fish species richness and abundance (3473, 3475).
