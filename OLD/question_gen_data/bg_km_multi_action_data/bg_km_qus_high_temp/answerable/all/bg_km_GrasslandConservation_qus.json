    "question": "What methods can be used to prepare soil before seeding to enhance grassland restoration?",
    "answer": "Several soil preparation methods exist. Disturbing soil by ploughing or tilling can increase plant emergence and seedling richness (3413). Removing topsoil before seeding can increase the similarity to intact steppe, boost plant species richness, and improve the survival of planted seedlings (3415). Applying herbicide can also increase sown species richness and abundance (3418). Conversely, removing leaf litter before sowing has shown mixed or no significant effects on seedling emergence or sown species cover (3414).",

    "answer": "In the UK, strip seeding was found to increase both grass and forb species richness (3411). However, one review noted that it often resulted in failed introductions of sown species (3411). For comparison, removing turf before sowing also increased grass and forb species richness, more so than just disturbing the soil (3415). Disturbing soil by rotovating before sowing also increased grass and forb richness compared to harrowing (3413).",

Increasing the number of species in a seed mix also directly increased the richness of sown plants in two US studies (3406). Planting grassland plants, especially forbs, was also effective, increasing forb species richness in 83% of cases in one UK study (3399).

Sowing native grass and forb seeds is a common approach, with sixteen studies showing it increased overall species richness (3432). Using seeds from a local source can increase plant species richness compared to commercial mixes (3400). For grasslands dominated by competitive grasses, sowing parasitic species like yellow rattle can increase overall plant diversity by suppressing grass growth (3404). Sowing seeds of nurse plants has also been tried, but one study found it did not increase species richness and actually reduced similarity to intact steppe (3401).",
