Uncropped margins sown with native wildflower seed mixes (with mowing) increased bumblebee abundance—and in several trials species richness—over cropped, grassy, or naturally regenerated margins; inclusion of perennial leguminous herbs was an important forage resource, particularly for long‑tongued species, and some long‑tongued bumblebees preferred perennial wildflower mixes over annual forage mixes [19]. Leaving margins to naturally regenerate sometimes supported more bumblebees than cropped margins, but outcomes were inconsistent between years and often depended on thistles, which may require control; in some trials naturally regenerated margins did not exceed cropped margins for bumblebee abundance or diversity [20]. Sown grassy field margins showed mixed results, with some trials finding higher bumblebee abundance (and sometimes diversity) and others finding no improvement over cropped margins [14]. At a broader scale, farms implementing agri‑environment scheme options (including field margin measures) sometimes showed enhanced foraging wild bee abundance or diversity compared to conventional management, but other trials found no enhancement, and population‑level benefits for bumblebees were not consistently detected [24]. Evidence from wider wildlife studies also indicates that leaving cultivated, uncropped margins or plots can benefit bumblebees among other taxa [562].",
