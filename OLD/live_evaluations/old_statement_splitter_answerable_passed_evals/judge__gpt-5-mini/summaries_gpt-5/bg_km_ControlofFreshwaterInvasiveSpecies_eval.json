Covering with carpet followed by glyphosate killed 80% in a single‑pond study [1313]. Evidence on other herbicides was mixed: diquat or diquat alginate reduced cover or eradicated submerged plants in three of four studies, with one small trial finding no effect; dichlobenil and terbutryne only partially reduced biomass in some trials, and one small field study found no effect of dichlobenil; asulam, 2,4‑D amine and dalapon reduced emergent plants in one replicated, controlled study [1279]. Physical (lightproof barriers): Five before‑and‑after UK studies found black sheeting or carpet strips eradicated or severely reduced cover, though two sites later had progressive recolonization after initial eradication [1294]. Physical (salt water): Two replicated, controlled container trials and two before‑and‑after field trials in the UK found seawater eradicated C. helmsii [1288].",
