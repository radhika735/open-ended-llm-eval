For invertebrates, long flexible habitats in studies that included Australia showed mixed effects on abundance depending on species group, survey week, and habitat characteristics, and studies in Australia and the Netherlands reported that such habitats supported macroalgae and non‑mobile invertebrate or fish species that were absent from surfaces without flexible habitats [3451]. Creating short flexible habitats in Australia yielded mixed effects on seahorse abundance depending on the survey week [3450], and studies in Australia and France reported mixed effects on invertebrate abundance depending on survey week, species group, habitat length, or site, with one study finding no effect on mobile invertebrate abundance [3450]. Overall, both short and long flexible habitats in Australia have shown mixed responses for fish (including seahorses) and invertebrate populations, with long habitats additionally associated with use by seahorses and the presence of species absent from control surfaces [3451][3450].",
