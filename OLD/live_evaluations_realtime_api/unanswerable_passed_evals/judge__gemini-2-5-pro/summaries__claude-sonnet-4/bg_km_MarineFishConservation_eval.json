Additionally, sites inside a protected area that had been prohibiting dredging for approximately 2.5 years had different combined invertebrate and fish community composition compared to unprotected dredged sites (Action 2228).",

It evaluates the impact on 'fish community composition,' which is a core component of the 'marine fish populations' mentioned in the question. The finding that composition differed suggests that even if abundance or richness (as mentioned in other statements) doesn't change, the types of species present can be affected by dredging restrictions.
