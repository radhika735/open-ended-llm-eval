Establishing fallowing systems can reduce parasites and disease, with a study in Scotland recording lower lice numbers on Atlantic salmon in cages using a fallowing system (Action ID: 1026). Breeding for resistance traits has shown effectiveness, as a study in Norway found increased survival levels in salmon exposed to infectious pancreatic necrosis when the family was bred for high resistance to the disease compared to a family bred for low resistance (Action ID: 735). Leaving fallow periods during fish farming has been studied, with three studies examining effects on invertebrate populations, showing that fallow periods allow invertebrate community composition to become more similar to pre-farming conditions (Action ID: 2191). Additional recommended practices include sourcing spat and juveniles from areas or hatcheries not infested with diseases or non-native or problematic species (Action ID: 2159), reducing aquaculture stocking densities (Action ID: 2186), locating aquaculture systems in areas with fast currents (Action ID: 2188), and improving fish food and pellets to reduce waste production (Action ID: 2192).",
