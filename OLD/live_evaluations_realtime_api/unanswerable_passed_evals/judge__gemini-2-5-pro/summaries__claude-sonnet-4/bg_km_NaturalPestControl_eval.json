Additionally, the pollen from genetically modified maize expressing the Btk toxin did not reduce the growth of eastern tiger swallowtail or spicebush swallowtail caterpillars more than pollen from non-genetically modified maize. This study evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of using genetically modified crops which produce pesticide to replace conventional pesticide application.",
