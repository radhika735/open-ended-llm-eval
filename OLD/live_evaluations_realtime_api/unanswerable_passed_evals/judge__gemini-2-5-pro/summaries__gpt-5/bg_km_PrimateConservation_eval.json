The reported lack of evidence for this analogous strategy is highly relevant because it raises significant questions about the underlying principle of deterrence through unpalatability, which is central to the proposed GM strategy.",

While the statement does mention primates, it is in the context of a technology that is irrelevant to the strategy described in the question.
