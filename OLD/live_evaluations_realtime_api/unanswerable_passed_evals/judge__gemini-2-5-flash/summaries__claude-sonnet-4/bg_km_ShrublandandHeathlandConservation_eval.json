One systematic review found that cutting may be equally effective as herbicide asulam for reducing bracken abundance (Action 105). Cutting bracken was found to reduce bracken cover or biomass in multiple studies, with one randomized, controlled, before-and-after trial in Norway and two randomized, controlled studies in the UK showing effectiveness (Action 1653). However, results were mixed, with one study showing cutting had mixed effects on bracken cover and another finding no decrease in bracken abundance (Action 1653). Herbicide application was also evaluated, with three randomized, controlled studies in the UK finding that herbicide application reduced bracken biomass or cover, though one study found no change in bracken abundance (Action 1652). The use of a 'bracken bruiser' was found to actually increase bracken cover in one study (Action 1726). No studies were found evaluating herbicide combined with sowing shrubland plant seeds (Action 1658) or cutting and burning methods (Action 1655) specifically in shrublands.",
