Additionally, no studies have been found that evaluated the effects of breeding bats in captivity specifically to supplement wild populations affected by white-nose syndrome (Action 2009). While studies have documented successful captive breeding of bats, with 6-100% of female bats successfully conceiving, giving birth and rearing young in captivity, and 20-100% of bat pups surviving from 10 days to adulthood in captive settings (Action 2053), there is no evidence available regarding the success rates of reintroducing these captive-bred bats into wild populations, particularly in areas affected by white-nose syndrome. The only related evidence comes from rehabilitation studies, where 70-90% of hand-reared pipistrelle bats survived for at least 4-14 days after release into the wild, with six of 21 bats joining wild bat colonies, and 13% of ringed hand-reared bats were found alive 38 days to almost four years after release (Action 2054).",

                "reasoning": "This statement is relevant because it frames the existing body of knowledge regarding bat reintroduction success. By clarifying that all current evidence stems from 'rehabilitation studies' (which typically involve wild bats that are rescued and then released, rather than bats specifically bred in captivity for reintroduction programs), it indirectly supports the conclusion that data for 'captive-bred bats' reintroduction is scarce or non-existent, especially in the context of white-nose syndrome.",

                "reasoning": "While this statement provides a survival rate after 'release into the wild', it refers to 'hand-reared' bats (often orphaned or injured wild bats raised in captivity) from 'rehabilitation studies', as implied by Statement 9. The question specifically asks about 'captive-bred bats' (implying bats born of captive parents for reintroduction programs) and, crucially, 'in areas affected by white-nose syndrome'. Since this statement does not meet these specific criteria (type of bat source and environmental context), it is not sufficiently relevant to directly answer the precise question.",

                "reasoning": "This statement offers a metric of integration for 'bats released from rehabilitation studies'. However, as with Statement 10, these are typically wild, injured, or orphaned bats, not 'captive-bred' bats specifically produced for population supplementation. Furthermore, it does not specify 'areas affected by white-nose syndrome', which is a critical part of the question's scope.",

                "reasoning": "Similar to Statements 10 and 11, this provides a long-term survival rate for 'hand-reared bats' from 'rehabilitation studies'. These bats do not align with the question's focus on 'captive-bred bats' (from breeding programs) nor does the statement provide any context regarding 'areas affected by white-nose syndrome'.
