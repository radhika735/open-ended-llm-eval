A study in Scotland found that fallowing, the practice of leaving cages empty, was associated with lower numbers of sea lice (1026). However, another study in Australia found that fallowing did not reduce mortality from Amoebic Gill Disease (1026). In terms of dietary supplements, one study in Scotland showed that probiotics increased the survival of salmon when they were exposed to bacteria that cause diseases (732). A study in Norway found that a diet containing 28% plant-based protein reduced infections from sea lice by 28%, and the addition of beta-glucans to the diet further decreased the levels of lice infection by 28% (732). The same study also found that the addition of mannan oligosaccharides improved the function of the gut (732). The use of cleaner wrasse as a natural control agent has had mixed results in two studies in Ireland (738). One study found that corkwing and goldskinny wrasse were as effective as chemical treatments for the control of lice, while another study found that rockcook wrasse were not effective at preventing outbreaks of lice (738).",
