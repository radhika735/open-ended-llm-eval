A fourth study noted that while lesser sandeel biomass and density peaked, there was no overall increase in the three years following a long-term fishery closure (2655).\n\nIn contrast, a study on temporary fishery closures found no increase in the biomass of spawning cod when compared to fished areas over a nine-year period (2664).
