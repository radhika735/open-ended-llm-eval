In a Canadian laboratory study, little brown bats treated with the probiotic at the time of infection showed increased survival, while those treated 21 days prior to infection experienced worse symptoms (2008). A study in the USA found that treating little brown bats with a probiotic in a mine increased survival for free-flying bats, but not for those in cages (2008). The US study also found that the severity of white-nose syndrome in caged bats treated with a probiotic was similar to untreated bats (2008). No studies were found that evaluated the effectiveness of breeding bats in captivity to supplement wild populations affected by white-nose syndrome (2009) or the effects of decontaminating clothing and equipment after entering caves to reduce the spread of the pathogen on bat populations (2006).",
