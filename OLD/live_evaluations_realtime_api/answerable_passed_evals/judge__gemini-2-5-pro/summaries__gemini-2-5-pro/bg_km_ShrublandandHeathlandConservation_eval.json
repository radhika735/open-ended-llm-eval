One UK study found that herbicide application increased heather biomass, the number of plant species, and the cover of wavy hair-grass and sheep's fescue (1652). However, another UK study found that herbicide had no effect on species richness or diversity (1652). Herbicide application has been found to reduce bracken abundance and biomass in multiple UK studies, though one study found no change (1652).\n\nCutting bracken has been shown to increase heather cover or biomass in studies in Norway and the UK, but two UK studies found no increase in heather cover or seedlings (1653). One UK study found that cutting increased heathland plant species richness, while another found it increased species diversity but not richness (1653). Cutting has been found to increase the cover of wavy hair-grass and sheep's fescue in one UK study (1653). Most studies in the UK and Norway have found that cutting reduces bracken cover or biomass, with one UK study showing mixed effects and another showing no decrease in bracken abundance (1653).\n\nA combination of cutting and applying herbicide was found in a UK study to have no effect on heather biomass, while a Norwegian trial found it increased heather cover (1654). One UK study found that cutting followed by herbicide application increased plant species richness compared to applying herbicide and then cutting (1654). Three studies in the UK and Norway found that cutting and applying herbicide together reduced bracken biomass or cover (1654).",
