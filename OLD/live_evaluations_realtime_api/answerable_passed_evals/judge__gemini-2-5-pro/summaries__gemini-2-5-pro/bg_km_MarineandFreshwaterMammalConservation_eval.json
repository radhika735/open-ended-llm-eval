      "relevant_summary": "Six studies evaluated the use of acoustic devices at aquaculture systems [2775]. Four of these studies, conducted in the North Atlantic Ocean, the Reloncav√≠ fjord, and the Mediterranean Sea, found that using acoustic devices at salmon farms reduced predation on caged salmon by grey seals, harbour seals, and South American sea lions, or decreased the number of harbour seals approaching a fish cage. However, two other studies reported that acoustic devices did not lessen harbour seal predation at salmon farms, nor did they affect the presence, approach distances, group sizes, or time that common bottlenose dolphins spent around fin-fish farms [2775].\n\nIn comparison, thirty-three studies have examined the effects of acoustic devices on fishing gear [2808]. Within this body of research, twelve of sixteen controlled studies on behaviour change showed that these devices led to harbour porpoises, common bottlenose dolphins, tuxuci dolphins, finless porpoises, and seals approaching nets less, having fewer interactions with them, or showing reduced activity in the vicinity. Four studies, however, found no significant behavioural effect on common bottlenose dolphins, harbour porpoises, Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins, or dugongs [2808]. Additionally, nine of fourteen studies on bycatch found that acoustic devices on fishing nets or traps resulted in fewer collisions of humpback whales or entanglements of harbour porpoises, Franciscana dolphins, beaked whales, and small cetaceans [2808]. On the topic of human-wildlife conflict, five of six studies found that acoustic devices reduced damage to fish catches and fishing nets caused by common bottlenose dolphins and seals [2808]. One study showed no reduction in damage to swordfish catches by California sea lions [2808].",
