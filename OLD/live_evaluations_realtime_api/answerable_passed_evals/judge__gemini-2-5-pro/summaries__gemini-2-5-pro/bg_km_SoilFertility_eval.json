In terms of soil health, twelve studies showed higher soil organic carbon under reduced tillage (906), and eight studies found it maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure (906). Four studies also noted an increase in microbes and earthworm populations (906). However, the effects are not all positive. Three replicated trials reported higher soil compaction under reduced tillage (906). The impact on soil erosion is mixed; seven trials showed reduced soil loss, but two showed increased soil loss when there was no crop cover (906). For biodiversity, 34 studies from European countries found some positive effects on earthworms, invertebrates, weeds, or farmland birds (126). Some studies also found higher species richness or diversity for some or all bird groups (211). Reduced tillage fields can have higher densities of certain bird species, with one review noting that no-till systems provide more invertebrate bird food resources (126, 211). On the other hand, 26 studies found that reducing tillage had negative, null, or inconsistent effects on some invertebrates, earthworms, weeds, and bird species (126). The effects on crop yields are also inconsistent. One study found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage (906), another found no effect of tillage on yield (906), and a third found higher yields when subsoiling was performed (906).",
