      "relevant_summary": "Several actions to mitigate the impacts of roads on amphibian populations have been studied. Two studies in Germany found that closing roads during seasonal amphibian migration protected large numbers of amphibians from death [842]. Six out of seven studies in several countries, including Canada, Germany, and the USA, showed that installing culverts or tunnels significantly reduced amphibian road deaths [884]. However, one study found that this was only effective when barrier fencing was also installed [884]. The use of these crossings by amphibians is supported by 15 of 24 studies, which found that 23-100% of culverts or tunnels were used by amphibians [884]. The effectiveness and use of these crossings can be influenced by their design, including diameter, length, lighting, and substrate [884]. Some culvert designs, such as those with one-way tunnels and vertical entry chutes, were found to be unsuitable and resulted in high mortality rates [884]. One study also noted that despite the installation of culverts, thousands of amphibians were still killed on the road [884]. Human assistance for migrating amphibians has also been studied. Despite efforts to move large numbers of amphibians across roads, two studies in Italy and the UK observed population declines of 64-70% over 6-10 years in toad populations that were being assisted [784]. In the UK, one study found that over 500 toads were still killed on roads at 7% of sites with human assistance patrols [784].",
