      "relevant_summary": "Leaving uncut strips of rye grass on silage fields in the UK has been found to benefit birds by increasing their numbers (132). While seed-eating birds were found to prefer rye grass cut only once, insect-eating birds showed more variable results, with some preferring plots cut two or more times (132). In the first two years of one study, there was no difference in ground beetle abundance and diversity between cut and uncut silage field headlands, but the uncut plots had a higher species diversity in the third year (132). There were no studies found that looked at the effects on mammals of leaving uncut areas of ryegrass in silage fields (2400).\n\nRaising the mowing height on grasslands in the UK has been found to provide benefits to Eurasian skylarks, including increased productivity (138). One review also found that raised cutting heights were less damaging to amphibians and invertebrates (138). However, another study in the UK found that raising the mowing height on grasslands had no effect on the numbers of foraging birds or invertebrates, and a separate study found no difference in invertebrate abundance (138). Foraging success of northern lapwing and common starling chicks was found to be greater in shorter grass (138). For butterflies and moths, one UK study on intensively managed grassland found that plots cut to 10 cm had a similar species richness and abundance of butterflies and caterpillars to plots cut to 5 cm (3968). A UK review noted that while raising the mowing height may have increased the productivity of Eurasian skylarks, it was not enough to maintain the local population (222).",
