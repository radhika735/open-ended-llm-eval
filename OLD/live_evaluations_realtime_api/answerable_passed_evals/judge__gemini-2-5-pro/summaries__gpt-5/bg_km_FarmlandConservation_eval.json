Seed-eating birds were more abundant on uncut and ungrazed plots than on uncut and grazed plots (224). A replicated, controlled, randomized UK study found no difference in ground beetle abundance and diversity between cut and uncut headlands in the first two years, but higher species diversity in uncut plots in the third year; no studies were found assessing effects on mammals (132, 2400). Raising mowing/cutting height: A replicated, controlled study and a review from the UK found raised mowing heights benefited Eurasian skylark, including increased productivity, and a review reported raised cutting heights were less damaging to amphibians and invertebrates (138). However, a randomized, replicated, controlled UK trial found no effect of raised mowing height on numbers of foraging birds or invertebrates, and one replicated controlled study found no difference in invertebrate abundance (138). A UK review found raised mowing height may have increased skylark productivity but not enough to maintain the local population (222). On intensively managed UK grassland, plots cut to 10 cm had similar butterfly species richness and abundance to plots cut to 5 cm (3968).",
