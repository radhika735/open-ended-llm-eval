Dietary and immune-based approaches include probiotics that increased survival after exposure to four bacterial pathogens, and diets with 28% plant protein that reduced lice infections by 28% with an additional 28% reduction when beta-glucans were added; mannan oligosaccharides improved gut function by preventing soybean-induced enteritis (732). Operational fallowing reduced lice numbers in one Scottish study, though an Australian study found no difference in Amoebic Gill Disease mortality (1026). Selective breeding for disease resistance increased survival against infectious pancreatic necrosis (735). Aerobic training increased survival against infectious pancreatic necrosis, with interval training outperforming continuous training (740). Freshwater bathing to manage amoebic gill disease showed mixed results, with one study reporting reduced amoebae for up to 10 days and another finding no difference (739).",
