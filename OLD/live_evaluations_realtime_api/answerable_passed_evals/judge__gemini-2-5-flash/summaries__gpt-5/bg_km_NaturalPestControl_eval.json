Additional studies report that delaying mowing/grazing increased some natural enemy groups (greater abundance of some spiders and ground beetles) and more insect species/individuals visiting flowers in some cases, while other studies found no clear effect on some insects and spiders (ID: 131). Using grazing instead of cutting also shows mixed outcomes: effects on natural enemies varied by species/date with one study finding no effect; among five studies on pests/diseases, one found more pests, two found effects varied by pest group/date, and two found no effect; one study found no effect on disease when grazing was used in addition to cutting (ID: 885).",
