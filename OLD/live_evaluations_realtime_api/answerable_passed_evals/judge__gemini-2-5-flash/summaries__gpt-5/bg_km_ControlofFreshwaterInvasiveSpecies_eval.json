This statement provides a concrete example of physical removal (hand pulling and raking) failing to achieve success. The failure itself implies that certain factors were at play (e.g., initial infestation size, regeneration capacity from fragments, environmental conditions) that prevented the treatment from being effective. Understanding why removal fails is crucial to identifying factors that lead to success, making this statement directly relevant.",

Crucially, it highlights 'smaller population' as a potential factor influencing this success. This directly informs what conditions (i.e., population size) might lead to effective physical removal, especially for plants capable of regenerating from fragments, thus making it highly relevant to the question of influencing factors.",

It points to 'recently established plants' and 'over five years' as crucial elements. This suggests that factors like early intervention (plant age/establishment stage) and sustained, long-term effort are important for success, particularly when dealing with plants that can regenerate. These are key influencing factors for success.",

It explicitly links success (was effective) to the 'small outbreak' of plants. While the 'small-growing plant' descriptor might be a general point, the 'small outbreak' size is a clear factor influencing success. This directly contributes to understanding the conditions under which physical removal methods can be successful, aligning with the question's focus on influencing factors.",

This illustrates the challenges and intensity of effort required for success, or the factors (like initial infestation size, resilience, or fragmentation regeneration) that can prolong the removal process and necessitate sustained effort. It highlights implicitly negative influencing factors or the difficulty of overcoming regeneration, thus directly relating to what factors influence the *rate* or *ease* of success.",
