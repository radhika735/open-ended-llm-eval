A replicated, paired, controlled study reported reduced cover of forest‑characteristic mosses [1731]. In a drained rich fen, Sphagnum cover decreased over three years after tree removal, whereas in partly rewetted rich fens Sphagnum increased over eight years following tree removal [1731]. Two replicated, paired, controlled studies in rich fens reported increased total plant species richness, with one study noting a much smaller effect of tree removal in rewetted plots than in drained plots [1731]. Cutting/removing plantations and rewetting: Site‑comparison studies in bogs and fens found plant community composition changed and became less like drained, forested sites; some replicated fen studies found no or only small effects on overall composition [1732]. Two before‑and‑after studies reported increased abundance of wetland‑characteristic plants [1732]. For mosses, two replicated, paired studies found increased Sphagnum cover, one replicated before‑after site‑comparison found no effect, two before‑and‑after studies found mixed effects by site or species, and three studies reported reduced cover of non‑Sphagnum or forest‑characteristic mosses; one study found no effect on forest mosses when thinning/rewetting [1732]. Seven studies reported increased cover of at least one herb group (including cottongrasses and sedges), with one study reporting loss of cottongrass where it was rare and reduced purple moor grass [1732]. One study found increased ground vegetation height; another found no effect on canopy height after eight years; thinning reduced the number of tall trees for 1–3 years but not to natural levels [1732]. Two replicated, paired, controlled studies in rich fens reported increased plant species richness, while two replicated Finnish studies found no effect on total richness or diversity [1732].",
