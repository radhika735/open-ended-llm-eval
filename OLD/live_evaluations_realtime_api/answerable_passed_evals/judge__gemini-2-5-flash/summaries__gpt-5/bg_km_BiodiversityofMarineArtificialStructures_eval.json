For invertebrates, long flexible habitats in studies that included Australia showed mixed effects on abundance depending on species group, survey week, and habitat characteristics, and studies in Australia and the Netherlands reported that such habitats supported macroalgae and non‑mobile invertebrate or fish species that were absent from surfaces without flexible habitats [3451]. Creating short flexible habitats in Australia yielded mixed effects on seahorse abundance depending on the survey week [3450], and studies in Australia and France reported mixed effects on invertebrate abundance depending on survey week, species group, habitat length, or site, with one study finding no effect on mobile invertebrate abundance [3450]. Overall, both short and long flexible habitats in Australia have shown mixed responses for fish (including seahorses) and invertebrate populations, with long habitats additionally associated with use by seahorses and the presence of species absent from control surfaces [3451][3450].",

Creating small adjoining cavities (‘swimthroughs’ ≤100 mm) had mixed effects on juvenile fish community composition, richness and abundance depending on site, month and development stage, but supported six species absent from structures without swimthroughs and were used by adult and juvenile fishes [3436]. Creating hole habitats (>50 mm), often combined with grooves, pits and environmentally-sensitive material, altered mobile invertebrate and fish community composition and supported fish species absent from plain surfaces; fish abundances showed mixed or no increases depending on study [3434]. Creating groove habitats (1–50 mm), often with other features, altered community composition and supported fish species absent from plain surfaces; fish abundances showed mixed effects [3448]. Creating pit habitats (1–50 mm), with other features, altered community composition and supported fish species absent from plain surfaces; fish abundances showed mixed effects [3455]. Creating long flexible habitats (>50 mm) had mixed effects on fish species richness and fish/seahorse abundance and were used by seahorses [3451]. Creating short flexible habitats (1–50 mm) had mixed effects on seahorse abundance [3450]. Using environmentally-sensitive material (e.g., ECOncrete or rock), often alongside added habitat features, supported fish species absent from standard surfaces and had mixed effects on fish abundance depending on species [3470]. Transplanting or seeding organisms (e.g., oysters) onto structures increased combined invertebrate and fish species richness and diversity and altered community composition; overall combined abundance did not increase, with effects varying among species [3471]. Managing or restricting harvesting around structures was associated with higher fish species richness, different fish community composition including species absent from unrestricted sites, and higher seabream abundance; total fish abundance responses varied and access restrictions did not fully prevent harvesting [3457]. Creating artificial reefs of different 3‑D structure/material often showed no differences in combined mobile invertebrate and fish richness or abundance between designs/materials [2259]. For several actions on subtidal structures—creating large/small ridges or ledges, crevice habitats, large protrusions, and reducing slope—no studies were found evaluating effects on biodiversity [3445; 3444; 3454; 3443; 3442].",

Therefore, the statement including 'seeding' as a generic term is technically covered by the intervention type, but the specific evidence applies to 'transplanting'.
