A separator trawl separated unwanted cod into a lower codend where a larger mesh allowed more smaller cod to escape (2711). Topless (coverless) trawls reduced unwanted Atlantic cod, and reduced unwanted larger haddock but not smaller haddock, while larger cod reductions occurred only in one of two cases (2712). Size‑sorting escape grids fitted to trawl nets reduced unwanted sizes of cod and other non‑target fish including haddock in multiple regions that include the North Sea, and in North Sea/Norwegian Sea studies grids improved size‑selection for haddock though not consistently for cod, with one study finding no improvement versus square‑mesh windows (2720). Fitting mesh escape panels/windows (square or large diamond) to trawl nets reduced unwanted catches including cod and haddock in several North Sea studies, and reviews/experiments reported improved size‑selectivity for Atlantic cod and haddock, with effects varying by panel design and position (2716). Modifying the position and/or size of mesh escape panels improved size‑selectivity for haddock in North Sea studies, though some studies reported no reduction in unwanted cod (2717).",

Large, supported escape openings (e.g., Fisheyes, Bigeyes, radial sections) generally reduced unwanted fish and total unwanted catch in most trials, with species-specific results (e.g., fewer unwanted Chinook salmon in both opening designs tested, mixed effects for widow rockfish), and one study reported reduced unwanted sharks but not rays or sawfish compared to standard nets [2723]. Mesh escape panels/windows showed mixed effects: modifying panel position/size sometimes improved size-selectivity for haddock and whiting while effects for cod were similar to standard trawls, and reductions in unwanted catches were inconsistent across species and studies [2717]. Combining devices tended to enhance selectivity and bycatch reduction: panels/windows plus grids reduced unwanted fish, rays, sharks, and total discards in several studies and increased size-selectivity of whiting, with escape occurring via either device depending on species/size [2727]; grids combined with large supported openings reduced unwanted fish and sharks/rays in most studies, with exceptions (no reduction in sharks in one study; no reduction in sawfish) [2726].",
