Compost increased soil nutrients in some or all comparisons in several studies, with inconsistent nitrogen responses and no phosphorus difference in one USA study; pH was often similar [1362]. Manure increased nitrogen in some comparisons, potassium in two studies, and showed mixed results for phosphorus and pH [1363]. Compost frequently increased microbial biomass in some or all comparisons, with some studies showing no difference and shifts in bacterial communities [1362]; manure showed similar microbial biomass to controls in two studies [1363], whereas other studies reported higher microbial biomass or respiration when manure or compost was applied [911]. Both compost and manure were associated with reduced erosion and/or higher soil stability in some studies [1362, 1363], and one study found lower soil loss and runoff when manure was applied with other treatments [911]. Greenhouse gas responses differed: compost sometimes increased emissions and sometimes showed no difference across studies [1362], while manure increased carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions in individual studies [1363]. In nutrient retention and loss, one trial reported reduced nutrient loss and higher nitrogen with farmyard or poultry manure, though another found higher nitrate leaching [911]; a trial applying high rates of cotton gin compost and poultry manure improved soil structure and reduced soil loss but increased nutrient loss [891]. Several studies found higher crop yields when manures or compost were applied [911].",
