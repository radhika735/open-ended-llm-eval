      "relevant_summary": "Evidence from action documents indicates multiple practices associated with increases in soil organic matter or soil organic carbon on agricultural land: Including legumes or forage in crop rotations increased soil organic matter and soil organic carbon in several studies, though a few reported mixed or lower effects (857). Growing cover crops as living mulches or between rows increased soil organic matter in two controlled trials, with one trial finding no effect (897). Growing cover crops in fallow periods improved soil structure and nutrient retention, with studies reporting increased soil carbon and, in several trials, increased nitrogen and carbon under cover crops, although some European studies found no marked effect on soil organic matter (898). Applying manures and agricultural composts increased soil organic carbon in multiple studies and increased soil organic matter in one controlled, randomized, replicated study, while some studies found no effect on organic matter (911). Applying composts (not otherwise specified) at high rates increased soil organic matter and microbial biomass in a controlled, randomized, replicated trial (889). Incorporating fresh plant material or crop remains (e.g., straw) increased soil organic carbon across multiple studies and, in some cases, improved aggregation and reduced nitrate leaching (910). Retaining crop residues increased soil organic carbon and nitrogen in two randomized, replicated trials (907). Reduced tillage increased soil organic matter relative to conventional tillage in multiple replicated studies and a meta-analysis, though some studies found similar levels (1371). No-tillage increased soil organic matter relative to tilled soils in many replicated studies and a meta-analysis, with some studies finding mixed or similar results (1369). Changing tillage practices toward reduced or no-till increased soil organic carbon across numerous studies and often maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure, though results varied by context (906).",
