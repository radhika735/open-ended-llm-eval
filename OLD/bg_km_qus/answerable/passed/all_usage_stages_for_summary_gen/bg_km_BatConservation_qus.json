    "question": "What is the extent of evidence for actions to mitigate pollution from agricultural sources to benefit bats?",
    "answer": "The evidence is strongest for reducing chemical inputs. Both reducing pesticide, herbicide, or fertiliser use (2013) and using organic farming (961) are rated as 'Likely to be beneficial', with multiple studies showing positive effects such as higher bat activity, more species, and better body condition on farms with low or no chemical inputs. Agroforestry is also rated 'Likely to be beneficial' (963). In contrast, there are significant evidence gaps for other mitigation actions, with no studies found that evaluated the effects of changing effluent treatments in agriculture (1016), using organic pest control specifically (2014), preventing pollution from entering watercourses (2015), or planting riparian buffer strips to reduce pollution (2016).",

    "question": "What design and placement factors influence the successful use of bat boxes by bats?",
    "answer": "Evidence from numerous studies suggests both design and placement are critical for bat box uptake (1024). Key design factors associated with higher use include using black-coloured boxes, larger box sizes, concrete rather than wood construction, and multiple internal compartments. Key placement factors include orientation and sun exposure, height, location (with boxes on buildings being used more than on trees), and the surrounding habitat type. Occupancy rates were also found to be higher when a greater number of boxes were installed across a site (1024). Additionally, managing the microclimate of artificial roosts, for example by modifying them to reduce internal temperatures, was found in one study to increase the number of bats using them (2052).",

    "question": "How do different types of purpose-built road crossing structures compare in effectiveness for bats?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests a range of effectiveness for different crossing structures. Eight studies found that bats use underpasses and culverts, but in varying proportions compared to crossing over the road (976). Two studies on overpasses found that some bat species used them, but up to three-quarters of bats still crossed at traffic height or elsewhere (977). A study on green bridges found one was used by 97% of crossing bats (979). In contrast, bat gantries are considered unlikely to be beneficial, with two studies finding that fewer bats used them than crossed the road at traffic height below (978).",

    "question": "For arid regions, what is the evidence on the effectiveness of creating or managing water sources to support bat populations?",
    "answer": "The evidence suggests that creating and managing water sources is beneficial for bats in arid and other landscapes. Managing livestock water troughs is rated as 'Likely to be beneficial', with two US studies finding that removing modifications increased their use by bats (1951). Creating artificial water sources is also rated 'Likely to be beneficial'; five studies found bat activity was similar or higher over artificial water bodies (like reservoirs, ponds, and drainage ditches) compared to natural wetlands or surrounding habitats (959). One study found that reservoirs created by small dams had greater activity for four bat species than the streams feeding them (1997). There is no evidence on managing natural water bodies to prevent desiccation (2027).",

    "question": "In agricultural landscapes, which farming systems are most beneficial for bat populations?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests both organic farming and agroforestry systems are 'Likely to be beneficial' for bats. For organic farming, while five of seven studies found no difference in species richness, two found more species on organic farms, and four of nine studies found higher overall bat activity on organic farms than conventional ones (961). For agroforestry, studies found more bat species and higher diversity in shaded plantations compared to those with no shade or a single shade species. Two studies also found more bats or higher activity of forest bat species in plantations with varied shade cover, and one study found bats had better body condition in a silvopastoral system that used agroforestry (963). In contrast, agri-environment schemes in the UK were found to be 'Unlikely to be beneficial', with studies showing no difference or even lower bat activity compared to conventional farms (962).",

    "question": "What are the outcomes and success rates associated with ex-situ bat conservation actions like captive breeding and rehabilitation?",
    "answer": "Both actions have an 'Unknown effectiveness' rating for maintaining wild populations. For captive breeding, eight studies show that bats can reproduce in captivity, with 6-100% of wild-caught females successfully rearing young. Survival of captive-born pups to adulthood varied from 20-100% across studies (2053). For rehabilitation of injured or orphaned bats, four studies documented survival after release. One study found 70-90% of hand-reared pipistrelles survived 4-14 days post-release, with some joining wild colonies. Another study found 13% of ringed, hand-reared bats were found alive in bat boxes up to four years later (2054). No studies for either action evaluated the effect on overall wild bat population numbers.",
