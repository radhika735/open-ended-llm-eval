    "answer": "Studies show different outcomes for the effect of cover crops on soil organic matter in Europe versus the USA. Three controlled, randomized, replicated studies from the USA found that growing cover crops when fields were empty increased soil nitrogen and carbon levels (898). In contrast, a trial in Germany found no effect on soil organic matter levels from growing cover crops beneath the main crop (897), and two other studies from Europe also found no marked effect on soil organic matter from growing cover crops when fields were empty (898).",
