    "question": "When attempting to control problematic grass in UK shrublands, how does mowing compare to stripping turf?",
    "answer": "In the UK, one controlled study found that mowing did not alter the cover of common heather, whereas another study found stripping turf increased the number of heathland plants [1638, 1647]. Another study also found stripping turf could increase heather cover [1685]. One replicated study found the presence of wavy hair grass was similar in areas where turf was cut and those that were mown [1647], but a different study found turf removal reduced its cover [1685].",
