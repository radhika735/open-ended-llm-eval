    "question": "What factors appear to influence the success of trapping as a control method for invasive crayfish?",
    "answer": "The success of trapping for crayfish control appears to depend on the species and whether it is combined with other methods. For red swamp crayfish, baiting traps with food (tinned meat) was found to be most effective, capturing over half of all crayfish in one study (1029). However, trapping alone was found to be ineffective for managing spiny-cheeked crayfish (1029). Success is likely enhanced when combined with other methods; a study found that combining trapping with the introduction of predators significantly reduced red swamp crayfish populations and was more effective than predation alone (1031).",

For the American bullfrog (1049), red-eared terrapin (1060), and parrot's feather (1603), the synopsis explicitly states that no evidence was found that tested the impact of public education.

For red swamp crayfish, combining trapping with the introduction of predators significantly reduced populations in a pond and was more effective than predation alone (1031).

For skunk cabbage, studies showed conflicting results for glyphosate, while 2,4-D amine was found to be effective (1102). For water primrose, effectiveness was enhanced by using an adjuvant like TopFilm with glyphosate, which increased mortality from 97% to 100% in one study (1139). For parrot's feather, the specific herbicide is important; one study found 2,4-D more effective than diquat or glyphosate (1606), another found triclopyr more effective than glyphosate (1689), and other studies confirmed that while many herbicides are effective, some like fluridone and clopyralid are not (1699).",

    "answer": "For floating pennywort, chemical control with the herbicide 2,4-D amine has been shown to achieve nearly 100% mortality (1127), and flame treatment can be fatal to the plant (1131). Physical removal has shown mixed success; one study noted that the plant's growth rate exceeded the removal rate, while another reported a significant reduction but not complete eradication (1126). For parrot's feather, the herbicides 2,4-D (1606) and triclopyr (1689) have been found to be beneficial in reducing its growth. In contrast, biological control using grass carp did not reduce parrot's feather biomass in one study (1599).",

    "question": "What control options are available for managing American bullfrogs in shallow ponds, and what is their likely effectiveness?",
    "answer": "Several control options exist for American bullfrogs in shallow ponds. Biological control through the introduction of northern pike led to a significant decline in tadpole numbers in one study (1039). Direct removal of adults is rated as 'Likely to be beneficial', although one study noted that populations rebounded rapidly following removal efforts (1045). The direct removal of juveniles is also rated 'Likely to be beneficial', with studies indicating that double fyke nets are effective for capturing tadpoles (1046). Chemical control is another option; a study found that chemicals such as caffeine and chloroxylenol were lethal to bullfrogs, but the overall effectiveness of this method in the wild is currently unknown (1048).",

    "answer": "The outcomes of physical removal for these plants are highly variable and context-dependent. For skunk cabbage, annual removal over five years successfully eliminated a stock of recently established plants, but a twice-yearly program on a larger population still required significant removal efforts after four years (1101). For floating pennywort, one study found its growth rate outpaced removal efforts, whereas another achieved a significant reduction but not full eradication (1126). Similarly for water primrose, hand pulling and raking failed to reduce its abundance in one instance, yet the same method successfully eradicated a smaller population from the margins of a pond in another case (1138).",

A study in Belgium found that double fyke nets were effective at catching tadpoles (juveniles), but had very low catchability for adults (1046, 1045). While one study found that shooting adult bullfrogs before reproduction could significantly reduce their numbers as part of a combination treatment, another study in the USA found that populations rebounded quickly after intensive adult removal (1045). In contrast, removing juveniles by trapping (as part of a combination treatment) led to a significant reduction in both adult and juvenile numbers in a French study (1046).",

    "question": "What factors influence the effectiveness of biological control for invasive aquatic plants such as floating pennywort and water primrose?",
    "answer": "A key factor is the host specificity of the herbivore. A flea beetle used to control water primrose was found to be specific and caused significant damage (1135). In contrast, while a weevil showed a preference for floating pennywort in lab tests, it failed to reduce the plant's biomass in the field, suggesting lab success does not always translate to field effectiveness (1123). The type of herbivore also matters; while host-specific insects are often sought, generalist herbivores like grass carp have been used, such as in a US study where they reduced parrot's feather abundance, but these pose a risk to non-target native plants (1599).",

    "question": "How does the effectiveness of altering water salinity compare to altering temperature for controlling invasive invertebrates like Asian clams and Ponto-Caspian gammarids?",
    "answer": "Both methods show promise and are generally rated as beneficial. For Asian clams, exposure to high salinities (18-34‰) resulted in 100% mortality in a lab study (1115), and temperatures of 36°C or higher also killed them within four days (1116). For Ponto-Caspian gammarids, one study found that increasing salinity killed most invasive shrimp within five hours, though another study found no effect (1091). Heating water to over 43°C was found to kill shrimp immediately (1092).",

    "question": "What factors influence the effectiveness of using non-native herbivores as biological control agents for invasive aquatic plants like water primrose and parrot's feather?",
    "answer": "Effectiveness depends on the herbivore's diet specificity and its impact on the target plant. For water primrose, a host-specific flea beetle was found to cause heavy feeding damage (1135). Similarly, a South American leaf-feeding beetle reduced parrot's feather growth (1599). In contrast, generalist herbivores like grass carp show mixed results; they can reduce parrot's feather biomass but had no effect in one study (1599). Their lack of specificity also poses a risk to native plants (1135, 1599).",

    "question": "In industrial water systems in Europe, what are the most effective methods for controlling biofouling by Asian clams?",
    "answer": "Evidence points to several beneficial methods for industrial settings. Mechanical removal, such as suction dredging, can reduce clam densities by 96% (1120). Physically cleaning industrial pipes or adding sand filters are also effective at removing or reducing clam numbers (1119). Chemical controls have also proven effective; biocides like chlorine, potassium, and copper can kill Asian clams, as can specialized fat-coated particles called 'BioBullets' which achieved 100% mortality in Spanish irrigation systems (1118).",
