    "question": "What have been the observed effects of excluding livestock from ponds and streams on amphibian populations in the USA and UK?",
    "answer": "The evidence suggests that excluding livestock by fencing is 'likely to be ineffective or harmful'. Studies in the USA found that excluding livestock did not increase amphibian species numbers or overall abundance, though it did increase larval abundance for some species (746). Two US studies found that the abundance of green frogs and American toads was actually higher with grazing (746). Furthermore, one study noted that excluding livestock caused temporary pools to dry out 50 days earlier (746). Conversely, one study in the UK found that a pond restoration project that included livestock exclusion did increase pond use by breeding natterjack toads (746).",

    "question": "What design and placement factors are associated with the successful use of road tunnels by migrating amphibians?",
    "answer": "Multiple factors influence whether amphibians will use road underpasses. Studies found that success is often dependent on the installation of barrier fencing to guide amphibians towards the tunnel entrances (884, 756). Key design elements affecting usage include tunnel diameter (wider is often better), length (long culverts may be avoided), lighting (with mixed effects), and substrate (natural substrates are preferred) (884). The presence of water can have mixed effects, and some designs, such as those with vertical entry chutes or certain metal materials, can be harmful or result in high mortality (884).",

For Mallorcan midwife toads, releases established breeding populations at 38-100% of sites, though one study noted reduced genetic diversity in a reintroduced population (873). For other toad species, releases established populations in two of three studies, but survival of released Puerto Rican crested toads was low (875).
