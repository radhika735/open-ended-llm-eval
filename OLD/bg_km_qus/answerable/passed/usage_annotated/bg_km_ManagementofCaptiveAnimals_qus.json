    "question": "In a captive breeding program for Australian frogs, what are the most effective interventions to stimulate successful breeding?",
    "answer": "Evidence from studies in Australia suggests a combination of interventions is effective. One study found that frogs only bred after being moved to an indoor enclosure with various substrates that allowed for temporary flooding, along with manipulating sex ratios and playing recorded mating calls (1873, 1879, 1881). Another study found that clutch size increased when sexes were separated during non-breeding periods, females were allowed to gain weight before breeding, female mate choice was provided, and recorded mating calls were played (1880, 1881, 1882, 1888).",

Formulating a diet to reflect the nutritional composition of wild foods, such as by removing fruit, was found to lower aggression in lemurs and reduce regurgitation in gorillas (1329). Providing cut branches (browse) encouraged wild-type foraging skills in gorillas (1332). Replacing pellet feed with fresh produce increased time spent feeding and decreased inactivity in rhesus macaques (1335).",
