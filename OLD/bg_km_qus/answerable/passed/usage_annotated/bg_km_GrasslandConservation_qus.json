    "question": "How do the outcomes of post-seeding grazing by livestock vary between studies in Europe and the USA?",
    "answer": "In Europe, post-seeding grazing shows mixed results. An Italian study found it increased plant species richness (3423), while a UK study found it reduced richness compared to cutting (3423). A Hungarian study found grazing did not alter the cover of target plant species (3423). In the USA, one study found that grazing with cattle after sowing seeds increased native plant species richness but reduced the cover of native plant species (3423).",

    "question": "What actions are available to increase the abundance of sown or planted species in grassland restoration projects?",
    "answer": "Several actions have been shown to increase the abundance of sown or planted species. Sowing seeds at the start of the growing season, rather than in autumn, increased the cover of sown species in one UK study (3407). Sowing seeds into large prepared gaps in vegetation led to greater cover of sown species (3409), as did removing topsoil before planting (3415). Applying herbicide before sowing (3418) and adding topsoil from other grasslands (3420) also increased the abundance of sown species. Sowing native grass and forbs increased sown species abundance in five of six studies (3432). Other actions show mixed or neutral results, such as sowing seeds at a higher density (3405), hydroseeding (3412), mowing (3419), and adding fertilizer (3427). In contrast, using slot/strip seeding resulted in failed introductions in a majority of cases in one review (3411).",

    "question": "In European grasslands, how do different soil preparation methods prior to seeding, such as soil disturbance, topsoil removal, and herbicide application, compare in their effects on seedling emergence and survival?",
    "answer": "Evidence from European studies suggests several soil preparation methods can aid seedling establishment. Disturbing the soil before sowing was found to increase plant emergence in studies in Germany and Spain (3413). One German study found applying herbicide before sowing increased seedling emergence for most wildflower species tested (3418). Removing vegetation mechanically was found to increase germination rates in a UK study (3416). In contrast, removing leaf litter had mixed effects on the number of seedlings in studies in Germany and Belgium (3414). Evidence on survival is more limited; one Spanish study found disturbing soil increased seedling survival, while another found it did not alter survival of planted species (3413). Evidence for topsoil removal's effect on survival comes from US studies, which found it increased seedling survival (3415).",

    "question": "What is the extent of evidence on how different grassland seeding and planting interventions affect vegetation structure?",
    "answer": "The evidence base for the effects of grassland restoration actions on vegetation structure is extremely limited. The vast majority of interventions, such as sowing grass seeds (3397), planting grassland plants (3399), or sowing parasitic species (3404), have zero studies assessing impacts on vegetation structure. Only three actions report such evidence. Hydroseeding was found to increase the height of herb species in one study in Italy (3412). Sowing grassland seeds from a local source did not alter vegetation height in two studies (3400). Inoculating soil with mycorrhiza before sowing increased the height of one plant species in a US study (3429).",

Two replicated studies in the USA and Canada found that sowing grass seeds reduced the abundance of shrub species (3397).

    "answer": "Evidence suggests that the composition of the seed mix is critical for forb abundance. In North American studies, sowing only grass seeds was found to reduce the abundance of native forbs or have no effect (3397). In contrast, sowing a mix of native grass and forb seeds increased forb cover or density in studies in both the USA and the Czech Republic (3432). Also in the USA, sowing seeds at a higher density increased forb cover (3405). In a European study in Switzerland, the specialist action of sowing parasitic plants did not alter the cover of forbs (3404).",

One study directly comparing the two found that annual cutting increased plant species richness compared to livestock grazing (3419, 3423). Mowing after sowing was also found to increase sown species richness and the abundance of sown forbs in other UK studies (3419). The effects of grazing were more complex; one study found grazing with cattle increased sown species richness compared to sheep, but another found cattle reduced the cover of sown species compared to sheep (3423).
