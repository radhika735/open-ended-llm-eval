    "question": "What is the comparative effectiveness of deploying acoustic devices on fishing gear, vessels, or moorings for reducing human-wildlife conflict at wild fisheries?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests acoustic devices on fishing gear are effective, with five of six studies finding they reduced damage to catches and nets by dolphins and seals (2808). One study found acoustic devices on moorings reduced harbour seal predation on salmon (2816). In contrast, one study found that using acoustic devices on fishing vessels did not reduce predation of squid catches by Risso's dolphins (2815).",

    "question": "What is the available evidence for methods aimed at reducing marine mammal exposure to noise from industrial activities like pile driving and seismic surveys?",
    "answer": "Three studies found that 'soft start' procedures for seismic airguns resulted in some cetaceans moving away, but one study noted that migrating humpback whales did not significantly alter their course (2897). One study found that using bubble curtains or screens during pile driving led to a smaller decrease in harbour porpoise detections compared to sites without these measures (2901). Four studies found that using acoustic devices to deter mammals prior to noisy activities reduced harbour porpoise activity and caused minke whales to swim away (2896).",

Legally protecting habitats has been associated with an increased population of Mediterranean monk seals and higher survival rates for Hector's dolphins in two studies, although one study found no change in a bottlenose dolphin population (2915). One study found that prohibiting fishing in a sensitive area increased harbour porpoise activity (2917). No studies were found evaluating the general legal protection of species (2923).",

    "question": "What are the documented benefits and negative outcomes associated with captive rearing and rehabilitation of marine mammals?",
    "answer": "Many studies show benefits. Rehabilitated and released mammals showed high survival rates (10-100%) in 21 studies, and some reproduced post-release (2925). Hand-reared mammals have also shown high survival rates after release, with some manatees surviving for over seven years and reproducing (2926). However, negative outcomes are also documented. Some hand-reared manatee and seal pups died before or after release or had to be returned to captivity (2926). One study found California sea lions treated for toxic algae poisoning had impaired diving behaviour and higher mortality post-release (2925). Captive breeding programmes have had mixed success, with most captive-born river dolphins, finless porpoises and Irrawaddy dolphins not surviving in captivity (2932).",
