    "question": "How does the effectiveness of draining water bodies compare to using physical barriers for controlling invasive species like Asian clams and Crassula helmsii?",
    "answer": "While there is no direct evidence captured on the effectiveness of draining water bodies to control Asian clams (1110) or Crassula helmsii (1303), using physical barriers has demonstrated success. For Asian clams, placing gas-impermeable barriers on the lake bottom significantly reduced their abundance (1117). For Crassula helmsii, five separate studies found that covering the plant with lightproof barriers, such as black sheeting or carpet strips, successfully eradicated or severely reduced its coverage (1294).",

    "question": "What is the extent of evidence for using biological control agents, such as host-specific herbivores or parasites, to manage invasive invertebrates like Procambarus crayfish and Ponto-Caspian gammarids?",
    "answer": "The evidence for biological control of these invertebrates is varied. For Procambarus crayfish, encouraging predators like eels and pike has been found to reduce population size in replicated, controlled studies (1030). For Ponto-Caspian gammarids, there is currently no captured evidence for the deliberate introduction of predatory fish as a control method (1087). However, a replicated laboratory study did find that an introduced parasitic mould could successfully reduce populations of an invasive shrimp (1089).",

    "question": "What factors influence the success of chemical control for invasive plants, considering examples from skunk cabbage and water primrose management?",
    "answer": "Evidence from skunk cabbage and water primrose control suggests two key factors influence success: the type of herbicide and the use of adjuvants. For skunk cabbage, studies show conflicting results for glyphosate, but indicate that 2,4-D Amine can be effective (1102). For water primrose, triclopyr TEA was found to be effective in a lab study (1139). The use of adjuvants, or sticking agents, is also critical. A field study on water primrose found that glyphosate application resulted in 97% mortality when mixed with a non-oil-based sticker, but this increased to 100% mortality when combined with the adjuvant TopFilm (1139).",

    "question": "What management options can prevent the spread of invasive aquatic invertebrates like red swamp crayfish and Ponto-Caspian gammarids between water bodies?",
    "answer": "For containing crayfish, physical barriers have proven effective. A study in Spain found that specially designed concrete dams successfully prevented red swamp crayfish from spreading upstream (1037). For smaller invertebrates like Ponto-Caspian gammarids, biosecurity measures for equipment are key. Studies have shown that submerging equipment in hot water (>43Â°C) kills the shrimp immediately (1092). Chemical dips using substances like iodine solution or acetic acid were also found to kill invasive killer shrimp in lab tests, although they were considered impractical for field application (1095). A lab study also suggested that carbonating water could stun killer shrimp, potentially helping to control their movement (1088).",

    "question": "For controlling invasive red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) in European ponds, what are some effective non-chemical management strategies?",
    "answer": "Studies suggest that trapping and removal, especially when baited with food, can be beneficial for controlling red swamp crayfish (1029). Sterilizing males by exposing them to X-rays has been found to reduce offspring production (1032). Encouraging native predators like eels and pike can also help reduce crayfish population size (1030). A combination of trapping and encouraging predators has been shown to be more effective than predation alone and can significantly reduce crayfish populations (1031).",

For red swamp crayfish, specially designed concrete dams successfully contained their upstream spread (1037). An electrical barrier was found to prevent the movement of Ponto-Caspian gobies (1074). For Asian clams, placing gas-impermeable barriers on a lake bottom significantly reduced their abundance (1117). In the case of the invasive plant Crassula helmsii, covering it with lightproof barriers like black sheeting or carpet strips successfully eradicated or severely reduced its cover in several UK studies (1294).",

    "answer": "Various direct removal methods have been studied with mixed success. For American bullfrogs, removing juveniles with double fyke nets was effective, and shooting metamorphosed individuals before they could reproduce significantly reduced populations as part of a combination treatment (1046). However, catching adult bullfrogs with the same nets had low success, and populations rebounded quickly after intensive adult removal (1045). For red-eared terrapins, specialized turtle traps and seine nets were used to capture adults and juveniles, but these methods did not achieve eradication (1055).",

Physical removal using a mechanical digger combined with monthly hand-picking was found to greatly reduce the plant's cover, although it did not lead to complete eradication (1126). Flame treatments were shown to be potentially fatal to the plant; a pilot experiment found that a 3-second application, repeated after 11 days, killed the pennywort (1131). In contrast, using hydrogen peroxide appears to be an ineffective control method, as even the highest tested concentrations were not sufficient to kill the plant (1129).",
