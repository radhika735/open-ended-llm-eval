    "answer": "Several non-lethal actions have been shown to be beneficial in managing human-primate conflict. Removing and relocating ‘problem’ animals has been found to be 'Likely to be beneficial', with studies showing that translocated rhesus monkeys, olive baboons, and western lowland gorillas survived and remained at release sites for at least four years (1422). Using nets to keep primates out of fruit trees is rated as 'Unknown effectiveness' but one study in Indonesia found this reduced crop-raiding by orangutans (1442). Chasing primates using random loud noise is also considered 'Likely to be beneficial', with studies showing it reduced crop raiding by orangutans and resulted in gorillas returning from plantations to protected forests (1449).",

For mining, proposed actions include minimizing ground vibrations from open-cast mining (1451), establishing no-mining zones near watersheds to protect water quality (1452), and creating 'set-aside' areas of natural habitat within the mining concession (1453). To mitigate impacts from dam construction, one intervention is to create or preserve habitat on islands that primates can flee to during flooding, though this has potential downsides like overcrowding (1455). Additionally, wild primates can be translocated from development sites to natural habitats elsewhere (1558).",

    "answer": "Implementing tourism projects has shown mixed outcomes for primate populations, indicating a trade-off between benefits and harms (1512). Positive impacts include increases in mountain gorilla populations in several studies across Rwanda, Uganda, and the Republic of Congo, as well as an increase in black howler monkeys in Belize. Conversely, negative impacts have also been documented, such as decreases in Tana River red colobus and crested mangabey numbers in Kenya, increased stress levels and 100% infant mortality in some years for Tibetan macaques in China, and population or body size declines for some lemur species in Madagascar (1512).",

    "question": "What are the effects of implementing veterinary and health-related interventions for wild or reintroduced primate populations?",
    "answer": "Veterinary and health interventions show varied outcomes. Preventative vaccination has led to decreased mortality in rhesus macaques and high survival rates in reintroduced chimpanzees and gorillas (1549). Treating sick or injured animals has shown mixed results, with high survival in some studies involving great apes but poor survival for others like golden lion tamarins and lar gibbons (1550). Similarly, treating parasites resulted in high survival for reintroduced chimpanzees and gorillas, but not for tamarins or mandrills (1551). Continuous health monitoring with an on-site vet was associated with an increase in mountain gorilla populations (1554).",

Implementing local no-hunting policies is rated 'likely to be beneficial', with studies showing population increases for gorillas and howler monkeys and very few snub-nosed monkeys being killed where such policies exist (1478). Community control of patrolling and hunting bans is also 'likely to be beneficial', proving more effective at reducing illegal hunting than a nearby national park in one study and leading to higher great ape numbers in another (1482). Strengthening local taboos that forbid killing primates has 'unknown effectiveness' but was associated with higher gibbon densities in one area (1479). Employing hunters in the conservation sector is another potential strategy, but no evidence was found for its effects (1484).",

Implementing a 'no-feeding of wild primates' policy is rated as having 'unknown effectiveness', but one study in Japan found that previously increasing Japanese macaque populations declined after food provisioning was prohibited (1502). In a similar context, a review found that aggressive interactions between macaques and humans declined after a feeding prohibition was put in place, which was communicated via signage (1507). For other actions such as installing 'primate-proof' garbage bins (1505) or discouraging the planting of fruit trees on the urban edge (1424), no evidence was found to assess their effectiveness.",
