    "question": "In European grasslands, which grazing management strategies appear most beneficial for butterfly species richness?",
    "answer": "The evidence suggests that reducing grazing intensity is generally beneficial. Several studies found that grasslands with lower stocking densities of livestock had greater butterfly and moth species richness than more intensely grazed grasslands (3959). Two studies found that rotational grazing resulted in greater species richness than continuous grazing (3965), and changing livestock from sheep to cattle or horses also increased species richness in two studies (3963). In contrast, completely ceasing grazing for long periods often resulted in similar or lower species richness compared to managed grasslands (3956).",

Following the cessation of grazing, one study found butterfly species richness was higher in grasslands abandoned for 2-9 years than in those abandoned for over 10 years (3956). When mowing ceased, a butterfly community became dominated by generalist species over a 6-year period (3957). For restoration projects, grasslands restored from arable land saw their butterfly communities become increasingly similar to high-quality grasslands over the first 10 years (3929), while those restored from abandoned meadows showed no such trend over time (3955).",

Uncultivated margins that were wider or managed without summer cutting also showed benefits for butterfly abundance and richness (3981).

After clearing patches in forests, one study found butterfly species richness and abundance declined over the first three years, while another found heath fritillary abundance was greatest in patches cleared 2â€“4 years ago (3938). For coppicing, studies found higher butterfly abundance in woodland coppiced 2, 2-4, 5-7, or 12-15 years ago compared to woodland coppiced more than 15 years ago. Species richness was greater in woodland coppiced two years ago than in older coppice (3939).

Margins can be created by leaving them uncultivated, with wider margins and less frequent cutting providing greater benefits (3981). A more proactive approach is to sow grass buffer strips, which are most effective when they are wider and floristically enhanced with wildflowers (3982, 3932). For existing hedgerows, management can be improved by reducing cutting frequency to every 2-3 years, avoiding summer cutting, filling in gaps, and creating a more complex structure, for instance by retaining trees or creating scalloped edges (3975).",

    "question": "What actions can be taken along transportation and service corridors to benefit butterfly and moth populations?",
    "answer": "Several actions can benefit butterflies and moths along transportation and service corridors. Restoring or maintaining species-rich grassland along road verges has been found to increase butterfly and moth species richness and abundance (3854). Similarly, managing land under power lines, for example through mechanical cutting, can increase butterfly richness and abundance compared to unmanaged land (3855). Altering mowing regimes on road verges to be less frequent has also shown benefits for species richness and abundance (3841), as has stopping the use of herbicides (3899).",

    "question": "What are the effects of reducing or ceasing pesticide and fertiliser use on butterfly and moth diversity?",
    "answer": "Reducing or ceasing the use of pesticides and fertilisers generally has positive effects on butterfly and moth diversity. Studies on converting to organic farming, which eliminates synthetic chemical inputs, found that organic farms typically had greater species richness of butterflies and moths than conventionally managed farms (3907). Similarly, a general reduction in the frequency or amount of pesticide, herbicide, or fertiliser application was found to increase butterfly and moth species richness in a range of agricultural landscapes (3897). More specifically, restricting the use of certain herbicides like glyphosate on field margins also resulted in greater butterfly species richness compared to sprayed margins (3896).",

    "question": "What are the main alternatives to grazing for maintaining open grassland habitats, and how do their effects on butterfly communities compare?",
    "answer": "The main alternatives to grazing for maintaining open grassland habitats are mowing and prescribed fire. Comparisons show varied effects on butterfly communities. Several studies comparing mowing and grazing on semi-natural grasslands found they could support similar butterfly species richness, although some specific mowing or grazing regimes were found to be better than others (3908). Prescribed fire is another alternative, but studies in US prairies found that burned areas had lower butterfly species richness than rotationally grazed pastures and lower abundance of some specialist butterflies compared to hayed (mown) prairies (3882, 3945). Therefore, mowing or haying appears to be a common and often effective alternative to grazing for maintaining butterfly communities (3908, 3945).",
