    "answer": "This question cannot be answered as none of the actions in the database relate to precision agriculture. While there are general actions like 'Reduce fertilizer, pesticide or herbicide use generally' (ID 139), there is no information on the specific impacts of technology-driven methods like variable rate applications on wildlife, meaning no relevant evidence is available to form an answer.",

It does not contain information on the socio-economic or political factors, such as national subsidy policies, that influence farmer decision-making or the large-scale uptake of these practices.",

Action 139 discusses reducing fertilizer use generally, but does not provide evidence on the specific effects of these modern application technologies on wildlife.",
