    "relevant_summary": "Opening forest canopies through clearing, coppicing, or thinning has differential effects on butterfly and moth communities. Clearing or opening patches in forests generally benefits butterflies while having mixed effects on moths. Studies found that cleared patches had greater species richness of butterflies but lower species richness of moths than unmanaged patches, coppiced woodland, or closed canopy forest (Action 3938). Larger cleared patches supported higher species richness and abundance of butterflies than undisturbed forest, while smaller patches did not show this effect (Action 3938). Butterfly abundance was consistently higher in cleared patches, with specific benefits documented for species including chequered blue, woodland brown, high brown fritillary, and small pearl-bordered fritillary (Action 3938). A European review found that clearing small patches in forests benefitted 19 out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern (Action 3938).\n\nCoppicing woodland showed strong positive effects for butterflies but negative effects for moths. Coppiced woodland had greater species richness of butterflies than unmanaged woodland but lower species richness of macro-moths than mature forest (Action 3939). The abundance of butterflies was higher in coppiced woodland than unmanaged woodland, with particular benefits for heath fritillary, pearl-bordered fritillary, and small pearl-bordered fritillary (Action 3939). Coppice age matters, with woodland coppiced 2-4 years ago supporting higher butterfly abundance than older coppice (Action 3939). However, macro-moth abundance was lower in coppiced woodland than mature forest (Action 3939).\n\nForest thinning combined with other management practices showed positive effects for butterflies. Coniferous woodland that had been thinned along with prescribed burning, mulching, or nearby felling had greater species richness and higher abundance of butterflies than unmanaged woodland (Action 3940). In tropical forests, thinning had neutral effects, with managed forests showing similar species richness and abundance of fruit-feeding butterflies to unmanaged forests (Action 3940). One study found that partially-cleared forest plots had higher butterfly but lower moth species richness than closed-canopy forest plots (Action 3940).",

    "relevant_summary": "For butterfly populations in US prairies, rotational burning and leaving unburned patches show different effects based on the available research evidence. According to action 3883, rotational burning studies found that under rotational burning management, the total abundance of prairie specialist, grassland and all butterflies was higher on prairies burned more than one, two or four years ago than on prairies burned in the last one or two years. Additionally, the abundance of grassland and generalist butterflies was highest in the third year after burning, and migrant butterflies in the first year after burning. However, rotational burning showed mixed effects overall, with some studies finding that for three fritillary species abundance was lower in prairies managed by rotational burning compared to prairies managed with only haying or grazing, or in unmanaged prairies.\n\nIn contrast, according to action 3879, leaving unburned patches during prescribed burning showed more consistently positive effects for butterfly populations. The abundance of Karner blue butterflies increased over 2-3 years in oak savannas and prairies where unburned patches were left during prescribed burning. Additionally, six out of nine specialist butterfly species were more abundant in pine barrens and prairies where unburned areas were left during prescribed burning compared to sites without unburned areas, while only one species was less abundant and two had similar abundance. Karner blue butterflies were recorded using all 11 unburned patches surveyed within oak savannas and prairies managed by burning.\n\nThe research suggests that timing is crucial for rotational burning effects, with butterfly abundance generally being higher on areas burned more than one year ago, while leaving unburned patches provides immediate refugia that specialist butterfly species appear to utilize effectively.",

Action 3902 indicates that using low intensity lighting reduces moth attraction, with fewer moths attracted to low intensity lights than to higher intensity lights.

    "relevant_summary": "Based on evidence from action documents, butterfly population re-establishment through translocation and captive-release shows mixed long-term success rates. For captive-bred butterfly releases (Action ID 3914), six studies in the UK, USA, Poland and Slovakia reported that populations released as eggs, caterpillars, pupae and adults persisted for 2-28 years and increased in abundance, sometimes with continued captive-rearing of wild-laid caterpillars or supplemented by further releases. However, two UK studies reported that captive-bred large copper and belted beauty moth populations died out one, two or 12 years after release, or required further releases to survive. One replicated UK study found that only three of 10 captive-bred barberry carpet moth populations established, with at least one persisting for five years. A critical finding from a review across the UK and Ireland showed that only 25% of captive-bred and translocated butterfly populations survived for more than 3 years, 38% died out within that time, and only 8% were known to have survived for more than 10 years.\n\nFor translocation to re-establish populations (Action ID 3909), eight studies reported that translocated populations of adult butterflies and Fisher's estuarine moth eggs persisted for 2-12 years and increased in abundance. However, three studies found that some translocated populations persisted for 1-49 years and colonized new sites, while other populations died out within 0-7 years. One UK and Ireland review found identical success rates to captive-breeding: 25% of translocated populations survived for at least three years, 38% died out within that time, and only 8% survived for more than 10 years. Another review reported that translocated large copper populations survived for up to 38 years but ultimately died out or required supplementation by further releases. Studies also found that translocated large copper caterpillars had higher survival rates than released captive-bred caterpillars.",

Fourteen studies (one replicated) in South Africa, the USA, the Netherlands, Italy, France\\u00a0and Spain found that following translocation, populations of warthogs, Eurasian beavers, red squirrels, roe deer, Alpine ibex, Iberian ibex, Cape mountain zebra, 22 species of grazing mammals, black bears, brown bear, bobcats\\u00a0and most populations of river otters\\u00a0increased. Two reviews in South Africa\\u00a0and Australia\\u00a0found that reintroductions (mainly through translocations) led to increasing populations for four of six species of large carnivores\\u00a0and that over half of translocations were classified as successful. One replicated study in the USA and Mexico\\u00a0found that translocating desert bighorn sheep did not increase the population size. Two studies (one replicated) and a review in USA and Canada, the USA\\u00a0and Australia\\u00a0found that translocated American martens, and sea otters\\u00a0at four of seven sites, established populations and that translocated and released captive-bred macropod species\\u00a0established populations in 44 of 72 cases.

A review in Australia\\u00a0found that over half of translocations, for which the outcome could be determined, were classified as successful. Two of three studies (one replicated) and one review in Sweden, the UK, the Netherlands\\u00a0and the USA and Mexico\\u00a0found that following release of wild-caught translocated and captive-bred animals, European otters\\u00a0and common dormice\\u00a0survived three months to seven years.

    "relevant_summary": "Several actions can be taken in urban environments to support butterfly and moth populations. Establishing green infrastructure in urban areas shows potential, though green roofs had lower species richness and abundance of butterflies than urban parks, with higher abundance on older green roofs with more nectar plant species in larger areas (Action 3837). Protecting greenfield sites or undeveloped land in urban areas is effective, as protected native forest and grassland in urban areas had higher species richness of butterflies than urban parks or non-native Eucalyptus plantations (Action 3836). \n\nPlanting parks, gardens and road verges with appropriate native species is beneficial, with three of five studies finding that areas planted with native species had greater species richness of butterfly and moth adults and caterpillars than areas with mixed or exclusively non-native plant species, and two of three studies showing higher abundance of butterfly and moth caterpillars in gardens planted with native species (Action 3842). Wildlife gardening practices show mixed results, with gardens where insecticides and herbicides were not used and where there were natural features having higher abundance of butterflies, though some specific practices like increasing potted nettle plants did not increase butterfly abundance (Action 3834).\n\nAltering mowing regimes on greenspaces and road verges is effective, as less frequently mown or unmown urban greenspaces had higher species richness and diversity of butterflies and moths than more frequently mown areas, and unmown public parks and road verges had higher abundance of butterflies than regularly mown areas (Action 3841). Road verges mown less frequently or later in summer also had fewer dead butterflies killed by traffic (Action 3841). \n\nManaging artificial lighting can help moths, as fewer individual moths and moth species were attracted to lights fitted with blinds to prevent light scattering than to conventional lights (Action 3904).",

Additionally, moth species richness recovered faster after shelterwood harvesting than after group selection harvesting or clearcutting (action 3871).

Selective harvesting methods produced mixed results: one study found that forests harvested by single tree selection had similar species richness of moths to forests managed by group selection harvesting or clearcutting, but lower species richness than unharvested forest (action 3867).
