Direct removal of juveniles using double fyke nets has been found effective in catching bullfrog tadpoles in small shallow ponds (Action 1046). One study in Belgium found that double fyke nets were effective in catching bullfrog tadpoles in small shallow ponds, and a study in France found a significant reduction in recorded adults and juveniles following removal of juveniles by trapping as part of combination treatment (Action 1046). For adult removal, catchability using one double fyke net for 24 hours was found to be very low in small shallow ponds in Belgium, though adult bullfrogs can be captured overnight using a single trap floating on the water surface according to a USA study (Action 1045). However, one study found that bullfrog populations rapidly rebounded following intensive removal of adults (Action 1045). Biological control using native predators shows promise, with one study in Belgium finding that introduction of northern pike led to a strong decline in bullfrog tadpole numbers (Action 1039). Shooting of metamorphosed individuals before reproduction was found to significantly reduce recorded adults and juveniles when part of combination treatment in France (Action 1045). No evidence was found for the effectiveness of habitat modification or draining ponds/altering water duration for bullfrog control (Actions 1041, 1042).",

Mechanical removal and equipment cleaning are proven effective approaches: a study in Portugal found that mechanical removal and regular cleaning of industrial pipes or addition of sand filters were effective methods for permanently removing or reducing numbers of Asian clams (action 1119). Suction dredging has shown high effectiveness, with a replicated controlled trial in North America finding that suction dredging reduced Asian clam densities by 96% over two weeks with the reduction persisting for a year (action 1120). Field trials in Ireland demonstrated that three types of dredges were equally effective at removing Asian clams, resulting in biomass reductions ranging from 74% to over 95% and density reductions ranging from 65% to 95% (action 1120). Temperature manipulation offers another control method, as laboratory studies in the USA found that temperatures of 36\u00b0C or higher killed Asian clams within or after four days (action 1116). Salinity adjustment is also effective, with controlled laboratory studies showing that Asian clams experienced 100% mortality when exposed to high salinities of 18-34\u2030 (action 1115). However, reducing oxygen levels was not effective, as laboratory studies found that Asian clams were resistant to extremely low oxygen levels regardless of water temperature or immersion length (action 1113).",
