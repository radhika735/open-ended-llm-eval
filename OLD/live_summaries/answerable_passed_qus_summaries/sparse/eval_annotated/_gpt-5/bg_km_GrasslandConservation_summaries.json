    "relevant_summary": "Across studies, removing topsoil (or turf) before seeding/planting more consistently increased desired plant metrics than soil disturbance alone: removing topsoil increased plant species richness and community similarity to reference vegetation, increased richness of sown species, increased grass and forb richness compared to soil disturbance in most cases, increased cover of planted species, reduced common knapweed cover, and increased seedling/plant survival, while not altering overall vegetation cover (3415). By contrast, disturbing soil before seeding showed mixed effects: some studies reported increased plant or seedling richness and higher grass/forb richness with more intensive disturbance (rotovating) than lighter disturbance (harrowing), but others found no change in richness; total plant biomass often did not change, forb cover increased in one study, seed emergence increased in most cases, seedling survival increased in one study but not another, and seedling growth was unaffected (3413). Additional evidence indicates topsoil stripping can shift composition by increasing cover of specialist and generalist species without increasing richness, increasing annual grasses while decreasing perennial grasses, and yielding mixed responses of heathland species cover, with some increases in heather or gorse and overall species number in certain trials (1685). Further, simple topsoil disturbance sometimes increased abundance or richness, but in other contexts did not change vegetation cover or native plant density (1728). When topsoil removal was combined with adding seed or plant clippings, studies reported increased cover of target heathland plants and reductions in competitive grasses such as perennial rye-grass, alongside decreased perennial grass cover (1711).",
