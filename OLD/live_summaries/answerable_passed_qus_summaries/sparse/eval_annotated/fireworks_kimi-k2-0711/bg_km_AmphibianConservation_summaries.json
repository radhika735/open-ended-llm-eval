    "relevant_summary": "Based on evidence from multiple studies in USA forests, partial harvesting methods show varying impacts on salamander populations compared to clearcutting. Three studies found that shelterwood harvesting resulted in higher, similar, or initially higher then similar salamander abundance compared to clearcutting (Action ID 851). However, compared to clearcutting, harvesting trees in small groups did not result in higher amphibian or salamander abundance according to three studies (Action ID 844). Similarly, two studies found that leaving a low density of trees during harvest (leave-tree harvesting) did not result in higher salamander abundance compared to clearcutting (Action ID 846).\n\nA meta-analysis of 24 studies in North America found that partial harvest methods collectively (including shelterwood harvesting, harvesting groups or individual trees, thinning, and shelterwood harvesting) resulted in smaller reductions in salamander populations than clearcutting (Action IDs 851, 844, 852). Regarding thinning specifically, four studies compared amphibians in thinned versus clearcut forest, with two finding higher abundance in thinned forest and two finding mixed effects depending on species, life stage and time since harvest (Action ID 852). The meta-analysis also found that partial harvest methods including thinning resulted in smaller reductions in salamander populations than clearcutting.\n\nWhen comparing partial harvesting methods to no harvesting, the evidence shows that partial harvest methods generally decrease salamander abundance. Two studies found shelterwood harvesting decreased salamander abundance compared to no harvesting, while two studies found harvesting trees in small groups significantly decreased salamander abundance compared to no harvesting. Additionally, two studies found leave-tree harvesting decreased salamander abundance compared to no harvesting.\n\nThe studies consistently indicate that while partial harvesting methods may have less severe impacts on salamander populations than clearcutting, they still result in decreases in salamander abundance compared to unharvested forest conditions.",

    "relevant_summary": "The evidence demonstrates substantial effectiveness of engaging the public in amphibian conservation efforts across Europe and the USA. Citizen science initiatives have proven successful, with five studies showing amphibian data collection projects engaged 100-10,506 volunteers and were active in 16-17 states in the USA, with volunteers conducting 412 surveys, surveying 121-7,872 sites, swabbing almost 6,000 amphibians, and submitting thousands of records.\n\nPublic awareness campaigns and education programmes have achieved measurable impacts. In the UK and Estonia, raising public awareness alongside other interventions increased natterjack toad populations and created 1,023 ponds for amphibians. In Mexico, awareness campaigns increased tourists' knowledge of axolotls. Two studies found that awareness campaigns reached over 50,000 members of the public each year and trained 1,016 people at 57 events over four years.\n\nEngaging landowners and volunteers in direct habitat management has shown direct conservation benefits. In Estonia and Taiwan, habitat management involving volunteers increased natterjack toad and Taipei frog populations. In Mexico, engaging landowners in aquatic habitat management increased axolotl weight. Six studies across Estonia, USA, and UK found 8-41,000 volunteers engaged in aquatic and terrestrial habitat restoration programmes, with individual programmes restoring up to 1,023 ponds or over 11,500 km2 of habitat.\n\nEducational programmes have improved amphibian knowledge retention, with studies in Germany, Mexico, Zimbabwe, and USA showing increased knowledge among 119-6,000 course participants and 700 school children in amphibian camps. Taiwan's education programmes doubled Taipei frog populations.\n\nHabitat creation efforts have demonstrated amphibian population increases, with 50-100% of created ponds establishing stable amphibian populations across Denmark and the USA. European studies documented up to 15 naturally colonizing species using created ponds, with 64-100% of ponds used by amphibians and 64-68% used for reproduction. Pond restoration and creation across Denmark, Estonia, Italy, and UK maintained or increased amphibian populations and increased species diversity, with 1-7 species colonizing restored and created ponds.",

Fourteen studies (one replicated) in South Africa, the USA, the Netherlands, Italy, France\\u00a0and Spain found that following translocation, populations of warthogs, Eurasian beavers, red squirrels, roe deer, Alpine ibex, Iberian ibex, Cape mountain zebra, 22 species of grazing mammals, black bears, brown bear, bobcats\\u00a0and most populations of river otters\\u00a0increased. Two reviews in South Africa\\u00a0and Australia\\u00a0found that reintroductions (mainly through translocations) led to increasing populations for four of six species of large carnivores\\u00a0and that over half of translocations were classified as successful. One replicated study in the USA and Mexico\\u00a0found that translocating desert bighorn sheep did not increase the population size. Two studies (one replicated) and a review in USA and Canada, the USA\\u00a0and Australia\\u00a0found that translocated American martens, and sea otters\\u00a0at four of seven sites, established populations and that translocated and released captive-bred macropod species\\u00a0established populations in 44 of 72 cases. A study in Italy\\u00a0found that following the translocation of red deer, the density of Apennine chamois in the area almost halved.

The other two studies found that two of 10 translocated white rhinoceroses\\u00a0died within three days of release and an American marten\\u00a0population did not persist. A review in Australia\\u00a0found that over half of translocations, for which the outcome could be determined, were classified as successful. Two of three studies (one replicated) and one review in Sweden, the UK, the Netherlands\\u00a0and the USA and Mexico\\u00a0found that following release of wild-caught translocated and captive-bred animals, European otters\\u00a0and common dormice\\u00a0survived three months to seven years. The review found that most black-footed ferret\\u00a0releases were unsuccessful at maintaining a population.

Two of four studies (including one randomized, controlled study) in the USA, Netherlands\\u00a0and Botswana\\u00a0found that following translocation (and in one case release of some captive-bred animals), most Eurasian otters\\u00a0settled and all three female grizzly bears\\u00a0established ranges at their release site.

One review found that 41% of captive-bred or head-started amphibian release programs showed evidence of breeding in the wild for multiple generations, 29% showed some evidence of breeding, and 12% showed evidence of survival following release. Specific studies show captive-bred frogs established breeding populations at 79-100% of release sites in some regions. Natterjack toad translocations in the UK and France established breeding populations in 30-70% of cases. Green and golden bell frog releases in Australia did not establish breeding populations in most cases, while captive-bred salamanders in Germany successfully established stable breeding populations.

Research shows no clear benefits of livestock grazing for amphibian populations on agricultural lands.\n\nNegative impacts identified include reduced amphibian presence in grazed areas. One study found that areas with cattle excluded had similar amphibian abundance to grazed areas, and unmanaged areas (no grazing or burning) had higher abundance of certain species compared to areas with grazing, though this was for a skink species rather than amphibians specifically [Action 3512]. Another study reported no difference in Yosemite toad abundance between grazed and cattle-excluded areas [Action 2319]. The creation of wetlands specifically to support amphibians shows promise as an alternative approach, with created wetlands found to have similar numbers of amphibian species and abundance as natural wetlands in 54% of cases [Action 880].\n\nWetland restoration efforts also show potential, with 17 studies demonstrating that restored wetlands can establish breeding populations for amphibians, though results vary with restored wetlands having similar or higher abundance compared to natural wetlands in 89% of cases [Action 879]. These interventions suggest that ceasing livestock grazing in sensitive areas like wetlands and restoring or creating amphibian-specific habitat may be more effective for amphibian conservation than maintaining grazing on agricultural lands.",
