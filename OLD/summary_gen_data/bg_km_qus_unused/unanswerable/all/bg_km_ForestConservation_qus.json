While several actions are described that can affect understory plants, such as thinning (1211) or using shelterwood harvesting (1223), their relative cost-effectiveness cannot be determined from the text.",

    "answer": "The provided text lists 'Use prescribed fire to remove invasive plant species' (1196) and 'Mechanically/manually remove invasive plants' (1228) as conservation actions. However, the text states that for prescribed fire, 'no evidence was found' (1196), and for mechanical removal, the evidence is limited and rated as 'Unknown effectiveness' (1228). There are no studies presented that directly compare the two methods, making it impossible to determine which is more effective.",
