The document lists several actions related to forestry, such as changing the timing of operations (1984), protecting roost trees (1982), retaining riparian buffers (1985), and retaining forested corridors (996). However, many of these individual actions have a \"No evidence found\" rating, and no studies are presented that evaluate combinations of these practices. Therefore, it is impossible to determine the 'best combination' from the information given.",
