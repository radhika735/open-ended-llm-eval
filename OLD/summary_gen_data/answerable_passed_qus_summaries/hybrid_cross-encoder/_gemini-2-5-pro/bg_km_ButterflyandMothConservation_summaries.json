Cleared patches in forests were found to have a greater species richness of butterflies but a lower species richness of moths (3938). One study noted that butterfly species richness declined in the first three years after clearing (3938). Cleared patches, sometimes managed with coppicing and grazing, showed a higher abundance of butterflies, including specific species like the chequered blue and high brown fritillary (3938). However, one study found that wider rides had a lower abundance of macro-moths (3938). Thinning of coniferous woodland, in some cases with other management like prescribed burning, led to a greater species richness of butterflies and, in some cases, higher abundance (3940). Conversely, another study found that forests managed by thinning had a similar species richness and abundance of fruit-feeding butterflies to unmanaged forests (3940). Coppicing was found to support different communities of moths and butterflies depending on the age of the coppice (3939). Some studies found that coppiced woodland had a greater species richness of butterflies than unmanaged woodland, while another found a lower species richness of macro-moths compared to mature forest (3939). The abundance of butterflies was higher in coppiced woodland in some studies, with specific timeframes after coppicing showing higher numbers for certain species (3939).",

One found that rotationally burned prairies had more rapidly declining populations of grass-skipper butterflies than unmanaged or lightly managed fields (3883). For three fritillary species, rotational burning did not affect abundance, but for three others, abundance was lower in prairies managed by rotational burning compared to those managed with only haying or grazing, or in unmanaged prairies (3883). In contrast, one site comparison study in the US reported that regal fritillary abundance was higher in grasslands and oak barrens managed by rotational burning every three years than on unmanaged sites (3883).

The sixth study found that for three fritillary species rotational burning in prairies did not affect abundance, but for three others, in at least one region surveyed, abundance was lower in prairies managed by rotational burning, sometimes in combination with haying, grazing and/or mowing, than in prairies managed with only haying or grazing, or in unmanaged prairies. One replicated, site comparison study in the USA\\u00a0reported that Karner blue butterfly abundance was similar in rotationally burned and unmanaged oak savannas and prairies. One site comparison study in the USA\\u00a0reported that regal fritillary abundance was higher in grasslands and oak barrens managed by rotational burning every three years (following restoration by seeding) than on unmanaged sites or remnant prairies. One replicated, site comparison study in the USA\\u00a0found that the abundance of regal fritillary was higher in rotationally burned prairies four years after the last burn than one or eight years after the last burn. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the USA\\u00a0found that, in June, the abundance of regal fritillaries in prairies burned on rotation that spring was lower than in prairies burned 1\\u20132 years ago, but in July the abundance was higher in recently burned prairies.\\nSurvival (1 study): One replicated study in South Africa\\u00a0found that populations of Karkloof blue persisted for at least a year following rotational burning.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\"\n}"

Two of four studies found that excluding non-native pigs and deer led to greater species richness of butterflies and macro-moths, while two other studies on elk exclusion showed mixed effects on species richness depending on the year and fire intensity (3891). A global systematic review found that reducing or removing grazing by wild or domestic herbivores in temperate and boreal forests did not affect the species richness of butterflies and moths (3891). Five of eight studies discovered that fencing to exclude or reduce the density of deer, sheep, pigs, and other large herbivores resulted in a higher abundance of butterflies, moths, caterpillars, rare macro-moths, and New Forest burnet moths (3891). A global systematic review also found that reducing or removing grazing in temperate and boreal forests increased the abundance of butterflies and moths (3891). One study noted that excluding sika deer led to a lower abundance of tree-feeding moths (3891). In one study, all Glanville fritillary caterpillar nests survived in a grassland area fenced to exclude sheep, compared to 88% in a grazed area, and fewer nests were damaged (3891).",

    "relevant_summary": "Several studies have compared the effectiveness of different methods for creating field margins on butterfly communities in European farmland. When comparing sown wildflower strips to grass or uncultivated margins, floristically enhanced grass buffers or wildflower strips were found to have a greater species richness of butterflies than standard grass margins in three studies based in the UK and Sweden (3982). Two studies from the UK and Sweden also showed that margins sown with wildflowers had a greater butterfly species richness than grass-only margins (3932). However, two other UK studies found that farms with floristically enhanced margins had a similar species richness of butterflies and moths as farms with standard grass margins (3982). In a wider review of thirteen studies, eight found that sown wildflower strips had a higher species richness and diversity of butterflies and moths compared to conventional or unsown margins, while four studies found the species richness to be similar (3932).\n\nRegarding butterfly abundance, four studies in the UK and Sweden indicated that floristically enhanced grass buffers or wildflower strips supported a higher abundance of butterflies than standard grass or uncultivated margins (3982). This is supported by two studies in the UK and Sweden that found wildflower-sown margins had a higher butterfly abundance than grass-only margins (3932), and ten studies across the UK, Switzerland, and Finland that reported a higher abundance of butterflies in sown wildflower strips compared to conventional or unsown margins (3932). In contrast, two UK studies found that farms with floristically enhanced margins had a higher abundance of some butterfly species but a lower abundance of others compared to farms with standard grass margins (3982, 3932). Additionally, the width of the margin can be a factor, as some studies found that wider grass margins (up to 6m) supported a greater species richness and diversity of butterflies and moths than narrower margins (3982). In comparison, beetle banks were found to have a lower species richness of butterflies than hedgerows and a similar abundance of caterpillars to field margins (3927).",

    "relevant_summary": "The cessation of mowing on grasslands has shown varied effects on butterfly populations. Two studies found that the butterfly and moth community composition in grasslands abandoned for over five years was similar to that in managed grasslands (3957, 3956). However, one study observed that after six years of abandonment, the butterfly community became dominated by generalist species with fewer generations per year (3957). In terms of species richness, five of seven studies found no significant difference between grasslands abandoned for 3-13 years and those that were regularly mowed (3957). Conversely, grasslands abandoned for over 50 years showed lower species richness (3957). Butterfly abundance also yielded mixed results; four studies reported a decline in abundance in grasslands abandoned for 1-20 years compared to annually or biennially mown grasslands (3957), while another four studies found higher abundance in grasslands left uncut for over three years (3957). Some studies noted a shift in species, with an increase in woodland and hedgerow butterflies but a decrease in grassland species, and in some cases, the extinction of silver-studded blue butterflies in abandoned meadows (3957).\n\nSimilarly, ceasing grazing on grasslands produced a range of outcomes. Two studies found that the community composition of butterflies and moths in grasslands abandoned for more than five years was comparable to that in grazed grasslands (3956). Another study noted a shift towards generalist species after six years of ceased grazing and mowing (3956). Species richness was similar in six of nine studies between grasslands ungrazed for over five years and those under grazing management (3956). However, some studies found higher richness in abandoned grasslands, particularly 4-10 years after cessation, compared to extensively grazed lands (3956). Butterfly abundance was higher in abandoned grasslands in six of twenty studies (3956), lower in four studies (3956), and similar in another four (3956). The response often depended on the specific butterfly species (3956). As with mowing cessation, the abandonment of grazing led to an increase in woodland and hedgerow butterfly species and a decrease in grassland species, with instances of the large blue and silver-studded blue becoming extinct in some abandoned areas (3956). A review in Europe reported that ceasing grazing benefited six out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern (3956).",

In terms of species richness, five of seven studies found no significant difference between grasslands abandoned for 3-13 years and those that were regularly mowed (3957). Conversely, grasslands abandoned for over 50 years showed lower species richness (3957). Butterfly abundance also yielded mixed results; four studies reported a decline in abundance in grasslands abandoned for 1-20 years compared to annually or biennially mown grasslands (3957), while another four studies found higher abundance in grasslands left uncut for over three years (3957). Some studies noted a shift in species, with an increase in woodland and hedgerow butterflies but a decrease in grassland species, and in some cases, the extinction of silver-studded blue butterflies in abandoned meadows (3957).\\n\\nSimilarly, ceasing grazing on grasslands produced a range of outcomes. Two studies found that the community composition of butterflies and moths in grasslands abandoned for more than five years was comparable to that in grazed grasslands (3956). Another study noted a shift towards generalist species after six years of ceased grazing and mowing (3956). Species richness was similar in six of nine studies between grasslands ungrazed for over five years and those under grazing management (3956). However, some studies found higher richness in abandoned grasslands, particularly 4-10 years after cessation, compared to extensively grazed lands (3956). Butterfly abundance was higher in abandoned grasslands in six of twenty studies (3956), lower in four studies (3956), and similar in another four (3956). The response often depended on the specific butterfly species (3956). As with mowing cessation, the abandonment of grazing led to an increase in woodland and hedgerow butterfly species and a decrease in grassland species, with instances of the large blue and silver-studded blue becoming extinct in some abandoned areas (3956).

Excluding predators, such as birds, mammals, spiders, and ants, was found to increase the survival of large copper caterpillars, Boisduval silkworm eggs and caterpillars, and Appalachian brown eggs and juveniles in three of five studies. However, two studies showed no increase in monarch caterpillar survival after excluding vertebrate or terrestrial predators (3889). Fencing out or reducing non-native pigs and deer was found in two of four studies to increase butterfly and macro-moth species richness (3891). Another two studies showed mixed effects on species richness after excluding elk, and one global review found no effect from reducing or removing grazing in certain forests (3891). The abundance of butterflies, moths, and caterpillars was found to increase in five of eight studies when excluding or reducing deer, sheep, pigs, and other large herbivores, while a global review also found that reducing or removing grazing increased butterfly and moth abundance (3891). In one study, the survival of Glanville fritillary caterpillar nests was 100% in a fenced-off area to exclude sheep, compared to 88% in a grazed area, and fewer nests were damaged (3891).",

    "relevant_summary": "The success of captive breeding and release programs for butterflies and moths is influenced by several factors. Releasing captive-bred individuals has led to populations persisting for 2-28 years and increasing in abundance (3914). However, other studies show populations dying out within 1-12 years, with one review indicating that only 25% of released populations survive for more than three years, and only 8% for more than ten years (3914). Similarly, translocated populations have been reported to persist for between 2 and 49 years, while others have died out in as little as 0-7 years (3909). The success of these programs can be dependent on continued releases to supplement the population (3914, 3909). \n\nHabitat management at the release site is a significant factor. Practices such as coppicing, selective felling, planting, fencing, host plant translocation, invasive plant removal, sheep grazing, and scrub clearance have been associated with the persistence and increased abundance of translocated populations (3909). For example, captive-bred pearl-bordered fritillaries released into coppiced woodland successfully bred at least once (3914). The life stage at which individuals are released varies, with releases of eggs, caterpillars, pupae, and adults all being recorded (3914). The specific conditions of the release site are also important; for instance, the survival of large blue caterpillars was higher when they were translocated into nests of the ant Myrmica sabuleti that did not have a queen present (3909). Comparative studies have found that translocated large copper caterpillars had a higher survival rate than captive-bred ones (3909), and that released, captive-bred large copper caterpillars had lower survival rates than their captive, wild, or translocated counterparts (3914). Nineteen years after translocation, a population of large blue butterflies in the UK showed similar genetic diversity to its Swedish source population (3909). Following a release of captive-bred large coppers, the number of eggs laid per female increased over the first three years (3914).",

    "relevant_summary": "Planting new hedges and managing existing ones provides numerous benefits for butterfly and moth conservation on farmland. Studies in the UK, Ireland, and Canada have shown that established hedgerows support a higher species richness of butterflies and macro-moths compared to other farm habitats like beetle banks, crops, or pastures (3976). The abundance of butterflies and moths is also greater along hedgerows than in open fields or on grass margins (3976). The composition of the hedge is important, as planting species like gorse, oak, and blackthorn can support a higher number of arthropod species, including caterpillars, than the more commonly planted hawthorn (3976).\n\nThe management of existing hedgerows also plays a crucial role. Hedgerows with a more complex structure, such as those with trees, have a higher diversity of butterflies and moths (3975). Management practices like cutting hedgerows less frequently (every 2-3 years), cutting in autumn, or allowing for incremental growth can increase the abundance of butterflies, moths, and their caterpillars (3975). The height and shape of the hedge also matter; hedgerows kept between 1-2 meters tall in Italy and those with scalloped edges in Belgium have been found to support more butterflies and their eggs (3975). Laid or coppiced hedges in the UK also had a higher abundance of butterflies than unmanaged ones (3975). Furthermore, providing training and advice to landowners about agri-environment schemes has resulted in the management of large areas of farmland for the benefit of species like the marsh fritillary butterfly (3846).",

In contrast, traditional hay meadows mown once a year supported a higher abundance of heath fritillary adults and caterpillars than old, abandoned meadows (3908). Summer-grazed or mown grasslands were found to have a lower abundance of woodland butterflies and burnet moths than abandoned grasslands (3908). Additionally, after a reduction in management, the abundance of two butterfly species decreased, and 12 species of moth showed a preference for more intensively managed grasslands (3958).\n\nPotential benefits of abandoning or reducing management intensity on grasslands include a higher species richness of butterflies and moths (3958). Less intensively managed grasslands may also support more specialist moth species, species of conservation concern, and butterfly species with specific host plant requirements (3958). Several studies found that the abundance of butterflies, micro-moths, and declining macro-moths was higher in low-input or unfertilized, ungrazed grasslands (3958). One study found that butterflies were less abundant in managed grasslands compared to unmanaged ones (3908). Similarly, unmown grasslands were found to have a higher abundance and species richness of nocturnal moths compared to mown grasslands (3908).

    "relevant_summary": "In European forests, comparing the effects of coppicing and clearing patches on butterfly and moth communities reveals varied impacts.\n\nIn terms of community composition, coppiced woodland and wider woodland rides were found to have more unique species of macro-moths than mature forest or standard width rides (3938, 3939). Different aged coppiced woodlands supported different communities of butterflies and moths (3939).\n\nFor species richness and diversity, cleared patches in forests showed a greater species richness of butterflies but a lower species richness of moths when compared to unmanaged patches, coppiced woodland, or closed-canopy forests (3938). One study noted a decline in butterfly species richness over the first three years after clearing (3938). In contrast, coppiced woodland was found to have a greater species richness of butterflies than unmanaged woodland (3939). However, it also had a lower species richness of macro-moths than mature forest, and the age of the coppice did not affect this (3939). Another study found that woodland coppiced two years prior had a greater butterfly species richness than woodland coppiced more than 15 years prior (3939). The species richness of moths was similar in woodland that was coppiced 1-4, 5-8 and 12-20 years ago (3939).\n\nRegarding population abundance, cleared forest patches that were also coppiced and grazed had a higher abundance of butterflies in general, including species like the chequered blue, woodland brown, high brown fritillary, and small pearl-bordered fritillary, compared to unmanaged or solely coppiced areas (3938). However, the abundance of butterflies in these cleared patches declined over the first three years after clearing (3938). Larger cleared patches supported a higher abundance of butterflies than undisturbed forest (3938), while wider rides had a lower abundance of macro-moths than standard width rides or mature forest (3938). In coppiced woodlands, a higher abundance of butterflies, particularly the heath fritillary, was observed compared to unmanaged woodland (3939). Populations of pearl-bordered fritillary and small pearl-bordered fritillary were also more likely to persist in coppiced woodland (3939). Conversely, the abundance of macro-moths was lower in coppiced woodland than in mature forest, with no change in abundance based on the age of the coppice (3939). The timing of coppicing was also a factor, with higher butterfly abundance found in woodlands coppiced 2, 2-4, 5-7, or 12-15 years ago compared to those coppiced 5-11 or over 15 years ago (3939). After coppicing along with other management like scrub control and grazing, the abundance of high brown fritillary and small pearl-bordered fritillary increased (3939). Across Europe, clearing small patches in forests was reported to benefit 19 out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern (3938).",
