Adding sulphur before sowing reduced overall vegetation cover but increased the cover of three of six sown species when applied in low amounts. Native plant species cover and richness were not altered by sulphur addition (Action 3428).

However, adding sulphur alongside planting heather seedlings increased their survival, though survival remained very low after two years (Action 1710).",

Mowing after seeding/planting has been found to increase plant species richness compared to grazing with livestock in one UK study (Action 3419). Additionally, mowing after sowing seeds increased the richness of sown species in another UK study, and cutting sown plots each year with removal of cut vegetation increased sown grass and forb species richness compared to cutting without removing vegetation (Action 3419). Mowing after sowing also increased the abundance of sown forb species in one UK study and increased the abundance of five of seven sown forb species when mowing was more frequent in a German study (Action 3419). In contrast, livestock grazing after seeding showed mixed results for sown species enhancement. One UK study found that grazing with cattle after sowing seeds increased sown species richness compared to grazing with sheep, but another UK study found that grazing with cattle reduced the cover of sown species compared to grazing with sheep (Action 3423). However, one Italian study found that grazing with livestock after sowing seeds increased plant species richness compared to sowing without grazing (Action 3423). The evidence suggests that annual mowing after sowing can increase plant community similarity to natural grassland and that cutting vegetation three times per year after sowing increased the richness of characteristic grassland species compared to cutting once per year (Action 3419).",

One study found that sowing yellow rattle seeds did not alter plant species richness (Action 3404).\n\nRegarding vegetation abundance effects, the evidence shows country-specific variations: In the UK, one review found that sowing seeds of the parasitic plant yellow rattle led to a decrease in total plant biomass in three of four studies (Action 3404). In Belgium, one controlled study found that sowing seeds of the parasitic plant marsh lousewort increased the abundance of six target plant species (Action 3404). In Switzerland, one replicated, controlled study found that sowing seeds of the parasitic plant European yellow rattle led to a decrease in grass cover but did not alter the cover of forbs (Action 3404).\n\nAdditionally, separate research in the UK found that adding yellow rattle seed helped other sown target meadow species to colonize and that more plant species were found when yellow rattle was present, and that yellow rattle could be established on a pasture field by 'slot seeding' (Action 129).",

Five studies examined mycorrhizal inoculation effects, with one study in Germany finding that inoculation did not alter plant species richness, while another study in Germany found that adding mycorrhiza increased the abundance of target species considered a local conservation priority (Action 3429). In the USA, one study found that mycorrhizal inoculation initially increased vegetation cover but after three years vegetation cover did not differ between inoculated and non-inoculated areas (Action 3429). The same action showed that mycorrhizal fungi increased the height of giant sacaton plants but did not increase their biomass or emergence rates (Action 3429). Topsoil addition before seeding demonstrates more consistent positive effects. One study in the USA found that adding topsoil before sowing seeds increased both plant species richness and the biomass of sown species in most cases (Action 3420). When topsoil was added alongside seeding, one study found it increased grass biomass but reduced forb biomass compared to topsoil addition alone (Action 1857). Soil amendments with bacteria and fungi resulted in higher microbial diversity and increased soil organic matter content, with two studies finding higher crop yields (Action 888). Compost application as a soil amendment increased soil organic matter levels, microbial biomass and fruit yield in one study in Italy (Action 889).",

Adding carbon to soil after sowing seeds either reduced or did not alter the density of sown forb species (Action 3433). Adding mulch before sowing seeds did not alter the species richness of target plants in one study and did not increase plant cover in another (Action 3425). Additionally, adding mulch before planting seedlings reduced the cover of planted species in one study, while in other cases it did not alter the density of six sown plant species (Action 3425). Adding charcoal to soil before sowing seeds did not alter overall plant biomass or grass cover (Action 3422). In wetland contexts, adding compost before planting wetland herbs typically reduced overall plant species richness over three growing seasons, with richness being negatively related to the amount of soil organic matter in plots (Action 3308). Other neutral effects included adding fertilizer after planting native prairie plants, which reduced the diameter of prairie lupine plants and did not alter the growth of six other plant species (Action 3427). These findings suggest that soil amendments can sometimes have no beneficial effect or may even negatively impact certain aspects of grassland establishment, particularly regarding species diversity and abundance of specific plant types.",

Adding fertilizer to soil before or after seeding/planting showed that three replicated, controlled, paired studies found that adding fertilizer alongside sowing seeds did not alter the survival of seedlings (action 3427). Adding mulch before or after seeding/planting resulted in one study finding that adding mulch before sowing seeds increased the number of seedlings in most cases (action 3425). Sowing grassland seeds from a local source showed that one replicated, randomized, controlled experiment found that sowing Sandberg bluegrass seeds from a local source did not change the survival of sown plants compared to sowing non-local varieties (action 3400). For transplanted plants, one study found that 44% of new seedlings from transplanted pepper saxifrage plants survived over four months (action 3399).

    "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4",
    "provider": null,
    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence, the three mechanical seeding methods show different effects on grassland vegetation in the US and UK. Strip seeding (slot seeding) was studied in the UK and increased both grass species richness and forb species richness, but in the majority of cases resulted in failed introductions of sown species (Action 3411). Drill seeding was studied exclusively in the USA and showed mixed effects: two of three studies found it did not alter plant species richness, while one study found mixed effects; one study found it increased the density of two sown grass species compared to hand sowing, but two other studies found it led to no change or a reduction in the abundance of sown plants compared to hydroseeding or hand sowing; it did increase the abundance of warm-season grass species compared to hand sowing (Action 3410). Hydroseeding was studied in Spain, Italy, and the USA and showed variable results: one of two studies found it did not alter plant diversity in most cases while the other found it increased plant species richness in one of two cases; one study found it increased overall plant cover in most cases while another found it did not alter vegetation cover; it increased the abundance of half of the sown plant species compared to drill seeding in one USA study; and it led to an increase in the height of herb species in Italy (Action 3412). The evidence suggests that hydroseeding may be more effective than drill seeding for establishing sown species, as one study found drill seeding led to reduced abundance of sown plants compared to hydroseeding.",

One of two replicated, controlled studies in the UK and Germany found that disturbing soil before sowing seeds increased plant and seedling species richness (Action 3413). More specifically, rotovating soil before sowing seeds increased both grass species richness and forb species richness in most cases compared to harrowing before sowing in a UK study (Action 3413). Adding topsoil before seeding increased plant species richness according to one replicated, controlled study, though this was conducted in the USA rather than Europe (Action 3420). Inoculating soil with mycorrhizal fungi before seeding did not alter plant species richness according to one replicated, randomized, controlled study in Germany (Action 3429). Adding sulphur to soil before seeding had mixed results, with one study in the UK finding it reduced plant species richness while another in the USA found no change (Action 3428). Adding charcoal to soil before seeding showed no clear effects on species richness in a Netherlands study (Action 3422).",

Regarding species diversity in seed mixes, four studies in the USA found that increasing the number of species in a seed mix increased the species richness of sown plants (Action 3406). However, one study found that increasing species number did not change overall plant species richness, and effects on sown species cover were mixed, with one study showing increased cover and another showing no change (Action 3406). For seed density modifications, studies in the USA found that sowing seeds at higher densities increased forb species richness, grass cover, and forb cover (Action 3405). Higher seed density also increased the number of purple needlegrass seedlings but did not alter overall cover of sown plant species (Action 3405). Additionally, sowing seeds at higher density reduced the cover of native grassland shrubs (Action 3405). Regarding broader seeding approaches, twelve studies in North America examining native grass and forb seeding found that sixteen of twenty-eight studies showed increased overall plant species richness, though three studies found species richness was lower in sown areas than in intact grasslands (Action 3432). The evidence suggests that both increased species diversity and higher seed density can enhance certain aspects of grassland restoration success, though effects vary depending on the specific vegetation metrics measured.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence, multiple actions can increase the abundance of sown or planted species in grassland restoration projects. \n\n**Seeding strategies and timing:** Sowing seeds at a higher density can increase the cover of individual plant species like thickspike wheatgrass and increase the number of purple needlegrass seedlings, though effects on overall sown species cover are mixed (Action 3405). Sowing seeds at the start of the growing season increased the cover of sown grass and forb species compared to autumn sowing and increased the number of sown species (Action 3407). Increasing the number of species in seed mix showed mixed effects, with one study finding increased cover of sown plant species while another found no change (Action 3406).\n\n**Site preparation methods:** Applying herbicide before seeding increased the cover of sown grass species and increased sown species richness (Action 3418). Disturbing soil before sowing seeds increased plant emergence in most cases and improved seedling survival in some studies (Action 3413). Removing leaf litter before seeding showed mixed effects on seedling emergence of sown species (Action 3414).\n\n**Soil amendments and treatments:** Adding fertilizer to soil before or after seeding showed mixed results, with some studies finding increased cover and density of sown species while others found no change (Action 3427). Inoculating soil with mycorrhiza before seeding increased the abundance of target species considered a local conservation priority and increased cover of some native prairie species (Action 3429).\n\n**Post-establishment management:** Mowing after seeding increased the abundance of sown forb species and increased sown species richness, with more frequent mowing increasing abundance of five of seven sown forb species (Action 3419). Using erosion blankets after seeding showed mixed effects on vegetation (Action 3431).\n\n**Direct planting approaches:** Plant grassland plants increased species richness of grasses in 50% of cases and forbs in 83% of cases, with planted species having mixed effects on abundance (Action 3399). Sowing native grass and forb seeds increased the abundance of sown species in most cases, with five of six studies finding positive effects (Action 3432).\n\n**Spatial strategies:** Sowing seeds in prepared gaps within vegetation led to greater cover of sown target plant species when using large gaps compared to smaller gaps (Action 3409). Sowing grassland seeds from a local source increased the abundance of some characteristic plant species and increased cover of target plant species when combined with increased species diversity (Action 3400).\n\n**Water management:** Irrigating after seeding showed limited evidence, with one study finding no change in vegetation cover (Action 3430).",

Topsoil or turf removal before seeding showed positive effects on survival, with two studies in the USA finding that removing topsoil before planting California oatgrass or sowing and planting purple needlegrass increased the survival of seedlings and plants (action 3415). Herbicide application before seeding demonstrated benefits for emergence, with one study in Germany finding that spraying with herbicide before sowing seeds increased seedling emergence for five of eight wildflower species (action 3418). In direct comparisons within European studies, removing turf before sowing seeds increased both grass and forb species richness in most cases compared to disturbing the soil before sowing in a UK study (action 3415). One UK study found that rotovating soil before sowing seeds increased both grass and forb species richness compared to harrowing before sowing (action 3413).

No other grassland seeding or planting interventions had any evidence for effects on vegetation structure - this includes sowing seeds at higher density (Action 3405), increasing the number of species in seed mix (Action 3406), sowing seeds in prepared gaps within vegetation (Action 3409), removing vegetation before seeding/planting (Action 3416), adding topsoil before seeding/planting (Action 3420), removing leaf litter before seeding/planting (Action 3414), and irrigating before or after seeding/planting (Action 3430).

    "relevant_summary": "Post-seeding management practices in grasslands show distinct effects on vegetation outcomes. Mowing after seeding/planting increased plant species richness compared to grazing with livestock in UK studies (Action 3419). Specifically, cutting vegetation yearly after sowing seeds resulted in higher plant species richness than livestock grazing (Action 3419). Mowing also increased the richness of sown species after seeding, with one UK study showing that mowing after sowing seeds increased sown species richness (Action 3419). Additionally, cutting sown plots each year and removing cut vegetation increased sown grass and forb species richness compared to cutting without removing vegetation (Action 3419). \n\nFor grazing effects, one UK study found that grazing with cattle after sowing seeds increased sown species richness compared to grazing with sheep (Action 3423). However, the same study also found that grazing with cattle reduced the cover of sown species compared to sheep grazing (Action 3423). Grazing with livestock after sowing seeds generally reduced plant species richness compared to cutting vegetation after sowing (Action 3423).\n\nRegarding mowing frequency, cutting vegetation three times per year after sowing seeds increased the richness of characteristic grassland species compared to cutting once per year in German studies (Action 3419). More frequent mowing also increased the abundance of five of seven sown forb species (Action 3419).\n\nThe timing of management also matters, as studies showed that delaying mowing dates resulted in higher plant species richness in some cases (Action 131).",
