For parrot\u2019s feather, lab and field results show differing efficacy by chemical and over time: endothall reduced growth in lab but field cover decreased only shortly after treatment before returning toward pre-treatment levels [1681]; dichlobenil reduced growth but was less effective than a 2,4\u2011D+MCPA mix at 8 days and early cover reductions often rebounded by 45 days [1699]; 2,4\u2011D reduced growth more than diquat, glyphosate, or imazapyr in lab, 2,4\u2011D amine reduced biomass in field, and combinations (2,4\u2011D+MCPA; 2,4\u2011D+carfentrazone\u2011ethyl) achieved higher short\u2011term reductions or elimination, though some advantages diminished by 45 days [1606, 1699]. Some herbicides (fluridone, clopyralid, copper chelate) did not reduce growth, while others (imazamox, imazapyr, flumioxazin, florpyrauxifen\u2011benzyl, glufosinate\u2011ammonium, glyphosate) reduced growth or biomass in certain studies [1699]. For water primrose, triclopyr TEA at 0.25% killed 100% of young cultivated plants within two months; glyphosate achieved 97\u2013100% mortality when mixed with specific sticking agents (non\u2011oil based or TopFilm); halosulfuron\u2011methyl reduced coverage without apparent rice toxicity, indicating adjuvants, concentration, plant age, and crop selectivity considerations affect outcomes [1139]. Combining herbicides with mechanical removal improved control, with glyphosate plus a surfactant (Cygnet\u2011Plus) followed by mechanical removal yielding a 75% kill, and integrated programs reducing coverage by 85\u201390% [1140]. For skunk cabbage, outcomes differed by active ingredient and dose: one UK study reported both glyphosate and 2,4\u2011D amine killed all plants, while another found 2,4\u2011D amine at 9 L/ha eradicated plants but glyphosate was unsuccessful beyond limited growth reduction [1102].",

Adults can be captured overnight in a single floating trap (small study, USA) [1045]. Intensive adult removals saw rapid population rebound (replicated, controlled, USA) [1045], whereas shooting metamorphosed individuals before reproduction, as part of a combination treatment, was followed by significant reductions in recorded adults and juveniles (before-and-after, France) [1045]. Removing juveniles by trapping, within a combination treatment, was followed by significant reductions in recorded adults and juveniles (before-and-after, France) [1046]. More broadly, removing or eradicating bullfrogs increased native frog occurrence and range in multiple before-and-after studies (USA; USA and Mexico) [825].\n- Biological control: Introducing northern pike led to a strong decline in bullfrog tadpoles (replicated, controlled, Belgium) [1039].\n- Chemical control: Several chemicals killed bullfrogs in tests, including caffeine 10%, chloroxylenol 5%, and a combined treatment of permethrin 4.6% + rotenone 1% (replicated, controlled, USA) [1048].\n- Other options with no captured evidence of effectiveness: Habitat modification [1041], pond destruction [1043], collection of egg clutches (despite references to removal using bilge pumps or nets) [1047], fencing [1044], and public education [1049].",
