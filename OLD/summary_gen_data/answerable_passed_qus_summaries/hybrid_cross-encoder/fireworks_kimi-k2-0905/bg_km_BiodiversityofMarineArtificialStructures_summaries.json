Both habitat lengths showed mixed effects on invertebrate abundance depending on factors like survey week, species group, and habitat characteristics, with three studies on short habitats and three studies on long habitats documenting variable responses (actions 3450, 3451). For fish populations, both habitat lengths demonstrated mixed effects on seahorse abundance depending on survey timing (actions 3450, 3451).

One study found transplanting oysters increased mobile invertebrate species richness, but two of three studies found no increase in fish species richness. Abundance outcomes varied with transplanting oysters showing mixed effects on combined macroalgae and invertebrate abundance, mobile invertebrate abundance, and fish abundance. Survival studies revealed varying results depending on species, site, and surface characteristics - oyster survival was higher when transplanted into grooves versus ridges, with survival rates varying by site. One study found transplanting oysters and coralline algae did not increase fish interaction time or bites taken from surfaces, though benthic fishes took more bites from oyster-only surfaces compared to combined algae and oyster surfaces.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on 22 studies from various locations worldwide, several habitat creation methods have shown effectiveness for increasing species richness and diversity on intertidal artificial structures. Pit habitats (1-50 mm) appear to be the most consistently effective, with 8 out of 12 controlled studies showing increased macroalgae and invertebrate species richness or diversity on structure surfaces, though effects varied by site and species group. Rock pools also showed strong results, with 9 out of 12 controlled studies supporting higher species diversity and richness compared to structure surfaces without pools. Groove habitats (1-50 mm) demonstrated mixed effectiveness, with 3 out of 6 controlled studies showing increased species richness or diversity, though they did support different species communities and supported higher richness than some other habitat types like ridges. Combined approaches using grooves with small protrusions, ridges or ledges showed 6 out of 11 controlled studies increasing species diversity or richness. However, several methods showed limited effectiveness or even negative impacts. Short flexible habitats (1-50 mm) actually decreased species richness, while long flexible habitats (>50 mm) altered community composition without clear increases in richness. Small ridges or ledges (1-50 mm) generally supported lower species richness than grooves created between them. The effectiveness of all methods appeared to depend on various factors including habitat size and arrangement, shore level, site conditions, and the specific species groups being considered.",

For pit habitats, 16 studies examined community responses with mixed but generally positive effects: 4 out of 6 controlled studies found that pits altered macroalgae and invertebrate community composition, with pits supporting species absent from surfaces without added habitats. Eight of 12 controlled studies found pits increased species richness/diversity, though some found mixed effects depending on site, size, or arrangement.\n\nFor hole habitats, only 3 studies examined community responses, but all found positive effects: creating holes altered macroalgae and invertebrate community composition and increased species diversity/richness on structure surfaces, with holes supporting species absent from control surfaces.\n\nPopulation responses varied for both habitat types. For pit habitats, 5 studies examined overall abundance with 2 finding increases, 1 finding decreases, and 2 finding no effect or mixed effects. For hole habitats, 2 studies examined abundance with neither finding increases in macroalgal or invertebrate abundance.\n\nBoth habitat types were found to be actively used by organisms - pit habitats were used by periwinkles, macroalgae, limpets, and increased fish foraging behavior, while hole habitats were used by sea slugs, urchins, and octopuses.",

These studies demonstrated that pit habitats consistently altered community composition and increased species richness and diversity, with 8 out of 12 studies showing increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness and/or diversity. Rock pools created on intertidal artificial structures also showed strong effectiveness, with 18 studies examining their impacts and 13 studies showing they supported species that were absent from structure surfaces without pools. Additionally, rock pools created different community compositions compared to surfaces without pools in multiple studies. Creating hole habitats (>50 mm) showed positive effects in 5 studies, with findings that they altered community composition and increased species diversity and richness. In contrast, other modifications showed more limited or mixed results - crevice habitats (>50 mm) had no studies evaluating their effects, flexible habitats showed mixed results with some studies finding decreased species richness, and natural rocky reef topography showed no increase in species richness in the available studies. The evidence indicates that small-scale surface modifications like pits and water-retaining features like rock pools are the most consistently effective for altering ecological communities on intertidal artificial structures.",

Transplanting or seeding algae directly onto structures is effective, with studies showing that canopy algae transplanted onto subtidal artificial structures had increased cover when protected by cages (action 3471), and macroalgae transplanted onto intertidal structures showed varying survival rates depending on shore position (action 3472). \n\nSurface modifications can also enhance algal abundance. Creating textured surfaces (\u22641 mm) on subtidal structures showed mixed effects on macroalgal abundance depending on species group and site (action 3449), while creating large ledges (>50 mm) on intertidal structures along with grooves and small protrusions increased rockweed abundance (action 3465). However, creating textured surfaces on intertidal structures did not increase macroalgal abundance in studies from the Netherlands (action 3466).\n\nUsing environmentally-sensitive materials can influence algal communities. While most studies found that using quarried rock or recycled-cement-concrete in place of standard-concrete did not increase macroalgal abundance (action 3470), some showed mixed effects depending on species group and site. Creating natural rocky reef topography on subtidal structures did not increase juvenile canopy macroalgae settlement regardless of topography depth (action 3446).\n\nCreating small protrusions (1-50 mm) on subtidal structures had mixed effects on macroalgal abundance depending on the species (action 3453), and creating grooves with small protrusions, ridges or ledges showed mixed effects on combined macroalgae and invertebrate abundance depending on surface orientation (action 3452).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from marine conservation action documents, several interventions can be used to increase algal abundance on marine artificial structures. Transplanting or seeding algae directly onto structures shows the most consistent positive results, with studies demonstrating that canopy algae cover increased when transplanted under protective cages on subtidal structures (Action ID 3471), and that macroalgae survival varied depending on shore position when transplanted onto intertidal structures (Action ID 3472). Creating specific habitat features on structure surfaces also shows potential, including creating textured surfaces (\u22641 mm) which had mixed effects on macroalgal abundance depending on species group and site (Action ID 3449), creating small protrusions (1-50 mm) which showed mixed effects on macroalgal abundance depending on the species (Action ID 3453), and creating pit habitats and groove habitats which had mixed effects on macroalgal abundances depending on species group (Action IDs 3455, 3448). Creating natural rocky reef topography on subtidal artificial structures was found to not increase juvenile canopy macroalgae abundance regardless of topography depth (Action ID 3446). Combining multiple habitat modifications with environmentally-sensitive materials appears most effective, as demonstrated by studies that created combinations of pits, grooves, and holes with eco-friendly materials, resulting in altered macroalgae community composition and increased diversity (Action IDs 3448, 3455). The success of interventions varied by species group, site conditions, wave exposure, and surface orientation, indicating that context-specific approaches are necessary for optimizing algal abundance enhancement.",

    "relevant_summary": "The ecological effects of simultaneously creating grooves and small protrusions, ridges, or ledges (1-50 mm) on artificial structures have been extensively studied across marine environments. For intertidal structures, 16 studies across multiple locations including Singapore Strait, USA, Australia, Hong Kong, Israel, Spain, and the UK demonstrate varied ecological impacts. Community composition effects are mixed - three of five controlled studies found these features altered macroalgae and invertebrate community composition, while two studies showed mixed effects depending on site conditions and feature arrangements. Species diversity and richness generally increased in six of eleven controlled studies, with mixed effects in five studies depending on factors like groove/ledge dimensions, shore level, and species groups. Population abundance effects also varied - two studies found increased combined abundance when features were partially-covered with water-retaining and light-shading covers, while other studies showed mixed or no significant effects on macroalgae, invertebrates, and fish abundances depending on environmental conditions and site characteristics.\n\nFor subtidal structures, three studies in Israel, UK, and Spain found these microhabitat features generally enhanced biodiversity. One controlled study found altered community composition and increased species richness and diversity, while another showed mixed effects on species richness depending on surface orientation. The features supported colonization by macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrates, with abundance effects varying by surface orientation. These microhabitat modifications consistently provide colonization opportunities for species that would otherwise be absent from smooth artificial structure surfaces, creating more complex habitat heterogeneity that can enhance marine biodiversity in both intertidal and subtidal environments.",

Site-specific factors play a crucial role, as many modifications showed mixed effects on invertebrate abundance depending on the location (actions 3459, 3435, 3469, 3472). The presence of surface features such as grooves, small ridges, ledges, texture, pits and water-retaining depressions significantly affects outcomes - creating short flexible habitats altered non-mobile invertebrate abundance depending on species group and site (action 3459), natural rocky reef topography with shaded grooves had mixed effects on barnacle and mobile invertebrate abundances depending on site (action 3435), textured surfaces showed mixed effects on barnacle and mobile invertebrate abundances depending on the site (action 3466), and transplanting oysters had mixed effects on mobile invertebrate abundance depending on the presence of grooves and small ridges or ledges and site (action 3472). Environmental conditions such as wave exposure and tidal position also influenced outcomes - sandstone surfaces increased barnacle abundance depending on site and tidal position (action 3469), macroalgae transplants survived better at mid- and highshore than lowshore (action 3472), and oyster survival was higher in grooves compared with ridges (action 3472). The type of modification matters - reducing slope alone did not increase oyster or mobile invertebrate abundance (action 3461), while using hemp-concrete increased mobile invertebrate species richness (action 3469). Material type and surface complexity are important - ECOncreteTM with added grooves, small ledges and holes increased species richness and diversity (action 3469), and different texture types supported different barnacle abundances (action 3466).",

The presence of surface features such as grooves, small ridges, ledges, texture, pits and water-retaining depressions significantly affects outcomes - creating short flexible habitats altered non-mobile invertebrate abundance depending on species group and site (action 3459), natural rocky reef topography with shaded grooves had mixed effects on barnacle and mobile invertebrate abundances depending on site (action 3435), textured surfaces showed mixed effects on barnacle and mobile invertebrate abundances depending on the site (action 3466), and transplanting oysters had mixed effects on mobile invertebrate abundance depending on the presence of grooves and small ridges or ledges and site (action 3472). Environmental conditions such as wave exposure and tidal position also influenced outcomes - sandstone surfaces increased barnacle abundance depending on site and tidal position (action 3469), macroalgae transplants survived better at mid- and highshore than lowshore (action 3472), and oyster survival was higher in grooves compared with ridges (action 3472). The type of modification matters - reducing slope alone did not increase oyster or mobile invertebrate abundance (action 3461), while using hemp-concrete increased mobile invertebrate species richness (action 3469).

The natural topography was colonized by macroalgae and limpets, with limpets actively using shaded grooves and water-retaining depressions created by the topography. In contrast, the Italian subtidal study (action 3446) found that creating natural rocky reef topography on subtidal artificial structures did not increase the abundance of juvenile canopy macroalgae that settled onto structure surfaces, regardless of the topography depth. The intertidal UK studies demonstrated more complex outcomes with species utilizing the created habitats behaviorally, while the subtidal Italian study showed limited effects on algal settlement, with no reported community-level responses or behavioral outcomes.",

On intertidal structures, using hemp-concrete in place of standard-concrete increased mobile invertebrate species richness (Action 3469), and hemp-concrete or shell-concrete increased combined macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate abundance. However, using sandstone instead of basalt or reducing concrete pH did not increase the abundance of tubeworms, oysters, limpets, barnacles, or combined invertebrates (Action 3469). On subtidal structures, three of six replicated controlled studies found that using quarried rock instead of concrete or using ECOncreteTM with added habitats had mixed effects on non-mobile and mobile invertebrate abundance, depending on rock type, species group, and site (Action 3470). Two studies found quarried rock did not increase sponge, bryozoan, ascidian, mussel, barnacle, or Serpulid tubeworm abundance, while one found shell-concrete increased bivalve abundance (Action 3470). Three studies found ECOncreteTM with added habitats supported mobile and non-mobile invertebrate species absent from standard-concrete surfaces (Action 3470). For artificial reefs, five controlled studies found no differences in overall invertebrate abundances between different reef materials, though one found breakwaters made of oyster shell bags recruited more oysters and ribbed mussels than ReefBall breakwaters (Action 2259).",

For artificial reefs, five controlled studies found no differences in overall invertebrate abundances between different reef materials, though one found breakwaters made of oyster shell bags recruited more oysters and ribbed mussels than ReefBall breakwaters (Action 2259).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"3469\",\n    \"3470\",\n    \"2259\"\n  ]\n}"

In contrast, interventions showing inconsistent or no effects on invertebrate abundance include creating textured surfaces (\u22641 mm), hole habitats (>50 mm), small ridges or ledges (1-50 mm), and using environmentally-sensitive materials, with most studies finding no consistent increases in invertebrate abundance.",

Small protrusions, ridges, and ledges had mixed effects on community composition - some studies found no changes while others reported effects varying by site and habitat arrangement (Action ID: 3462, 3464, 3474). Large features showed more consistent positive outcomes, with large ledges increasing species diversity and abundance of macroalgae, microalgae, and invertebrates (Action ID: 3465). However, large protrusions and ridges did not consistently increase species richness compared to small features (Action ID: 3463, 3465).\n\nFor specific organism groups, small ledges supported lower mobile invertebrate richness than adjacent grooves but had similar fish richness (Action ID: 3464). Large ledges increased mussel and limpet abundances but not barnacles, and enhanced juvenile salmon feeding activity (Action ID: 3465). The effectiveness depended on feature arrangement - combining grooves with small ridges/ledges often produced better outcomes than individual features alone (Action ID: 3474).\n\nWhen both small and large features were tested together, results were mixed, with effectiveness varying by site, habitat height/depth, and species groups (Action ID: 3465, 3474).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from multiple studies, the most consistently effective interventions for altering the overall community composition of algae and invertebrates on artificial structures include: (1) Creating rock pools on intertidal structures, which consistently supported different species assemblages compared with non-pool surfaces and often increased species richness and diversity - one study found rock pools supported different combined macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate communities compared with surfaces without pools (Action 3476). (2) Transplanting or seeding organisms onto both subtidal and intertidal artificial structures consistently altered community composition - studies showed transplanted oysters on intertidal structures supported macroalgae, mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate and fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without transplanted oysters, and one subtidal study found transplanted oysters altered the combined invertebrate and fish community composition (Actions 3471, 3472). (3) Creating flexible habitats on structures showed consistent effects - long flexible habitats (>50 mm) on intertidal structures altered the combined macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate community composition and supported species absent from surfaces without flexible habitats, while short flexible habitats also altered community composition (Actions 3460, 3459, 3450). (4) Using environmentally-sensitive materials, particularly ECOncrete\u2122 combined with habitat features, consistently altered community composition compared with standard concrete (Actions 3469, 3470). (5) Creating groove habitats sometimes altered community composition, though effects were more variable and often site-dependent (Actions 3473, 3452). The evidence indicates interventions that create novel habitat features (pools, flexible structures) or introduce living organisms are most reliably effective at modifying community composition.",

However, when combined with other microhabitats (Action 3474), creating grooves and small ridges had mixed effects on community composition depending on the site and habitat arrangement, and increased species richness in some cases.\n\nFor pit habitats (Action 3475): Studies in Singapore found that pits altered macroalgae and invertebrate community composition, increased species richness and diversity in most cases, and supported species that were absent from surfaces without pits. When combined with grooves (Action 3473), these features also altered fish community composition and increased both fish species richness and abundance.\n\nFor groove habitats alone (Action 3473): Studies showed that grooves increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate abundance, increased fish species richness and abundance, and altered fish community composition and behavior (increased fish bites on surfaces).\n\nFor environmentally-sensitive materials (Action 3469): Studies in Singapore found that using alternative materials (like ECOncreTE) altered community composition, increased species richness and diversity, and supported species absent from standard concrete surfaces. However, material effects were mixed - limestone-cement had site-dependent effects on richness.\n\nFor organism transplantation (Action 3472): Studies in Singapore found that macroalgae transplanted onto structures had variable survival depending on shore level (higher survival at mid- and highshore), while corals and sponges showed species-dependent growth patterns.

Using environmentally-sensitive materials like ECOncreteTM or shell-concrete in six of eleven studies altered the combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition and supported species absent from standard concrete surfaces (Action ID: 3470). Long flexible habitats (>50 mm) created on subtidal structures supported macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate species absent from surfaces without flexible habitats (Action ID: 3451). Finally, transplanting or seeding organisms onto subtidal artificial structures altered the combined invertebrate and fish community composition and increased species richness (Action ID: 3471).",

    "relevant_summary": "Multiple factors influence the effectiveness of oyster transplantation onto intertidal artificial structures in Australian estuaries for biodiversity enhancement. Site location is critical, with oyster survival varying between sites and being higher when transplanted into grooves compared with on ridges. The design of artificial structures significantly affects outcomes - creating pit habitats (1-50 mm) and grooves can enhance both oyster survival and broader biodiversity. Three studies found that oysters transplanted onto intertidal artificial structures supported macroalgae, mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate, and fish species that were absent from structures without transplanted oysters. However, the effectiveness depends on specific design features: survival in grooves versus on ledges varied by site, and the presence and size of grooves and small ridges on structure surfaces influenced species richness and abundance outcomes. Using environmentally-sensitive materials can also impact success, with some studies showing that alternative concrete compositions can alter community composition and species richness. The biodiversity benefits include increased mobile invertebrate species richness, though effects on fish abundance and species richness were generally not significant across multiple studies. Mixed effects on overall community composition and abundance were common, depending on the specific combination of structural modifications, materials used, and site characteristics.",

Creating pit habitats (1-50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures increases combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness in multiple studies (action ID 3475). Creating groove habitats (1-50 mm) shows mixed results, with some studies finding increased species richness while others show no effect (action ID 3473). Creating rock pools on intertidal artificial structures consistently supports higher species diversity, with nine of twelve studies showing increased combined macroalgae, invertebrate and fish species diversity (action ID 3476). Transplanting or seeding organisms onto intertidal artificial structures can increase richness, particularly mobile invertebrate species richness (action ID 3472). Using environmentally-sensitive materials shows variable results, with some materials like ECOncreteTM increasing species richness and diversity while others show no effect (action ID 3469). Creating small ridges or ledges generally supports lower species richness than grooves created between them (action ID 3464), while reducing structure slope combined with creating rock pools has shown positive effects on species richness (action ID 3461). Creating short flexible habitats appears to decrease overall species richness (action ID 3459). Managing harvesting restrictions shows limited evidence for directly increasing species richness (action ID 3458), while controlling non-native species lacks evidence (action ID 3439).",

Studies from Israel (actions 3448, 3455, 3434) found that groove and pit habitats (1-50 mm) created on subtidal structures altered macroalgae and invertebrate community composition, increased species diversity, and supported species that were absent from structures without these habitat features. Hole habitats (>50 mm) on subtidal structures (action 3434) in studies from Israel and Sweden also altered community composition and increased species richness, supporting both mobile and non-mobile invertebrate and fish species that were absent from control structures. However, for crevice habitats specifically (>50 mm), no studies were found evaluating their effects on subtidal artificial structures (action 3454). The evidence shows consistently positive effects on biodiversity enhancement through the creation of various depression types on subtidal artificial structures, with effects varying by species group and habitat type.",

For small ridges/ledges (1-50 mm) on intertidal structures, one replicated study in Australia found they supported lower mobile invertebrate abundance than grooves created between them (action 3464). However, when grooves were combined with small protrusions/ridges/ledges, five of seven replicated studies found mixed effects on mobile invertebrate abundance depending on factors like depth/height of grooves and ridges, presence of large ledges, shore level, and site location (action 3474). Two studies found this combination increased mobile invertebrate abundance (action 3474). For large ridges/ledges (>50 mm) on intertidal structures, two replicated studies found they increased mussel and limpet abundance but not barnacles when combined with grooves and small protrusions (action 3465). Large protrusions (>50 mm) on intertidal structures increased limpet abundance but not barnacles when combined with large ridges (action 3463).
