Six of seven studies found that shelterwood harvesting increased abundance, species richness and diversity of understory plants (1223). For group-selection harvesting, four of eight studies found increases in cover and diversity of understory plants, while two studies found no effect on understory species richness and diversity (1224). Additionally, thinning trees within forests has proven effective, with 13 of 19 studies showing increased species richness and diversity of understory plants following thinning (1211). Selective harvesting instead of clearcutting was also examined, though the evidence showed mixed results for understory plant diversity (2637, 1273). The evidence suggests partial harvesting methods that maintain some canopy cover tend to support greater understory plant diversity compared to clearcutting approaches.",

The main benefits include: increased species richness of butterflies in coniferous forests restored by burning combined with thinning, increased abundance of butterflies and higher bird species richness in burned areas, and improved forest restoration when used in combination with tree thinning. Prescribed fire after replanting can also increase survival and sprouting rate of planted trees. \n\nHowever, significant negative impacts were identified. Eight of 14 studies found no positive effect of prescribed forest fires on amphibian abundance or species numbers, with some finding mixed or decreased abundance depending on species and season. Four of eight studies found that prescribed fire decreased tree cover, density and diversity. Seven studies found that prescribed fire increased tree mortality. Four of eight studies found no effect or mixed effects of prescribed fire on cover and density of trees. For young trees, five of 15 studies found increased density and biomass, while two studies found decreased new tree density, and eight found no effect or mixed effects depending on tree species and fire frequency. Ten studies found total bird densities or densities of some species were the same or lower in burned areas compared to control sites.

Five studies found no differences in species richness or community composition between sites with prescribed burning; prescribed burning, tree thinning and mid- or understorey control; or prescribed burning and tree thinning only, compared to control sites, or those with other management.\\nEight studies found that some species or guilds (such as open habitat species) were more abundant or more likely to be found in burned areas of pine forest than control areas. One study found that the responses of Henslow\\u2019s sparrows to burning varied considerably with geography and habitat. \\nThree studies found that some species were more abundant in thinned and burned stands, compared to controls or other management. Three studies found that overall bird densities or abundances of red-cockaded woodpeckers were higher in open pine forests with prescribed burning, tree thinning and mid- or understorey control, compared with control areas or those thinned but not burned. One found differences were more marked in spring. A study found that a red-cockaded woodpecker population increased following the start of intensive management consisting of prescribed burning and other interventions. \\nTen studies found that total bird densities or those of some species was the same or lower in sites with prescribed burning compared to control sites, or those with other management. Five studies investigated several interventions at once. Generally, closed-forest species and ground nesters appeared to be adversely affected by burning.\\nThree studies found higher productivities or survival of species in burned or burned and thinned areas, compared to control areas or those burned less recently. Seven studies found no differences in productivity, behaviour or survival (including of artificial nests) in burned areas or burned and thinned areas, compared to controls. One study found that northern bobwhite chicks had lower foraging success in burned areas, compared to other management regimes, whilst another found that different predators were dominant under different management.\\nThe three studies that investigated it found that burning season did not appear to affect the effects of burning.\"\n}"
