    "relevant_summary": "The available research provides limited specific data on 20-year periods, but several studies have examined compost effects on soil properties. Action 890 reports that municipal compost application to semi-arid soils greatly reduced soil loss and water runoff. Action 891 found that high rates of organic waste compost improved soil structure and reduced soil loss. Action 911 indicates that manure and compost applications consistently increased soil organic carbon levels across multiple studies, with four studies showing higher carbon levels when manures were applied. This action also reports that compost application improved soil physical properties including higher organic matter content and larger soil aggregations. Action 1377 found that compost addition increased soil water retention in some studies and reduced water runoff. However, the documents do not contain specific studies tracking municipal waste compost effects continuously over 20-year periods, and most evidence covers shorter-term impacts on soil physical properties, organic matter, and erosion control rather than long-term fertility trends.",
