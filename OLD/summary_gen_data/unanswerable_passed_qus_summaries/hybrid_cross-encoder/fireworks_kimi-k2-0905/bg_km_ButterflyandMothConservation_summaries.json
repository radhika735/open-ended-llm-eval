Planting nectar flower mixtures/wildflower strips is also highly effective, with 23 studies demonstrating increased butterfly species richness and abundance compared to conventional field margins or cropped fields (Action ID: 3932). Planting grass buffer strips/margins around fields shows mixed results but can be beneficial, with 26 studies indicating they can enhance butterfly species richness and abundance, especially when floristically enhanced or made wider (up to 6m) rather than standard grass-only margins (Action ID: 3982). Payment schemes covering conservation costs are widely used and can be effective for implementing these measures (Action ID: 3915).",

The sixth study found that, after prescribed burning, an area where bracken fern was also removed had fewer Brenton blue butterfly eggs than an area without removal. One study in Australia\\u00a0reported that a population of purple copper butterfly caterpillars translocated to an area where invasive plants had been removed, along with host plant translocation and other habitat management, increased in number compared to at the time of translocation.\\n\\n\\nSurvival (2 studies): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the USA\\u00a0found that in plots where herbicide was applied to control invasive grasses, the survival of Columbia silvery blue eggs and caterpillars was similar to unsprayed plots. One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the USA\\u00a0found that one herbicide commonly used to control invasive grasses reduced the survival of snowberry checkerspot caterpillars, but two other herbicides did not affect the survival of snowberry checkerspot, Edith\\u2019s checkerspot or Baltimore checkerspot caterpillars.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (4 STUDIES)\\n\\nUse (3 studies): Two of three randomized, controlled studies (including two replicated, paired studies and one before-and-after study) in the USA\\u00a0found that sites where invasive oat-grass was cut to a similar height to native plants, or where Eastern white pine was removed, were used more by Fender\\u2019s blue\\u00a0and frosted elfin\\u00a0butterflies than untreated sites. The third study found that habitat use by Columbia silvery blue butterflies was similar in plots where herbicide was applied to control invasive grasses and in unsprayed plots.\\nBehaviour change (1 study): One before-and-after study in Poland\\u00a0found that removal of trees and shrubs, in addition to the release of captive bred adults and pupae, allowed adults from two previously separated populations of Apollo butterflies to mix.\"\n}"

Action ID 3842 shows that planting parks, gardens and road verges with appropriate native species, including milkweeds, directly increases monarch egg abundance compared to shorter milkweed species. The evidence demonstrates that monarchs readily use planted milkweed in gardens more than in meadows, and that planting native milkweed species is critical for monarch caterpillar growth. Action ID 3933 supports this by showing that replanting native vegetation including host plants is used by wild monarch butterflies and other species. While captive rearing (Action ID 3916) has been successfully used for monarchs for over 25 years, habitat restoration through native plant establishment remains the primary conservation approach with direct field evidence showing increased monarch abundance.",

The sixth study\\u00a0found that mountain Alcon blue caterpillars had a similar survival rate in ant nests with or without queens present. Two of these studies, and one replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the USA, found that the survival of large blue, mountain Alcon blue\\u00a0and monarch\\u00a0caterpillars differed when reared in ant nests of different species\\u00a0or on different species of milkweed. Two site comparison studies in the UK\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0found that large copper\\u00a0and Puget blue\\u00a0eggs had a similar survival rate to the caterpillar\\u00a0and adult\\u00a0stage whether they were laid in captivity or collected from the wild and reared in captivity. One of these studies also found that Puget blue caterpillars kept in refrigerators while overwintering had a lower survival than caterpillars kept in environmental chambers or outside. Three of four studies in South Africa\\u00a0and the UK\\u00a0reported that some wild-collected Brenton blue butterfly, Karkloof blue butterfly\\u00a0and Fishers\\u2019 estuarine\\u00a0moth eggs hatched, survived as caterpillars for three months\\u00a0or to adulthood, bred in captivity\\u00a0and the resulting captive population survived for at least eight generations. The other study reported that wild-collected Brenton blue butterfly eggs hatched in captivity and those caterpillars reared with only Pyllanthus incurvatus leaves died whereas all caterpillars also given Indigofera erecta leaves survived to the fourth instar of development. One study in South Africa\\u00a0reported that wild-caught final instar Cape Peninsula butterfly caterpillars reared in an artificial pugnacious ant nest successfully pupated and became adults, but captive-hatched first instar Cape Peninsula and Riley\\u2019s skolly butterfly caterpillars placed next to a nest did not survive to pupation.\\nCondition (5 studies): Two studies (including one controlled study) in the UK\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0found that adult large white from a population kept in captivity for &gt;25 years were heavier, and had smaller wings, than individuals from a population in its third generation in captivity, and captive-reared Puget blue adults were smaller than wild-caught butterflies. One of these studies also found that Puget blue caterpillars raised in environmental chambers or outdoor enclosures reached a similar size as adults. One replicated, controlled study in Spain\\u00a0found that mountain Alcon blue caterpillars reared in ant colonies with winged females were lighter than caterpillars reared in colonies without winged females. One replicated, controlled study in Israel\\u00a0found that spring webworm caterpillars fed vegetation from cattle-grazed pasture had a similar growth rate to caterpillars fed vegetation from an ungrazed paddock. One study in South Africa\\u00a0reported that Brenton blue butterfly caterpillars reared on Indigofera erecta leaves with no ants became dwarf adults, but those reared on whole Indigofera plants with an ant colony became full-sized adults.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\"\n}"
