Fifteen studies on pond restoration reported mixed outcomes by site and species, with several before-and-after studies finding increases in species richness, population maintenance or increases, and higher pond occupancy and breeding, while others found no increases or mixed effects; colonization of restored/created ponds ranged from 1\u20137 species with 6\u201365% of ponds colonized and 35% used for breeding in specific cases [878]. Creating wetlands yielded amphibian communities and species numbers similar to natural wetlands in several site comparisons, though some studies found fewer species or different communities; colonization of created wetlands ranged from 4\u201315 species and was affected by design, vegetation, water levels, surrounding habitat, fish presence, and distance to source wetlands [880]. Restoring connectivity by elevating a road on a viaduct between two wetlands significantly decreased deaths of migrating amphibians [840]. Replanting vegetation as part of habitat restoration led to amphibian abundance or communities similar to natural sites in some cases and increases in frog species in one before-and-after study; amphibians colonized replanted forests and reseeded grasslands, with some variation depending on prior land use and management [849].",

Thirty-four studies (of which 21 were replicated and controlled and seven also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found some positive effects on earthworms, some invertebrates (other than earthworms), weeds or farmland birds, of reducing tillage compared to conventional management. Positive effects included increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms, greater abundance of some invertebrates other than earthworms, increased numbers of some weeds and/or weed species, higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying date and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields, and greater abundance of some birds - including Eurasian skylark, seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in late winter on non-inversion or conservation tillage. A review found tillage had negative effects on invertebrate numbers and no-till systems had more invertebrate bird food resources.\\nTwenty-six studies (of which 13 replicated and controlled and three also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found reducing tillage had either negative, no effect or no consistent effects on abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates (other than earthworms), earthworm abundance, biomass, or species richness, number of different plant species found as seeds, number of some weed species, mammal abundance, some bird species, and one study found bird preferences for conservation tillage fields decreased over time. Two studies found that crop type affected the number of weeds under different tillage regimes.\\nOne small replicated trial in the UK compared bird numbers under two different forms of reduced tillage, and found more birds from species that make up the \\u2018Farmland Bird Index\\u2019 on broadcast than non-inversion tillage fields.\\nTwo studies looked at the long-term effects of reduced tillage on earthworms (after ten years). One study found higher earthworm biomass under reduced tillage, the other study found earthworm abundance was the same between conventional and reduced tillage plots.\\nThree of the studies mentioned above did not distinguish between the effects of reducing tillage and reduced pesticide and/or fertilizer inputs.\"\n}"

Pond restoration showed mixed results by species and site, with several studies reporting increased species numbers, population maintenance or increases, colonization, and more ponds used for breeding, while other studies found no increase or inconclusive outcomes for certain species [878]. Restoring or retaining connectivity reduced road mortality when a road was elevated to reconnect wetlands and maintained multiple frog species over decades when native vegetation corridors were retained [840, 853]. Managing water levels increased or maintained certain toad and newt populations and enabled successful breeding in a threatened frog; draining ponds increased amphibian abundance and species numbers in one study [833]. Engaging landowners and volunteers was associated with population increases in some species, increased weights in aquatically managed habitats, and large-scale restoration efforts involving thousands of volunteers and up to 1,023 ponds restored or over 11,500 km2 of habitat managed [777]. Payments to farmers to cover conservation costs created breeding habitat or increased frog and toad populations in several countries and were associated with higher species numbers and abundance in agri-environment scheme ditches compared to conventional management [818]. Replanting or reseeding vegetation led to amphibian communities similar to natural sites in some contexts, increased frog species in one case, and colonization of restored habitats, though post-logging planted forests with herbicide had lower or similar abundance than naturally regenerating forests depending on species and age [849].

Replanting or reseeding vegetation led to amphibian communities similar to natural sites in some contexts, increased frog species in one case, and colonization of restored habitats, though post-logging planted forests with herbicide had lower or similar abundance than naturally regenerating forests depending on species and age [849]. Reduced mowing as part of restoration was linked to increased numbers of frog species in one study [783]. Grazing management yielded mixed outcomes, with some programs increasing or maintaining populations of certain toads and others finding no advantage or lower abundance depending on species and grazing regime [780].\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"879\",\n    \"878\",\n    \"840\",\n    \"853\",\n    \"833\",\n    \"777\",\n    \"818\",\n    \"849\",\n    \"783\",\n    \"780\"\n  ]\n}"
