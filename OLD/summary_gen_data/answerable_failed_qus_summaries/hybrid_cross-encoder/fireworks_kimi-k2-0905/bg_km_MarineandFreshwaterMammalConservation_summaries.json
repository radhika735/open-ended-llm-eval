One controlled study in the Arafura Sea found that fishing nets deployed 4.5 m below the water surface had fewer entanglements of dolphins than surface nets (Action 2793). Using acoustically reflective fishing gear materials can also reduce entanglements - two of three controlled studies found that fishing nets made from acoustically reflective materials (iron-oxide or barium sulfate) had fewer entanglements of harbour porpoises than conventional fishing nets, although one study found that nets made from barium sulfate did not reduce dolphin entanglements (Action 2807). The use of weakened fishing gear has not been evaluated in studies for marine mammal populations (Action 2797). Other gear modifications such as establishing move-on rules for fishing vessels when mammals are encountered can reduce marine mammal mortality - a before-and-after study in the Great Australian Bight found that introducing measures to delay or relocate fishing if dolphins were encountered resulted in fewer short-beaked common dolphins being encircled and killed (Action 2790).",

For habitat protection specifically, four studies found mixed but generally positive effects: Mediterranean monk seal populations increased after eight years of island protection, bottlenose dolphin populations maintained similar sizes before and after habitat protection, Hector's dolphins showed higher survival rates after coastal area protection, and human-caused strandings decreased while overall strandings remained similar after area protection. For hunting prohibitions, four of five studies found that abundance increased after hunting bans: harbour seals and humpback whales increased over 7-30 years, and 10 of 12 baleen whale populations showed significant increases during 7-21 years after protective legislation. However, no studies were found evaluating the direct effects of legally protecting marine mammal species themselves, and one study found no significant change in mature male sperm whale numbers 31 years after hunting prohibition.",

One found that the sizes of lobsters, velvet crabs, brown crabs and spider crabs varied with the levels of protection, and one study found that the size of spiny lobsters decreased similarly in an area prohibiting all fishing and in an area with fewer restrictions 14 to 20 years after designation of the protected area.

Two site comparison studies in the Caribbean Sea found that inside marine protected areas with a zonation system, abundances of adult queen conch increased over time in a zone closed to all fishing and were greater than in zones with fewer restrictions, but abundances of juvenile conch did not differ or vary differently between zones, after either five to eight years\\u00a0or 14 to 20 years.\\nMollusc condition (1 study): One site comparison study in the Caribbean Sea\\u00a0found that inside a marine protected area with a zonation system, the size of queen conch decreased similarly in the area prohibiting all fishing and in the area with fewer restrictions, after 14 to 20 years.\\nSponge abundance (1 study): One site comparison study in the Mediterranean Sea\\u00a0found that inside a marine protected area with a zonation system, the cover of sponges Cliona was higher at a site prohibiting all fishing for six years compared to sites where some fishing occurred.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\\n\\nCrustacean behaviour (1 study): One site comparison study in the Caribbean Sea\\u00a0found that, inside a marine protected area with a zonation system (year of designation unspecified), 80% of the lobster population occurring in the unfished area remained in the protected unfished area, and thus remained protected.\"\n}"

One controlled study found that at least 25% of California sea lions treated for toxic algae poisoning and released back into the wild died or had to be euthanized. Reproductive success was demonstrated by one study showing that more than 25% of rehabilitated and released Hawaiian monk seals reproduced. Eleven studies on rescue and release of stranded or trapped marine mammals found survival rates of 17-100% during post-release monitoring periods ranging from three weeks to three years. These studies included evidence that rescued and released common bottlenose dolphins were observed with calves one year later, and that Hawaiian monk seal rescue and release, along with other interventions, resulted in more than 25% of the seals surviving and reproducing. Behavioural evidence from three controlled studies showed that rehabilitated and released harbour porpoises and harbour seals had similar movements and behaviours to wild mammals in two of the studies, while one study found that California sea lions treated for toxic algae poisoning showed altered behavior compared to wild sea lions.",

Acoustic devices deployed on moorings can reduce harbour seal predation on migrating juvenile salmon (action ID 2816). Anti-predator nets around aquaculture systems can be replaced or repaired more frequently to reduce salmon losses to harbour seal predation (action ID 2774). Barriers such as 'cork line' barriers can be installed at wild fisheries, though one study found this did not deter harbour seals from feeding on salmon (action ID 2824). Switching off artificial lighting at wild fisheries is another option tested, but one study found it did not deter harbour seals from feeding on salmon (action ID 2825). Translocating mammals away from aquaculture systems has been attempted, but studies found that more than half or nearly all of translocated Australian and New Zealand fur seals returned (action ID 2776). Modifying aquaculture gear and anti-predator nets are potential actions, though no studies have evaluated their effectiveness yet (action IDs 2742, 2743).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence, several non-lethal methods have been tested for reducing seal predation at wild fisheries. The most effective approaches include:\n\nAcoustic devices have shown significant promise across multiple studies. Deploying acoustic devices on moorings (Action 2816) reduced the number of harbour seals feeding on migrating juvenile salmon in the Puntledge River in Canada. At aquaculture systems (Action 2775), acoustic devices reduced predation on caged salmon by grey seals, harbour seals, and South American sea lions. Using acoustic devices on fishing gear (Action 2808) reduced seal damage to fish catches and fishing nets in multiple controlled studies.\n\nPhysical gear modifications have also proven effective. Modifying fishing pots and traps to exclude mammals (Action 2822) with wire grids or steel bars, along with strengthened netting, reduced damage to salmon catches by grey and harbour seals. Installing steel rods or metal frames on fishing pots and traps also reduced the number of grey and harbour seals that entered or became trapped in pots.\n\nElectric deterrents showed positive results in one controlled study (Action 2818), where using an electric current on a fishing net reduced Pacific harbour seal predation on salmon catches.\n\nLess effective methods included switching off artificial lighting at wild fisheries (Action 2825) and installing cork line barriers (Action 2824), both of which failed to deter harbour seals from feeding on salmon released from a hatchery. Playing predator calls (Action 2817) was ineffective at deterring Cape fur seals. Visual deterrents and acoustically reflective objects showed mixed or no effects on marine mammals.",

When compared to non-translocated populations, translocated seal pups had similar survival rates to those born at release sites or showed greater survival rates than pups remaining at original sites [Action ID: 2930]. Reproductive success was also documented, with more than a quarter of translocated seals reproducing following interventions that included rehabilitation and survival enhancement measures [Action ID: 2930]. Additionally, translocated seal pups exhibited similar dispersal behaviors to non-translocated pups born at release sites [Action ID: 2930].

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence found, the most beneficial interventions for reducing marine mammal bycatch in Australian fisheries include: (1) Establishing handling and release protocols for captured mammals - a before-and-after study in the Great Australian Bight found this reduced mortality of short-beaked common dolphins when combined with avoiding dolphins during fishing (Action ID: 2829); (2) Deploying fishing gear at different depths - a controlled study in the Arafura Sea found nets deployed 4.5m below surface had fewer dolphin entanglements than surface nets (Action ID: 2793); (3) Establishing 'move-on rules' for fishing vessels when mammals are encountered - a before-and-after study in the Great Australian Bight found this resulted in fewer short-beaked common dolphins being encircled and killed when combined with releasing trapped dolphins (Action ID: 2790); (4) Using acoustic devices on fishing vessels - multiple studies including in Australian waters (Rainbow Channel and Keppel Bay) showed these can reduce dolphin foraging and echolocation activity, though effects vary by species and behavior type (Action ID: 2815); (5) Using catch and hook protection devices - studies show these can reduce unwanted catches of toothed whales and damage to fish catches (Action ID: 2821); and (6) Using acoustically reflective fishing gear materials - some studies found these materials reduced harbor porpoise entanglements, though results vary by material and species (Action ID: 2807). Several interventions like gear exchange programs, low-interest loans for gear conversion, and fisher involvement in gear design have been proposed but lack evaluation studies to confirm their effectiveness.",

    "relevant_summary": "The evidence for mitigating seal predation shows distinct approaches between aquaculture systems and wild fisheries. In aquaculture systems, there is documented evidence for several techniques: replacing anti-predator nets more frequently at salmon farms resulted in fewer salmon losses to harbour seal predation (action 2774), and using acoustic devices at salmon farms reduced predation on caged salmon by grey seals, harbour seals and South American sea lions, though effectiveness varied with two of six studies showing no reduction in predation (action 2775). Translocating mammals away from aquaculture systems showed limited effectiveness, with more than half or nearly all of translocated Australian and New Zealand fur seals returning to salmon farms (action 2776). For wild fisheries, the evidence focuses on gear modifications: installing steel rods on lobster pots or metal frames on fishing pots reduced seal entrapments (action 2822), and installing wire grids or steel bars on fishing trap-nets or bag-nets, along with strengthened netting, reduced damage to salmon catches by seals and resulted in higher catches of undamaged salmon (action 2822). Other approaches like switching off artificial lighting at wild fisheries did not deter harbour seals from feeding on salmon (action 2825), and playing predator calls did not deter Cape fur seals from feeding on fish catches (action 2817). No studies were found on enforcing regulations to prevent harmful deterrents at wild fisheries (action 2779).",

In aquaculture systems, there is documented evidence for several techniques: replacing anti-predator nets more frequently at salmon farms resulted in fewer salmon losses to harbour seal predation (action 2774), and using acoustic devices at salmon farms reduced predation on caged salmon by grey seals, harbour seals and South American sea lions, though effectiveness varied with two of six studies showing no reduction in predation (action 2775). Translocating mammals away from aquaculture systems showed limited effectiveness, with more than half or nearly all of translocated Australian and New Zealand fur seals returning to salmon farms (action 2776). For wild fisheries, the evidence focuses on gear modifications: installing steel rods on lobster pots or metal frames on fishing pots reduced seal entrapments (action 2822), and installing wire grids or steel bars on fishing trap-nets or bag-nets, along with strengthened netting, reduced damage to salmon catches by seals and resulted in higher catches of undamaged salmon (action 2822). Other approaches like switching off artificial lighting at wild fisheries did not deter harbour seals from feeding on salmon (action 2825), and playing predator calls did not deter Cape fur seals from feeding on fish catches (action 2817). No studies were found on enforcing regulations to prevent harmful deterrents at wild fisheries (action 2779).\", \"action_ids\": [\"2774\", \"2775\", \"2776\", \"2779\", \"2822\", \"2825\", \"2817\"]}",
