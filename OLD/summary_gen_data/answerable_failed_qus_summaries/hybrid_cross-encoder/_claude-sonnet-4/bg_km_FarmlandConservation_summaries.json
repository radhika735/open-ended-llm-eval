Sowing uncropped arable field margins with agricultural nectar and pollen mixes significantly attracts more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated, grassy or cropped field margins (action 18). Leaving cultivated, uncropped margins or plots provides benefits to farmland bird species, plants, invertebrates and mammals, including increased species richness of plants and bumblebees, abundance of ground-dwelling invertebrates and ground beetles, and improved northern lapwing hatching success and Eurasian skylark nesting success (action 562). Planting grass buffer strips around arable fields shows wider margins up to 6 meters have greater species richness of butterflies, macro-moths and micro-moths than narrower margins, with floristically enhanced grass buffers supporting higher species richness and abundance of butterflies than standard grass margins (action 3982). Leaving headlands in fields unsprayed (conservation headlands) results in greater species richness and abundance of butterflies and caterpillars compared to headlands sprayed with herbicide and insecticide (action 3898). Taking field corners out of management was positively correlated with grey partridge overwinter survival (action 128). Reducing field size or maintaining small fields leads to higher species richness and abundance of butterflies and burnet moths in landscapes with smaller fields compared to areas with larger fields (action 3974).",

For supplementary food provision, nine studies from France, Sweden and the UK found that providing supplementary food increased farmland bird abundance, breeding population size, density, body mass, hatching, nestling growth and fledging rates, and increased overwinter survival of a declining house sparrow population (Action 648). However, five replicated studies from the UK found no clear effect on farmland bird breeding abundance, overwinter survival of three stable house sparrow populations, or tree sparrow nest box use (Action 648). Four studies from the UK found that use of supplementary food by farmland birds varied between species and region, depended upon the time of year and proximity to other feeding stations and natural feeding areas (Action 648). For cover interventions, fourteen studies from the UK found that fields sown with wild bird cover mix had higher abundance, density, species diversity and species richness of birds than other farmland habitats (Action 594). Thirteen studies from Finland, Switzerland and the UK found that leaving overwinter stubbles provides benefits including higher densities of farmland birds in winter, increased grey partridge productivity, and increased cirl bunting population size (Action 695). Two reviews and two replicated controlled trials from the UK found that leaving uncut strips of rye grass on silage fields resulted in benefits to birds including increased numbers, with seed-eating birds preferring rye grass cut once only (Action 132).

    "relevant_summary": "Several specific actions can be taken on farmland to support invertebrate populations like bees and beetles:\n\n**Beetle Banks**: Create beetle banks, which are raised strips of uncropped land planted with grasses. Studies found that beetle banks provide positive effects on invertebrate densities/numbers and higher ground beetle density and species diversity in spring and summer (Action 651).\n\n**Field Margins with Grasses**: Provide grass strips at field margins, with one trial showing that 6-meter wide grassy field margins enhanced the abundance but not diversity of wild bees at field boundaries, and another trial showing enhanced abundance and diversity of bumblebees within the margin (Action 14).\n\n**Wildflower Margins**: Sow uncropped arable field margins with native wild flower seed mix. Five replicated trials showed that uncropped field margins sown with wild flowers support higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees than cropped field edges, grassy margins, or naturally regenerated uncropped margins. Perennial leguminous herbs in seed mixtures are particularly important forage sources for bumblebees (Action 19).\n\n**Nectar Flower Strips**: Plant nectar flower mixture/wildflower strips. Studies found that sown wildflower strips had higher species richness and diversity of butterflies and moths than conventional field margins, unsown margins, cropped fields or conventional grassland. Multiple studies also found higher abundance of butterflies in sown wildflower strips compared to conventional margins (Action 3932).\n\n**Hedgerow Planting**: Plant hedgerows, which studies found support more bee species in fields with hedgerows or in hedgerows themselves compared to fields or field edges without hedgerows. Native bees showed higher crop visitation rates in fields next to planted hedgerows (Action 1407).\n\n**Set-aside Areas**: Provide or retain set-aside areas in farmland. Of 34 studies comparing set-aside areas with control farmed fields, 20 studies showed benefits to or higher use by all wildlife groups considered, and 12 found some species or groups used set-aside more than crops (Action 156).\n\n**Buffer Strips**: Plant grass buffer strips/margins around arable or pasture fields. Studies found that wider grass margins had greater species richness or diversity of butterflies, macro-moths and micro-moths than narrower margins, and that floristically enhanced grass buffers or wildflower strips had higher abundance of butterflies than standard grass margins (Action 3982).",

Studies found that beetle banks provide positive effects on invertebrate densities/numbers and higher ground beetle density and species diversity in spring and summer (Action 651).\\n\\n**Field Margins with Grasses**: Provide grass strips at field margins, with one trial showing that 6-meter wide grassy field margins enhanced the abundance but not diversity of wild bees at field boundaries, and another trial showing enhanced abundance and diversity of bumblebees within the margin (Action 14).\\n\\n**Wildflower Margins**: Sow uncropped arable field margins with native wild flower seed mix. Five replicated trials showed that uncropped field margins sown with wild flowers support higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees than cropped field edges, grassy margins, or naturally regenerated uncropped margins. Perennial leguminous herbs in seed mixtures are particularly important forage sources for bumblebees (Action 19).\\n\\n**Nectar Flower Strips**: Plant nectar flower mixture/wildflower strips. Studies found that sown wildflower strips had higher species richness and diversity of butterflies and moths than conventional field margins, unsown margins, cropped fields or conventional grassland. Multiple studies also found higher abundance of butterflies in sown wildflower strips compared to conventional margins (Action 3932).\\n\\n**Hedgerow Planting**: Plant hedgerows, which studies found support more bee species in fields with hedgerows or in hedgerows themselves compared to fields or field edges without hedgerows. Native bees showed higher crop visitation rates in fields next to planted hedgerows (Action 1407).\\n\\n**Set-aside Areas**: Provide or retain set-aside areas in farmland. Of 34 studies comparing set-aside areas with control farmed fields, 20 studies showed benefits to or higher use by all wildlife groups considered, and 12 found some species or groups used set-aside more than crops (Action 156).\\n\\n**Buffer Strips**: Plant grass buffer strips/margins around arable or pasture fields. Studies found that wider grass margins had greater species richness or diversity of butterflies, macro-moths and micro-moths than narrower margins, and that floristically enhanced grass buffers or wildflower strips had higher abundance of butterflies than standard grass margins (Action 3982).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"651\",\n    \"14\",\n    \"19\",\n    \"3932\",\n    \"1407\",\n    \"156\",\n    \"3982\"\n  ]\n}"

Managing ditches to benefit wildlife results in increased invertebrant biomass or abundance, plant species richness, emergent plant cover, amphibian diversity and abundance, bird visit rates and higher numbers of some bird species in plots with ditches managed under agri-environment schemes (action 135). Creating ponds for amphibians shows that amphibians used some or all created ponds, with created ponds having similar or higher numbers of species or breeding species compared to natural ponds, and amphibians establishing stable populations in 50-100% of created ponds (action 869). Created wetlands show similar numbers of amphibian species, amphibian abundance or communities to natural wetlands, with four to 15 amphibian species using or colonizing created wetlands (action 880). Creating artificial water sources shows that bat activity is similar or higher over farm ponds, retention ponds, and drainage ditches compared to natural wetlands and surrounding areas (action 959). Providing buffer strips to reduce pesticide and nutrient run-off into waterways and ponds shows greater abundance of moths than conventionally managed margins (action 3894). However, there are documented drawbacks: raising water levels results in a net loss of plant species and does not affect lapwing foraging rate, and re-wetting soils on old arable fields is not an effective method of reducing nutrient levels and restoring species-rich grassland (action 121). Ditch management can have negative or no clear effects on some farmland bird species or plants (action 135). Additionally, unflooded pastures contained a high biomass of soil macroinvertebrates of importance to breeding wading birds, suggesting that flooding may reduce this important food source (action 121).",

Planting new or maintaining existing hedgerows on farmland has also demonstrated positive effects, with a UK study finding that establishing hedgerows alongside arable land increased small mammal abundance (action 2383).\n\nPlanting crops to provide supplementary food for mammals has shown effectiveness, with studies in the UK and Spain finding that crops grown to provide food for wildlife resulted in higher abundance of small mammals in winter, and increased European rabbit abundance (action 2394). \n\nReducing the intensity of grazing by domestic livestock shows promise, with six of nine studies in the USA, Denmark, the UK, China, Netherlands and Norway finding that reductions in livestock grazing intensity were associated with increases in abundances of small mammals (action 2408).\n\nReducing pesticide or fertilizer use through organic farming showed mixed results, with one UK study finding increased wood mouse abundance while an Italian study found no increase in European hare abundance (action 2539).

Positive effects included increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms, greater abundance of some invertebrates other than earthworms, increased numbers of some weeds and/or weed species, higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying date and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields, and greater abundance of some birds - including Eurasian skylark, seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in late winter on non-inversion or conservation tillage.

    "relevant_summary": "Several specific actions are available to protect ground-nesting birds like lapwings and skylarks on farmland. Creating skylark plots increases skylark population size, breeding density, duration or success and lowers the likelihood of skylarks abandoning their territory, with plots being used by skylarks more than expected based on availability (actions 540, 214). Leaving cultivated, uncropped margins or plots, including specific 'lapwing plots', benefits northern lapwing hatching success, Eurasian skylark nesting success, and provides breeding sites for northern lapwing, Eurasian skylark, grey partridge and yellow wagtail (action 562). Direct per-clutch payments for farmland birds result in higher hatching success of northern lapwing and black-tailed godwit on participating farms (actions 146, 196). Sowing crops in spring rather than autumn benefits farmland birds, with northern lapwings nesting on spring-sown crops more than expected based on availability, and skylarks using winter and spring sown crops for different broods (actions 137, 207). Reduced tillage increases Eurasian skylark nest density, enables earlier laying dates, and provides shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields (action 126). Leaving overwinter stubbles increases grey partridge productivity and benefits Eurasian skylark and Eurasian linnet among farmland bird species (action 695). Planting wild bird seed or cover mixture increases abundance, density, species diversity and species richness of birds on farmland, with grey partridge populations increasing substantially on farms implementing these measures (action 594). Maintaining species-rich, semi-natural grassland supports birds of conservation concern, with five species increasing after implementation of appropriate management (action 218).",

    "relevant_summary": "Evidence for the effectiveness of linear features like hedges and beetle banks for farmland wildlife is mixed but generally positive. For beetle banks, 14 reports from eight studies found that beetle banks provide some benefits to farmland biodiversity (651). Five reports from two replicated studies found positive effects on invertebrate densities/numbers, distribution, or higher ground beetle density and species diversity in spring and summer but not winter (651). Two reviews and one replicated controlled trial found positive effects on bird numbers in combination with other farmland conservation measures or evidence that birds used beetle banks (651). One controlled study and a review found beetle banks acted as nest sites for harvest mice (651), with one replicated study specifically finding higher densities of harvest mouse nests on beetle banks than field margins (2393). However, five replicated studies found lower or no difference in invertebrate densities or numbers on beetle banks relative to other habitats (651), and one replicated study found no farmland bird species were associated with beetle banks (651).\n\nFor hedges, newly planted hedges showed higher abundance, species richness or diversity of beetles or spiders than crop fields or field margins in studies from France and the UK (538). A replicated study also found vascular plant species diversity and grass species richness were higher in newly planted hedges than recently established grass field margins (538). Five of six studies found that the abundance of butterflies, moths, macro-moths and gatekeepers was higher along hedgerows than on beetle banks, grass margins without hedgerows, in field interiors, or 5-10 metres away from hedgerows (3976). Three of four site comparison studies found that established hedgerows had a higher species richness of butterflies and macro-moths than in-field beetle banks, crops or pasture (3976). For mammals, establishing hedgerows alongside arable land increased small mammal abundance (2383), and retaining and enhancing hedgerows along with other field boundary features was associated with higher brown hare density in arable sites but not in grassland sites (2383). For reptiles, reptile communities in cultivated areas with hedges were more similar to those found in forests than were communities from cultivated areas without hedges (3519). However, no evidence was found for the effects of managing stone-faced hedge banks (73, 179).",

    "relevant_summary": "The documented effects of reducing or excluding livestock grazing on semi-natural farmland habitats show mixed results with both benefits and negative impacts.\n\n**Benefits of reducing/excluding grazing:**\nFrom action 150, three studies found that excluding livestock benefited plants and invertebrates. From action 704, fifteen studies found benefits to birds, plants or invertebrates from reducing grazing intensity on permanent grassland, including increased plant abundance and diversity, increased invertebrate diversity, and benefits to breeding Eurasian skylark. Six studies specifically found that excluding or delaying summer grazing increased plant species diversity, invertebrate abundance and benefited breeding Eurasian skylark. From action 3960, three controlled studies found that grasslands where cattle or sheep were removed seasonally had higher abundance of butterflies, other pollinators, and caterpillars than grasslands grazed throughout the season. From action 3959, eight replicated studies found that grasslands grazed with lower stocking densities had greater abundance of butterflies, moths, and caterpillars than grasslands grazed at higher stocking densities. From action 3956, six studies found that grasslands abandoned from grazing for various periods had higher abundance of certain butterflies, moths, and nocturnal moths than grazed grasslands.\n\n**Negative impacts or lack of benefits:**\nFrom action 150, three studies found that excluding grazing did not benefit plants or birds, and two studies found that the impact of excluding grazing as a tool in habitat restoration was neutral or mixed. From action 704, three studies found no benefit to plants or invertebrates from reduced grazing intensity. From action 3956, four studies found that grasslands abandoned from grazing had lower abundance of butterflies and spring webworm caterpillars than grazed grasslands, and two studies found that the large blue and silver-studded blue went extinct in some abandoned meadows. From action 3512, one study found that ungrazed wetland sites had fewer bog turtles than grazed sites, and juvenile box turtles were present less frequently in ungrazed sites compared to grazed sites. From action 697, excluding cattle from fenland reduced the number of plant species.\n\n**Mixed or context-dependent effects:**\nFrom action 704, nine studies reported mixed results, with a systematic review concluding that intermediate levels of grazing are usually optimal for plants, invertebrates and birds but that trade-offs exist between different taxa. From action 3956, studies found that effects varied by species, with some woodland and hedgerow butterflies benefiting from abandonment while grassland or farmland species declined.",

    "relevant_summary": "Different mowing management strategies have varying effects on farmland wildlife across multiple species groups. Regarding mowing height, raised mowing heights benefit some species including Eurasian skylark with increased productivity and are less damaging to amphibians and invertebrates (Action 138). However, northern lapwing and common starling chicks had greater foraging success in shorter grass (Action 138). For mowing techniques, specific techniques can reduce mortality or injury in birds, mammals, amphibians, and invertebrates (Action 698). Changing mowing patterns reduces chick mortality - 68% of corncrake chicks escaped when fields were mown from center outwards compared to 45% during conventional edge-inward mowing (Action 698). Different machinery types have varying impacts: bar mowers and double chop mowers cause less damage to amphibians and invertebrates than other types, while rotary disc mowers with conditioners kill twice as many small mammals compared to double blade mowers. Skylark chick survival was four times higher when wider mowing machinery was used (Action 698). Regarding timing, delayed mowing benefits various species groups. The UK corncrake population increased following initiatives to delay mowing (Action 223, 131, 192). Delaying mowing dates resulted in higher plant species richness, more insect species and individuals visiting flowers, greater abundance of some spiders and ground beetles, increased breeding wading bird densities, and increased Eurasian skylark productivity (Action 131). However, some studies found no clear effects on plant species richness, ground beetle communities, or abundance of some insects and spiders (Action 131). Rotational mowing strategies also show benefits: grasslands managed by mowing strips in alternate years or leaving rotational areas uncut had greater species richness and diversity of butterflies than grasslands cut in full once per year (Action 3966). Reducing cutting frequency can be beneficial, with meadows cut once per year having higher species richness of butterflies and moths than meadows cut multiple times per year (Action 3961). Seasonal timing effects vary, with cutting in different seasons having different impacts on individual plant species abundance in freshwater marshes (Action 3070).",

    "relevant_summary": "Several actions are available to manage invasive non-native plants and overabundant native species like bracken on UK farmland. For invasive non-native plants, mechanical control includes removing all flower heads at peak flowering time, which dramatically reduces seed production in giant hogweed (action 104). Physical removal methods include cutting invasive plants to similar heights as native plants, weeding, cutting and applying herbicide, with some studies showing these methods increase butterfly species richness and abundance (action 3890). Hand weeding and selective vegetation management are also effective approaches (action 3714).\n\nFor bracken control specifically, multiple methods are available. Herbicide application using asulam reduces bracken abundance if applied repeatedly, with studies showing it increases heather seedlings and biomass, plant species number, and cover of wavy hair-grass and sheep's fescue while reducing bracken biomass and cover (action 1652). Cutting bracken increases heather cover or biomass and species richness of heathland plants, while also increasing cover of wavy hair-grass and sheep's fescue and reducing bracken cover or biomass (action 1653). A combined approach of cutting and applying herbicide reduces bracken biomass or cover and increases plant species richness when cutting is followed by herbicide application compared to herbicide followed by cutting (action 1654). However, cutting may be equally effective to repeated herbicide application according to systematic review findings (action 105).\n\nAdditional control methods include using grass-specific herbicides that reduce grass diversity while increasing broadleaved plants, cutting and infection with fungal pathogens for controlling creeping thistle, and lenient grazing for long-term control (action 123). The herbicide asulam is noted to reduce bracken abundance but may affect associated moss species when exposed over three weeks (action 105).",

Nineteen studies found that grass buffer strips increased arthropod abundance, species richness and diversity (action 246). Nine studies found benefits for birds including increased numbers, densities, species richness and foraging time (action 246). Seven studies found increased plant cover and species richness (action 246). Five studies found benefits for small mammals including increased activity and numbers (action 246). However, some studies found no clear effects on insect numbers, bird numbers or invertebrate pest populations (action 246).\n\n**Riparian Buffer Strips**: Provide buffer strips alongside water courses (action 120), with three studies reporting positive influence on plant, invertebrate and bird diversity or abundance. However, two studies found no increase in plant species numbers compared to farms without buffer strips.\n\n**Beetle Banks**: Create raised beetle banks in arable fields (actions 651, 3927, 2393), with fourteen reports from eight studies finding some benefits to farmland biodiversity (action 651). Effects include positive impacts on invertebrate densities and ground beetle diversity, evidence of bird usage, and provision of nest sites for harvest mice (action 651). One study found higher densities of harvest mouse nests on beetle banks than field margins (action 2393).\n\n**Conservation Headlands**: Leave headlands unsprayed (actions 3898, 29), with studies showing increased butterfly species richness and abundance in unsprayed headlands compared to sprayed ones (action 3898).

    "relevant_summary": "Several in-field management alternatives to overwinter stubbles are available for UK cereal fields to benefit seed-eating birds and other wildlife. Creating skylark plots within cereal fields shows positive effects, with studies finding increases in skylark population size, breeding density, duration or success, and benefits to plants and invertebrates (Action 540). Undersowing spring cereals with clover benefits some birds, plants, insects, spiders and earthworms, including increases in Eurasian skylark density and nesting dunnock, arthropod abundance and species richness, and bumblebee, butterfly, earthworm, ground beetle, spider or springtail abundances (Action 136). Planting wild bird seed or cover mixture shows strong evidence of effectiveness, with studies finding higher bird diversity, densities, abundances, nesting densities, and higher productivities for some species compared to other habitats (Action 187). Sowing crops in spring rather than autumn provides benefits, with studies finding more bird species on areas with spring sown cereals compared with winter cereals, and population increases after the start of spring sowing (Action 207). Conservation headlands (leaving headlands unsprayed) are frequently used by bird species and show higher grey partridge chick and adult survival, with larger broods on farms with conservation headlands (Action 461). Creating beetle banks provides habitat that holds more invertebrate predators than surrounding crops, which can benefit the wider food web (Action 729). However, evidence for some options is limited - no evidence was found for the effects of leaving unharvested cereal headlands on bird populations (Actions 206, 646), and planting cereals in wide-spaced rows showed mixed results with lower invertebrate abundances and fewer skylark nests but increased nestling body condition (Action 564).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, introducing flower-rich habitats into arable field margins produces several documented effects across different wildlife groups. For butterflies and moths, 23 studies showed that nectar flower mixtures and wildflower strips had higher species richness and diversity than conventional field margins, unsown margins, and cropped fields (Action 3932). Ten studies found higher abundance of butterflies including generalist, specialist, and meadow brown butterflies in sown wildflower strips compared to conventional margins and cropped fields (Action 3932). For bees, five replicated trials demonstrated that uncropped field margins sown with wild flowers support higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees than cropped field edges, grassy margins, or naturally regenerated margins (Action 19). Four trials showed that field margins sown with agricultural nectar and pollen mixes attract significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated, grassy, or cropped field margins (Action 18). Perennial leguminous herbs in seed mixtures are particularly important forage sources for bumblebees, especially long-tongued species (Action 19). For birds, four replicated controlled studies found that plots sown with wildflower or legume seed mix attracted more birds or bird species, with Eurasian skylarks preferentially foraging and nesting in sown weed patches (Action 442). All five studies investigating wildflower strips effects on small mammals found increases in abundance, density and species richness (Action 442). For nettle strips specifically, a study from Belgium found that planting nettle strips in arable field margins resulted in a higher number of aphid predator species, with three insect families including green lacewings found only on nettles (Action 118). Overall, 80 individual studies investigating flowering strips showed that 64 demonstrated some benefits to one or more wildlife groups, with 50 of 65 studies on invertebrates reporting positive effects (Action 442).",
