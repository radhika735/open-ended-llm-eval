    "relevant_summary": "A meta-analysis of 24 studies in North America found that partial harvesting, which includes shelterwood harvesting, thinning, and harvesting in small groups, resulted in smaller reductions in salamander populations than clearcutting (844, 851, 852).\n\nWhen compared to no harvesting, two out of three studies in the USA found that shelterwood harvesting decreased salamander abundance and changed species composition, while another study found no effect on salamander abundance (851). In comparison, harvesting trees in small groups was found to significantly decrease salamander abundance and change species composition in two US studies (844). The effects of thinning on amphibian abundance were mixed, with studies finding increased, decreased, or no change in abundance depending on the species and time since the thinning occurred (852).\n\nWhen compared to clearcutting, three studies in the USA found that shelterwood harvesting resulted in higher, similar, or initially higher and then similar salamander abundance (851). Three US studies found that harvesting trees in small groups did not lead to higher amphibian or salamander abundance compared to clearcutting (844). Thinning, however, was found to result in higher amphibian abundance (with the exception of ensatina salamanders) or a less negative overall response in two out of four US studies when compared to clearcutting (852).\n\nOne study found that the negative impacts of thinning on amphibian populations could be prevented by the presence of high volumes of pre-existing downed wood (852).",
