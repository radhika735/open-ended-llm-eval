    "query": "To mitigate the impacts of logging in forests, how does shelterwood harvesting compare to thinning trees or harvesting in small groups for amphibian conservation?",
    "relevant_summary": "Compared to clearcutting, shelterwood harvesting resulted in higher, similar, or initially higher then similar salamander abundance, and a meta-analysis reported that partial harvest approaches including shelterwood led to smaller reductions in salamander populations than clearcutting; however, relative to no harvesting, shelterwood decreased salamander abundance and changed species composition in two studies, while one study found no effect, and reproductive metrics were similar or lower depending on species and time since harvest (851). Thinning showed mixed outcomes relative to unharvested forest, including increases for some species except ensatina, no effect in one study, and a negative overall response in another; a meta-analysis found that partial harvest including thinning decreased salamander populations, though pre-existing high volumes of downed wood prevented declines after thinning; relative to clearcuts, thinning produced higher amphibian abundance or a less negative overall response in some studies, with other studies showing mixed, species- and stage-specific effects, and a meta-analysis found smaller reductions than with clearcutting; migrating amphibians used thinned forest as much as unharvested forest (more for one species) and emigrating salamanders used it more than clearcuts (852). Harvesting trees in small groups did not produce higher amphibian or salamander abundance than clearcutting in three USA studies; a meta-analysis found partial harvest approaches that included group selection, thinning, and shelterwood led to smaller reductions in salamander populations than clearcutting; relative to no harvesting, group harvesting decreased salamander abundance and altered species composition, and reproductive measures were similar or lower in harvested plots that included group-harvest treatments (844).",

Two before-and-after studies (including one controlled study) in Canada found mixed effects of installing roadside fencing and culverts on road use by turtles and snakes. One replicated study in Spain found that use of different crossing structures depended on species group. One replicated study in Australia found that reptiles used wildlife underpasses or culverts for only 1% of road crossings.
