    "question": "To control Crassula helmsii, how do chemical methods like herbicides compare in effectiveness to physical methods like using lightproof barriers or salt water?",
    "answer": "Applying herbicides like glyphosate and diquat has been found to reduce or eradicate Crassula helmsii [1279]. Similarly, physical methods have shown success; covering the plant with black sheeting or carpet strips can eradicate or severely reduce its cover, and using seawater has also been shown to eradicate it in several trials [1294, 1288]. However, one study noted that after initial eradication with black sheeting, Crassula helmsii progressively recolonized the site [1294].",

    "question": "What are the most beneficial actions for controlling American bullfrog populations in small ponds?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests several beneficial actions. Introducing native predators like the northern pike can lead to a strong decline in bullfrog tadpole numbers [1039]. Direct removal of juveniles using methods like double fyke nets in small, shallow ponds can be effective, especially as part of a combined treatment [1046]. Direct removal of adults through methods like shooting can also significantly reduce their numbers, although populations may rebound rapidly following intensive removal [1045]. Finally, certain chemicals like caffeine or chloroxylenol have been found to kill American bullfrogs in controlled studies [1048].",

    "answer": "The outcomes of using herbivores for biological control are mixed. For floating pennywort, a South American weevil caused feeding lesions but did not reduce the plant's biomass in field trials, making it unlikely to be beneficial [1123]. In contrast, for water primrose, a flea beetle was found to cause heavy feeding destruction and significantly reduce its abundance, suggesting this approach is likely to be beneficial [1135]. For parrot's feather, the introduction of grass carp reduced its abundance in some studies, but not in others, while a leaf-feeding beetle reduced its growth, indicating a trade-off between benefits and harms [1599].",

A laboratory study in Canada found that high salinity (30%) resulted in 100% mortality of round gobies within 48 hours [1072]. Additionally, a field study in the USA demonstrated that an electrical barrier successfully prevented the movement of round gobies [1074].

Trapping baited with food has been shown to be effective for capture, though its ability to manage populations is questionable [1029]. Encouraging predators like eels may reduce population size, though this action is rated as unlikely to be beneficial on its own [1030]. A combination of trapping and encouraging predators has been shown to be more effective than predation alone and can significantly reduce crayfish populations [1031]. Other likely beneficial actions include sterilizing males by exposing them to X-rays to reduce offspring numbers [1032], adding chemicals like the pyrethrum Pyblast to the water [1036], and creating physical barriers like specially designed concrete dams to contain their spread upstream [1037].",

Mechanical removal and regular cleaning of industrial pipes can permanently remove or reduce clam numbers, as can the addition of a sand filter [1119]. Altering water conditions is another option: exposing clams to high temperatures (36°C or higher), which may be feasible in industrial facilities, leads to high mortality [1116]. Other methods shown to be effective in wider settings include mechanical suction dredging, which can reduce clam densities by 96% [1120], and placing gas-impermeable barriers on the bed of a waterbody [1117].",

    "question": "What factors influence the success of physical removal for invasive plants like skunk cabbage and water primrose, which can regenerate from fragments?",
    "answer": "The success of physical removal often depends on the scale of the infestation and the thoroughness of the removal process. For skunk cabbage, annual removal of recently established plants over five years was successful, but a twice-yearly program on a large infestation was less effective [1101]. For water primrose, hand-pulling failed to reduce a large population but did eradicate a smaller one at the margins of a pond [1138]. Similarly, for floating pennywort, removal was ineffective in one study because the growth rate exceeded the rate of removal, while another study greatly reduced its cover with mechanical removal followed by monthly hand-picking, but did not achieve eradication [1126]. The key factor is the ability to remove all fragments, as incomplete removal can lead to regeneration and continued spread.",
