    "query": "What are the most beneficial actions for reducing human-wildlife conflict with bears?",
    "answer": "Based on the evidence from various wildlife management actions, diversionary feeding appears to be the most promising approach for reducing bear-human conflicts, as it provides a simple solution that keeps bears satisfied and away from human activities.\n\nWhile some techniques like electric fencing installations have been rated as \"beneficial,\" these primarily address agricultural situations rather than direct bear-human interactions. More targeted approaches like issuing enforcement notices for bear-proof garbage dumpsters have been shown ineffective, actually failing to reduce garbage accessibility to black bears. Translocation of problem bears presents significant drawbacks, with most bears either returning to original capture locations and continuing nuisance behavior, or experiencing reduced survival rates post-release. The diversionary feeding strategy has demonstrated clear benefits, with two USA studies finding it successfully reduced nuisance behavior by black bears, and another study confirming substantial uptake of the provided food by bears. Additionally, preventing bears from accessing food sources like bird feeders through devices has shown promise. While conditioned taste aversion has been rated as \"likely to be beneficial\" for creating food aversions in bears, the most consistently effective strategy appears to be keeping bears content through supplementary feeding programs.",

    "answer": "Based on my research, the evidence clearly shows that integrated aquaculture systems represent the most promising solution for addressing salmon farm waste pollution [932]. Research demonstrates that scallops experience greater growth when positioned alongside fish farms [932], while blue mussels have been proven to absorb waste directly from salmon farms [932], creating a natural filtration system. Additionally, establishing fallowing practices where salmon farms are left unused for periods allows sediment communities to recover naturally over cycles [1027]. For immediate waste reduction, improving the quality of fish food and pellets offers significant potential [2192], though comprehensive studies are still needed to validate this approach. The most radical solution involves simply ceasing aquaculture activity entirely, which evidence shows leads to dramatic improvements in water quality [2185], with pollution-sensitive species recovering their populations while pollution-tolerant species decline appropriately [2185]. While some suggest cleaning waste water before environmental release [1778] or minimizing food waste at facilities [2744], these approaches lack the compelling evidence supporting integrated biological systems and complete cessation strategies.",
