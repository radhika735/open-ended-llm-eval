    "answer": "Summary: \nActions to reduce pollution from salmon farms primarily involve wastewater cleaning, waste confinement in nets, and gas pollutant removal, though their effectiveness is still uncertain or unproven.\n\nDetailed answer:  \nImplementing barriers at the bottom of salmon net pens aims to confine fish waste and feed residues but remains unproven despite claims about preventing waste dispersion, with potential risks like oxygen deprivation in cages (Action 917). Cleaning wastewater before discharge\u2014through methods like filtration\u2014is promoted for pollutant reduction but has shown unknown effectiveness, especially in marine settings where its impact on salmon farm pollution is unclear (Action 1778). Integrated aquaculture systems (such as co-culturing species to recycle waste) lack effectiveness assessments and face implementation challenges without documented pollution reduction success for salmon farms (Action 932). Removing pollutants from waste gases, while sometimes applied indirectly to aquaculture operations, offers poorly quantified benefits for water-based waste issues and may misdirect resources away from core mitigation strategies (Action 1789). These approaches rely on inconclusive evidence, leaving pollution concerns inadequately addressed across the industry.",
