Eight studies on breeding bats in captivity found that the reproductive success and survival of captive-born pups varied. In six studies, 6-100% of wild-caught female bats successfully reared young in captivity, and in two other studies, some bats born in captivity also reproduced (2053). Survival rates for captive-born pups ranged from 20% to 100% from 10 days to adulthood, as observed in seven studies. In another study, two of five captive-born pups survived and were hand-reared (2053).",
