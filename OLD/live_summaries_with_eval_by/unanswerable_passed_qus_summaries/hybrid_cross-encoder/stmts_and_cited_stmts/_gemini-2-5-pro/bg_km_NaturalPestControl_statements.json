      "relevant_summary": "One study in Switzerland found that using mass-emergence devices in urban areas resulted in higher parasitism at one site but had no effect at another, with no overall impact on pest damage to horse chestnut trees (775). In a study from the USA and an unspecified Mediterranean country, adding compost to the soil was found to reduce crop disease in some comparisons, though another study showed no difference (1392). The same study noted fewer dead tomato plants in soil with added compost in some cases (1392). Planting flower strips was found in three US and Italian studies to increase pest reduction and the proportion of parasitized pests (1400). However, an Italian study reported more damage by caterpillars in tomatoes near flower strips (1400). Delaying herbicide use, as studied in Australia and Denmark, led to an increase in natural enemies but also more weeds (774). The effects on insect pests and crop damage were inconsistent, with one study finding lower yields while another found no effect (774). No information was found regarding the cost-effectiveness of any of these methods in arid or desert environments (775, 1392, 1400, 774). Additionally, no studies were found on the effects of managing natural water bodies to prevent desiccation on bat populations (2027) or on butterflies and moths (3858).",

Four studies from Kenya and the USA found that the effects of alley cropping on parasitism varied between study sites, sampling dates, pest life stages or the width of crop alleys (718). Two studies found no effect on parasitism and one study found mixed effects on fungal infections in pests (718). One study found lower egg predation, while another found more wasps and spiders but fewer ladybirds (718). Two of four studies found more pests in alley cropped plots, one study found fewer pests and one study found effects varied with pest group and between years (718). One study found more pest damage to crops but another study found no effect (718).",
