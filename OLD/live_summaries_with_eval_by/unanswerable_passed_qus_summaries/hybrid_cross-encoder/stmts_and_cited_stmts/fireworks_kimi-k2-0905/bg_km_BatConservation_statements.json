The systematic searches have not found any studies assessing the success rate of such reintroductions. While there is evidence about breeding bats in captivity showing that reproductive success varies (6-100% of female bats successfully conceive and give birth in captivity), and survival rates of captive-born pups range from 20-100%, these studies do not address the specific challenge of reintroducing them into white-nose syndrome affected areas. The rehabilitation studies show that hand-reared orphaned bats have survival rates of 70-90% for at least 4-14 days after release into the wild, with some evidence of longer-term survival (up to nearly four years), but this is for rehabilitated bats rather than captive-bred individuals.",
