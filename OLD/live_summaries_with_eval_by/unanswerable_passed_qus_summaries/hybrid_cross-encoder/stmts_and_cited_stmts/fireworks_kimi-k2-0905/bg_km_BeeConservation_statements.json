Seven replicated trials have monitored laboratory-reared colonies introduced to the environment, with variable results: two UK trials found very low or zero numbers of new queens produced, while two trials (both in the UK) reported good numbers of new queens being produced. These colony reintroduction studies also documented variable rates of social parasitism by cuckoo bees ranging from 25-79% (Action ID: 52).",

Fourteen trials in Europe and North America recorded substantial numbers of wild bees foraging on perennial or annual sown flowering plants in agricultural environments. Ten trials found substantial numbers of foraging wild bees, particularly bumblebees, on phacelia plantings. One replicated trial showed enhanced reproductive success of blue orchard mason bees with planted lupine patches in commercial apple orchards. While other methods like reducing meadow management intensity, providing grass strips at field margins, and implementing agri-environment schemes showed mixed results, planting dedicated floral resources had the most consistent positive outcomes across multiple studies.",

The documents show that both approaches have different benefits: native wild flower seed mixes are strongly preferred by long-tongued bumblebee species (action 19) and support higher abundance compared to cropped field edges, grassy margins, or naturally regenerated margins. Agricultural nectar mixes show greater numbers of bumblebees attracted in the first year compared to perennial wildflower mixes, but these margins degrade in value over time and require re-sowing every few years (action 18). The documents establish that both approaches are beneficial for bumblebee abundance but do not provide the specific quantitative comparison requested.",
