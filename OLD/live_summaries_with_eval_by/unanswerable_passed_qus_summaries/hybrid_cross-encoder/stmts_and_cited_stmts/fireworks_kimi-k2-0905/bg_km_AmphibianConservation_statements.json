      "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence reviewed, pond creation and restoration are effective and cost-efficient methods for amphibian habitat restoration. Creating new ponds (Action 869) has proven highly successful, with studies showing that amphibians naturally colonized 64-100% of created ponds and reproduced in 64-68% of them, with some ponds supporting up to 15 species naturally. Pond restoration (Action 878) was also effective, increasing amphibian species numbers, maintaining or increasing populations, and achieving breeding success in 35-65% of restored ponds. Engaging landowners and volunteers to manage land for amphibians (Action 777) represents a particularly cost-effective approach, with studies showing that between 8 and 41,000 volunteers participated in habitat restoration programs that restored up to 1,023 ponds or over 11,500 kmÂ² of habitat. Payment schemes for farmers (Action 818) to cover conservation costs have also proven effective in creating breeding habitat and increasing amphibian populations. Simple management actions like deepening, de-silting or re-profiling existing ponds (Action 817) resulted in breeding population establishment for various species including great crested newts and tree frogs.",

Action ID 791 states 'We found no evidence for the effects of planting hedges on amphibian populations,' and Action ID 790 similarly reports 'We found no evidence for the effects of maintaining or restoring of hedges on amphibian populations.' However, Action ID 840 provides some related evidence showing that restoring habitat connectivity between wetlands can benefit amphibians, with one study in Italy finding that raising a road on a viaduct to restore connectivity between two wetlands significantly decreased deaths of migrating amphibians. Studies on hedge effectiveness in other contexts (Action ID 538) found that newly planted hedges had higher abundance, species richness or diversity of beetles and spiders compared to crop fields, but no specific data was collected on amphibians. The evidence base currently lacks studies that directly test whether hedges are effective as amphibian corridors.",

Seven amphibian species studies found that created wetlands had similar or higher numbers of species compared to natural wetlands when designed appropriately [Action ID 880].
