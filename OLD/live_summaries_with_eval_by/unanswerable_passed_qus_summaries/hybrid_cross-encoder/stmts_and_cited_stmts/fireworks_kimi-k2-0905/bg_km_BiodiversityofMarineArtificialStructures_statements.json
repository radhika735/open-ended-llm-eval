      "relevant_summary": "Based on available evidence, creating groove habitats and small protrusions, ridges, or ledges (1-50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures appears to be a cost-effective method for enhancing biodiversity (Action ID: 3474). Sixteen studies found that this technique increased species richness and diversity, supported species absent from smooth surfaces, and altered community composition. While some studies showed mixed results depending on factors like depth, shore level, and site conditions, the majority found positive effects on biodiversity. Another cost-effective option is creating small protrusions alone (1-50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures (Action ID: 3462), which studies in Singapore found increased species richness. Reducing the slope of intertidal artificial structures (Action ID: 3461) was also examined, with one study finding increased species richness when combined with rock pools, though individual species abundances were not consistently enhanced. These surface modification techniques are likely more cost-effective than complex engineering solutions as they involve relatively simple alterations during construction or retrofitting of existing structures.",

For crevice habitats specifically, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not this intervention has any desirable or harmful effects on fish populations. However, related studies on similar habitat modifications provide some context: creating large swimthrough habitats (>100 mm) increased overall fish abundance and species richness on subtidal artificial structures (Action ID: 3456), though individual species responses varied. Creating hole habitats (>50 mm), which are similar to crevices, showed mixed effects on fish abundance - one study found no increase in fish abundances while another found mixed effects depending on species group (Action ID: 3434). The lack of specific studies on crevice habitats (>50 mm) means there is currently no direct evidence about their effects on fish abundance.",

Specifically for creating large protrusions (>50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures (Action ID: 3443), no studies were found that evaluated the effects on marine mammal populations, meaning there is currently no evidence to indicate whether this intervention has any desirable or harmful effects on marine mammals. For related eco-engineering interventions, the evidence is also limited. Creating artificial habitat specifically for marine and freshwater mammals (Action ID: 2921) has not been studied, with no evidence available to assess effectiveness or harmful impacts. Similarly, leaving anthropogenic structures in place after decommissioning (Action ID: 2922) has not been evaluated for effects on marine mammal populations. The studies that do exist focus primarily on invertebrate and algal communities. For instance, research on creating grooves and small protrusions (1-50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures (Action ID: 3452) found effects on macroalgae and invertebrate communities, but these studies did not examine impacts on marine mammals. One study on repurposing obsolete offshore structures as artificial reefs (Action ID: 2262) documented colonization by invertebrate species but did not assess marine mammal interactions. This comprehensive lack of evidence suggests that the effects of eco-engineering interventions, including the creation of large protrusions on subtidal artificial structures, remain unstudied in relation to marine mammal populations.",

Small habitat features (1-50 mm) such as pits, grooves, flexible habitats, and protrusions showed mixed but generally positive results for increasing invertebrate and fish diversity, with three studies from Japan, Israel, Australia, and France demonstrating improved community composition and abundance for various species groups (actions 3450, 3453, 3455, 3448). Creating large swimthrough habitats (>100 mm) effectively increased fish species richness and abundance in studies from Mayotte and the USA (action 3456). Managing or restricting harvesting on structures showed higher fish species richness and abundance in studies from Italy (action 3457). However, there is no evidence available for the effectiveness of reducing structure slope, removing non-native species, or using environmentally-sensitive materials, as these interventions lack sufficient study data.",

For transplanting organisms, eleven studies examined this approach with varied results - two studies specifically looked at invertebrate abundance, finding that transplanting sea urchins reduced non-native species cover on kelps, while transplanting corals increased coral cover on structure surfaces. However, survival rates for transplanted organisms were variable depending on species, environmental conditions, and protection measures.
