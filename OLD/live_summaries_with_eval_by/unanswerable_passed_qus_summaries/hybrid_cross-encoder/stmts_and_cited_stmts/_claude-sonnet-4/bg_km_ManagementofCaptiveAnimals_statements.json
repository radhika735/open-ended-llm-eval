      "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence, several cost-effective dietary enrichment methods for captive primates have been demonstrated: Scattering food throughout enclosures is highly effective, with studies showing it increases feeding and exploratory behaviors in rhesus macaques, reduces abnormal behaviors in chimpanzees and aggression in lemurs, and increases foraging and activity levels in gorillas (Action 1315). Presenting food items whole instead of processed increases the amount consumed and time spent feeding in macaques (Action 1323). Changing feeding times to unpredictable schedules decreases inactivity in chimpanzees (Action 1338). Providing cut branches (browse) allows captive gorillas to use the same processing skills as wild gorillas for foraging (Action 1332). Hiding food in containers such as boxes and bags increases activity levels and foraging behaviors in lemurs and gibbons (Action 1316). Feeding individuals in social groups makes enrichment tasks more efficient, requiring less time to complete in monkeys, and increases consumption of unfamiliar foods (Action 1343). Presenting feeds when smaller crowds are present increases foraging and object use in chimpanzees (Action 1324).",

The action documents show that simulating rainfall using sound recordings of rain and/or thunderstorms has no captured evidence for its effects (action 1867). Similarly, allowing temperate amphibians to hibernate has no captured evidence for its effects (action 1868). However, the documents do show that varying artificial rainfall to simulate seasonal changes (rather than sound recordings) has evidence of effectiveness - two studies in Germany and Austria found that simulating a wet and dry season stimulated breeding and egg deposition (action 1872). Additionally, one review and four studies found that reproductive success of frogs in captivity depended on temperature or a simulated wet and dry season (action 835).",
