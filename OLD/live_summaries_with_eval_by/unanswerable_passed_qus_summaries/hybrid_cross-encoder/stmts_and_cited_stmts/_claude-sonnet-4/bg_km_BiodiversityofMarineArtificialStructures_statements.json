Twenty-two studies examined this intervention, showing that creating pit habitats increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness and/or diversity on structure surfaces in eight of 12 studies (Action ID 3475). The pit habitats supported macroalgae, invertebrate and fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without added habitats. Creating small protrusions (1-50 mm) also showed promise, with two studies in Singapore finding increased species richness when combined with grooves, small ridges and pits (Action ID 3462). Creating large ridges or ledges (>50 mm) demonstrated effectiveness in three studies, with one study reporting increased species diversity when combined with grooves and small protrusions (Action ID 3465). Reducing the slope of intertidal artificial structures showed mixed results, with one study finding increased combined macroalgae, invertebrate and fish species richness when combined with creating rock pools (Action ID 3461). Using environmentally-sensitive materials had varied effects across eight studies, with some materials like ECOncrete™ showing benefits when combined with creating grooves, small ledges and holes, while other materials showed mixed or no effects (Action ID 3469). Creating flexible habitats showed limited effectiveness, with short flexible habitats (1-50 mm) decreasing species richness in one study (Action ID 3459), though long flexible habitats (>50 mm) did alter community composition in one study (Action ID 3460).",

Fourteen studies examined this approach (action 3470). Six of 11 studies found that using shell-concrete or quarried rock in place of standard-concrete on subtidal artificial structures, or using ECOncrete™ in place of standard-concrete or fibreglass, along with creating texture, grooves, holes, pits and/or small ledges, altered the combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition on structure surfaces. Three studies found that ECOncrete™ surfaces with added habitats supported mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate and/or fish species that were absent from standard-concrete or fibreglass structure surfaces. Three studies found that using ECOncrete™, along with creating texture, grooves, holes, pits and/or small ledges, did increase the species diversity and/or richness on and around structures. Additionally, managing or restricting harvesting showed some benefits with one study finding higher fish species richness around a subtidal artificial structure with harvesting restrictions compared with unrestricted structures (action 3457). Creating short flexible habitats (1–50 mm) had mixed effects on invertebrate communities depending on density, length and site (action 3450). Several other potential methods showed no evidence or mixed results, including reducing slopes (action 3442), creating large protrusions (action 3443), and creating natural rocky reef topography (action 3446).",

For hole habitats (>50 mm), studies in Australia, the UK, Israel and the Netherlands found that holes, when combined with other features like grooves and small ridges, altered macroalgae and invertebrate community composition, supported species absent from surfaces without habitat features, and increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species diversity and richness on structure surfaces, though effects on individual invertebrate abundance were mixed (Action 3467). For groove habitats (1-50 mm), studies across multiple locations found mixed results: some studies showed that grooves supported macroalgae, mobile and non-mobile invertebrate species absent from surfaces without grooves, and in some cases increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness and diversity, though effects varied by site and groove configuration (Action 3473).",

One study mentioned that wave-sheltered pools filled with sediment within two years (Action 3476).

Two of three replicated, controlled studies found that creating textured surfaces did not increase the combined macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate live cover on structure surfaces, though one study found that textured surfaces combined with environmentally-sensitive material did increase cover and biomass (Action 3449). For transplanting organisms, two studies examined invertebrate abundance specifically: one replicated, randomized, controlled and site comparison study in Australia found that transplanting sea urchins onto a subtidal artificial structure reduced the cover of non-native sea mat on kelps, and one study in Singapore reported that transplanting corals increased coral cover on structure surfaces (Action 3471).
