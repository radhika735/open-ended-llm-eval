Four studies were based on the same experimental set-up in the UK. N.B. Prescribed burning in historically disturbed peatlands is considered as a separate action.\\nMoss cover (4 studies): One replicated, paired, controlled study in bogs in Germany\\u00a0found that burning increased moss/lichen/bare ground cover in the short term (2\\u20137 months after burning). Three replicated, paired studies (based on the same experimental set-up) in one bog in the UK\\u00a0found that moss cover (including Sphagnum) was higher in plots burned more often.\\nHerb cover (4 studies): Of two replicated, paired, controlled studies in bogs in Germany\\u00a0and the UK, one\\u00a0found that burning had no effect on cottongrass cover after 2\\u20137 months but the other\\u00a0found that burning increased cottongrass cover after 8\\u201318 years. Two replicated, paired studies in the same bog in the UK reported that cottongrass cover was similar in plots burned every 10 or 20 years. The study in Germany\\u00a0also found that burning reduced purple moor grass cover but had mixed effects, amongst sites, on cover of other grass-like plants and forbs.\\nTree/shrub cover (5 studies): Three replicated, paired studies in a bog in the UK\\u00a0found that heather cover was lower in plots burned more often. One replicated, paired, controlled study in bogs in Germany found that heather cover was lower in burned than unburned plots. Two replicated, controlled studies in the bogs in Germany and fens in the USA\\u00a0found that burning (sometimes along with other interventions) did not affect cover of other shrubs.\\nVegetation structure (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in a bog in the UK\\u00a0found that plots burned more frequently contained more biomass of grass-like plants than plots burned less often, but contained less total vegetation, shrub and bryophyte biomass.\\nOverall plant richness/diversity (2 studies): Two replicated, controlled studies (one also randomized and paired) in the fens in the USA\\u00a0and a bog in the UK\\u00a0found that burning reduced or limited plant species richness. In the USA, burning was carried out along with other interventions.\"\n}"
