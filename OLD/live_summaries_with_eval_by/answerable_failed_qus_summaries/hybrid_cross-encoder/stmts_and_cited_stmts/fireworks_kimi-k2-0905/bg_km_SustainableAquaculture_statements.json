The most supported action is fallowing, with a trial in Tasmania demonstrating that sediment community structure under Atlantic salmon cages became more similar to non-impacted sites over two fallowing cycles (Action 1027). Integrated aquaculture systems show mixed results, with a study in Canada finding that blue mussels absorbed waste from a salmon farm, while a study in Spain found no evidence that oyster and mussels fed on fish farm waste. One replicated, controlled study in the USA reported greater growth of scallops grown next to fish farms, and a replicated, controlled study in Scotland reported enhanced algal growth when placed adjacent to fish farms (Action 932). However, several potential mitigation approaches lack evidence, including improving fish food and pellets to reduce waste production (Action 2192), using other bioremediation methods (Action 2197), modifying aquaculture practices in watersheds (Action 3172), introducing water quality regulations (Action 3581), cleaning wastewater before environmental release (Action 3142), and locating aquaculture systems in vegetated areas (Action 2189).",

      "relevant_summary": "Several husbandry practices beyond feed and chemical treatments can improve Atlantic salmon health on farms. Fallowing systems help reduce parasites and disease - a study in Scotland found lower lice numbers on salmon in cages using fallowing (1026). Cage size management shows benefits, with larger cages resulting in lower levels of amoebic gill disease compared to smaller cages (742). Aerobic training programs improve survival rates, with interval training being more effective than continuous training when salmon are exposed to infectious pancreatic necrosis (740). Selective breeding for disease resistance traits increases survival levels, as demonstrated in a Norwegian study where salmon bred for high resistance to infectious pancreatic necrosis showed better survival than those bred for low resistance (735). Freshwater bathing can help manage amoebic gill disease, with one study showing reduction in gill amoebae persisting up to 10 days post-treatment (739). Probiotics and immunostimulants also improve health outcomes - Scottish studies found increased survival in salmon fed probiotics before bacterial exposure, while Norwegian research showed that beta-glucans reduced lice infection by 28% and mannan oligosaccharides improved gut function (732). Fallowing also provides environmental benefits, with Tasmanian trials showing sediment communities recovering to become more similar to non-impacted sites over two fallowing cycles (1027).",

Altering lighting intensity also showed promise, with a replicated, controlled study in Norway reporting lower numbers of lice on salmon kept in low intensity artificial light or natural lighting - the more intense the artificial light, the higher the number of lice found on fish (Action ID: 741). Dietary interventions using probiotics and immunostimulants showed some benefits, with a replicated, controlled study in Norway finding that feeding salmon a diet with 28% plant-based protein reduced lice infection by 28%, and adding beta-glucans decreased infection levels by a further 28% compared to controls (Action ID: 732).",

Fallowing strategies involve leaving salmon cages empty for periods, which research shows can help sediment communities recover from aquaculture impacts - with studies demonstrating that sediment community structure under salmon cages becomes more similar to non-impacted sites after fallowing cycles. Additional management approaches include replacing or repairing damaged anti-predator nets to reduce environmental impacts, and locating aquaculture systems in already impacted areas to minimize additional stress on pristine environments, though evidence for these latter strategies is limited.",
