Twenty studies found that restoring species-rich, semi-natural grassland resulted in increased plant species richness [133]. However, seven other studies found no clear effect on plant species richness from such restoration efforts, and three studies found that restored grasslands had a lower diversity and frequency of certain plant species [133]. Techniques that have been found to be effective for restoring species-rich grassland include grazing, introducing plant species, hay spreading, and mowing [133].",

One strategy is to increase the number of species in the seed mix, which has been found in some studies to increase the species richness of sown plants and the cover of target plant species (3406). However, other studies have found that increasing the number of species in the seed mix does not change plant species richness or the cover of sown species (3406). Another strategy is to include a mix of grasses, legumes, and other forbs, which can result in a higher species richness and abundance of butterflies compared to grass-only mixes (3929). Finally, the inclusion of nurse plants in the seed mix has been studied, with mixed results. While one study found that sowing seeds under nurse plants increased seed germination and survival, another found that a seed mix containing nurse species resulted in a community composition that was less similar to the target community and did not increase species richness (3402).",
