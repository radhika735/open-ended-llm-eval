Another study in Austria observed that captive frogs began breeding when their enclosures were enriched with more calling, perching, and egg-laying sites, and when they experienced simulated wet and dry seasons (1876). The reproductive success of captive frogs has been found to be dependent on temperature or the simulation of a wet and dry season (835).

Another study in the USA on a fishing cat found that providing live fish increased hunting behavior and decreased sleeping (1925). A study in Brazil on maned wolves found that scattering food around their enclosure increased their locomotion and they spent more time in the area with scattered food compared to food on a tray (1921). There was no change in the occurrence of stereotypical behaviours in tigers when provided with live fish in a study in the USA (1925).",

      "relevant_summary": "A study in Brazil suggested that identifying and breeding a similar, less-threatened species can help refine husbandry techniques for a target species, leading to successful breeding (1862). For enclosure design, one study in Fiji found that adding rotting logs, hollow bamboo pipes, and a variety of substrates promoted egg-laying in frogs (1876). Another study in Austria reported that providing more calling, perching, and laying sites, along with simulating wet and dry seasons, initiated breeding in captive frogs (1876).\n\nHormone treatment is another option. One review and multiple studies found that hormone treatment in male amphibians stimulated or increased sperm production, or resulted in successful captive breeding (883). However, the amount and viability of sperm depended on the type, amount, or number of hormone doses (883). For female amphibians, hormone treatment yielded mixed results. Some studies reported that 30-71% of females produced viable eggs, with success often depending on the hormone combination and dosage, while other studies found no increase in egg production (883). Some studies also reported that eggs induced by hormone treatment were successfully raised to tadpoles or froglets, while others noted high mortality rates before or after hatching (883).",
