The survival rate for translocated Hawaiian monk seal pups after one year was between 50% and 83%, and for those both rehabilitated and translocated, it was 52% (2930). These survival rates were comparable to or higher than those of non-translocated pups at the release or original sites, respectively (2930). Additionally, the dispersal times of translocated Hawaiian monk seal pups were similar to those of non-translocated pups at the release sites (2930). There were no studies found that assessed the effects of translocating marine and freshwater mammals to mitigate disease exposure or before the start of impactful activities (2859, 2931).",

In addition, four of six studies found that using acoustic devices at salmon farms reduced predation by grey seals, harbour seals, and South American sea lions, although two studies found that acoustic devices did not reduce harbour seal predation or the presence of common bottlenose dolphins (2775). Two studies on translocating seals away from salmon farms found that more than half of the translocated seals returned (2776). In the context of wild fisheries, two controlled studies found that modifying fishing pots by installing steel rods or metal frames reduced the number of Australian sea lion pups or grey and harbour seals that entered or became trapped in them (2822). Four other controlled studies found that modifying fishing trap-nets or bag-nets reduced damage to salmon catches by seals and that securing crab pot doors reduced interactions with common bottlenose dolphins (2822). One study found that switching off artificial lights at a wild fishery did not deter harbour seals from feeding on salmon (2825). Finally, no studies were found that evaluated the effects of introducing and enforcing regulations to prevent the use of harmful deterrents on mammals at wild fisheries (2779).",
