Chemical control methods include herbicide application (1643), which in four of five controlled studies reduced grass cover or non-native grass cover, though two studies in the UK found herbicide did not reduce grass cover. Herbicide can be combined with seeding shrubland plants (1644), where one of two studies found reduced non-native grass cover, though one study found no reduction in non-native grass cover. Mechanical control techniques include cutting/mowing (1638), which in two studies reduced grass cover but grass cover recovered over time in one study. Cutting can be combined with sowing shrubland seeds (1639), where one study found reduced grass cover. Other mechanical methods include rotovating (1648), though this did not alter grass presence in one study, and raking (1640), which reduced both invasive and native grass cover in one study. Prescribed burning (1723) is used to control grass, though one study found it did not reduce purple moor grass cover but did reduce common heather cover. Combination treatments include herbicide with prescribed burning (1725), which did not reduce purple moor grass cover, and cutting with prescribed burning (1724), which also did not reduce purple moor grass cover. Grazing management through livestock use (1646) had mixed effects, with one study finding increased wavy-hair grass cover and another finding reduced grass height. Livestock exclusion using fences (1545) showed variable results, with one study finding declined grass cover and one study finding increased grass cover. Additional techniques include adding mulch with seeding (1650), though this did not reduce grass cover, and allowing natural regeneration without active management (1679), where two studies found decreased grass cover or biomass after fire.",

Topsoil removal has been used as a restoration technique, with one study in the Netherlands finding that heathlands restored by topsoil removal had higher butterfly abundance in areas where heather litter had also been spread compared to areas where it had not (Action 3946). Temporary irrigation has been shown to increase shrub cover in degraded shrublands, with one study in the USA demonstrating that irrigation increased shrub cover (Action 1696). Shrubland restoration generally achieved similar biodiversity outcomes to undisturbed areas, with studies in the USA and Mexico finding that restored desert scrub or shrubland had mammal species richness similar to undisturbed areas (Action 2569), and a Mexico study found areas of restored shrubland had similar reptile and amphibian species richness compared to non-restored areas but higher abundance of lizards (Action 3751). In the UK, restored moorland developed moth communities more similar to established heather moorland than degraded moorland (Action 3946). One UK study reported that a population of silver-studded blue butterflies released into a site managed for heathland restoration increased in abundance over 11 years and expanded its range beyond the initial release area (Action 3946). For bird populations, a UK study found that one or two pairs of northern lapwing bred on restored moorland where none had previously bred (Action 364).",

      "relevant_summary": "Altering livestock grazing practices produces diverse effects on shrubland vegetation depending on the specific intervention. Changing the type of livestock leads to mixed effects on shrub cover, but in two studies it reduced the cover of herbaceous species (Action 1608). Grazing with both cattle and sheep, as opposed to grazing with sheep alone, reduced cover of purple moor grass but had no effect on four other plant species (Action 1608).\n\nIncreasing the number of livestock shows varied impacts on shrub communities. In the UK, high density livestock caused common heather cover to decline, while in the Netherlands dwarf shrub cover was lower in grazed versus ungrazed areas (Action 1628). However, one study in Belgium found that grazing increased heather cover, and areas grazed by cattle in France had higher cover of non-ericaceous shrubs but lower cover of ericaceous shrubs (Action 1628). Increasing livestock numbers resulted in increased common heather and cross-leaved heath seedlings in the Netherlands, but one US study found no alteration in shrub cover (Action 1628). A systematic review found that increased grazing intensity increased grass species cover relative to heather species (Action 1628).\n\nExcluding livestock from shrublands through fencing generally increases shrub cover and abundance, with studies showing increased shrub biomass and height of individual heather plants (Action 1545). However, one US study found decreased woody plant cover with fencing (Action 1545). Livestock exclusion typically decreases grass cover in some studies, though effects are mixed across different locations (Action 1545). \n\nIn degraded peatlands, excluding livestock shows variable effects: some studies found no effect on shrub cover, while others found increased shrub cover, with responses sometimes varying between species and sites (Action 1734). Livestock exclusion in peatlands increased total vegetation, shrub and bryophyte biomass but had no effect on grass-like herb biomass (Action 1734).",

Manual vegetation control involving mowing, chaining, and cutting can be used to remove midstorey and ground-level vegetation in shrublands (Action 337). Mechanical cutting has been shown to increase the number of plant species in some cases and can reduce tree cover (Action 1627). Livestock grazing represents another alternative, where increasing livestock numbers can influence shrub cover and vegetation structure, with studies showing mixed effects on heather cover and increases in grass species relative to heather species (Action 1628). Cutting and mowing can be used to mimic traditional grazing practices, with studies in North Western Europe, Italy, and Spain showing varied effects on heather abundance and grass cover (Action 1627). Heathland management through cutting has shown benefits for some butterfly species, with mechanical cutting demonstrating higher abundance of certain species compared to other management approaches (Action 3947). Rotovation represents another mechanical approach for controlling grass species, though studies found it did not significantly alter heather presence compared to mowing or cutting (Action 1648). Additionally, cutting combined with seeding of shrubland plants can help control grass while establishing desired shrub species (Action 1639). The reduction of large herbivore numbers has also been shown to increase shrub cover and reduce grass cover when grazing pressure needs to be decreased (Action 1663).",

Additionally, cutting large trees/shrubs can be used to maintain or restore disturbance, with studies showing it increased herb cover and biomass (Action 1761). Tree/crop removal specifically to restore shrubland structure is also practiced, though no studies have yet evaluated its effectiveness (Action 1683).

Prescribed fire is used to maintain or restore disturbance in grasslands and other open habitats, with studies showing varied effects on different species depending on timing and site characteristics (3882). Land under power lines can be managed through mechanical cutting, which has been shown to increase butterfly species richness compared to unmanaged land, with effects varying by time since management (3855). Combined approaches such as cutting and prescribed burning have also been employed to control grass vegetation (1724).

Herbicide treatment for bracken control increased cover of wavy hair-grass, sheep's fescue, gorse, and abundance of common cow-wheat (Action 1652). Studies consistently showed that herbicide application reduced bracken biomass or cover, though one study found no change in bracken abundance (Action 1652). However, herbicide use also increased silver birch seedlings, which may be undesirable in some shrubland management contexts (Action 1652). For grass control, herbicide combined with seed sowing increased shrub seedlings and the number of native plant species in USA studies, with mixed results on native plant cover (Action 1644). One study found herbicide and weeding increased native grass and forb cover while reducing non-native grass cover (Action 1645). However, some negative effects were documented: one study found that burning and herbicide application to reduce purple moor grass actually reduced common heather cover without reducing the target grass (Action 1725). When herbicide was combined with cutting for bracken control, results were mixed, with some studies showing increased heather cover and plant species richness, while others showed no significant effects on plant species cover (Action 1654).",

      "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, prescribed burning applications on shrubland vegetation show varied effects depending on the specific objectives and contexts. For bird populations in shrublands, prescribed burning resulted in overall bird densities being similar between burned and unburned areas, with species numbers and bird densities not varying between areas burned in summer versus winter (Action 321). For vegetation control applications, prescribed burning to control trees reduced cover of common heather and increased cover of purple moor grass (Action 1721), while burning to control grass did not reduce purple moor grass cover but did reduce common heather cover (Action 1723). Prescribed burning initially reduced vegetation height, but this recovered over time (Action 1723). For pollutant reduction purposes, prescribed burning to reduce nitrogen deposition impacts did not alter shoot length of common heather or number of purple moor grass seedlings compared to mowing (Action 1670). For reptile populations in grassland and shrubland environments, prescribed burning showed mixed results - some studies found similar reptile species richness and abundance between burned and unburned areas, while others found different species composition immediately after burning that remained different in some grass types even after vegetation regrowth (Action 3651). Areas burned 1-4 years earlier had lower reptile species richness and abundance than areas burned 11-15 years earlier (Action 3651). When prescribed burning was combined with vegetation cutting, it resulted in higher abundance of some reptile species compared to burning only or unmanaged areas (Action 3655).",

One controlled study in the UK found that mowing increased the number of heathland plants in one of two sites and increased the presence of a small minority of heathland plants (Action 1638). Two randomized controlled studies in the USA found that mowing reduced grass cover, but in one study grass cover recovered over time (Action 1638). However, three replicated controlled studies found that cutting to control grass did not alter cover of common heather or shrub seedling abundance (Action 1638).\n\n**Cutting/Mowing Combined with Seeding**: When cutting is combined with sowing shrubland plant seeds, one randomized controlled study in the USA found that this approach increased shrub seedling abundance and reduced grass cover (Action 1639). However, another study found that the biomass of sagebrush plants in areas where grass was cut and seeds sown did not differ from areas where grass was not cut but seeds were sown (Action 1639).\n\n**Mechanical Soil Disturbance**: Rotovating (mechanical cultivation) showed limited effectiveness, with one study finding it did not alter the presence of heather or wavy hair grass compared to mowing or cutting (Action 1648). When combined with mowing, one controlled study found that mowing followed by rotovating increased the number of heathland plant species in one of two sites (Action 1641).\n\n**Turf Stripping**: Cutting and removing turf showed promise in one controlled study in the UK, which found it increased the number of heathland plants and increased the presence of heathland plants while decreasing the presence of non-heathland plants (Action 1647).\n\n**Prescribed Burning**: Prescribed burning alone showed mixed results for grass control. One replicated controlled study found that prescribed burning to reduce purple moor grass cover did not reduce its cover but did reduce the cover of common heather (Action 1723). When combined with cutting, burning and cutting reduced cover of common heather but did not reduce cover of purple moor grass (Action 1724).\n\n**Grazing**: One replicated controlled study in the Netherlands found that grazing to reduce grass cover had mixed effects on cover of common heather and cross-leaved heath, while cover of wavy-hair grass increased (Action 1646). One before-and-after study in Spain found a reduction in grass height with grazing (Action 1646).",

Livestock grazing can effectively control unwanted vegetation, with studies showing reduced tree cover and basal area when grazing is used to control trees (Actions 1634, 1722). Grazing increased the number of common heather and cross-leaved heath seedlings in the Netherlands (Action 1628). One study in Belgium found that grazing increased cover of heather (Action 1628). Areas grazed by cattle had higher cover of non-ericaceous shrubs in France (Action 1628). Increased grazing intensity led to increased cover of grass species relative to heather species in North Western Europe (Action 1628).\n\nNegative outcomes include: Cover of common heather declined in sites with high livestock density in UK studies (Action 1628). Dwarf shrub cover was lower in grazed areas than ungrazed areas in the Netherlands (Action 1628). Grazing reduced the cover of common heather when used to control trees in Italy (Actions 1634, 1722). High livestock density areas had lower cover of ericaceous shrubs in France (Action 1628). Increased grazing resulted in decreased vegetation height in the Netherlands (Action 1628). One study in the Netherlands found a decrease in the number of plant species following livestock increases (Action 1628). Removal of livestock (feral sheep, cattle and horses) led to increased shrub cover and reduced grass cover in the USA, suggesting negative effects of their presence (Action 1663). Reducing grazing pressure by red deer increased the cover and height of common heather in the UK (Action 1663).\n\nThe effects appear to vary significantly by location, livestock type, grazing intensity, and target vegetation, with some studies showing no significant effects or mixed results across different sites within the same study (Actions 1628, 1608, 1646).",

In one study, prescribed burning to reduce purple moor grass cover did not reduce the target species but did reduce common heather cover (action 1723). Similarly, burning combined with herbicide application reduced common heather cover but failed to reduce purple moor grass cover (action 1725). For wildlife impacts, studies showed that some individual bird species had similar or lower densities on burned areas compared to control areas (action 321). In reptile populations, immediate negative effects were documented, with reptile abundance being lower immediately after burning compared to before burning, though abundance recovered after vegetation regrew (action 3651). Additionally, areas burned 1-4 years earlier had lower reptile species richness and abundance compared to areas burned 11-15 years earlier (action 3651).

Studies evaluating cutting to mimic grazing found mixed results: a systematic review of three studies in lowland heathland in North Western Europe found that mowing did not alter heather abundance relative to grass abundance, while a site comparison in Italy found that mowing increased heather cover and grass cover and reduced tree cover (Action 1627). For bird conservation, one controlled study from the USA found that overall bird diversity was similar between chained areas, burned areas and controls, while five studies from the USA and Europe found that some species were found at greater densities or abundances on sites with mechanical vegetation control than on sites with prescribed burning or no management (Action 337). Regarding grazing intensity, one replicated, paired, controlled study in bogs in the UK found that reducing grazing intensity resulted in greater total vegetation and shrub cover, and higher vegetation biomass (Action 1735). One replicated controlled trial in mixed temperate forest in the USA showed that for bee conservation, controlling fire using cutting and burning combined increases herbaceous plant cover in subsequent years (Action 37).

Reducing or stopping grazing increased abundance or cover of shrubs (1607), dwarf shrub cover was higher in ungrazed sites (1607), and reducing grazing increased cover of western gorse (1607). Using fences to exclude livestock increased shrub cover, abundance, biomass, and individual heather plant biomass and height (1545). Removing feral sheep, cattle and horses increased shrub cover and reduced grass cover (1663), and reducing grazing pressure by red deer increased cover and height of common heather (1663).

Similarly, no evidence was found for the effects of creating managed paths/signs to contain disturbance on forests (Action 1170), and no studies evaluated the effects of limiting, ceasing or prohibiting access for recreational purposes on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations (Action 2152). While one study in Turkey found that using signs and access restrictions (specifically fencing sea turtle nests with signs) resulted in higher hatching success compared to areas with no fencing or signs (Action 3642), this was in a marine turtle context rather than shrubland habitat. For broader access management, studies on mammals showed that excluding or limiting visitors to protected areas resulted in higher population abundance of medium-sized and large mammals on roads with restricted access compared to unrestricted access, fewer bear killings when visitor access was temporarily restricted, and increased use of protected areas by grizzly bears and leopards when human access was restricted (Action 2330). However, these findings are not specific to shrubland ecosystems.",
