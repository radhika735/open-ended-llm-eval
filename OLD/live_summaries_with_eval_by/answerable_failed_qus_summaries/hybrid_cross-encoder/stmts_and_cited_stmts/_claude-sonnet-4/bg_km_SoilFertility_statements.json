Reducing tillage (action 126) provides similar benefits for soil organic matter retention.

Reducing fertilizer, pesticide or herbicide use generally is highly effective, with studies from Italy and Pakistan finding higher diversity of soil invertebrates and microorganisms in low-input systems (Action 904). Converting to organic farming shows significant benefits, with four studies across Asia, Europe, and the USA finding higher numbers, diversity, functional diversity or activity of soil organisms under organic management (Action 895). \n\nTillage management practices are particularly important for soil organism diversity. No-tillage cultivation methods result in more microbial biomass, more earthworms, and different communities of nematodes and mites (Action 2306). Reduced tillage practices also increase microbial biomass and earthworms in multiple studies (Actions 2307, 906, 126). Using crop rotation, particularly when including legumes, increases the number of microbes and diversity of different soil animals according to four randomized, replicated trials from Canada, Portugal and Zambia (Action 857).\n\nCover crop management provides substantial benefits for soil organisms. Growing cover crops when fields are empty results in more diverse nematode communities and greater microbial biomass (Action 898). Cover crops or ground cover in perennial crops increase microbial biomass, symbiotic fungi, bacteria and nematodes (Action 2304). Adding mulch to crops increases soil animal and fungal numbers, diversity and activity in three replicated trials from Canada, Poland and Spain (Action 887).\n\nSoil amendments directly support soil organism diversity. Amending soil with bacteria or fungi results in higher microbial diversity (Action 888). Adding fresh plant material or crop remains increases microbial biomass (Action 910). Using a mix of organic and inorganic amendments leads to higher microbial biomass, activity and diversity according to multiple controlled trials (Action 902). Alley cropping results in higher diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Action 903). Excluding grazers from areas results in more nematodes and more diverse nematode communities (Action 2309).",

Mixed organic and inorganic amendments increased microbial biomass and activity, reduced soil cracking more effectively than inorganic fertilizers alone, increased soil organic carbon content, enhanced soil nutrients, and increased maize yields (Action 902). General composts applied at high rates increased soil organic matter levels, microbial biomass, and fruit yield (Action 889). Manures and agricultural composts consistently increased microbial biomass and respiration, reduced soil loss and water runoff, reduced nutrient loss while increasing nitrogen levels, increased soil carbon levels, improved soil physical properties including larger soil aggregations, and increased crop yields (Action 911). Green manures increased soil organic carbon and grain yields (Action 908). Fresh plant material and crop remains increased microbial biomass, improved soil structure, reduced soil loss with mixed effects depending on soil type, increased soil nitrogen levels and reduced nitrate leaching, consistently increased soil carbon levels and created larger soil aggregates, and improved crop yields (Action 910).

Changing tillage practices shows significant benefits, with reduced tillage reducing soil loss and runoff compared to conventional ploughing according to seven replicated trials (Action 906). Adding mulch to crops reduces soil erosion and runoff, with five studies from India, France, Nigeria and the UK finding that mulches increased soil stability and reduced soil erosion (Action 887). Growing cover crops beneath the main crop or between crop rows reduces erosion, with studies from France and the USA showing reduced soil loss under cover crops (Action 897). Crop rotation that includes legumes reduces rainwater runoff and soil loss and increases water infiltration into the soil (Action 857). Amending soil with fresh plant material or crop remains reduces soil loss, though effects can vary depending on soil type (Action 910). Amending soil using a mix of organic and inorganic amendments is more effective at reducing the size of cracks in dry soil than inorganic fertilizers alone (Action 902). Controlling traffic and timing shows that controlled traffic reduces runoff and increases water filtration into the soil (Action 899). Reducing grazing intensity reduces sediment erosion when grazing time in forage crops is reduced (Action 901). Planting new hedges reduces soil erosion and increases soil organic matter levels according to three replicated studies (Action 744). Providing un-harvested buffer strips can also contribute to soil protection on agricultural land (Action 161).",

Growing cover crops when fields are empty improves soil structure and nutrient retention, with studies finding reduced nitrate leaching (Action 898). Four replicated, randomized, controlled studies found that less nitrate was leached from soils with winter cover crops compared to soils without them (Action 1357). Growing cover crops beneath main crops or between crop rows also helps retain nutrients (Action 897).\n\nChemical amendments can reduce nitrate losses. Three of five trials testing nitrification inhibitors found reduced nitrate losses and nitrous oxide emissions when applied to soil, although the method of application influenced effectiveness (Action 909).\n\nTiming management strategies are important. Delaying ploughing until spring reduces nitrate leaching compared to autumn ploughing (Action 712).\n\nOrganic amendments help with nutrient retention. Three randomized, replicated studies found reduced nutrient loss and higher nitrogen levels when farmyard or poultry manure was applied, with one study finding lower nutrient loss when farmyard manure was applied in winter rather than autumn (Action 911). Using organic rather than mineral fertilizers supports better nutrient management (Action 134).\n\nBuffer strips provide protection against nutrient runoff. Studies found less nitrate in runoff from irrigated pastures with buffer strips compared to those without (Action 1387). Buffer strips also increase nitrogen retention in soils (Action 1372) and reduce pesticide and nutrient runoff into waterways (Action 3894).\n\nReducing chemical inputs in grassland management helps prevent excess nutrient loss while maintaining soil health (Action 694).",

Incorporating fresh plant material or crop remains increased yields in trials from Denmark and the Philippines (Action 910).\n\nOrganic processing wastes and their composts have shown promise, with one trial finding increased barley yield when molasses were added (Action 891). The use of organic rather than mineral fertilizers generally supports higher plant diversity and improved soil biological activity (Action 134). Converting to organic farming showed mixed results for yields but demonstrated higher soil carbon levels and improved fruit quality and disease resistance in some cases (Action 895).\n\nMixed approaches combining organic and inorganic amendments have also proven effective, with two controlled, randomized, replicated trials from China finding increased maize yield in soils with mixed manure and inorganic fertilizer amendments (Action 902). Cover crops provide additional benefits by reducing nutrient leaching and improving water management (Action 1357).",

Changing tillage practices is effective, with studies showing that reduced tillage and no-tillage systems can reduce compaction (action 906). Five studies found that controlled traffic and reduced tillage led to reduced compaction and subsequent effects like reduced water runoff, and crop yields increased under no-tillage (action 906). No-tillage compared to reduced tillage showed more large aggregates in soils and higher water-stability in some comparisons (action 1370). Controlling traffic and traffic timing helps reduce compaction, with five trials finding less compaction, reduced runoff and increased water filtration into the soil under controlled traffic (action 899). Adding organic matter through incorporating fresh plant material or crop remains improves soil structure, with one study finding improved soil structure when straw was incorporated (action 910). Growing cover crops beneath the main crop or between crop rows reduces erosion and improves soil structure, with studies showing reduced erosion and highest soil stability under grass cover (action 897). Growing cover crops when fields are empty improves soil structure, with three studies finding that cover crops improved soil structure, including higher soil porosity, interconnectivity and lower resistance in soil (action 898). Using crop rotation also helps, with studies showing that including forage crops reduced rainwater runoff and soil loss, and including legumes increased water infiltration (action 857).",

Studies from Mediterranean countries including Italy, Spain, and Portugal found that no-tillage increased organic matter in soils compared to conventional tillage (Action 1369). No-tillage systems also led to more stable soil aggregates and reduced erosion, with seven studies from Spain and the USA finding that soils without tillage were more stable than tilled soils (Action 1369). Additionally, no-tillage systems increased earthworm populations, with two studies from the USA finding more earthworms in soils without tillage compared to soils with tillage (Action 1369).\n\nReduced tillage systems also provide soil structure improvements. A meta-analysis from multiple Mediterranean countries found more organic matter in soils with reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage (Action 1371). Studies from Italy, Spain, Syria, and the USA found more organic matter in soils with reduced tillage in some or all comparisons (Action 1371). Reduced tillage systems showed improved soil aggregation, with studies from Spain finding that soil aggregates had higher water-stability in plots with reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage (Action 1371).\n\nThe broader category of changing tillage practices demonstrates various benefits. Studies from Canada, Europe, Mexico, and the USA found that reduced tillage led to higher soil organic carbon compared to conventionally tilled soil (Action 906). Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA found that reduced tillage maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure (Action 906). Four trials found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage, and studies found more species of earthworms and higher microbe activity under reduced tillage compared to conventional systems (Action 906).\n\nThese tillage alternatives were tested across various European soil types including calcareous silt loam, chalky, clay, clay loam, fine sandy loam, loam, loamy-clay, sandy loam, silt loam, silty, and silty clay loam soils (Action 906).",

Manure applications also demonstrate reduced soil loss and water runoff when combined with other treatments (action 911), higher crop yields (action 911), and improved soil stability in some comparisons (action 1363).

      "relevant_summary": "Multiple actions are available to improve the physical structure of clay and clay-loam soils based on the evidence from action documents:\n\n**Organic Amendments**: Amending soil with fresh plant material or crop remains (Action 910) improves soil structure, with one study from India finding improved soil structure when straw was incorporated. Adding organic processing wastes or their composts (Action 891) also improves soil structure, with one trial finding that applying high rates of cotton gin compost and poultry manure improved soil structure. Using a mix of organic and inorganic amendments (Action 902) was found to be more effective at reducing the size of cracks in dry soil than inorganic fertilizers alone.\n\n**Cover Crops and Crop Management**: Growing cover crops when the field is empty (Action 898) improves soil structure, with three randomized, replicated studies finding that growing cover crops improved soil structure, including higher soil porosity and interconnectivity and lower resistance. Using crop rotation (Action 857) that includes legumes increases water infiltration and improves soil structure. Retaining crop residues (Action 907) provides mixed effects on soil physical properties including penetration resistance and the size of soil aggregates.\n\n**Tillage Practices**: Changing tillage practices (Action 906) can improve soil structure, with two studies finding reduced compaction under controlled traffic, and one finding that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Using reduced tillage (Action 1371) results in soil aggregates having higher water-stability and more large aggregates in some comparisons. Using no tillage instead of reduced tillage (Action 1370) creates more large aggregates and higher water-stability in some comparisons.\n\n**Traffic Management**: Controlling traffic and traffic timing (Action 899) improves soil structure by creating a higher number of pores in the soil, less compaction, reduced runoff and increased water filtration into the soil.\n\nThese actions have been tested on various soil types including clay and clay-loam soils specifically.",
