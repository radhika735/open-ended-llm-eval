Presenting food in puzzle feeders increases foraging behavior and tool use, though it may also increase aggression, and increases time spent feeding while reducing inactivity (Action 1318). Presenting food items whole instead of processed increases the amount consumed and time spent feeding in macaques (Action 1323). Providing cut branches (browse) allows captive gorillas to use the same processing skills as wild gorillas when foraging, particularly when presented with stinging nettles (Action 1332). Providing live invertebrates reduces inactivity and increases foraging in captive loris to levels seen in wild loris (Action 1333). Feeding individuals in social groups shows that enrichment tasks are completed faster when monkeys are in groups compared to feeding alone, and groupmates encourage eating unfamiliar foods (Action 1343). Presenting feeds at different crowd levels shows that smaller crowds increase foraging and object use in chimpanzees (Action 1324). Formulating diets to reflect nutritional composition of wild foods, including removal of domestic fruits, can reduce regurgitation and reingestion in gorillas and lower aggression and self-directed behavior in lemurs (Action 1329).",

Live invertebrate prey provided in feeding devices increased explorative behaviours in fennec foxes compared to other types of enrichment (Action 1926). Related feeding enrichment approaches like hiding food around enclosures increased exploring and foraging behaviours in various carnivore species including black bears, leopard cats, bush dogs, maned wolves and Malayan sun bears, while decreasing stereotypical pacing behaviours (Action 1915).

For captive carnivores, feeding whole carcasses (with or without organs/gastrointestinal tract) is an alternative that reduced pacing levels in lions, leopards, snow leopards and cougars, though it increased pacing in tigers (action 1901). When fed whole rabbit, cheetahs had lower blood protein urea, zinc and vitamin A levels compared to supplemented beef, and showed lower levels of inflammatory bowel indicators (action 1901). Feeding whole 1 to 3 day old chickens to ocelots resulted in lower digestible energy and fat compared to a commercial diet (action 1901). Plant-derived protein diets increased digestible energy and dry matter digestibility but decreased mineral retention and plasma taurine levels in maned wolves compared to animal-based protein diets (action 1903).

Food presentation methods can be enhanced by providing cut branches for browse, where captive gorillas used the same processing skills as wild gorillas when presented with stinging nettles (Action 1332), and by presenting food items whole instead of processed, which increased consumption and feeding time in macaques (Action 1323). Foraging opportunities can be improved by scattering food throughout enclosures, which increased feeding and exploratory behaviors in rhesus macaques, reduced abnormal behaviors in chimpanzees and aggression in lemurs, and increased foraging and activity levels in gorillas (Action 1315).

Live vegetation can be provided in planters for foraging, with chimpanzees spending more time foraging when provided with planted rye grass and scattered sunflower seeds (Action 1327). Spatial food distribution can be maximized by utilizing both horizontal and vertical food presentation locations, with monkeys spending longer feeding in bowls positioned at the top of enclosures than on the floor (Action 1328).

Temperature manipulation involves varying enclosure temperature to simulate seasonal changes, with one study finding that a drop in temperature from 20-24°C to 17°C resulted in breeding in one of six females (Action 1864). Artificial rainfall variation to simulate wet and dry seasons has been shown to stimulate breeding and egg deposition in studies from Germany and Austria (Action 1872). Environmental enrichment approaches include providing particular enclosure furniture for calling sites, breeding areas or egg laying sites, with studies showing that adding rotting logs and hollow bamboo pipes promoted egg laying (Action 1876), and providing multiple egg laying sites within enclosures (Action 1873). Natural substrate provision for species that don't breed in water, such as burrowing species, has been successful with studies showing that adding various substrates to enclosures promoted egg laying (Action 1874). Management practices include separating sexes during non-breeding periods, which increased clutch size when combined with other breeding stimulation methods (Action 1880). Additional methods mentioned include varying enclosure humidity using humidifiers, foggers or artificial rain (Action 1863), varying lighting duration and quality to simulate seasonal changes (Actions 1865, 1866), allowing hibernation for temperate species (Action 1868), providing dormancy periods for species from seasonal environments (Action 1869), varying food provision to reflect seasonal availability (Action 1883), and varying water flow for torrent breeding species (Action 1870), though many of these lack documented evidence of effectiveness. General captive breeding studies indicate that reproductive success depends on temperature and simulated wet/dry seasons (Action 835).",

Dietary composition modifications show promising results, with one study finding that when lemurs were fed a fruit-free diet, aggression and self-directed behavior were lower (Action 1329). However, puzzle feeders present mixed results - while they increase foraging behavior and tool use, they also increase aggression according to studies in the USA and UK (Action 1318). Feeding schedules also appear important, with unpredictable feeding schedules decreasing inactivity in chimpanzees (Action 1338). Social feeding arrangements show that monkeys complete enrichment tasks more quickly when in social groups compared to feeding alone, and eat more unfamiliar foods in the presence of groupmates (Action 1343). Environmental factors such as presenting feeds at different crowd levels can increase foraging and object use when smaller crowds are present (Action 1324).

Feeding schedule modifications also influence behavior, with unpredictable feeding schedules decreasing inactivity in chimpanzees (Action 1338), while increasing the number of feeds per day increased feeding time in chimpanzees but also increased hair eating in baboons (Action 1337). Social feeding arrangements can affect food acceptance, with monkeys eating more unfamiliar foods when in the presence of groupmates (Action 1343). Environmental crowd levels during feeding also matter, as smaller crowds increased foraging and object use in chimpanzees (Action 1324). Providing natural browse such as cut branches allows captive gorillas to use the same processing skills as wild gorillas when foraging (Action 1332).",

For carnivores, unpredictable feeding schedules reduced the frequency of stereotypic pacing behaviors in tigers and cheetahs across multiple studies in Switzerland, Ireland, Canada, UK, Namibia and South Africa (Action 1904). The same approach increased behavioral diversity in red foxes and alertness in black-footed cats according to studies in Switzerland and the USA (Action 1904). However, one study in the USA found that unpredictable feeding schedules increased territorial behavior in coyotes, though this did not affect their traveling or foraging behaviors (Action 1904). \n\nRegarding potential harms, one study in the UK found that large felids fed once every three days paced more frequently on non-feeding days, suggesting that extended periods without food may increase stress-related behaviors (Action 1906). \n\nFor primates specifically, no direct evidence was found regarding unpredictable feeding schedules. However, related research showed that when smaller crowds were present, foraging and object use in chimpanzees increased (Action 1324), and that monkeys in social groups completed enrichment tasks more quickly and ate more unfamiliar foods during first encounters (Action 1343). No evidence was captured for the effects of altering feeding schedules according to visitor activity or providing food during visitor experiences for carnivores (Actions 1914, 1916).",

Providing food on a random temporal schedule significantly reduced the frequency of stereotypic pacing behaviors in tigers and cheetahs across multiple studies in Switzerland, Ireland, Canada, the UK, Namibia and South Africa, while also increasing behavioral diversity in red foxes and alertness in black-footed cats (Action 1904). However, allocating fast days (feeding once every three days) actually increased pacing frequency in large felids on non-feeding days (Action 1906). Providing devices to simulate live prey, including lures and pulley systems, increased activity levels and behavioral diversity in felids, and carcasses on bungees decreased pacing behavior in cougars while increasing walking, though pacing initially increased in tigers (Action 1927). Presenting food frozen in ice decreased abnormal or stereotypic behaviors and increased activity levels in felids, while also increasing manipulation behaviors in lions (Action 1923).

Temperature variation to simulate seasonal changes can stimulate breeding, with one study finding breeding success following a temperature drop from 20-24°C to 17°C alongside filling an egg laying pond (Action 1864). Simulating wet and dry seasons through artificial rainfall has been shown to stimulate breeding and egg deposition in multiple studies (Action 1872). Physical enclosure modifications are critical, including providing particular enclosure furniture for calling sites, breeding areas or egg laying sites, with studies showing that adding rotting logs, hollow bamboo pipes, and variety of substrates promoted egg laying (Action 1876). Providing multiple egg laying sites within enclosures has proven effective, with frogs breeding only after being moved to enclosures with various organic substrates and temporary flooding capabilities (Action 1873). Natural substrate provision for non-aquatic breeding species, such as burrowing or tunnel breeders, promoted egg laying when combined with temporary flooding and other interventions (Action 1874). Specialized water features such as artificial aquifers for species that breed in upwelling springs have enabled salamander breeding in captivity (Action 1871). Social and reproductive management includes manipulating sex ratios within enclosures, which when combined with other interventions led to successful breeding (Action 1879), and allowing female mate choice, which increased clutch size when combined with other management practices (Action 1882). Hormone treatments can induce sperm and egg release, with studies showing 30-71% of treated females producing viable eggs, though success varies by hormone type, amount and dosing frequency (Action 883). Breeding similar species first to refine husbandry techniques before working with target species has proven successful for establishing effective protocols for critically endangered species (Action 1862).",
