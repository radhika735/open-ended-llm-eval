Fourteen trials in Europe and North America recorded substantial numbers of wild bees foraging on sown flowering plants; ten trials (eight replicated) using phacelia generally found substantial numbers of foraging wild bees (especially bumblebees), with one replicated trial in Greece finding phacelia not very attractive; six trials reported 8–35 foraging bee species; one replicated trial found planted perennial leguminous herbs were more attractive to bumblebees in more arable landscapes; and four replicated trials measured wider population responses, with one showing enhanced reproductive success of Osmia lignaria in orchards with lupine patches, one showing no increase in bee numbers or richness 50–1,500 m from planted patches, and two finding no or few solitary bees nesting on set‑aside fields sown with phacelia or clover [17].

Increase areas of rough grassland or establish grassy field margins to provide nesting habitat for bumblebees; these attracted nest‑searching queen bumblebees at higher densities than other compared habitats [12]. Provide artificial nest sites or nest boxes for solitary bees; many studies show high uptake across species, with effective designs including bundles of hollow stems or drilled wooden blocks, and recommendations to place boxes within 150–600 m of forage; provision has been associated with increased local populations in some studies [47][80].

Occupancy of solitary bee nest boxes was readily observed across ten studies; reported occupancy rates where given were 1–26% of cavities, and 4.6–33 bee species were recorded using boxes (80). Repeated provision can increase use: occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a site, and fields with nest boxes saw increased estimated foraging Osmia numbers compared to fields without boxes (47). Local population size or emerging red mason bees increased when nest boxes were provided in two replicated studies (80). Effective designs/materials include cut stems/tubes and drilled wood; reed stems and grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees per nest than several other types, while plastic-lined holes or plastic/paper tubes were less productive due to parasitism or mould (47). A replicated study found highest production of red mason bees per nest from reed stems or wood (80). Placement near forage matters: four European species had foraging ranges of 150–600 m, implying nests should be within this distance of forage (47), and one study recommended placing nest boxes 150–600 m from forage (80). Management considerations: parasites and predators frequently attack nest occupants with mortality reported in multiple trials; introduced species and earwigs sometimes occupy boxes; soil-filled boxes for a ground-nesting Andrena were not used (47).\n- Bumblebees showed very low uptake of nest boxes: two replicated trials reported ≤2% occupancy (80).\n- Stingless bees showed no uptake of tested nest boxes: a replicated trial with Melipona quadrifasciata found no use of tree-placed nest boxes (49).\n- Stocking nest boxes with solitary bees has no captured evidence of effects on farmland wildlife; effectiveness is unknown based on available studies (81).\n- Excluding predators can improve nesting outcomes: excluding ants from solitary bee nests increased offspring production for Exonuera nigrescens in a replicated controlled trial (46).\n- Rearing/management experience indicates several Megachilidae species readily nest in drilled wooden blocks or stacked grooved boards (including polystyrene); under good conditions and with plentiful floral resources, local populations can increase up to six-fold in one year, though parasites and pathogens can be problematic (54).",

Trials on North American declining species show mixed captive-rearing outcomes: B. vagans queens reared adults; B. terricola and B. rufocinctus queens reared adults in some attempts; B. fervidus queens laid eggs but larvae died before adulthood across three trials; similar larval mortality was reported for B. affinis (rusty-patched) and B. pensylvanicus; B. ruderatus was also successfully reared; and laboratory rearing was reported for the pocket-making B. atratus [50]. Captive-rearing performance is influenced by diet and husbandry: freshly frozen pollen increased queen size and subsequent colony performance versus dried frozen pollen, higher-protein pollen increased worker offspring production, an 8L:16D light regime shortened time to egg-laying, and specific hibernation regimes affected survival and colony formation (e.g., 4–5°C for 45 days enhanced egg-laying/colony formation but yielded smaller colonies; survival likelihood improved for queens >0.6 g and hibernated ≤4 months) [50]. For reintroduction of laboratory-reared colonies, seven replicated field trials report mixed success: in four trials (three UK, one Canada) colonies were monitored until new queens emerged or the founding queen died; two UK trials yielded very low or zero new queens per colony, whereas two other trials produced good numbers of new queens [52]. Social parasitism rates after release were variable: two replicated trials (Canada, UK) found high parasitism (25–66% and 79% respectively), and parasitism was reduced by placing colonies in landscapes with intermediate rather than very high floral resources and by releasing later in the season; five other trials reported no social parasites [52]. Supplementary feeding produced inconsistent benefits: one Canadian trial improved reproductive success without reducing parasite load, while a USA trial found no increase in productivity; a small Norwegian trial found released B. terrestris foraged mostly >100 m from nests [52].",

Complementary evidence shows solitary bee nest boxes were readily used in several countries, with 1–26% cavity occupancy where reported, increases in local population size or emerging red mason bees when boxes were provided, recommended placement 150–600 m from forage, and highest production in reed stems or wood materials [80].\n- Provide artificial nest sites for bumblebees: Multiple designs (surface wooden/brick/tile, underground tin/wood/terracotta, aerial/tree-attached) have been tested; underground, false underground, or aerial boxes are more readily occupied than wooden surface boxes; entirely buried boxes 5–10 cm deep with a 30–80 cm entrance pipe showed 6–58% occupancy; recent UK trials of surface boxes showed very low uptake (0–2.5%), while several earlier trials in the UK/USA/Canada reported 10–48% uptake; no evidence was found for effects on bumblebee populations [48].

Solitary bee nest boxes are readily used across many regions and species, with occupancy reported in most trials and between 1–26% of available cavities occupied where reported; 4.6–33 species have been recorded using boxes (80). On agricultural land, repeated provision of solitary bee nest boxes at the same site can nearly double the number of occupied nests over three years; increases in foraging Osmia bees were observed in blueberry fields with nest boxes compared to fields without (47). Recommended design and placement details include situating boxes within 150–600 m of forage resources and using nesting materials such as reed stems or wood/grooved boards, which produced more bees per nest than several alternatives; plastic-lined or plastic/paper tubes were less productive due to parasitism or mould (47, 80). Bumblebee nest boxes have very low uptake (around 2% or less) in replicated trials (80). Potential issues include parasitism and predation on bees in nest boxes, with reported mortality and parasitism varying by context (47).",

Patch-scale interventions have shown mixed evidence for broader population responses: one trial found planted lupine patches in apple orchards significantly enhanced the reproductive success of Osmia lignaria, while another found bee numbers and species richness in farmland 50–1,500 m away from planted patches were not higher; two trials reported no or relatively few solitary bees nesting on set-aside fields sown with phacelia or clover [17]. Field margins sown with agricultural nectar and pollen mixes, particularly perennial leguminous plants, attract significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated, grassy, or cropped margins, though their value may degrade over time and require re-sowing every few years [18]. At the wider landscape scale, one large replicated controlled trial found that the average abundance of long-tongued bumblebees on field margins was positively correlated with the number of ‘pollen and nectar’ agri-environment agreements within a 10 km grid square [21, 362]. Additionally, the attractiveness of planted perennial leguminous herbs to bumblebees increased in landscapes with a greater proportion of arable farming, indicating landscape context can influence patch-level outcomes [17].",
