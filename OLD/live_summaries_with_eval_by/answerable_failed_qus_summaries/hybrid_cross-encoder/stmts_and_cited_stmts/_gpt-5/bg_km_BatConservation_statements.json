Artificial hollows cut into trees were used by roosting long‑eared bats in Australia [2047]. Protecting brownfield or ex‑industrial sites: five bat species were recorded within a protected urban wildlife refuge on an abandoned manufacturing site in the USA [953]. Protecting greenfield or undeveloped land in urban areas has no studies evaluating effects on bats identified [1934]. Retaining veteran and standing dead trees as roosting sites has no studies evaluating effects on bats identified [993]. Increasing semi‑natural habitat within gardens has no studies evaluating effects on bats identified [1933]. Planting new hedges has no studies evaluating effects on bats identified [1942]. Providing bat boxes, bat grilles or improvements to roosts has no evidence identified for effects on farmland wildlife [95].",
