However, no studies were found that evaluated the effects of using covers/barriers, grazing, or physically damaging the plants (1775, 1773, 1769). One study found that introducing a parasitic plant could alter the plant community, reduce sedge cover, and increase moss cover and species richness (1777). Another study reported that herbicide application, along with other interventions, changed the plant community but could not prevent increases in shrub cover and prevented increases in plant species richness (1776). Prescribed fire has been shown to increase moss/lichen/bare ground cover in the short term, and lower heather cover, but it can also reduce or limit plant species richness (1774). The effects of cutting or mowing on plant communities were mixed, with some studies showing no significant effect and others reporting changes in community composition and increased cover of some desirable species like Sphagnum moss (1770, 1772). Finally, disturbing the peatland surface was found to affect plant community development, with one study noting an increase in weedy species (1811).",

One study reported the survival of some heather seedlings over a two-year period, whereas another noted that all germinated willow seedlings died within a month [1824]. In terms of shrub cover, two studies indicated that plots sown with shrub seeds developed greater cover of certain shrubs, but another study found that sown plots had similar overall shrub cover to unsown plots [1824]. For overall vegetation cover, two studies reported that plots sown with shrub seeds developed greater total vegetation cover than unsown plots, while another study reported no effect on total vegetation cover from sowing shrub seeds [1824]. The effect on plant species richness varied, with one study reporting an increase, another a decrease, and a third no effect [1824].\\n\\nWhen introducing seeds of herbaceous peatland plants, germination was reported in some cases [1823]. In three studies, wetland-characteristic or peatland-characteristic plants colonized plots where herb seeds were sown [1823]. Three studies found that plots sown with herb seeds developed cover of the sown herbs, while one study found that these plots had similar herb cover to plots that were not sown [1823]. The effect on overall vegetation cover was inconsistent: one study found an increase, another found no effect, and a third found that the effect depended on other treatments [1823]. Similarly, the effect on plant species richness was varied, with two studies finding no effect and two studies reporting inconsistent effects [1823].\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"1824\",\n    \"1823\"\n  ]\n}"

It also led to a higher number of plant species compared to unrestored areas (1804). Multiple other restoration interventions have also been found to increase the cover of mosses, Sphagnum, and herbaceous plants like cottongrass (1803). These interventions have also been reported to increase overall vegetation cover (1803). The plant community in restored bogs was found to be more similar to that of natural bogs than unrestored ones (1803). However, in one study, bogs being restored as fens developed a different plant community compared to natural fens after five years (1803). No studies were found that evaluated the effects of other methods of protecting or preparing peatland vegetation before planting (1842). In the context of tree planting, ground preparation treatments have been found to increase the survival and growth rate of planted trees in six out of seven studies (1263).",

    "relevant_summary": "Studies have looked into the effects of mowing and grazing on fens, offering alternatives to prescribed burning for vegetation management. In terms of vegetation, mowing has been shown to alter the overall plant community composition (1759, 1771). Multiple studies found that mowing increased plant species richness (1759), with one study noting a greater increase in summer-mown plots compared to those mown in spring or autumn (1771). Mowing also increased the cover of plants characteristic of fens or wet meadows (1759) and, in some cases, increased total moss or bryophyte cover (1759). It was found to reduce the cover of certain herbs and shrubs (1759). The impact on vegetation structure, such as height and biomass, was mixed (1759), and one study reported that mown fen meadows had a similar vegetation structure to grazed meadows (1759). Regarding wildlife, one study found that fens managed by mowing had a higher species richness of butterflies than fens managed by cattle grazing (3950). However, recently cut fens, or fens cut in autumn or winter, had fewer large copper butterfly eggs and lower caterpillar survival compared to uncut fens (3950). The timing of mowing can be significant, as one study reported that summer and winter mowing resulted in different plant community types, while another noted similar changes in composition regardless of the season (1771).",

One site comparison study in Poland\\u00a0reported that mowing a degraded fen (along with other interventions) made the plant community more similar to a target fen meadow.\\nCharacteristic plants (5 studies):\\u00a0Four\\u00a0studies (including one replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after) in fens and fen meadows in Switzerland,\\u00a0Germany, the Czech Republic and Poland found that cutting/mowing\\u00a0increased cover of fen- or wet meadow-characteristic plants.\\u00a0One replicated before-and-after study in fens in the UK\\u00a0found that a single mow typically had no effect on cover of fen-characteristic plants. In Poland\\u00a0and the UK, the effect of mowing was not separated from the effects of other interventions.\\nMoss cover (6 studies): Of six studies (five replicated, paired, controlled) in fens or fen meadows, four in Belgium, Switzerland\\u00a0and the Czech Republic\\u00a0found that mowing increased total moss or bryophyte cover. Two studies in Poland\\u00a0and the UK found that a single mow typically had no effect on bryophyte cover (total\\u00a0or hollow-adapted mosses).\\nHerb cover (8 studies): Six replicated studies (three also randomized and controlled) in fens and fen meadows in Belgium, Germany, Poland\\u00a0and the UK found that mowing reduced cover or abundance of at least one group of herbs (including bindweed, reeds, sedges,\\u00a0purple moor grass and grass-like plants overall). One before-and-after study in a fen in Poland\\u00a0found that mowing (along with other interventions) increased sedge cover. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in fen meadows in Switzerland\\u00a0found that mowing had no effect on overall herb cover.\\nTree/shrub cover (3 studies): Of three replicated studies in fens, two in the UK\\u00a0found that a single mow (sometimes along with other interventions) reduced shrub cover. However, one study in Poland\\u00a0found that a single mow had no effect on shrub cover.\\nVegetation structure (7 studies):\\u00a0In the following studies, vegetation structure was measured 6\\u201312 months after the most recent cut/mow. Three replicated studies in fens in Poland\\u00a0and the UK\\u00a0reported that a single mow (sometimes along with other interventions) had no, or no consistent, effect on vegetation height. One replicated, paired, site comparison study in fen meadows in Switzerland\\u00a0found that mowing reduced vegetation height. Three studies (including two replicated, paired, site comparisons) in fen meadows in Switzerland, Poland\\u00a0and Italy\\u00a0found mixed effects of mowing on vegetation biomass (total, sedge/rush, moss\\u00a0or common reed). One replicated, paired, site comparison study in Germany\\u00a0reported that mown fen meadows had similar vegetation structure to grazed meadows.\\nOverall plant richness/diversity (11 studies): Eight studies in fens and fen meadows in the UK, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, the Czech Republic\\u00a0and Poland\\u00a0found that mowing/cutting increased plant species richness (compared to no mowing, before mowing\\u00a0or grazing). Three studies (including two replicated, randomized, paired, controlled) in fens in Poland\\u00a0and the UK\\u00a0found that a single mow (sometimes\\u00a0along with other interventions) typically had no effect on plant species richness and/or diversity.\"\n}"
