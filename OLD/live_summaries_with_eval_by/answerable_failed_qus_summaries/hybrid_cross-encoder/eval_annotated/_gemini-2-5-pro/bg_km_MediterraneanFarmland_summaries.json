When comparing digested and untreated slurry, a Spanish study found similar nitrous oxide emissions, and another study found similar carbon dioxide and methane emissions (1365).\n\nWhen comparing organic to inorganic fertilizers, four studies in Italy and Spain noted higher carbon dioxide emissions from plots with organic fertilizer, with one Spanish study finding similar emissions (1366). In terms of methane, two Spanish studies revealed that more methane was absorbed by soils with organic fertilizer, while two other studies showed similar absorption amounts (1366). For nitrous oxide, three studies, including a meta-analysis, reported lower emissions from plots with organic fertilizer, whereas five studies in Spain found similar emissions (1366). The meta-analysis also indicated lower nitrous oxide emissions after adding solid organic fertilizer, but not liquid organic fertilizer, compared to inorganic fertilizer (1366). Furthermore, one study in Spain found that plots with slurry absorbed methane, while plots with manure emitted it (1366).\n\nRegarding the exclusion of grazers, one study in Spain found more carbon dioxide in the soil of ungrazed plots compared to grazed plots, while a US study found similar amounts (1375).

One replicated, paired, controlled study in a salt marsh in the Netherlands\\u00a0reported that plots fenced to exclude cattle for seven years had lower plant species richness than areas that remained grazed. Two controlled studies (one also replicated and paired) in salt marshes in Germany\\u00a0found that the effect of removing sheep on overall plant species richness depended on the scale of measurement and the grazing intensity used for comparison \\u2013 with inconsistent results across these studies even for similar scales and intensities. One paired, site comparison study of salt marshes in Argentina\\u00a0found that the effect of excluding cattle (along with legal protection) increased plant species richness at lower elevations, but did not significantly affect plant diversity at any elevation.\\n\\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\\n\\nOverall abundance (4 studies): Three studies (two controlled, one before-and-after) in salt marshes in the UK\\u00a0and Denmark\\u00a0reported that excluding livestock for 2\\u20136 years maintained or increased overall vegetation abundance (although in one study, only by a small amount). One controlled study in a salt marsh in Germany\\u00a0found that a paddock left ungrazed for 16\\u201318 years had greater overall vegetation cover than lightly or heavily grazed paddocks, but lower cover than a moderately grazed paddock.\\nIndividual species abundance (11 studies): Eleven studies\\u00a0quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. For example, five studies (four controlled, one before-and-after) on salt marshes in the UK, Denmark, Germany\\u00a0and the Netherlands\\u00a0reported that excluding livestock for 2\\u20138 years reduced (or prevented increases in) cover of saltmarsh grass Puccinellia maritima. However, two controlled studies (one also replicated and paired) on salt marshes in Denmark\\u00a0and Sweden\\u00a0reported greater saltmarsh grass cover in areas fenced to exclude livestock for 1\\u20136 years than in areas that remained grazed. Four studies (three controlled, one before-and-after) on salt marshes in Denmark\\u00a0and Germany\\u00a0reported that excluding or removing livestock for 4\\u201316 years increased cover of sea purslane Halimione portulacoides.\\n\\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE\\n\\nHeight (5 studies): Five controlled studies (two also replicated and paired) in salt marshes in Sweden\\u00a0and Germany,\\u00a0and brackish wet grassland in the UK,\\u00a0found that ungrazed plots (livestock excluded or removed) contained taller vegetation than plots that remained grazed. Vegetation was surveyed after one month, 1\\u20138 years\\u00a0or 16\\u201322 years.\"\n}"
