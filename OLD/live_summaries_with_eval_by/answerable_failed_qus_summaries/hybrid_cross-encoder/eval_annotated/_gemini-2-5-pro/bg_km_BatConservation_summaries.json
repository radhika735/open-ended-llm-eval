    "relevant_summary": "To mitigate the disturbance and loss of bat roosts during building developments, several actions can be taken. One approach is to create alternative roosts, although the success of this is varied. Studies have shown that in some cases bats did not use the alternative roosts provided (949). In other instances, bat boxes or lofts were used at 13-74% of development sites (949). Purpose-built roosts have been found to be used in higher or similar numbers to the original roosts in some cases, and in lower numbers in others (949). It has also been found that new bat boxes or lofts are four times less likely to be used by returning bats than roosts that are retained during development (949).\n\nAnother action is the legal protection of bats through licensing during development. However, a UK review found that 68% of roosts were destroyed under licensed activities (1935). Additionally, 81% of licensees did not carry out post-development monitoring to assess the use of the installed roost structures (1935). Some compensation roosts provided under license are used, with one study finding 5 of 28 were used (1935), and another review finding 31-67% were used (1935).\n\nRetaining existing bat roosts and access points within developments is another option. One study found similar numbers of bats roosting in an attic after access points were retained during renovations (947). A UK review found that two-thirds of retained and modified roosts were used after development, and retained roosts were more likely to be used than newly created ones (947).\n\nFinally, there is the option to provide training on bat ecology and conservation to the building and development sector, but no studies were found to evaluate the effectiveness of this (997). Similarly, no studies were found on the effectiveness of installing sound barriers near roosts (2023).",

In terms of design, three studies found that bats used black bat boxes more often than grey, white, or wooden ones, and one study found higher occupancy rates in concrete boxes compared to wooden ones [1024]. Another study in the USA found that resin bat boxes were occupied more quickly than wood boxes [1024]. Larger bat boxes were found to have higher occupancy rates in one of two studies [1024]. In Spain, bat boxes with two compartments were more frequently occupied than those with one, and in Lithuania, breeding colonies occupied standard and four- or five-chamber boxes while individuals used flat boxes [1024]. Different bat species were found to use different box designs [1024].\n\nRegarding placement, bat box orientation and sun exposure were found to affect occupancy in three studies, although one study found no significant effect of orientation [1024]. Bat box height was found to affect occupancy in two studies, while two other studies found no effect [1024]. Bat boxes placed on buildings had higher occupancy than those on trees in two studies [1024]. Occupancy was also higher in farm forestry sites compared to native forests in Australia, in pine stands over mixed deciduous stands in Poland, and in forest fragments over pasture in Costa Rica [1024]. One study found higher occupancy rates when boxes were installed in areas where bats were already known to roost [1024]. Furthermore, a review in the UK indicated a correlation between the number of bat boxes at a site and the likelihood of occupation [1024]. Lastly, a study in Australia found that 8 of 16 artificial hollows created in trees were used by roosting long-eared bats [2047].",

One of two studies in Spain\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0found higher occupancy rates in larger bat boxes. One study in the USA\\u00a0found that bats used both resin and wood cylindrical bat boxes, but another study in the USA\\u00a0found that resin bat boxes became occupied more quickly than wood boxes. One study in the UK\\u00a0found higher occupancy rates in concrete than wooden bat boxes. One study in the USA\\u00a0found that Indiana bats used rocket boxes more than wooden bat boxes or bark-mimic roosts. One study in Spain\\u00a0found that more bats occupied bat boxes that had two compartments than one compartment in the breeding season. One study in Lithuania\\u00a0found that bat breeding colonies occupied standard and four/five chamber bat boxes and individuals occupied flat bat boxes. Four studies in the USA, UK, Spain\\u00a0and Australia\\u00a0found bats selecting four of nine, three of five, three of four and one of five bat box designs. One study in the UK\\u00a0found that different bat box designs were used by different species. One study in Costa Rica\\u00a0found that bat boxes simulating tree trunks were used by 100% of bats and in group sizes similar to natural roosts.\\nBat box position (11 studies): Three studies in Germany, Spain\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0found that bat box orientation and/or the amount of exposure to sunlight affected bat occupancy, and one study in Spain\\u00a0found that orientation did not have a significant effect on occupancy. Two studies in the UK\\u00a0and Italy\\u00a0found that bat box height affected occupancy, and two studies in Spain\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0found no effect of height. Two studies in the USA\\u00a0and Spain\\u00a0found higher occupancy of bat boxes on buildings than on trees. One study in Australia\\u00a0found that bat boxes were occupied more often in farm forestry sites than in native forest, one study in Poland\\u00a0found higher occupancy in pine relative to mixed deciduous stands, and one study in Costa Rica\\u00a0found higher occupancy in forest fragments than in pasture. One study in the USA\\u00a0found higher occupancy rates in areas where bats were known to roost prior to installing bat boxes. One review in the UK\\u00a0found that bat boxes were more likely to be occupied when a greater number of bat boxes were installed across a site.\"\n}"
