    "relevant_summary": "A study in Rwanda, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of Congo revealed that mountain gorilla populations monitored continuously by veterinarians, in conjunction with other interventions, saw a 168% increase over 41 years (1554). For reintroduced or translocated primates, veterinary screens conducted before release have shown varied outcomes. In one Brazilian study, most reintroduced golden lion tamarins did not survive over seven years, and in a Malaysian study, 90% of reintroduced Müller's Bornean gibbons did not survive, despite pre-release veterinary screens and other interventions (1553). However, other studies noted high survival rates. For example, most reintroduced black lion tamarins in Brazil survived over four months, and translocated orangutans in Malaysia and Indonesia, as well as reintroduced chimpanzees in Liberia, the Republic of Congo, and Guinea, also had high survival rates of over 1-5 years with veterinary screens and other interventions (1553). One study in Uganda reported that a reintroduced chimpanzee repeatedly returned to human settlements despite undergoing pre-release veterinary screens (1553). In Kenya, a translocated olive baboon population was still surviving after 16 years with the application of veterinary screens and other interventions (1553). Conversely, five studies in French Guiana, Madagascar, South Africa, and Vietnam indicated that most reintroduced or translocated primates were presumed to have died after release, despite undergoing veterinary screens (1553). There is no evidence available on the effects of implementing a health program for local communities on primate populations (1557).",
