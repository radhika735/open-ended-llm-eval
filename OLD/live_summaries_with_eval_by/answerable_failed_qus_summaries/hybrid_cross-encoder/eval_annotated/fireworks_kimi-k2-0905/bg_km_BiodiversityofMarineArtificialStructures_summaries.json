    "relevant_summary": "Several interventions can increase invertebrate abundance on subtidal artificial structures based on the evidence from these studies. Creating habitat features is the most consistently effective approach. Creating hole habitats (>50 mm) on structures increased brown crab abundance (action 3434). Creating pit habitats (1–50 mm), along with holes, grooves and environmentally-sensitive material, had mixed effects on invertebrate abundances depending on the species group (action 3455). Creating groove habitats (1–50 mm) similarly had mixed effects on invertebrate abundances (action 3448). Creating grooves and small protrusions, ridges or ledges (1–50 mm) together led to colonization by non-mobile invertebrates (action 3452). \n\nCreating flexible habitats also showed positive effects. Short flexible habitats (1–50 mm) had mixed effects on mobile and non-mobile invertebrate abundances depending on species group and site (action 3450). Long flexible habitats (>50 mm) supported higher biomass (mostly mussels) and non-mobile invertebrate species that were absent from structure surfaces without flexible habitats, though effects varied by species group and survey timing (action 3451).\n\nTransplanting or seeding organisms onto structures increased invertebrate species richness and altered community composition (action 3471). Using textured surfaces (≤1 mm) had mixed effects on non-mobile invertebrate abundance depending on the site (action 3449). \n\nOverall, creating physical habitat complexity through holes, pits, grooves, flexible habitats, and transplanting organisms provides the most reliable interventions for increasing invertebrate abundance on subtidal artificial structures, though effects can vary by species group and environmental conditions.",

Multiple replicated, controlled studies from Australia, the UK, Spain, and Malaysia have consistently shown that created rock pools support higher combined macroalgae, invertebrate, and fish species diversity and richness compared to structure surfaces without pools (Action ID: 3476). Specifically, nine of twelve replicated studies found increased species richness and diversity in created pools, with three studies reporting similar richness to natural rock pools. The pools support macroalgae, mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate, and fish species that are absent from structure surfaces without pools. Additionally, hole habitats and pit habitats on intertidal artificial structures have also been shown to increase combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness and diversity on structure surfaces (Action IDs: 3467, 3475). A before-and-after study in Australia specifically reported that creating pools, along with reducing the slope of a structure, increased the combined macroalgae, invertebrate, and fish species richness on the structure.",

Multiple studies found that grooves combined with small protrusions/ridges/ledges (1-50 mm) increased macroalgae and invertebrate species richness in 6 of 11 studies, while effects on abundance were mixed (Action ID 3474). Pit habitats (1-50 mm depressions) increased species richness in 8 of 12 studies, with higher densities increasing abundance of certain species like periwinkles (Action ID 3475). Small ridges or ledges (1-50 mm elevations) had mixed effects - some studies found no increase in richness while others found positive effects when combined with multiple habitat types (Action ID 3464). Large ridges or ledges (>50 mm) showed more consistent positive effects, increasing species diversity and overall macroalgae, microalgae and invertebrate abundance (Action ID 3465). The effects varied significantly depending on factors such as habitat size and arrangement, shore level, site characteristics, and the presence of additional habitat features like water-retaining covers or environmentally-sensitive materials. Many studies documented that these created habitats supported species that were absent from flat artificial structure surfaces.",

Creating hole habitats (>50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures consistently altered community composition in all three studies examined. This intervention, particularly when combined with other features like grooves, environmentally-sensitive materials, and small ledges, consistently changed the combined macroalgae and invertebrate or mobile invertebrate and fish community composition on and around structures. Using environmentally-sensitive materials also showed consistent effectiveness, with six of eleven studies finding that materials such as shell-concrete, quarried rock, or ECOncreteTM in place of standard-concrete altered the combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition. When combined with texture, grooves, holes, pits, and/or small ledges, these materials consistently changed community composition. Creating pit habitats (1–50 mm) combined with holes, grooves, and environmentally-sensitive material consistently altered community composition. Creating groove habitats (1–50 mm) also consistently altered community composition when combined with other habitat features. Creating textured surfaces (≤1 mm) showed mixed results, with two of three studies finding altered community composition. Creating long flexible habitats (>50 mm) supported different species assemblages compared to structures without flexible habitats. In contrast, ceasing or altering maintenance activities showed less consistent effects, with one study finding no alteration of community composition.",

Creating swimthrough habitats (both small ≤100mm and large >100mm) on subtidal artificial structures has been found to increase fish species richness and abundance, with large swimthrough habitats supporting fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without them. Creating hole habitats (>50mm) on subtidal artificial structures has been shown to alter fish community composition and support fish species that were absent from structures without these features. Long flexible habitats (>50mm) created on subtidal artificial structures have been found to support fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without them, with mixed effects on fish abundance depending on species and survey timing. Managing or restricting harvesting of species on subtidal artificial structures has been shown to result in different fish community composition and higher fish species richness compared with unrestricted structures, with some studies showing higher seabream abundances around structures with harvesting restrictions. Creating artificial reefs with different 3-D structures and materials has been investigated primarily for invertebrate populations rather than fish specifically.",

Several studies focused on creating different habitat features on artificial structures. Long flexible habitats (>50 mm) created on subtidal structures in southeast Australian estuaries supported macroalgae and invertebrate species that were absent from structures without such habitats, with mixed effects on fish and seahorse abundance depending on species and conditions (action 3451). Creating hole habitats (>50 mm) on intertidal structures in Australian estuaries increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness and diversity, supporting species that were absent from structures without added habitat features, though effects on invertebrate abundance were mixed (action 3467). Groove habitats (1-50 mm) on intertidal structures in Australian estuaries showed varied results - some studies found no increase in species richness for macroalgae, mobile or non-mobile invertebrates, while others found grooves supported higher mobile invertebrate species richness than small ledges (action 3473). Short flexible habitats (1-50 mm) on intertidal structures in Australian estuaries altered community composition but decreased overall species richness during low tide, with mixed effects on macroalgal and invertebrate abundance (action 3459). Reducing the slope of intertidal artificial structures in Australian estuaries increased overall species richness when combined with rock pools, though it did not increase macroalgal or invertebrate abundance (action 3461).",

The specific effects depend on the size and arrangement of these features:\n\nFor small-scale features (1-50 mm): Research shows mixed but generally positive effects on overall species richness and diversity. Six of eleven studies found that creating small grooves, ridges, and ledges increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species diversity and richness. These features often support species that are absent from flat structure surfaces and can alter community composition. However, two studies reported that grooves supported higher species richness than ridges or ledges when compared directly.\n\nFor large-scale features (>50 mm): Research is limited but suggests potential benefits for biodiversity. One study found that large ledges increased combined macroalgae, microalgae and invertebrate species diversity, while mixed results were observed for species richness. These features were found to increase the abundance of certain taxa like mussels and limpets, but not barnacles.\n\nEffects on specific taxa: Grooves and small linear features had mixed effects on macroalgal species richness and abundance, with results varying by location, size of features, and shore level. Similar mixed effects were observed for invertebrate communities, with some studies showing increased abundances of certain taxa while others showed no significant changes. Fish communities showed minimal responses to these features, with most studies finding no increase in fish species richness or abundance, though one study observed increased feeding activity of juvenile salmon around structures with large ledges.",

Rock pools were equally effective, with sixteen of seventeen studies showing they supported macroalgae, invertebrate, and/or fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without pools, and thirteen of sixteen studies reporting altered community composition. Hole habitats (>50 mm) also showed strong effectiveness in three studies, altering community composition and supporting unique species. In contrast, groove habitats (1-50 mm) showed mixed results with only two of three studies altering community composition, while small ridges/ledges (1-50 mm) and small swimthrough habitats showed limited effectiveness.

    "relevant_summary": "Besides selecting different construction materials, several surface modification interventions can benefit biodiversity on artificial structures:\n\n**Textured surfaces and micro-features:** Creating textured surfaces (≤1 mm) can alter macroalgae and invertebrate community composition on both subtidal and intertidal artificial structures [3449, 3466].\n\n**Small-scale habitat features:** Creating small protrusions, ridges, or ledges (1-50 mm) provides habitat complexity that can support different macroalgae and invertebrate species [3453, 3452].\n\n**Large-scale habitat features:** Installing large ridges or ledges (>50 mm) on intertidal structures increases species diversity and abundance, particularly enhancing mussel and limpet populations while increasing rockweed abundance [3465].\n\n**Flexible habitats:** Adding short flexible habitats (1-50 mm) alters community composition around artificial structures [3459].\n\n**Slope modification:** Reducing the slope of artificial structures can increase overall species richness and change community composition [3461].\n\n**Maintenance modifications:** Altering or reducing cleaning and maintenance activities on subtidal structures increases macroalgal abundance and can enhance seahorse populations [3447].\n\n**Biological enhancement:** Transplanting or seeding organisms (such as oysters, kelp, corals, or sea urchins) onto artificial structures can establish new populations and enhance biodiversity, with studies showing successful establishment of various marine organisms [3471].\n\n**Natural reef topography:** Creating natural rocky reef topography on artificial structures has been tested, though results show mixed effects on juvenile canopy algae settlement [3446].\n\n**Crevice habitats:** Installing crevice habitats (>50 mm) is proposed as an intervention, though no studies have yet evaluated their effectiveness [3454, 3437].",
