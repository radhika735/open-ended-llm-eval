    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence, several non-lethal methods have been studied for managing human-primate conflict. For crop-raiding primates, changing to crops less palatable to primates (action 1439) has been proposed, though no effectiveness studies were found. Using loud-speakers to broadcast primate alarm calls (1447) or sounds of potential threats like barking dogs and gunshots (1446) have been proposed but lack effectiveness evidence. Humans chasing primates using random loud noise (1449) reduced crop raiding by orangutans in Indonesia and returned gorillas to protected forest areas in Democratic Republic of Congo. Using chili as a deterrent (2492) has shown mixed results with elephants but no specific primate evidence is available. GPS/VHF tracking devices on problem troops to provide early warning to farmers (1443) has been proposed but not studied. Diversionary feeding (2323) reduced nuisance behavior by black bears in two USA studies, though this was not specifically tested on primates. Translocation approaches have been studied for other mammals (2341, 2336) but specific evidence for primates is lacking, with general translocation showing mixed results including high return rates and continued nuisance behavior.",

In the Democratic Republic of Congo, community control was more effective at reducing illegal bushmeat hunting, including primates, compared to nearby national parks. Similarly, in Cameroon, no incidents of gorilla poaching occurred over three years after implementing community control and monitoring of illegal activities, and in Nigeria, there were more gorillas and chimpanzees in areas managed by community conservation organizations. Implementing local no-hunting community policies or traditional hunting bans also proved effective. Studies from China, Democratic Republic of Congo, Belize, Cameroon, and Nigeria showed that primate populations increased following the implementation of local hunting bans, with very few snub-nosed monkeys killed annually in areas where wildlife killing was forbidden, and populations of gorillas, black howler monkeys, drills, and Sclater's monkeys all increasing after hunting prohibitions were established. Strengthening or reinstalling traditional taboos that forbid the killing of primates was found to be effective, with Laotian black crested gibbons occurring at higher densities in areas protected by local hunting taboos compared to sites without such taboos.",

A study in Uganda found that no gorillas were killed over a 21-month period when anti-poaching patrol numbers increased. Training anti-poaching ranger patrols has proven beneficial, with studies in Uganda showing no gorilla deaths over 21 months after game guard training. In Rwanda, areas where game guards received training saw increased numbers of immature gorillas. Providing better equipment to anti-poaching ranger patrols has shown positive results, with studies in DRC and Rwanda finding increased gorilla populations. Implementing monitoring surveillance strategies has demonstrated benefits, with Nigeria studies finding increased observations of gorillas and chimpanzees after implementing law enforcement and monitoring systems. Regular removal of ground snares has shown some benefits, including increased mountain gorilla numbers in patrolled areas.",

    "relevant_summary": "Documented outcomes show mixed results for both primate species legal protection and habitat protection strategies. For species-specific legal protection (Action ID 1524): A before-and-after study in India found rhesus macaque populations increased over 17 years following an export ban. However, studies in Thailand and India showed primate populations declined despite legal protection. In Malaysia, most introduced Müller's Bornean gibbons died despite legal protection, and in Cameroon, drill populations declined at four of five sites despite protection.\n\nFor habitat legal protection (Action ID 1578): Studies in China showed primate numbers increased or no more individuals were killed after areas received legal protection. A study in Kenya found Tana River red colobus monkey and crested mangabey numbers decreased despite legal protection. A study in China showed Hainan gibbon numbers increased by 34% over nine years after habitat protection. In Brazil, most golden lion tamarins did not survive over seven years despite being in a legally protected area, though they reproduced and surviving offspring partly compensated for adult mortality. Studies in Republic of Congo and Gabon found most central chimpanzees and lowland gorillas reintroduced to legally protected areas survived over 4-5 years. A study in Mexico found black howler monkeys in protected areas had lower stress levels than those in unprotected forest fragments.\n\nOverall, the evidence suggests habitat protection may show more positive outcomes than species-specific protection alone, with multiple studies documenting population increases or improved welfare measures when habitats are legally protected.",

For dam construction, creating or preserving primate habitat on islands before dam construction has been suggested (Action 1455). For mining operations, establishing no-mining zones in or near watersheds to preserve water levels and water quality (Action 1452), using 'set-aside' areas of natural habitat for primate protection within mining areas (Action 1453), and minimizing ground vibrations caused by open cast mining activities (Action 1451) are potential mitigation strategies. Reintroducing primates in groups has shown mixed results, with some studies showing population increases while others found declining populations after reintroduction (Action 1567). Translocating mammals away from development sites has been attempted, with limited success as some animals return to their capture sites (Action 2517). Other suggested interventions include restoring habitat corridors (Action 1583), certifying mines and marketing their products as 'primate friendly' (Action 1454), and reusing old roads rather than building new ones (Action 1463).

Educating local communities about primates and sustainable use in Cameroon led to increased drill populations when combined with another intervention (Action ID: 1563). Multimedia campaigns using theatre, film, print media, and discussions have demonstrated significant benefits, including 61-138% increases in black howler monkey numbers over 3-13 years in Belize alongside other interventions (Action ID: 1571). These campaigns also improved attitudes and knowledge about tamarins in Brazil and Colombia, informed large numbers of people about lowland gorillas in the Republic of Congo, and led to the apparent cessation of poaching for diademed sifakas and black and white ruffed lemurs in Madagascar after distributing conservation books in local primary schools. Community involvement in conservation management has mixed but encouraging results. Involving local communities in management showed benefits for black howler monkeys in Belize, with numbers increasing over 13 years when combined with other interventions (Action ID: 1565). A community-based monitoring scheme in Cameroon successfully stopped gorilla poaching incidents when implemented alongside other conservation measures. However, some proposed community-based strategies lack supporting evidence. Paying farmers to cover the costs of non-harmful strategies to deter primates (Action ID: 1429), compensating farmers for produce loss caused by primates (Action ID: 1428), employing hunters in the conservation sector to reduce their impact (Action ID: 1484), creating buffer zones around protected primate habitat (Action ID: 1577), and installing billboards to raise primate conservation awareness (Action ID: 1566) all have no evidence available to assess their effectiveness.",

Involving local communities in management showed benefits for black howler monkeys in Belize, with numbers increasing over 13 years when combined with other interventions (Action ID: 1565). A community-based monitoring scheme in Cameroon successfully stopped gorilla poaching incidents when implemented alongside other conservation measures. However, some proposed community-based strategies lack supporting evidence. Paying farmers to cover the costs of non-harmful strategies to deter primates (Action ID: 1429), compensating farmers for produce loss caused by primates (Action ID: 1428), employing hunters in the conservation sector to reduce their impact (Action ID: 1484), creating buffer zones around protected primate habitat (Action ID: 1577), and installing billboards to raise primate conservation awareness (Action ID: 1566) all have no evidence available to assess their effectiveness.\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"1563\",\n    \"1571\",\n    \"1565\",\n    \"1429\",\n    \"1428\",\n    \"1484\",\n    \"1577\",\n    \"1566\"\n  ]\n}"

Pre-release veterinary screens, when combined with other interventions, showed variable outcomes: most reintroduced golden lion tamarins and 90% of Müller's Bornean gibbons did not survive despite pre-release screening, while most black lion tamarins survived over four months, and translocated orangutans typically survived capture and three months post-translocation. Mountain gorilla populations increased by 168% over 41 years with continuous health monitoring by veterinary staff alongside other interventions. Treatment of parasites showed mixed results: most golden lion tamarins did not survive despite treatment, but 70% of reintroduced chimpanzees survived for at least 3.5-5 years and some populations increased. Quarantine protocols before release showed variable effectiveness with most golden lion tamarins and black-and-white ruffed lemurs not surviving over five years, though more than 80% of reintroduced gorillas survived over ten years. Treatment of sick or injured primates demonstrated similar variability: most golden lion tamarins died despite treatment availability, most chimpanzees survived 1-5 years with some populations increasing, and most orangutans survived capture and release. Overall, veterinary interventions alone showed inconsistent survival improvements, with outcomes varying significantly by species, intervention type, and implementation alongside other management strategies.",

Studies from USA and Canada found some species were more abundant in selectively-logged forests while others were less abundant, with one study showing no consistent differences between selective harvesting and clearcuts (Action 331). For butterflies and moths, reduced impact logging had mixed effects: Brazilian forests managed with RIL had similar community composition and species richness to primary forest but different from pristine forest, with intermediate intensity RIL showing higher butterfly abundance than high or low intensity (Action 3867). Moth species richness in shelterwood harvesting recovered faster than after clearcutting, while thinning showed higher species richness than clearcutting (Action 3871, 3868). For bats, reduced impact logging had smaller effects on abundance than conventional logging, though activity varied by species (Action 989). Primate studies showed variable results: low intensity selective logging had higher primate densities than high intensity logging in Sierra Leone, but similar densities in Uganda studies, with lemur numbers increasing following selective logging in Madagascar (Action 1485). Three reptile studies found mixed effects on lizard abundance with selective logging intensity, but similar overall reptile abundance compared to clearcutting/thinning combinations (Action 3637).",

Improved habitat quality - Community-based mangrove restoration in India increased high-quality mangrove forest area while decreasing degraded forest area (3390). Reduced illegal activities - Community-based wetland management in Senegal resulted in fewer fines for illegal activities like settlement and grazing (3390). Enhanced species protection - Poaching of diademed sifakas and black and white ruffed lemurs ceased after conservation books were distributed in local primary schools (1571), and hoolock gibbon numbers increased 66% over five years with education programs (1571). Better resource management - Community-based fisheries management areas had more abundant scallop populations compared to protected or recreational areas (2242), and fewer farmers removed large carnivores when engaged in community-based land management (2395). Improved conservation behavior - Students' conservation behavior toward Asian horseshoe crabs significantly increased after education programs (2281), and education programs improved attitudes and knowledge about tamarins (1571). Increased awareness - Large numbers of people were informed about lowland gorillas through multimedia campaigns (1571), and visitors' knowledge about primates increased after education programs (1571).",

A study in the Democratic Republic of Congo found that chasing gorillas and using random noise resulted in gorillas returning from plantations to areas near protected forest (Action 1449). Studies on loud noise deterrents for mammals show mixed results - five of six studies found that loud noises reduced crop damage by white-tailed deer, black-tailed deer, and elephants when animals were in the vicinity, while three studies found that regularly sounding loud noises did not repel European rabbits or white-tailed deer (Action 2460). However, there is no evidence available for several primate-specific deterrents: studies on planting favored crops away from primate areas, using unpalatable buffer crops, and changing to less palatable crops all show 'no evidence' status, meaning no studies have directly tested these interventions for primates (Actions 1440, 1438, 1439). Evidence for chili-based deterrents exists for elephants but not specifically for primates (Action 2492).",
