    "relevant_summary": "Evidence from action documents indicates several trawl-gear modifications reduced unwanted fish catch in multiple studies: (1) Combining square-mesh escape panels/windows with size‑sorting grids in bottom trawls reduced unwanted catches of fish, sharks and rays, and total discards in four of five replicated paired/controlled studies across the Gulf of Carpentaria, Indian Ocean and Atlantic Ocean; effectiveness varied by species/size and panel position, and whiting size‑selectivity increased when panels/cylinders were combined with one or two grids in the English Channel (action 2727). (2) Fitting a size‑sorting mesh funnel (sieve net) to shrimp trawls reduced catches of unwanted (non‑commercial/discarded) fish in three replicated paired controlled studies in the North Sea (action 2722). (3) Using topless (coverless) trawls reduced unwanted Atlantic cod and discards of commercial fish species in two of four replicated controlled studies, with size‑dependent effects for haddock and cod in one study (action 2712). (4) Fitting rigid escape windows/panels reduced catches of unwanted flatfish in one replicated paired controlled study in the Baltic Sea (action 2719). (5) Decreasing codend circumference/diameter improved size‑selectivity for several species in four of eight replicated controlled studies and one review, and reduced discarded fish or total discards in some cases but not others across multiple regions (action 2706). (6) Switching to a square‑mesh rather than diamond‑mesh codend reduced non‑commercial unwanted invertebrates in one of two areas, with similar catches in the other, while maintaining similar commercial fish catches and sometimes higher shellfish catches (action 2136).",

The studies also found that in some cases where the total fish biomass or densities were higher in no-fished areas, the effect varied between individual groups of fish based on species family\\u00a0and/or position in the food chain, commercial target and non-target species, fish sizes, depth\\u00a0and habitat types. Eight studies found that inside protected areas prohibiting all fishing there were similar abundances of all fish, and all or most of the individual fish species/groups monitored, compared to fished areas between one and 20 years after implementation. The other sixteen studies\\u00a0found that the effect of prohibiting fishing in protected areas for three to 20 years on fish abundance varied between fish species or groups and on their fished status (fishery target or non-target)\\u00a0and/or position in the food chain. One also found that the effect varied with size or age of the protected areas. Five of six reviews (three systematic) across the world, in the Pacific and/or Atlantic Oceans\\u00a0and in unreported regions\\u00a0found that non-fished marine reserves with one to 27 years of protection had higher abundances of all fish, all fish and invertebrates combined\\u00a0and blue cod\\u00a0compared to fished areas, but there were differences between species/groups and fishing intensity outside reserves. The other review\\u00a0found that fish abundance varied between species in no-take marine reserves between one and 25 years old, and was affected by food chain position, level of exploitation and duration of protection. One replicated study in the Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found a long-term decline in the abundance/presence of eight of 12 shark and ray species inside an established (&gt;15 years) no-fishing protected area, however enforcement was poor. One before-and after, site comparison study in the Pacific Ocean, found no differences in overall fish abundance between a marine reserve closed permanently to fishing for five years and a closed area that was harvested for two years during the same period. One site comparison study in the Coral Sea\\u00a0found that in a no-take zone of an area protected for at least 10 years, fish abundance of four of six fish groups were similar to no-entry and fished zones, but two had lower abundance than the no-entry zone.

Eight of 11 site comparison studies (four replicated, one before-and-after, one paired, and one replicated and paired) in the Tasman Sea, Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, Atlantic Ocean, Java Sea\\u00a0and the Philippine Sea, found that non-fished protected areas had larger fish overall\\u00a0and larger individuals of all or most of the fish species/groups monitored, compared to fished areas, after one to 22 years. The other three studies\\u00a0found similar fish sizes of all or all but one species, compared to fished areas one to 16 years after all fishing was prohibited. Three site comparison studies (one replicated) in the Coral Sea, Caribbean Sea\\u00a0and the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that fish size in protected areas that had not been fished for six to more than 20 years, varied between fish species or food chain groups. One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that red hind grouper were larger, but had similar growth, in an area protected from fishing for three years compared to fished areas.

One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that in non-fished areas protected for one and 24 years, fish grazing rates were higher compared to fished areas.\\n\\n\\u00a0OTHER (15 STUDIES)\\n\\nUse (7 studies): Four of six site comparison studies in the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0and the Tasman Sea\\u00a0found that marine protected areas where all fishing had been prohibited for at least five to 15 years, were used for a large proportion of time by shark and ray species\\u00a0and commercially important reef fish species, compared to fished areas, thus were provided protection from fishing. Two other studies\\u00a0found that time spent inside areas closed to all fishing for 20 years\\u00a0and over 30 years, varied between species and with size for three shark species\\u00a0and with size for giant trevally. One replicated study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that most individuals of five fish species remained inside a marine reserve zone closed to fishing over a nine-year period.\\n\\n\\nCatch abundance (2 studies): One of two site comparison studies in the Mediterranean Sea\\u00a0and Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found that commercial fish catch rates in small-scale traditional fisheries were highest closest to a marine reserve closed to all fishing for 22 years, and decreased with increasing distance from the reserve. The other study\\u00a0found that there was no increase in fish catch rates in commercially landed catch in the five years after a no-fishing zone was implemented in a co-managed protected area.\\nStock biomass (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that the stock biomass (the harvested portion of the population) of reef fish species was highest in enforced protected areas closed to all fishing, compared to various other area management regimes.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\nFishing mortality (2 studies): Two site comparison studies in the North Sea\\u00a0and Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found that prohibiting fishing in protected areas resulted in reduced commercial fishing mortality of corkwing wrasse tagged inside non-fished marine reserves compared to fished areas, and that the overall fishing mortality of grey reef sharks tagged inside protected areas was low.\"\n}"

Eight of 11 site comparison studies (four replicated, one before-and-after, one paired, and one replicated and paired) in the Tasman Sea, Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, Atlantic Ocean, Java Sea\\u00a0and the Philippine Sea, found that non-fished protected areas had larger fish overall\\u00a0and larger individuals of all or most of the fish species/groups monitored, compared to fished areas, after one to 22 years. The other three studies\\u00a0found similar fish sizes of all or all but one species, compared to fished areas one to 16 years after all fishing was prohibited. Three site comparison studies (one replicated) in the Coral Sea, Caribbean Sea\\u00a0and the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that fish size in protected areas that had not been fished for six to more than 20 years, varied between fish species or food chain groups. One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that red hind grouper were larger, but had similar growth, in an area protected from fishing for three years compared to fished areas. One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that young lemon sharks in areas protected from fishing for 20 years had similar growth rates, but lower condition, than sharks in unprotected fished areas.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)\\u00a0\\n\\nBehaviour change (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in the Pacific and Indian Oceans\\u00a0found that surgeonfish and parrotfish inside established protected areas where fishing was prohibited, showed a similar avoidance response to fishing gears as in fished areas, and this increased with increasing fishing intensity outside the protected areas. One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that in non-fished areas protected for one and 24 years, fish grazing rates were higher compared to fished areas.\\n\\n\\u00a0OTHER (15 STUDIES)\\n\\nUse (7 studies): Four of six site comparison studies in the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0and the Tasman Sea\\u00a0found that marine protected areas where all fishing had been prohibited for at least five to 15 years, were used for a large proportion of time by shark and ray species\\u00a0and commercially important reef fish species, compared to fished areas, thus were provided protection from fishing. Two other studies\\u00a0found that time spent inside areas closed to all fishing for 20 years\\u00a0and over 30 years, varied between species and with size for three shark species\\u00a0and with size for giant trevally. One replicated study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that most individuals of five fish species remained inside a marine reserve zone closed to fishing over a nine-year period.\\n\\n\\nCatch abundance (2 studies): One of two site comparison studies in the Mediterranean Sea\\u00a0and Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found that commercial fish catch rates in small-scale traditional fisheries were highest closest to a marine reserve closed to all fishing for 22 years, and decreased with increasing distance from the reserve. The other study\\u00a0found that there was no increase in fish catch rates in commercially landed catch in the five years after a no-fishing zone was implemented in a co-managed protected area.\\nStock biomass (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that the stock biomass (the harvested portion of the population) of reef fish species was highest in enforced protected areas closed to all fishing, compared to various other area management regimes.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\nFishing mortality (2 studies): Two site comparison studies in the North Sea\\u00a0and Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found that prohibiting fishing in protected areas resulted in reduced commercial fishing mortality of corkwing wrasse tagged inside non-fished marine reserves compared to fished areas, and that the overall fishing mortality of grey reef sharks tagged inside protected areas was low.\"\n}"

Spatial–temporal measures include temporary closures, which showed mixed outcomes: cod biomass, survival and length composition did not increase versus fished areas, tagged cod spent about a third of time inside a seasonal spawning closure, real-time closures reduced the annual amount of cod caught, and some targeted fisheries saw increased catch rates after closures (2664); other temporary closures affected non-fish taxa, including reduced lethal turtle strandings and fishery shutdowns when turtle bycatch limits were reached (3545), and for benthic invertebrates produced varied changes in abundance and condition when areas were temporarily closed or reopened (2098). Long-term closures showed mixed fish responses but included reductions in unwanted cod catch when combined with gear-limited areas and reduced overall fishing effort for sandeel (2655). Size-based regulations include minimum landing sizes, where evidence on recruitment and discards was mixed, with some reductions in catches of the youngest fish in one case and persistence of immature fish in landings in another (2735); size limits for recreational species lacked direct evaluations for invertebrates (2274). Gear selectivity modifications offer alternatives to reduce mortality of non-target or undersized fish, such as fitting trawl nets with escape panels/windows and size-sorting grids, which reduced unwanted catches and improved size-selectivity in multiple studies (2727, 2725, 2721).",

Releasing captured fish alive resulted in the majority (76–92%) of several species surviving at least 1 h–5 days, though less than half of smooth skate survived; survival was reduced by injuries related to hooking/capture depth and by longer tow durations; nearly all yelloweye rockfish survived 4 days post-release while canary rockfish survival decreased with increasing capture depth; devilrays survived when brailed aboard from purse seines but not when brought aboard entangled (2691). Establishing handling and release protocols with minimal handling/air exposure led to faster returns to reef/seabed for reef fish, and tracked whale sharks released using an enhanced purse-seine protocol survived at least 21 days with normal movements (2692). Using different hook types reduced hook injuries associated with higher post-release mortality and reduced capture mortality for some unwanted sharks and rays and some non-target billfish, though other studies found no reduction in mortality; some studies reported reduced deep-hooking without mortality reduction (2698). Modifying longline configuration produced mixed survival outcomes for unwanted sharks: one global review reported higher survival on nylon hook attachments for two of three species and lower for one, while one field study found reduced survival on nylon compared to wire (2699). Using hook-and-line instead of other commercial gear produced greater vitality (an indicator of post-release survival) than other gear types (2732).",

In the Mediterranean Sea, site comparisons reported no increase in biomass for some targeted species 2–13 years after closure compared to a fished area, while other studies in this and additional basins recorded higher abundances for subsets of species (e.g., some commercially targeted and non-targeted groups) [2667]. In the Indian Ocean and Gulf of Mexico, among site comparison studies, some found higher abundances for parts of the fish community, while others reported mixed outcomes across species/groups [2667]. In the South Atlantic Ocean, one study found no change in fish species composition relative to fished areas, and among abundance-focused comparisons spanning this and other basins, responses ranged from higher abundances in some commercially exploited species to mixed effects depending on exploitation history [2667]. In the Tasman Sea, a before-and-after study found lower abundances for most species two years after closure in an estuary, while another study in a reserve zone closed to commercial trapping reported abundance patterns that varied over a decade and among fish groups [2667]. In the South China Sea, overall fish density in the wider region increased within five years after reserves limiting commercial fishing were created, alongside shifts in assemblage composition [2667]. Syntheses and multi-region studies of fully non-fished marine protected areas across the Indian, Atlantic, Mediterranean, Pacific, Tasman, Coral, Philippine, and Caribbean seas, as well as the Gulf of Mexico and Sulu Sea, frequently found higher total fish abundance/biomass and higher abundances of many targeted and non-targeted species compared to fished or partially fished areas, though several studies reported similar or species-dependent effects, with variability linked to species group, trophic position, fish size, depth, habitat, and protected area age/size [2682].",

The studies also found that in some cases where the total fish biomass or densities were higher in no-fished areas, the effect varied between individual groups of fish based on species family\\u00a0and/or position in the food chain, commercial target and non-target species, fish sizes, depth\\u00a0and habitat types. Eight studies found that inside protected areas prohibiting all fishing there were similar abundances of all fish, and all or most of the individual fish species/groups monitored, compared to fished areas between one and 20 years after implementation. The other sixteen studies\\u00a0found that the effect of prohibiting fishing in protected areas for three to 20 years on fish abundance varied between fish species or groups and on their fished status (fishery target or non-target)\\u00a0and/or position in the food chain. One also found that the effect varied with size or age of the protected areas. Five of six reviews (three systematic) across the world, in the Pacific and/or Atlantic Oceans\\u00a0and in unreported regions\\u00a0found that non-fished marine reserves with one to 27 years of protection had higher abundances of all fish, all fish and invertebrates combined\\u00a0and blue cod\\u00a0compared to fished areas, but there were differences between species/groups and fishing intensity outside reserves. The other review\\u00a0found that fish abundance varied between species in no-take marine reserves between one and 25 years old, and was affected by food chain position, level of exploitation and duration of protection. One replicated study in the Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found a long-term decline in the abundance/presence of eight of 12 shark and ray species inside an established (&gt;15 years) no-fishing protected area, however enforcement was poor. One before-and after, site comparison study in the Pacific Ocean, found no differences in overall fish abundance between a marine reserve closed permanently to fishing for five years and a closed area that was harvested for two years during the same period. One site comparison study in the Coral Sea\\u00a0found that in a no-take zone of an area protected for at least 10 years, fish abundance of four of six fish groups were similar to no-entry and fished zones, but two had lower abundance than the no-entry zone.

The other three studies\\u00a0found similar fish sizes of all or all but one species, compared to fished areas one to 16 years after all fishing was prohibited. Three site comparison studies (one replicated) in the Coral Sea, Caribbean Sea\\u00a0and the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that fish size in protected areas that had not been fished for six to more than 20 years, varied between fish species or food chain groups. One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that red hind grouper were larger, but had similar growth, in an area protected from fishing for three years compared to fished areas. One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that young lemon sharks in areas protected from fishing for 20 years had similar growth rates, but lower condition, than sharks in unprotected fished areas.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)\\u00a0\\n\\nBehaviour change (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in the Pacific and Indian Oceans\\u00a0found that surgeonfish and parrotfish inside established protected areas where fishing was prohibited, showed a similar avoidance response to fishing gears as in fished areas, and this increased with increasing fishing intensity outside the protected areas.

Two other studies\\u00a0found that time spent inside areas closed to all fishing for 20 years\\u00a0and over 30 years, varied between species and with size for three shark species\\u00a0and with size for giant trevally. One replicated study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that most individuals of five fish species remained inside a marine reserve zone closed to fishing over a nine-year period.\\n\\n\\nCatch abundance (2 studies): One of two site comparison studies in the Mediterranean Sea\\u00a0and Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found that commercial fish catch rates in small-scale traditional fisheries were highest closest to a marine reserve closed to all fishing for 22 years, and decreased with increasing distance from the reserve. The other study\\u00a0found that there was no increase in fish catch rates in commercially landed catch in the five years after a no-fishing zone was implemented in a co-managed protected area.\\nStock biomass (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that the stock biomass (the harvested portion of the population) of reef fish species was highest in enforced protected areas closed to all fishing, compared to various other area management regimes.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\nFishing mortality (2 studies): Two site comparison studies in the North Sea\\u00a0and Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found that prohibiting fishing in protected areas resulted in reduced commercial fishing mortality of corkwing wrasse tagged inside non-fished marine reserves compared to fished areas, and that the overall fishing mortality of grey reef sharks tagged inside protected areas was low.\"\n}"

Establishing temporary fishery closures; one study found no increase in cod spawning stock biomass, survival, or length composition over nine years, but tagged cod spent nearly a third of time inside a closed spawning area during implementation, and real-time area closures reduced annual cod catch (retained and discarded) [2664]. Ceasing or prohibiting all fishing in marine protected areas (no-take zones); multiple studies found higher abundances and larger fish compared to fished areas, and one study found more eggs of four commercially targeted species inside a non-fished reserve than outside [2682]. Setting minimum landing sizes for commercially fished species; one review reported increased swordfish recruitment in one of five fisheries after recommended minimum sizes and catch limits, whereas a replicated study reported most fish landed were immature despite minimum sizes, and other studies showed mixed effects on unwanted catch [2735]. Setting maximum landing sizes for commercially fished species; no studies currently evaluate effects [2736]. Releasing fish that are carrying eggs or live young; no studies currently evaluate effects [2733]. Releasing protected or species of concern alive after capture; replicated studies reported majority short-term survival (76–92%) in several species, with survival influenced by depth-related injuries and tow duration, while some species experienced lower survival or gear-related mortality [2691].",

Six studies\\u00a0found similar fish species/richness between one and 20 years after all fishing was banned in protected areas, compared to fished areas. One systematic review in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans\\u00a0found no difference in species richness between unfished protected areas and fished areas. One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that the effects of prohibiting all fishing on fish species richness/diversity after 15 years varied with the sampling method used.\\n\\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (66 STUDIES)\\n\\nAbundance (64 studies): Thirty of 54 site comparison studies (18 replicated, eight replicated and paired, two before-and-after, one paired and before-and-after, and one replicated and before-and-after) in the Indian Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, Pacific Ocean, Tasman Sea, Coral Sea, Philippine Sea, Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and the Sulu Sea, found that marine protected areas that had been prohibiting all fishing for up to 25 years or more, had higher abundances (density and/or biomass) of all fish (total fish biomass, total fish density), fishery targeted fish species, non-fishery targeted fish species\\u00a0and all or most of the individual fish species/groups monitored, except fish densities (all or most)\\u00a0and non-fishery targeted species, compared to unprotected fished areas and/or partly-fished protected areas. The studies also found that in some cases where the total fish biomass or densities were higher in no-fished areas, the effect varied between individual groups of fish based on species family\\u00a0and/or position in the food chain, commercial target and non-target species, fish sizes, depth\\u00a0and habitat types. Eight studies found that inside protected areas prohibiting all fishing there were similar abundances of all fish, and all or most of the individual fish species/groups monitored, compared to fished areas between one and 20 years after implementation. The other sixteen studies\\u00a0found that the effect of prohibiting fishing in protected areas for three to 20 years on fish abundance varied between fish species or groups and on their fished status (fishery target or non-target)\\u00a0and/or position in the food chain. One also found that the effect varied with size or age of the protected areas. Five of six reviews (three systematic) across the world, in the Pacific and/or Atlantic Oceans\\u00a0and in unreported regions\\u00a0found that non-fished marine reserves with one to 27 years of protection had higher abundances of all fish, all fish and invertebrates combined\\u00a0and blue cod\\u00a0compared to fished areas, but there were differences between species/groups and fishing intensity outside reserves. The other review\\u00a0found that fish abundance varied between species in no-take marine reserves between one and 25 years old, and was affected by food chain position, level of exploitation and duration of protection. One replicated study in the Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found a long-term decline in the abundance/presence of eight of 12 shark and ray species inside an established (&gt;15 years) no-fishing protected area, however enforcement was poor. One before-and after, site comparison study in the Pacific Ocean, found no differences in overall fish abundance between a marine reserve closed permanently to fishing for five years and a closed area that was harvested for two years during the same period. One site comparison study in the Coral Sea\\u00a0found that in a no-take zone of an area protected for at least 10 years, fish abundance of four of six fish groups were similar to no-entry and fished zones, but two had lower abundance than the no-entry zone. One replicated, paired, site comparison study in the Tasman Sea\\u00a0found that in a non-fished marine park zone abundance of commercially targeted fish was higher than partly fished zones but lower than unprotected areas after four to eight years.\\nReproductive success (1 study): One site comparison study in the Mediterranean Sea\\u00a0found more eggs of four commercially targeted fish species inside a non-fished marine reserve enforced for three years than in fished areas outside the reserve.\\nSurvival (1 study): One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that prohibiting all fishing in a marine protected area for three years resulted in similar survival of red hind grouper, compared to fished areas.\\nCondition (20 studies): Two global review studies\\u00a0(one systematic) and two systematic reviews in the Pacific Ocean\\u00a0and the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans\\u00a0found that prohibiting all fishing in marine protected areas for one to 27 years resulted in larger fish overall\\u00a0and larger blue cod\\u00a0compared to fished areas, but there were differences between individual fish families or species. Eight of 11 site comparison studies (four replicated, one before-and-after, one paired, and one replicated and paired) in the Tasman Sea, Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, Atlantic Ocean, Java Sea\\u00a0and the Philippine Sea, found that non-fished protected areas had larger fish overall\\u00a0and larger individuals of all or most of the fish species/groups monitored, compared to fished areas, after one to 22 years. The other three studies\\u00a0found similar fish sizes of all or all but one species, compared to fished areas one to 16 years after all fishing was prohibited. Three site comparison studies (one replicated) in the Coral Sea, Caribbean Sea\\u00a0and the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that fish size in protected areas that had not been fished for six to more than 20 years, varied between fish species or food chain groups. One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that red hind grouper were larger, but had similar growth, in an area protected from fishing for three years compared to fished areas. One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that young lemon sharks in areas protected from fishing for 20 years had similar growth rates, but lower condition, than sharks in unprotected fished areas.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)\\u00a0\\n\\nBehaviour change (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in the Pacific and Indian Oceans\\u00a0found that surgeonfish and parrotfish inside established protected areas where fishing was prohibited, showed a similar avoidance response to fishing gears as in fished areas, and this increased with increasing fishing intensity outside the protected areas. One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that in non-fished areas protected for one and 24 years, fish grazing rates were higher compared to fished areas.\\n\\n\\u00a0OTHER (15 STUDIES)\\n\\nUse (7 studies): Four of six site comparison studies in the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0and the Tasman Sea\\u00a0found that marine protected areas where all fishing had been prohibited for at least five to 15 years, were used for a large proportion of time by shark and ray species\\u00a0and commercially important reef fish species, compared to fished areas, thus were provided protection from fishing. Two other studies\\u00a0found that time spent inside areas closed to all fishing for 20 years\\u00a0and over 30 years, varied between species and with size for three shark species\\u00a0and with size for giant trevally. One replicated study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that most individuals of five fish species remained inside a marine reserve zone closed to fishing over a nine-year period.\\n\\n\\nCatch abundance (2 studies): One of two site comparison studies in the Mediterranean Sea\\u00a0and Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found that commercial fish catch rates in small-scale traditional fisheries were highest closest to a marine reserve closed to all fishing for 22 years, and decreased with increasing distance from the reserve. The other study\\u00a0found that there was no increase in fish catch rates in commercially landed catch in the five years after a no-fishing zone was implemented in a co-managed protected area.\\nStock biomass (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that the stock biomass (the harvested portion of the population) of reef fish species was highest in enforced protected areas closed to all fishing, compared to various other area management regimes.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\nFishing mortality (2 studies): Two site comparison studies in the North Sea\\u00a0and Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found that prohibiting fishing in protected areas resulted in reduced commercial fishing mortality of corkwing wrasse tagged inside non-fished marine reserves compared to fished areas, and that the overall fishing mortality of grey reef sharks tagged inside protected areas was low.\"\n}"

Establishing move-on rules that delay or relocate fishing when mammals are encountered, combined with releasing trapped animals, resulted in fewer short-beaked common dolphins being encircled and killed in the Great Australian Bight [2790]. Establishing temporary fishery closures was associated with fewer lethal strandings of loggerhead and Kemp’s ridley turtles during seasonal shrimp trawl closures in the USA, and swordfish longline fisheries were closed when annual turtle bycatch limits were reached after reopening, limiting further bycatch for the remainder of those years [3545]. For several operational approaches, the evidence base was reported as absent: selectively avoiding unwanted fish based on temperature distribution [2685], using remote tools to detect mammals and altering vessel course or speed [2757], and using human observers onboard vessels to monitor catches and discards [2740].",

Modifying longline configuration showed mixed effects: increasing lead weight or using nylon instead of wire reduced unwanted shark/ray catches in some fisheries or reviews, but one study found no reduction in undersized haddock; survival of unwanted sharks/rays at retrieval was higher on nylon than wire for some species in a review, whereas a field study found reduced survival on nylon vs wire [2699]. Changing bait type often reduced unwanted catches of undersized haddock, Atlantic cod and other non‑target fish in several replicated studies, but had no reduction for pelagic stingray or overall unwanted fish in others; two global reviews found no effect on unwanted shark/ray catches; using different bait did not reduce hooking injuries or increase survival of undersized snapper or sharks/rays, and one study reported increased size‑selectivity for Greenland halibut [2700]. Replacing J‑hooks with circle hooks generally reduced sea turtle bycatch in multiple studies and a review, with similar survival in some studies but fewer deep or swallowed hooks and, in one review, fewer turtle deaths in most of the assessed fisheries; effects varied among fisheries and with bait type [3559]. Evidence for seabird bycatch mitigation on longlines is variable: one Australian study found lower bycatch with bait throwers [291]; a North Pacific trial recorded higher bycatch with a line shooter while a Norwegian trial found no effect [290]; no intervention-based evidence was found for high‑visibility longlines or water cannons [294, 287]. Using non‑ringed circle hooks in a Mediterranean swordfish longline fishery reduced loggerhead turtle catch compared to ringed hooks [3576].",

Alternative designs/configurations of size‑sorting escape grids in trawls improved size‑selectivity for unwanted redfish, Greenland halibut, and target hake in some cases, with other studies showing species‑specific outcomes or no improvement [2728]. Decreasing trawl codend circumference/diameter improved size‑selectivity for haddock, Atlantic cod, whiting, European hake, and red mullet in several studies and a review, though effects varied among species and could be reduced for one species [2706]. In encircling nets, transparent netting panels improved size‑selectivity for one of four commercial fish species [2703]. Modified traps/pots with square‑mesh escape windows or larger mesh improved size‑selectivity for Atlantic cod, black sea bass, and most species tested, though one study found no effect for panga [2702]. Adding moving stimulator devices alongside square‑mesh escape panels improved cod size‑selectivity for one of three device types in the Baltic Sea [2729]. Some modifications showed no improvement: reducing the main trawl body size did not improve size‑selection of cod and haddock [2705], and LED lights on a size‑sorting grid did not improve size‑selectivity for long rough dab, Atlantic cod, haddock, and redfish [2695].",
