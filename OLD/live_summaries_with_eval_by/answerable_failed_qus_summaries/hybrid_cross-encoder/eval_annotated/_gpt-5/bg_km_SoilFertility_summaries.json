    "relevant_summary": "Evidence from action documents indicates multiple practices associated with increases in soil organic matter or soil organic carbon on agricultural land: Including legumes or forage in crop rotations increased soil organic matter and soil organic carbon in several studies, though a few reported mixed or lower effects (857). Growing cover crops as living mulches or between rows increased soil organic matter in two controlled trials, with one trial finding no effect (897). Growing cover crops in fallow periods improved soil structure and nutrient retention, with studies reporting increased soil carbon and, in several trials, increased nitrogen and carbon under cover crops, although some European studies found no marked effect on soil organic matter (898). Applying manures and agricultural composts increased soil organic carbon in multiple studies and increased soil organic matter in one controlled, randomized, replicated study, while some studies found no effect on organic matter (911). Applying composts (not otherwise specified) at high rates increased soil organic matter and microbial biomass in a controlled, randomized, replicated trial (889). Incorporating fresh plant material or crop remains (e.g., straw) increased soil organic carbon across multiple studies and, in some cases, improved aggregation and reduced nitrate leaching (910). Retaining crop residues increased soil organic carbon and nitrogen in two randomized, replicated trials (907). Reduced tillage increased soil organic matter relative to conventional tillage in multiple replicated studies and a meta-analysis, though some studies found similar levels (1371). No-tillage increased soil organic matter relative to tilled soils in many replicated studies and a meta-analysis, with some studies finding mixed or similar results (1369). Changing tillage practices toward reduced or no-till increased soil organic carbon across numerous studies and often maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure, though results varied by context (906).",

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done.

Mixed organic–inorganic amendments raised soil organic carbon and nutrients in several trials, with manure alone also boosting carbon; one trial found inconsistent nutrient effects [902]; incorporating plant material increased soil carbon across multiple studies and sometimes increased aggregate size, and straw combined with NPK raised carbon [910]; retaining residues increased soil organic carbon and nitrogen, sometimes only when fertilizer was applied [907]. Straw addition reduced soil loss in one study, with mixed erosion effects depending on soil type [910]; residue retention reduced water runoff, increased water storage and reduced erosion, though some soil physical properties showed mixed responses and tillage influenced erosion when residues were removed [907]; mixed amendments reduced the size of cracks in dry soil compared to inorganic fertilizer alone or no fertilizer [902]. Nitrogen levels rose with compost or straw in several studies, and straw incorporation reduced nitrate leaching, although processed wastes showed mixed nutrient results and site effects were mixed in some comparisons [910]. Yields increased with mixed manure–inorganic amendments for maize [902]; barley yield rose with straw, and earlier incorporation of crop remains increased grain yields in one trial [910]; retaining residues increased yields, sometimes only with fertilizer and no-tillage [907]. Incorporating allelopathic plant remains sometimes reduced weeds relative to weeded or unweeded controls but effects varied by year, weed group or residue; suppression could be short-lived; crop growth was sometimes inhibited but could be mitigated by timing; yield effects were positive, negative or mixed, and profit exceeded unweeded but not weeded controls in one study [728]. In a salt marsh, adding organic alginate increased smooth cordgrass density and later plant height, while biomass after 52 weeks was similar to unamended plots [3244].",

Growing cover crops in empty fields reduced nitrate leaching in one study and improved nutrient retention and soil structure in others [898]. Reduced or no-tillage showed reduced soil loss and runoff in several trials, and one controlled, replicated trial found less nitrate in no-till compared to conventional tillage, while conventionally tilled soil lost more nitrate [906]. Adding slurry increased nitrate leaching in some replicated, randomized, controlled studies; less nitrate was leached with surface application compared to injection, and with lower slurry application rates [1380]. Applying farmyard or poultry manure reduced nutrient loss and increased nitrogen levels in some randomized, replicated studies, but one controlled, replicated study found higher nitrate leaching [911].",

Retaining crop residues increased yields in two trials, with one trial finding this only when combined with fertilizer application and no‑tillage (907). Incorporating fresh plant material or crop remains (e.g., straw) increased barley yields in Denmark and raised grain yields when residues were incorporated earlier in the season in the Philippines (910). Adding mulch increased yields in two trials when either a live mulch or a vegetation barrier plus mulch was used (887). Growing cover crops led to higher tomato yields in one replicated trial (898). Using green manures increased grain yields in a controlled, randomized, replicated study (908). Applying organic processing wastes or their composts increased barley yield when molasses were added (891). Applying manures or agricultural composts increased crop yields in four controlled, replicated studies, with one study finding higher yields when combined with cover crops (911). Applying composts (not otherwise specified) at high rates increased fruit yield in one controlled, randomized, replicated trial (889).",

Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion.

Mixed organic–inorganic amendments frequently increased microbial diversity/activity, nutrients, and organic carbon, and improved dry-soil physical condition compared with inorganic-only inputs [902].

    "relevant_summary": "Evidence on low‑input/organic systems reports mixed outcomes across taxa: For bats, farms or grasslands with few or no chemical inputs had higher overall bat activity than high‑input sites in Portugal and Germany, coffee agroforestry with few/no chemicals had higher diversity of insect‑eating bats (but not fruit/nectar‑eating bats) in Mexico, and bats in Colombian silvopastoral areas without chemicals had higher body weight and condition; farms using fewer/no chemicals also showed different bat community composition compared to high‑input farms [2013]. Comparing organic vs conventional farms, multiple studies found either no difference in bat species richness or higher richness on organic farms in some cases; bat activity was sometimes higher on organic farms (overall activity, feeding activity, Brazilian free‑tailed bat activity, and activity of some species), with other studies finding no difference; higher activity of Myotis spp. over water/rivers and for some species over organic fields was also reported [961]. For butterflies and moths, several studies found greater species richness and abundance on organic arable farms than conventional, sometimes increasing with time since conversion, while other studies found similar richness/abundance; in one before‑and‑after study, two butterfly species decreased after conversion alongside other management changes; effects varied with landscape context and farm age in multiple studies [3907]. For mammals, reducing pesticide/fertilizer use did not increase small mammal species richness or use of field margins in Argentina; one UK/Italy study found increased wood mouse abundance with organic farming, while another found no increase for European hare [2539]. For conversion to organic agriculture/aquaculture near peatlands, no studies were found assessing effects on peatland vegetation [1785].",

One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done.

Growing cover crops increased microbial biomass in several studies, with five replicated, randomized, controlled studies finding more microbial biomass and one study reporting inconsistent differences; one trial found greater microbial biomass under ryegrass than a ryegrass/vetch mix [1345, 898]. In perennial systems, cover or ground covers increased microbial biomass in some or all comparisons across four replicated studies [2304]. Reduced tillage increased microbial biomass in many comparisons (11 of 15 studies), though some studies found less or no difference compared to conventional tillage [1371, 2307]. No-tillage sometimes increased, sometimes decreased, and sometimes did not change microbial biomass, though several studies reported higher microbial biomass without tillage [2306]. Grass buffer strips increased microbial biomass in one replicated, randomized, controlled study [2308]. Adding sewage sludge produced similar microbial biomass to controls in two studies [2303]. Including legumes in rotations showed mixed effects on microbial biomass (more in some comparisons, less in others) [2305, 1368].",
