    "relevant_summary": "Several habitat enhancement interventions can increase invertebrate abundance on subtidal artificial structures. Creating hole habitats (>50 mm) showed mixed effects on invertebrate abundances, with one study finding increased abundance of brown crabs but not other mobile invertebrates, while another reported mixed effects depending on species group (action 3434). Creating short flexible habitats (1-50 mm) had mixed effects on mobile and non-mobile invertebrate abundance, varying by survey week, species group, flexible habitat length, or site (action 3450). Creating textured surfaces (≤1 mm) produced mixed effects on non-mobile invertebrate abundance depending on the site (action 3449). Creating long flexible habitats (>50 mm) resulted in mixed effects on mobile and non-mobile invertebrate abundance depending on species group and survey week, or flexible habitat length and density, with one study finding decreased mussel abundance on structure surfaces but that the flexible habitats themselves supported higher biomass, mostly mussels (action 3451). Transplanting or seeding organisms showed positive results, with one study finding transplanting sea urchins reduced non-native sea mat cover on kelps, and another reporting that transplanting corals increased coral cover on structure surfaces (action 3471). Creating groove habitats (1-50 mm) had mixed effects on invertebrate abundances depending on species group (action 3448). Creating pit habitats (1-50 mm) also had mixed effects on invertebrate abundances depending on species group (action 3455). Different artificial reef structures and materials showed varying results, with some studies finding no differences in invertebrate abundances between different reef structures and materials, while others found specific materials like oyster shell bags recruited more oysters and ribbed mussels compared to \"ReefBall\" breakwaters (action 2259). Ceasing or altering maintenance activities showed limited effects on overall abundance but one study found reducing the cleaning area increased seahorse abundance on structure surfaces (action 3447). Creating combinations of grooves and small protrusions, ridges or ledges (1-50 mm) had mixed effects on combined macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate abundance depending on surface orientation (action 3452).",

Rock pools supported macroalgae, mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate and/or fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without pools (Action 3476). Combined macroalgae, invertebrate and fish species richness in created pools was similar to natural rock pools in some cases (Action 3476). One before-and-after study reported that creating pools, along with reducing the slope of a structure, increased the combined macroalgae, invertebrate and fish species richness on the structure (Action 3476). Rock pools created on intertidal artificial structures were used by sea slugs, urchins, octopuses, macroalgae, invertebrates and fishes (Action 3476).

    "relevant_summary": "Based on multiple studies, creating linear depressions (grooves) and elevations (ridges/ledges) on intertidal artificial structures has varied effects on biodiversity. Linear depressions (groove habitats 1-50mm) show mixed effects on community composition, with two of three studies finding no alteration to combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition, though grooves supported species absent from structure surfaces without grooves (Action 3473). For species richness and diversity, three of six studies found that groove habitats increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness and/or diversity, while two studies found no increase and one had mixed effects depending on site (Action 3473). Grooves supported higher species richness than small ridges or ledges created between them in some studies (Action 3473). Linear elevations (small ridges/ledges 1-50mm) generally showed less positive effects, with one of two studies finding no increase in combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness, and studies consistently finding that small ridges supported lower species richness than grooves created between them (Action 3464). Large ridges/ledges (>50mm) showed more positive results, with one of two studies reporting increased combined macroalgae, microalgae and invertebrate species diversity when combined with grooves and small protrusions (Action 3465). When grooves and small ridges/ledges are created together, six of 11 studies found increased species diversity and/or richness, while five studies had mixed effects depending on various factors including depth/height, shore level, and site (Action 3474). For population abundance, effects were similarly mixed, with some studies showing increased abundances while others showed no effect or mixed results depending on the specific organisms and environmental conditions (Actions 3473, 3464, 3465, 3474).",

They also supported mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate and/or fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without added habitat features. 3) Creating long flexible habitats (>50 mm): Both studies found that long flexible habitats created on subtidal artificial structures supported macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate or fish species that were absent from on and around structure surfaces without flexible habitats (Action ID 3451). 4) Creating grooves and small protrusions/ridges/ledges: One of two studies found that groove habitats and small ledges created on a subtidal artificial structure, along with holes and environmentally-sensitive material, altered the combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition and supported non-mobile invertebrate species that were absent from structure surfaces without added habitat features (Action ID 3452). Less consistently effective interventions included creating textured surfaces (2 of 3 studies showed effects on community composition), creating groove habitats alone, creating pit habitats, and creating short flexible habitats. Harvesting restrictions showed effects on fish community composition but had limited evidence.

    "relevant_summary": "Multiple conservation actions for artificial structures have been studied in Australian estuaries, focusing on habitat enhancement and organism transplantation approaches. Creating long flexible habitats (>50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures has been examined in three studies in southeast Australian estuaries, with outcomes showing that these habitats supported macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate or fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without flexible habitats (action 3451). The long flexible habitats were found to be used by seahorses and had mixed effects on fish species richness and abundance around structures, depending on fish presence when habitats were created (action 3451).\n\nCreating hole habitats (>50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures was studied in three Australian estuarine sites, demonstrating that holes (along with rock pools) supported macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate species absent from structure surfaces without added habitat features, and increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species diversity and richness (action 3467). These hole habitats were observed being used by sea slugs, urchins and octopuses, though they had mixed effects on limpet abundance depending on shore level and site (action 3467).\n\nCreating groove habitats (1-50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures has been extensively studied with seven studies conducted in southeast Australian estuaries. The outcomes showed that grooves supported macroalgae, mobile and non-mobile invertebrate species that were absent from structure surfaces without grooves, and grooves supported higher species richness than small ridges or ledges created between them (action 3473). However, grooves did not consistently increase combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition or abundance on structure surfaces (action 3473).\n\nTransplanting or seeding organisms onto intertidal artificial structures was examined in seven Australian estuarine studies, with outcomes showing that transplanted oysters supported macroalgae, mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate and fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without transplanted oysters (action 3472). Transplanting oysters had mixed effects on combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness and diversity, depending on site and presence of grooves and small ridges on surfaces, and increased mobile invertebrate species richness (action 3472).\n\nCreating short flexible habitats (1-50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures was studied in one Australian estuarine site, with outcomes showing altered combined macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate community composition, but decreased combined macroalgae, invertebrate and fish species richness during low tide (action 3459).\n\nUsing environmentally-sensitive materials on both intertidal and subtidal artificial structures has been studied in Australian estuaries, with outcomes showing that sandstone in place of basalt had mixed effects on community composition depending on site, while reduced-pH-concrete surfaces supported species absent from standard-concrete surfaces (action 3469, 3470).\n\nReducing the slope of intertidal artificial structures was examined in Australian estuarine studies, with outcomes showing that slope reduction (along with creating rock pools) increased combined macroalgae, invertebrate and fish species richness, but did not increase macroalgal, oyster or mobile invertebrate abundance (action 3461).\n\nTransplanting organisms onto subtidal artificial structures was studied in one Australian estuarine site, with outcomes showing that transplanting sea urchins reduced cover of non-native sea mat on kelps growing on the structure (action 3471).",

    "relevant_summary": "Creating linear habitat features such as grooves, ridges or ledges on intertidal artificial structures produces varied effects on biodiversity. Community composition studies show that creating groove habitats and small ridges/ledges can alter combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition, with effects depending on site-specific factors, the presence of water-retaining and light-shading covers, and the size and arrangement of features (Action 3474). Multiple studies found that these linear features support species that were absent from structure surfaces without grooves and ridges/ledges (Action 3474).\n\nFor species richness and diversity, six of 11 studies found that creating groove habitats and small ridges/ledges increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species diversity and/or richness on structure surfaces (Action 3474). However, effects varied depending on depth/height of grooves and ridges, shore level, species group and site (Action 3474). Comparative studies found that grooves supported higher species richness than small ridges or ledges created in between them, though species diversity in grooves versus ridges varied depending on groove depth (Action 3473).\n\nPopulation abundance responses were mixed across studies. Two of six studies found that creating groove habitats and small ridges/ledges did not increase combined macroalgae and invertebrate abundance, while two found increases when features were partially-covered with water-retaining and light-shading covers or combined with large ledges (Action 3474). For invertebrates specifically, five of seven studies found mixed effects on mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate, limpet, mussel, juvenile oyster and barnacle abundances, depending on feature depth/height, presence of large ledges or covers, shore level, and site (Action 3474).\n\nFish responses showed that creating groove habitats and small ridges/ledges generally did not increase fish species richness or abundance, with two of three studies finding no increase in fish species richness (Action 3474). However, behavioral effects included increased feeding activity for juvenile salmon and increased time benthic fishes spent interacting with structure surfaces (Action 3474). Large ridges or ledges (>50 mm) showed different patterns, with studies finding increased abundance of mussels or limpets but not barnacles, and increased rockweed abundance (Action 3465).\n\nGroove habitats specifically were found to be colonized by microalgal species and were used by mussels and periwinkles (Actions 3474, 3473). The effectiveness of linear habitat features appears to depend heavily on design parameters including size, arrangement, depth, and the presence of additional features or covers.",

Action 3448 showed that groove habitats (1-50 mm) created along with holes, pits and environmentally-sensitive material increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species diversity in Israel. Action 3455 found that pit habitats (1-50 mm) created with holes, grooves and environmentally-sensitive material increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species diversity on structure surfaces in Israel. Action 3456 demonstrated that large adjoining cavities or swimthrough habitats (>100 mm) increased overall fish species richness on and around structure surfaces in the USA. Action 3470 showed that using ECOncrete material along with creating texture, grooves, holes, pits and/or small ledges increased species diversity and/or richness on and around structures in three studies across multiple locations. Action 3471 found that transplanting oysters onto subtidal artificial structures increased combined invertebrate and fish species richness and diversity on and around structure surfaces in the USA.

The evidence indicates that combinations of multiple habitat features rather than single features, and the use of specialized materials like ECOncrete, appear most consistently effective at enhancing species richness.\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"3434\",\n    \"3452\",\n    \"3448\",\n    \"3455\",\n    \"3456\",\n    \"3470\",\n    \"3471\"\n  ]\n}"

Creating natural rocky reef topography did not increase combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness on structure surfaces and had mixed effects on barnacle and mobile invertebrate abundances depending on the site (Action 3435). Creating pit habitats showed variable effectiveness, with studies finding that pit creation did not alter community composition in some cases, did not increase species richness in some studies, and decreased combined macroalgae and invertebrate abundance in one study (Action 3475). The effects of pit habitats were frequently site-dependent and varied based on pit size and arrangement. Creating textured surfaces had mixed effects on species richness depending on the type of texture created and the site, and some studies found no increase in macroalgal or invertebrate abundance on structure surfaces (Action 3466). Reducing slope showed limited benefits, with one study finding no increase in macroalgal abundance or oyster and mobile invertebrate abundance on structure surfaces (Action 3461). Creating hole habitats showed some limitations, with studies reporting no increase in macroalgal abundance and mixed effects on limpet abundance depending on shore level and site (Action 3467). The effectiveness of topographical complexity modifications appears to be highly context-dependent, with results varying significantly based on site conditions, specific design parameters, and target species.",

Creating textured surfaces (≤1 mm) on artificial structures can alter community composition on structure surfaces, with studies showing changes in macroalgae and invertebrate communities and support for species absent from non-textured surfaces (Action ID 3449, 3466). Small protrusions (1-50 mm) can be added to artificial structures, which have shown mixed effects on macroalgal abundance depending on species (Action ID 3453). Creating grooves and small protrusions, ridges or ledges (1-50 mm) together on artificial structures can alter community composition and increase species richness and diversity, supporting species absent from structures without these features (Action ID 3452). Short flexible habitats (1-50 mm) can be installed on structures to alter community composition (Action ID 3459). The slope of artificial structures can be reduced to increase species richness when combined with other modifications like creating rock pools (Action ID 3461). Groove habitats (1-50 mm) can be created on structures to alter community composition and increase species diversity, supporting species groups not found on unmodified structures (Action ID 3448). Pit habitats (1-50 mm) can be created on artificial structures to alter community composition and increase species diversity (Action ID 3455). Natural rocky reef topography can be created on structures, though effects on biodiversity vary (Action ID 3446). Organisms can be transplanted or seeded onto artificial structures to alter community composition and increase species richness and diversity (Action ID 3471). Green infrastructure including green roofs can be established in urban areas, though they may have lower species richness compared to urban parks (Action ID 3837). Textured coatings can be applied to specific structures like turbines, though effects on wildlife activity may be limited (Action ID 1957).",

Short flexible habitats (1-50 mm) can be installed on structures to alter community composition (Action ID 3459). The slope of artificial structures can be reduced to increase species richness when combined with other modifications like creating rock pools (Action ID 3461).
