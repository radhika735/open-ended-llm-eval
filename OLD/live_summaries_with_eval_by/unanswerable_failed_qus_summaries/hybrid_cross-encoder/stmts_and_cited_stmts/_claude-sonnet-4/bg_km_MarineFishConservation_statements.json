      "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from the action documents, several methods have been demonstrated to reduce unwanted catch in commercial fisheries. Using larger mesh sizes showed the strongest evidence for effectiveness, with 15 of 20 studies finding that larger mesh nets reduced catches of unwanted fish compared to standard/smaller mesh sizes (Action ID: 2697). This method also improved size-selectivity for fish species in 19 of 21 studies. \n\nModifying net configuration also showed promise, with three of four studies finding that modifications to gillnet configurations reduced unwanted catch of various fish species (Action ID: 2701). For trap fisheries, increasing mesh size and fitting escape frames both appeared to reduce unwanted undersized mud crab catches in controlled studies (Action IDs: 2148, 2146).\n\nMore technologically advanced approaches showed mixed but promising results. Technology to communicate near real-time catch information to fishers reduced unwanted catch or discards in two of three cases (Action ID: 3826). Setting catch limits or quotas for non-target species reduced unwanted catch in two of three cases and reduced unwanted halibut in one study (Action ID: 2693).\n\nCombined gear modifications also demonstrated effectiveness. Trawl nets with escape grids and square mesh codends caught fewer unwanted fish species compared to diamond mesh codends with no grid (Action ID: 2725).",
