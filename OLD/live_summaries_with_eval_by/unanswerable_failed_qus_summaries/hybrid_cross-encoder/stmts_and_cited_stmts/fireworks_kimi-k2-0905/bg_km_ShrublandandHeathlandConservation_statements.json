Specifically, action 1665 \"Plant vegetation to act as a buffer to exclude pollution\" and action 1618 \"Create buffer zones beside roads and other transportation corridors\" both report that no studies were found that evaluated these actions on shrublands. This means that there is currently no scientific evidence available to determine whether planting vegetation buffers next to roads is effective or has any harmful impacts on shrubland ecosystems.",
