Providing bat boxes, bat grilles, or roost improvements has no captured evidence for effects on farmland wildlife [95]. Managing microclimate: a before-and-after study in Spain found more bats in two artificial roosts after reducing internal temperatures [2052]; in the UK, heated bat boxes were used by common pipistrelles at one of seven sites and not by maternity colonies, and none of 12 heated boxes in churches were used by displaced Natterer’s bats [2052]. Creating artificial caves/hibernacula: a UK study found bat numbers using an artificial hibernaculum increased in each of nine years after construction; another UK study recorded use of an artificial cave by a small number of brown long-eared bats; studies in Germany and the UK recorded use of artificial hibernacula by up to four species [2049]. Within developments, use of alternative roosts was mixed: two replicated studies (USA, UK) found no use of provided bat houses or a purpose-built bat wall after exclusion, while other studies/reviews reported bat boxes or bat lofts/barns used at 13–74% of sites and maternity use at one of 19 sites; in five before-and-after studies, three reported similar or higher use of purpose-built roosts after original roosts were destroyed and two reported lower use; a UK review found replacement roosts were four times less likely to be used than roosts retained during development [949]. In transport structures, a USA review found that spaces created in road bridges were recolonized in similar or greater numbers than original roosts at four of eight sites [1967].",
