Threshold-based spraying regimes increase natural enemy numbers, with one study showing effects lasting up to three weeks (Action 750). Altering insecticide timing to earlier application results in higher natural enemy populations compared to later applications (Action 723). Incorporating parasitism rates into spraying decision thresholds maintains acceptable pest damage levels while supporting biological control (Action 726). Reducing general pesticide, herbicide and fertilizer use increases both species richness and abundance of beneficial insects including butterflies, moths and their larvae across multiple agricultural systems (Action 3897). Using chemicals to attract natural enemies shows mixed results, with five of thirteen studies finding increased natural enemy populations, though effects vary between enemy groups and locations (Action 754). These strategies collectively reduce pesticide applications needed and production costs while maintaining pest control effectiveness and crop yields.",

Cultural practices involve planting crops in spring rather than autumn, which can reduce weed pressure (Action 137), and establishing competitive plant species that suppress weeds through natural competition (Action 722). Crop rotations, particularly sequences like canola-wheat compared to wheat-wheat, have shown effectiveness in reducing weed biomass (Action 1396). Leaving cultivated but uncropped margins or plots can help manage weed populations while providing wildlife benefits (Action 562). Additionally, using mixed pasture systems rather than monocultures has demonstrated reduced weed presence (Action 721). These approaches offer alternatives to chemical herbicide use while maintaining agricultural productivity.",

Five of six studies found higher abundance of butterflies, moths, macro-moths along hedgerows compared to beetle banks, grass margins without hedgerows, or field interiors. One study found reptile communities in cultivated areas with hedges were more similar to forest communities than areas without hedges. Beetle Banks - Multiple UK studies show beetle banks provide benefits to farmland biodiversity. Fourteen reports from eight studies found beetle banks provide some benefits to farmland biodiversity. Five reports found positive effects on invertebrate densities and higher ground beetle density and species diversity in spring and summer. One replicated study found beetle banks had higher densities of harvest mouse nests compared to field margins. However, effects varied between different invertebrate groups, with some studies finding lower invertebrate densities or no difference compared to other habitats. Alley Cropping - One controlled study from Canada found that intercropping with trees resulted in higher diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in sandy-loam soils. Field Size Reduction - One Canadian study found that agricultural landscapes with smaller fields had higher activity of six of seven bat species compared to landscapes with larger fields. The evidence shows these linear features generally enhance biodiversity, though effectiveness can vary by species group, season, and habitat type.",

Creating beetle banks (action 729) has been shown to increase predator numbers both within the banks themselves and in adjacent crops. Growing non-crop plants that produce chemicals attracting natural enemies (action 724) consistently resulted in higher numbers of natural enemies and decreased pest populations across multiple studies in different countries. Tree canopy management actions: Isolating colonies of beneficial ants (action 773) specifically targets canopy enhancement, with one study from Australia showing that predatory ants occupied more cashew trees when colonies were kept isolated, resulting in lower pest damage and higher yields. Diversifying ground vegetation and canopy structure in the habitat around woody crops (action 3526) affects the overall habitat structure that supports natural enemies. Planting new hedges (action 752) provides habitat for natural enemies, though effects vary between hedge species and natural enemy groups. These actions demonstrate that farmers have options for enhancing natural enemies both at ground level and within the tree canopy of perennial cropping systems.",

Nine studies found that planting competitive species (clovers, fescues, ryegrass, other grasses and turnip) reduced weed plant weight or ground cover, with five studies also showing reduced weed reproduction and survival. Cover crops provided additional benefits including improved soil structure, nutrient retention, increased soil organic carbon and matter, and enhanced biodiversity through more diverse nematode communities and greater microbial biomass.\n\nChemical-based approaches using plant residues with allelopathic properties showed mixed results. Six studies found that incorporating allelopathic plant remains reduced weed growth in some cases, but effects varied between years, weed groups, residue types, and application timing. Two studies found the weed-suppressing effects lasted only a few days to weeks. Chemical impacts on crops included inhibited growth in some cases, though timing adjustments could minimize negative effects. Yield effects were mixed, with studies showing positive, negative, or variable results depending on comparison groups.\n\nDirect herbicide applications showed high effectiveness for specific invasive species - triclopyr TEA achieved 100% kill rates on water primrose at 0.25% concentration, glyphosate achieved 97-100% mortality depending on additives used, and halosulfuron-methyl significantly reduced water primrose coverage without harming rice plants. However, herbicide use showed potential negative impacts including reduced grass diversity, increases in broadleaved plants, and negative effects on non-target organisms like green dock beetles from asulam herbicide.",

When using threshold-based spraying regimes instead of preventative schedules (action 750), two of four randomized studies found similar yields compared to conventional spraying, while two studies found mixed effects depending on site, year, pest stage/type or control treatment. For delayed herbicide use (action 774), one study found lower yields and another found no effect. Delaying mowing or grazing on pasture/grassland (action 727) did not directly measure crop yield effects but found variable impacts on natural enemies and pests. Using grazing instead of cutting for pasture management (action 885) showed one of four studies found lower yields, two found no effect, and one found variable results depending on species.

Studies have demonstrated that incorporating plant remains that produce weed-controlling chemicals (allelopathy) can reduce weed growth, with three out of six studies from North America finding a reduction in weed growth when amended soils were compared with weeded controls. Two studies found that using mixed pasture systems reduced weeds compared to monoculture pasture. Converting to organic farming showed mixed results for weed control, with three randomized, replicated, controlled studies from the USA finding more weeds in organically farmed fields, though effects varied between crops and years. Delaying herbicide use was found to increase weed populations in one randomized, replicated, controlled study. Reducing tillage was shown to affect weed management positively, with 21 European studies (some including North American data) finding positive effects on weeds, including increased numbers of some weeds and higher weed species diversity. Additionally, biological control using co-evolved, host-specific herbivores has been effective, with a replicated field study in the USA demonstrating that flea beetle introduction significantly reduced large-flower primrose-willow abundance.",

However, delayed herbicide use also resulted in more weeds and showed mixed effects on insect pests - one study found more pests for some groups while another found fewer pests in some experiments. Yield effects were also mixed, with one study finding lower yields and another finding no effect. \n\nIn contrast, altering insecticide timing (action 723) showed more consistent benefits for natural enemies, with one study reporting more natural enemies when insecticides were sprayed earlier rather than later. For pest control, two of four studies found fewer pests or less disease damage when insecticides were applied early, though effects varied with insecticide type and two studies found no effect. Yield effects were mixed, with two studies finding mixed effects, one finding no effect, and one finding higher yields when insecticides were applied at times of suspected crop susceptibility. One study also found higher profits when insecticides were only applied at suspected susceptibility times.\n\nThe evidence suggests that altering insecticide timing may provide more consistent benefits for natural enemy conservation and pest control compared to delaying herbicide use, though both strategies show variable outcomes depending on specific conditions, pest types, and crop varieties studied.",

Action 123 provides evidence for controlling weeds without damaging other plants in conservation areas, showing that specific management regimes can reduce pernicious weeds, with cutting and fungal pathogen infection being effective for controlling creeping thistle, and lenient grazing providing long-term control. Mixed pasture (Action 721) was found to reduce weeds in two studies from the USA, with both randomized, replicated trials showing reduced weeds compared to monoculture pasture. Delaying mowing or first grazing date on pasture or grassland (Action 131) resulted in benefits including higher plant species richness and higher densities of rare arable weeds according to studies from the Netherlands, Sweden and the UK. Reducing chemical inputs in permanent grassland management (Action 459) was tested as an approach, though the evidence showed no increase in foraging birds attracted to pasture plots with no fertiliser compared to controls. Additional vegetation management approaches include using prescribed fire to maintain or restore disturbance in grasslands (Action 3882) and managing vegetation using livestock grazing (Action 2545), though these were primarily studied for their effects on butterflies/moths and mammals respectively rather than specifically for weed control.",

One study found a non-native beetle was unsuitable for controlling creeping thistle because it had poor survival in the UK climate. A replicated controlled study found that spraying a high concentration of herbicide killed less than half of broad-leaved dock plants. A replicated, controlled, randomized study found black grass was eliminated with a December treatment of grass-specific herbicide.
