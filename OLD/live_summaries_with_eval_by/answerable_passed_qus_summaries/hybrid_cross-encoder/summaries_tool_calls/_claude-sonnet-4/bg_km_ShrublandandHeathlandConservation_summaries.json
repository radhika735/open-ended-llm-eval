Cutting alone: Two randomized, controlled studies in the UK found that cutting bracken reduced bracken cover or biomass, while one controlled study found that cutting bracken did not decrease the abundance of bracken (Action 1653). The systematic review noted that cutting may be equally effective to herbicide application (Action 105). Combination of cutting and herbicide: Three randomized, controlled studies in the UK and Norway found that cutting and applying herbicide reduced bracken biomass or cover (Action 1654). One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK found that cutting bracken followed by applying herbicide increased plant species richness when compared with applying herbicide followed by cutting, suggesting the order of treatment matters (Action 1654).

However, one site comparison study in the USA found that using fences led to decreased cover of woody plants, while three replicated, controlled studies in the USA and the UK found that fencing either had mixed effects on shrub cover or did not alter shrub cover (Action 1545). Additional effectiveness variations were observed in grass cover responses across countries: studies in the UK and USA found that fencing led to a decline in grass cover, while studies in the USA, UK, and Finland found that fencing did not alter grass cover, and studies in the USA and UK recorded an increase in grass cover (Action 1545).

Allowing shrubland to regenerate without active management was found to be effective, with five before-and-after trials in the USA, UK, and Norway showing increased shrub cover or biomass, and one replicated, paired site comparison in the USA finding that sites allowed to recover without active restoration had similar shrub cover to unburned areas (Action 1679). Two replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after trials in Spain and Portugal found increases in the cover of woody plant species, and one replicated, before-and-after study in South Africa found that the height of three protea species increased after recovery from fire (Action 1679).\n\nActive restoration interventions show mixed results. Adding mulch followed by seeding with shrub seeds increased the seedling abundance of one of seven shrub species in one randomized, controlled study in the USA, though it did not reduce grass cover (Action 1650). Hydroseeding (spraying a slurry of seed, mulch and water) showed variable effectiveness, with one controlled study in Spain finding increased overall plant cover in most cases, while another study found no alteration in vegetation cover (Action 3412). Adding mulch before sowing seeds increased the cover of target plant species in one replicated, controlled study in Germany and increased the number of seedlings in most cases in one replicated, controlled study in Canada (Action 3425). Using erosion blankets after seeding showed mixed results, with one study in Spain finding increased plant species richness and plant density, while two studies in the USA found no alteration in vegetation cover (Action 3431). \n\nPrescribed fire for maintaining or restoring disturbance was shown to reduce tree/shrub cover in two replicated studies in fens in the USA and UK, and increased plant species richness or diversity in two replicated, controlled studies in the USA and New Zealand (Action 1763).",

No studies were found that evaluated the effects of placing signs to discourage access to sensitive areas of shrub habitat (Action 1620). Similarly, no studies were found that evaluated the effects of placing signs to deter gathering of shrubland species (Action 1613). No studies were found that evaluated the effects of planting spiny shrubs to act as barriers to people in shrublands (Action 1621). The systematic searches conducted found no studies that have directly evaluated these actions for shrubland protection, meaning there is currently no evidence base to assess whether these interventions are effective or have any harmful impacts in shrubland ecosystems. While one study in Turkey found that signs and fencing around sea turtle nests increased hatching success (Action 3642), this relates to reptile conservation rather than shrubland vegetation protection. Some evidence exists for fencing/barriers protecting planted wetland vegetation from wildlife damage, but this does not apply to shrubland contexts or human impacts.",

Regarding plant species diversity, one replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after trial in Spain found that cutting increased the number of plant species, though another replicated, randomized, before-and-after trial found that the number of plant species only increased in a minority of cases (Action ID: 1627). Tree cover was affected in Italy, where one site comparison study found a reduction in tree cover following mowing (Action ID: 1627). The studies indicate contrasting effects on heather abundance between the two countries, with Italy showing increases and Spain showing decreases, while both countries demonstrated consistent increases in grass cover from cutting/mowing treatments.",

Five of six studies found that sowing seeds of shrubland species increased shrub cover (Action 1698). One replicated, randomized, controlled study found that shrub seedling abundance increased after seeds were sown, and that the community composition of shrublands where seeds were sown was similar to that found in undisturbed shrublands (Action 1698).

One randomized controlled study found that cutting grass and sowing seeds increased shrub seedling abundance and reduced grass cover (Action 1639). Applying herbicide and sowing seeds of shrubland plants was found in one randomized, controlled study to result in more shrub seedlings than areas that were not treated (Action 1644). This method also increased the number of native plant species in one study, though effects on grass cover were mixed (Action 1644).\n\nAdding mulch combined with seeding showed limited effectiveness, with one study finding it increased seedling abundance of only one of seven shrub species tested (Action 1650).\n\nIndividual plant planting showed mixed results. One study found that a majority of planted plants survived after one year (Action 1697), and planting increased plant cover in one study from South Africa (Action 1697). However, one study found that planting California sagebrush plants did not increase the cover of native plant species compared to sowing of seeds (Action 1697).\n\nCombining planting and seeding did not show additional benefits, with one study finding that planting and sowing of seeds did not increase cover of native plant species compared to either method alone (Action 1700).\n\nAdding topsoil alongside seeding increased grass biomass but reduced forb biomass compared to topsoil addition alone (Action 1857).",

This method also increased the number of native plant species in one study, though effects on grass cover were mixed (Action 1644).\\n\\nAdding mulch combined with seeding showed limited effectiveness, with one study finding it increased seedling abundance of only one of seven shrub species tested (Action 1650).\\n\\nIndividual plant planting showed mixed results. One study found that a majority of planted plants survived after one year (Action 1697), and planting increased plant cover in one study from South Africa (Action 1697). However, one study found that planting California sagebrush plants did not increase the cover of native plant species compared to sowing of seeds (Action 1697).\\n\\nCombining planting and seeding did not show additional benefits, with one study finding that planting and sowing of seeds did not increase cover of native plant species compared to either method alone (Action 1700).\\n\\nAdding topsoil alongside seeding increased grass biomass but reduced forb biomass compared to topsoil addition alone (Action 1857).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"1698\",\n    \"1639\",\n    \"1644\",\n    \"1650\",\n    \"1697\",\n    \"1700\",\n    \"1857\"\n  ]\n}"

One before-and-after trial in Australia found that closing paths did not alter shrub cover, but did increase the number of plant species in an alpine shrubland (Action 1619). For physical exclusion methods specifically targeting pedestrians, no studies were found that evaluated the effects on vegetation of physically excluding pedestrians from marshes or swamps (Action 3023). While fencing has been extensively studied for livestock exclusion in shrublands, with multiple controlled studies showing that fences generally increased shrub cover, abundance, and biomass (Action 1545), these studies focus on livestock rather than human disturbance. Signs and access restrictions have been studied primarily for mammal conservation rather than vegetation protection, with studies showing increased use of areas by wildlife when human access was restricted (Action 2325, Action 2330). One study from Turkey found that fencing sea turtle nests combined with signs resulted in higher hatching success compared to areas with no protection measures (Action 3642). Overall, there is a notable lack of evidence specifically evaluating physical barriers or deterrents for reducing human recreational disturbance to shrubland vegetation.",

The only available evidence comes from studies on other habitat types: one study in Canada found significantly higher abundances of some birds, but not forest specialists, in forest patches connected to continuous forest compared to isolated patches, and evidence that corridors were used by some bird species more than clearcuts between patches (Action 160). Studies on reptiles found that forest fragments connected by corridors and isolated forest fragments had similar species composition, richness, and abundance in Brazil, while in Madagascar an area with hedges connecting different habitat types had more unique reptile species and reptile communities were more similar across habitat types compared to areas without hedges (Action 3663).

Herbicide application showed mixed results for heather: one controlled trial found that applying herbicide increased the number of heather seedlings, and one study found it increased heather biomass, but two randomized controlled studies found that spraying with herbicide did not increase heather cover (Action 1652). Cutting bracken also showed variable effects on heather: one trial in Norway and one UK study found that cutting increased heather cover or biomass, but two UK studies found that cutting did not increase heather cover or abundance of heather seedlings (Action 1653). Combined cutting and herbicide treatment had similarly mixed results: one study found it did not alter heather biomass while a trial in Norway found it increased heather cover (Action 1654). The 'bracken bruiser' mechanical treatment was found to increase bracken cover rather than control it, with no effect on plant diversity (Action 1726). A systematic review found that the herbicide asulam reduced bracken abundance if applied repeatedly, and cutting may be equally effective (Action 105). No studies were found evaluating the effectiveness of herbicide and grazing combinations or cutting and burning for bracken control in shrublands (Actions 1661, 1655).",

One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK found that grazing in only winter or summer did not affect heather or grass height compared to year-round grazing (Action 1609).\n\nFor context on grazing effects more broadly, studies show that increased livestock numbers generally result in decreased shrub cover. Two site comparison studies in the UK found that cover of common heather declined in sites with a high density of livestock, and one site comparison in the Netherlands found that dwarf shrub cover was lower in grazed areas than in ungrazed areas (Action 1628).

    "relevant_summary": "The effects of reducing or stopping livestock grazing on shrub cover vary considerably across different countries and ecosystems. In the UK, studies show mixed effects: reducing grazing increased shrub cover or abundance in some studies (action 1607, 1545), with specific findings that total vegetation and shrub cover were greater where grazing intensity was lower in bogs (action 1735), and fencing to exclude livestock increased shrub cover (action 1545). However, one UK study found that reducing grazing had mixed effects on shrub cover (action 1607), and another found that reducing grazing led to a reduction in heather plant height (action 1607). In South Africa, a before-and-after trial found that reducing grazing increased shrub abundance (action 1607). In Spain, reducing grazing increased the cover of western gorse (action 1607). In the Netherlands, dwarf shrub cover was higher in ungrazed sites (action 1607). In France, ungrazed sites had higher cover of ericaceous shrubs but lower cover of non-ericaceous shrubs than grazed sites (action 1607). In contrast, studies in the USA found that stopping grazing did not increase shrub abundance (action 1607), and fencing led to decreased cover of woody plants in one study (action 1545). In peatland environments across multiple countries including the UK, Australia, USA, Spain, and Chile, excluding livestock had variable effects: some studies found no effect on shrub cover while others found increased shrub cover (action 1734). In Germany, fencing increased shrub biomass (action 1545).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence, several interventions have shown effectiveness for encouraging shrubland recovery after fire. Allowing shrubland to regenerate without active management has demonstrated consistent benefits, with five before-and-after trials in the USA, UK, and Norway finding increased shrub cover or biomass after fire recovery without intervention (Action ID: 1679). One replicated, paired study in the USA found that sites allowed to recover without active restoration had similar shrub cover to unburned areas (Action ID: 1679).\n\nActive restoration approaches include introducing seeds of trees and shrubs. Studies show that sowing shrub seeds can increase establishment, with studies in Germany and the USA reporting germination and survival of heather and willow seeds respectively, though success varies by species (Action ID: 1824). Direct planting of trees and shrubs has shown promise, with eight studies in various locations reporting that the majority of planted trees and shrubs survived over periods between 10 weeks and 13 years (Action ID: 1820).\n\nSoil preparation techniques can enhance restoration success. Studies in the UK found that removal of topsoil combined with adding seed or clippings increased cover of heathland plants and heather and gorse (Action ID: 1711). Additionally, cutting or mowing grass combined with sowing shrubland seeds showed mixed results, with one study in the USA finding increased shrub seedling abundance and reduced grass cover (Action ID: 1639).\n\nThinning trees after wildfire in burnt forest areas can support recovery, with studies in Spain and Canada finding increased plant species richness and aspen sapling cover respectively (Action ID: 1234).",

Organic matter addition showed mixed results: leaf litter addition in Brazil increased tree species richness, while in Costa Rica it decreased young tree density in forest gaps, with no effects under intact forest canopy (Action 1250). In Portugal, adding plant material to soil surface increased total plant cover (Action 1250). Various soil amendment approaches using composts and wastes were studied: Municipal waste composts in Spain greatly reduced soil loss and water runoff in semi-arid soils (Action 890). Organic processing waste composts applied at high rates improved soil structure and reduced soil loss but increased nutrient loss (Action 891). Manures and agricultural composts showed consistent benefits including higher microbial biomass, reduced soil loss and water runoff when combined with other treatments, higher soil carbon levels, and increased crop yields (Action 911). Mixed organic and inorganic amendments resulted in higher microbial biomass and activity, increased soil organic carbon, and improved crop yields (Action 902). Fresh plant material incorporation increased microbial biomass, reduced soil loss, increased soil nitrogen levels and carbon content, and improved yields (Action 910). Fertilizer application showed generally positive outcomes, increasing total plant cover, understory plant biomass, young tree size, and cover of artificially seeded species (Action 1248).",

Adding fertilizer to soil alongside planting/seeding increased cover of shrubs and trees in a majority of cases in Iceland and increased biomass of four-wing saltbush in a majority of cases in the USA (Action 1704). Temporary irrigation of degraded shrublands increased shrub cover according to a study at two sites in the USA (Action 1696). Stripping or disturbing topsoil alongside planting/seeding showed positive results, with two studies in the UK finding increased cover of heathland plants or heather and gorse, and one study finding increased numbers of heathland plants (Action 1711). Topsoil removal alone showed mixed results, with some UK studies finding increased heather cover and increased cover of both specialist and generalist plant species, though effects varied (Action 1685). Adding peat to soil alongside sowing seed increased cover of common heather in the majority of cases and increased density of heather seedlings compared to seeding alone, though no seedlings survived after two years in one UK study (Action 1705). In contrast, some interventions showed limited benefits: sowing seeds and planting individual plants together did not increase cover of native plant species compared to either method alone (Action 1700), and adding mulch to soil alongside planting/seeding did not increase shrub numbers or height of California sagebrush, though it did increase seedling numbers but not survival in one study (Action 1706). Adding mulch and fertilizer together showed no significant effects on seedling abundance or grass cover in most cases (Actions 1694, 1707).",
