Deterrent use around noise sources reduced harbour porpoise activity and sightings up to 1–18 km, and minke whales moved away, swam faster, and more directly when a device was deployed from a boat (2896). On vessels, bottlenose dolphins avoided boats more when devices were active; killer whales were farther from vessels during hauls with a device but distances decreased after first exposure; humpback and snubfin dolphins showed reduced surfacing, echolocation, and time spent foraging or socializing; and devices did not reduce Risso’s dolphin predation on squid catches (2815). On moorings, devices reduced numbers or activity of grey and harbour seals, harbour porpoises, and some dolphins; had no significant effect on several migration metrics of humpback whales; reduced harbour porpoise echolocation while the probability of approaching within 125 m increased over 10–11 days; and reduced seal numbers upstream of devices without reducing overall numbers (2816). At aquaculture sites, devices reduced seal/sea lion predation or approaches in some studies, while other studies found no reduction in seal predation or dolphin presence/behaviour near farms (2775). On fishing gear, devices often reduced approaches/interactions and lowered entanglements for several species, but some studies found benefits for some species or areas and not others, and others found no significant behavioural effects; devices reduced gear/catch damage in many but not all cases (2808). For renewable energy sites and cooling water intake structures, no studies were found evaluating effects on marine mammal populations (2748; 2751).",

Rehabilitating and releasing injured, sick, or weak marine mammals resulted in 10–100% survival during monitoring periods ranging from three days to five years across multiple species and locations, with more than a quarter of rehabilitated Hawaiian monk seals reproducing; behaviour of some rehabilitated harbour porpoises and harbour seals was similar to wild animals, but at least a quarter of California sea lions treated for toxic algae poisoning died or were euthanized and released individuals showed altered movements, reduced time diving or hauled out, and shorter, shallower dives compared to wild conspecifics [2925]. Rescuing and releasing stranded or trapped marine mammals yielded 17–100% survival over three weeks to three years in multiple dolphin, whale, and seal species, with reproduction documented in a rescued bottlenose dolphin and more than a quarter of Hawaiian monk seals surviving and reproducing when rescue/release was combined with at least seven other survival-enhancing interventions [2924]. Releasing captive-bred manatees led to survival of two of three Antillean manatees and two of 14 Florida manatees for at least one year without further intervention [2933].
