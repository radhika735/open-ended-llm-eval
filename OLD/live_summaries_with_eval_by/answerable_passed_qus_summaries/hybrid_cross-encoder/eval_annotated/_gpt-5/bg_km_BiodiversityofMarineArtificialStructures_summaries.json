Creating short flexible habitats in Australia yielded mixed effects on seahorse abundance depending on the survey week [3450], and studies in Australia and France reported mixed effects on invertebrate abundance depending on survey week, species group, habitat length, or site, with one study finding no effect on mobile invertebrate abundance [3450].

Effects on combined macroalgae and invertebrate richness/diversity were mixed and depended on site and the presence/size of grooves, small ridges, or ledges on surfaces [3472]. One study in Australia reported increased mobile invertebrate species richness on treated surfaces [3472]. For fishes, two of three Australian studies found no increase in species richness, while one found mixed effects depending on surface features and site [3472]. For abundance, one Australian study found no increase in combined macroalgae and invertebrates, and another found mixed effects depending on surface micro‑features [3472]. Invertebrate abundance responses were mixed; findings included increased non‑mobile invertebrate and oyster recruit abundance and decreased barnacle abundance in one study, and increased oyster and mobile invertebrate abundance in another [3472]. Fish abundance generally did not increase in two of three Australian studies, and in one study was similar regardless of groove/ridge size [3472]. Survival of transplanted invertebrates (including oysters) varied with species, site, and microhabitat features; oyster survival was higher in grooves than on ridges in one study, and survival in grooves/ledges varied by site in another [3472]. A behavioral study in Australia found no increase in time fishes interacted with surfaces or number of bites after transplanting oysters and/or coralline algae, though benthic fishes took more bites from surfaces with transplanted oysters than from those with algae plus oysters; these results held regardless of grooves/ridges [3472].",

Creating pit habitats often increased richness/diversity: eight of 12 replicated controlled studies reported increases in combined macroalgae/invertebrate richness/diversity, while two found no increase and two reported mixed effects, sometimes varying with pit size/arrangement (3475). Creating groove habitats produced fewer consistent gains: three of six replicated controlled studies reported increases in combined richness/diversity, two found no increase and one reported mixed effects; grooves also supported higher richness than adjacent small ledges/ridges in some comparisons (3473, 3464). Combining grooves with small protrusions/ridges/ledges yielded increases in six of 11 replicated controlled studies, with five reporting mixed effects depending on design and context (3474). Small ridges/ledges alone were less effective: one of two randomized controlled studies found no increase in combined richness, and two studies found lower richness on ridges/ledges than in grooves (3464). Short flexible habitats reduced combined richness in one randomized controlled study (3459). Small adjoining cavities or “swimthroughs” did not increase combined macroalgae/invertebrate richness in one replicated study (3468).",

Transplanting or seeding organisms (e.g., oysters) onto structures increased combined invertebrate and fish species richness and diversity and altered community composition; overall combined abundance did not increase, with effects varying among species [3471]. Managing or restricting harvesting around structures was associated with higher fish species richness, different fish community composition including species absent from unrestricted sites, and higher seabream abundance; total fish abundance responses varied and access restrictions did not fully prevent harvesting [3457]. Creating artificial reefs of different 3‑D structure/material often showed no differences in combined mobile invertebrate and fish richness or abundance between designs/materials [2259]. For several actions on subtidal structures—creating large/small ridges or ledges, crevice habitats, large protrusions, and reducing slope—no studies were found evaluating effects on biodiversity [3445; 3444; 3454; 3443; 3442].",

Reported effects on species richness/diversity were mixed, with some cases (often involving ECOncrete with added texture, grooves, holes, pits or ledges) showing increases, while others using quarried rock or alternative cement mixes did not increase richness/diversity (3470). In the UK, one study found recycled-cement concrete did not increase diatom species richness (3470). For overall abundance, several studies in these regions found no increase or mixed responses; in one case ECOncrete increased live cover and biomass, while different concrete mixes supported differing cover and inorganic biomass (3470). For algae, studies in Australia, Israel and the UK reported no increases for several algal groups (e.g., brown, turf, coralline, diatoms) when using quarried rock or recycled-cement concrete, with some mixed outcomes and occasional increases for certain groups depending on site and material (3470). For invertebrates, studies in these regions reported mixed responses, including no increases for several sessile groups with quarried rock in some cases, a decrease for Spirorbid tubeworms in one case, and increased bivalve abundance with shell-concrete; different ECOncrete and standard-concrete mixes supported different coral abundances (3470). In Israel specifically, one study reported mixed effects on fish abundances when using ECOncrete with added grooves, holes and pits, varying by species group (3470).",

    "relevant_summary": "Across interventions tested on intertidal artificial structures, creating ‘rock pools’ has the strongest and most consistent evidence base: multiple replicated, controlled studies reported that pools supported macroalgae, invertebrate and/or fish species absent from flat surfaces, often altered community composition, and frequently increased combined species richness or diversity (with some mixed or null results) [3476]. Creating pit habitats also shows broad support: several studies found altered combined macroalgae–invertebrate composition and many reported increases in richness/diversity, though responses of abundance were mixed and context dependent [3475]. Creating grooves yielded mixed outcomes: some studies recorded higher richness/diversity and increased combined abundance (often when combined with pits), while others found no change in community composition or richness [3473]. Creating hole habitats (>50 mm) increased combined macroalgae–invertebrate richness/diversity in all three studies that tested it (typically alongside pools or other microhabitats) and altered community composition when combined with grooves/ridges and modified materials; effects on abundance were mixed or null [3467]. Adding long or short flexible habitats altered surface community composition, but short flexible habitats reduced overall species richness and did not increase fish richness or abundance; effects on algal and invertebrate abundances were mixed [3460, 3459]. Creating small adjoining ‘swimthrough’ cavities (≤100 mm) did not increase richness or diversity and typically did not alter community composition, though abundance responses varied [3468]. Creating natural rocky reef topography did not increase combined macroalgae–invertebrate richness and produced mixed abundance effects [3435]. Reducing structure slope increased overall richness only when implemented together with created pools; algal and invertebrate abundances did not increase in controlled tests [3461]. Using environmentally-sensitive materials produced mixed results: some configurations (e.g., ECOncrete with added microhabitats) altered community composition and increased richness/diversity, while other material substitutions did not [3469]. No studies evaluated creating large adjoining ‘swimthrough’ cavities (>100 mm) or crevice habitats (>50 mm) [3438, 3437].",

For large swimthroughs (>100 mm), two studies found that adding them increased overall fish species richness and abundance on and around structures, supported fish species absent from structures without swimthroughs, and were used by juvenile spiny lobsters and groupers, sea firs, and adult fishes from five families [3456].

    "relevant_summary": "Evidence of increased invertebrate abundance on intertidal artificial structures has been reported for several interventions, but results are often mixed. Creating large ridges or ledges increased mussel or limpet abundance, but not barnacles (3465). Creating large protrusions increased limpet but not barnacle abundance (3463). Creating pit habitats increased barnacle and/or mobile invertebrate abundances in some studies, while other studies found no increase or mixed effects depending on site, species, or pit design (3475). Creating groove habitats often did not increase invertebrate, limpet, or chiton abundances, though one study reported higher mobile invertebrate and oyster abundances in grooves than on adjacent small ledges, and another found mixed effects with pits (3473). Creating rock pools had mixed effects on limpet or combined invertebrate abundances, varying with shore level, pool depth, species group and site (3476). Creating hole habitats did not increase overall invertebrate abundance in one study, and with rock pools had mixed effects on limpets depending on shore level and site (3467). Creating small adjoining cavities (“swimthroughs”) increased mobile invertebrate abundance in one study, while another found abundance varied with size and arrangement (3468). Transplanting or seeding organisms (typically oysters) produced mixed effects on mobile invertebrate abundance, with at least one study reporting increases in oyster and mobile invertebrate abundance and others finding dependence on grooves/ridges and site (3472). Creating small ridges or ledges supported lower mobile invertebrate and oyster abundances than grooves in one study, and overall abundance effects were non-increasing or mixed in others (3464). Creating natural rocky reef topography had mixed effects on barnacle and mobile invertebrate abundances, depending on site (3435).",

(2) Creating grooves (sometimes with pits) increased combined macroalgae–invertebrate species richness and, in some cases, overall abundance; fish richness, abundance, and feeding bites increased when grooves were paired with pits; other studies found no increase in richness or abundance, and responses varied by site and configuration (3473). (3) Creating small protrusions increased combined macroalgae–invertebrate species richness, but did not alter community composition in one study; effects on overall abundance were mixed and sometimes non-significant (3462). (4) Creating small ridges/ledges showed mixed outcomes: one Singapore study found no change in community composition or richness with ridges alone, while another study that combined ridges with grooves, protrusions, and pits reported increased richness but site- and configuration-dependent composition and abundance; studies elsewhere reported grooves between ledges often outperform ledges themselves (3464). (5) Combining grooves with small ridges/ledges (and sometimes holes or pits) altered community composition in some Singapore studies, supported species absent from plain concrete, increased species richness in several cases, and yielded mixed effects on overall and group-specific abundances depending on groove/ridge size, shore level, covers, and site; some studies detected no increase in overall abundance (3474). (6) Using environmentally-sensitive materials (e.g., ECOncrete with added grooves/ledges/holes; reduced-pH or alternative concretes) in Singapore and the UK altered community composition and supported species absent from standard concrete and increased richness/diversity in one ECOncrete study, but other material trials showed no increase in richness and mixed or non-significant effects on algal and invertebrate abundances (3469). (7) Transplanting or seeding organisms on structures in Singapore found macroalgae had higher survival at mid- and high-shore than low-shore, coral and sponge growth varied by species, and broader studies reported mixed effects of transplanted oysters/algae on fish and invertebrate richness and abundance depending on grooves/ledges and site (3472).",

Abundances and fish metrics showed mixed responses that depended on species group and site, indicating location\\u2011dependent outcomes across the studied regions (3476).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"3476\"\n  ]\n}"

Creating groove habitats (1–50 mm) sometimes increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate richness/diversity, though several studies found no increase or mixed, site-dependent effects; grooves supported higher species richness than small ridges/ledges in some comparisons (3473). Creating small ridges or ledges (1–50 mm) did not generally increase combined richness and, in comparative studies, supported lower species richness than grooves; one study with multiple habitat types reported increased richness with mixed effects by size/arrangement and shore level (3464). Creating short flexible habitats (1–50 mm) decreased combined macroalgae, invertebrate and fish species richness during low tide in one study, with mixed effects on mobile invertebrates at high tide (3459). Using environmentally-sensitive materials showed mixed outcomes: ECOncrete with added grooves, small ledges and holes increased species richness and diversity in one study, while hemp-, shell-, or reduced-pH concrete alone did not increase combined richness; limestone-cement with pits, grooves, small ridges and texture had mixed, site-dependent effects (3469).",

    "relevant_summary": "In Australian estuaries, reducing the slope of intertidal artificial structures, alongside creating rock pools, increased combined macroalgae, invertebrate and fish species richness, but did not increase macroalgal, oyster or mobile invertebrate abundance on surfaces [3461]. Transplanting or seeding (e.g., oysters, coralline algae) supported species absent from untreated surfaces, produced mixed effects on combined macroalgae/invertebrate richness/diversity depending on site and surface features, increased mobile invertebrate species richness, and generally did not increase fish richness or abundance in two of three studies; fish interaction time did not increase, though benthic fishes took more bites from oyster-only transplants than from combined algae–oyster transplants [3472]. Creating hole habitats (often with rock pools or grooves/ridges) supported species absent from controls, increased combined macroalgae/invertebrate richness/diversity, did not increase invertebrate abundance in one study, had shore- and site-dependent effects on limpet abundance, and was used by sea slugs, urchins and octopuses [3467]. Creating short flexible habitats altered community composition, decreased combined macroalgae–invertebrate–fish richness at low tide, did not increase combined mobile invertebrate and fish abundance at low tide, and had mixed effects on macroalgal and invertebrate abundances; fish biting rates did not increase [3459]. Creating pit habitats altered community composition in some studies, increased combined macroalgae/invertebrate richness/diversity in several studies but not others, increased limpet and periwinkle richness with effects varying by pit arrangement, and produced mixed invertebrate abundance responses including increases for some barnacles and mobile invertebrates [3475]. Evidence gaps remain: no studies were found on creating crevice habitats or on controlling/removing non-native or nuisance species on intertidal artificial structures [3437, 3439].",
