Cutting/removing plantations and rewetting: Site‑comparison studies in bogs and fens found plant community composition changed and became less like drained, forested sites; some replicated fen studies found no or only small effects on overall composition [1732]. Two before‑and‑after studies reported increased abundance of wetland‑characteristic plants [1732]. For mosses, two replicated, paired studies found increased Sphagnum cover, one replicated before‑after site‑comparison found no effect, two before‑and‑after studies found mixed effects by site or species, and three studies reported reduced cover of non‑Sphagnum or forest‑characteristic mosses; one study found no effect on forest mosses when thinning/rewetting [1732]. Seven studies reported increased cover of at least one herb group (including cottongrasses and sedges), with one study reporting loss of cottongrass where it was rare and reduced purple moor grass [1732]. One study found increased ground vegetation height; another found no effect on canopy height after eight years; thinning reduced the number of tall trees for 1–3 years but not to natural levels [1732]. Two replicated, paired, controlled studies in rich fens reported increased plant species richness, while two replicated Finnish studies found no effect on total richness or diversity [1732].",

Five studies (one paired, controlled, before-and-after) in Finland, Sweden\\u00a0and Canada\\u00a0reported that rewetting bogs or fens had no effect on cover of non-Sphagnum mosses (or mosses/lichens). However, two controlled studies in bogs in Ireland\\u00a0and the UK\\u00a0reported that rewetting reduced cover of non-Sphagnum mosses\\u00a0or bryophytes. One site comparison study in Finland\\u00a0reported that a rewetted peatland had similar moss cover (Sphagnum and total) to a natural peatland, but another site comparison study in Canada\\u00a0reported that a rewetted bog had lower moss cover (Sphagnum and other) than nearby target peatlands.\\nHerb cover (25 studies): Twenty-one studies (including four replicated, paired, controlled) reported that rewetting (sometimes\\u00a0along with other interventions) increased cover of at least one group of herbs.

Burning increased plant species richness or diversity in a fen (USA) and a bog (New Zealand) in replicated, controlled studies (1763), but other studies found plant species richness was reduced or limited in a bog (UK) and fens (USA; with other interventions) (1774), and typically unaffected in a fen (UK; with other interventions) (1763). In fens, burning reduced forb cover and increased sedge/rush cover with no effect on grass cover in one replicated, controlled study (USA), whereas another replicated before-and-after study (UK; with other interventions) reported reduced grass/sedge/rush cover (1763). In bogs, moss cover (including Sphagnum) was higher in plots burned more often in one UK bog, and burning increased moss/lichen/bare ground cover 2–7 months after burning in Germany (1774). For herbaceous plants in bogs, burning had no short-term effect on cottongrass in Germany, increased cottongrass after 8–18 years in the UK, and resulted in similar cottongrass cover when burned every 10 or 20 years in the same UK bog; burning reduced purple moor grass in Germany and had mixed effects on other grass-like plants and forbs across sites (1774). Vegetation structure responses included more biomass of grass-like plants but less total vegetation, shrub and bryophyte biomass in plots burned more frequently in a UK bog (1774).

Sphagnum moss cover or abundance frequently increased (with some mixed or no effects reported), while non‑Sphagnum moss cover often showed no change or declined in some cases; Sphagnum growth was reported to reach natural levels in forested fens [1756]. Herb cover commonly increased, including sedges, cottongrasses, and some reeds/rushes; purple moor grass often decreased; one study reported no effect on total herb cover [1756]. Tree/shrub cover typically decreased or showed no change, though increases were reported in some fens; effects could be mixed among species [1756]. Overall vegetation cover sometimes increased, sometimes decreased, or showed no change depending on site [1756]. Plant species richness/diversity often increased, but many studies found no effect and some reported reductions; compared with natural peatlands, rewetted sites sometimes had lower richness, sometimes higher, and sometimes similar [1756]. In studies where rewetting was combined with tree removal, results also included increases in wetland‑characteristic plants and herbs (including sedges and cottongrasses), increases in Sphagnum in some cases, and reductions in non‑Sphagnum or forest mosses; effects on species richness ranged from increases to no change [1732].",

Fifteen studies were in bogs (two\\u00a0being restored as fens). Fifteen studies were in fens or fen meadows\\u00a0(two\\u00a0were naturally forested). Six studies were in general or unspecified peatlands. Some studies were based on the same experimental set-up or sites as each other: two studies in Germany, three studies in Sweden, two studies in west Finland\\u00a0and two studies in south Finland.\\nPlant community composition (13 studies):\\u00a0Six before-and-after studies (four also replicated) in peatlands in Finland, Hungary, Sweden, Poland\\u00a0and Germany\\u00a0reported changes in the overall plant community composition following rewetting. Typically, drier grassland communities were replaced by more wetland- or peatland-characteristic communities.\\u00a0One replicated, paired, controlled study in a bog in the Czech Republic\\u00a0found that rewetted plots developed a different plant community to drained plots. Three site comparison studies in Finland\\u00a0and Canada\\u00a0reported that rewetted peatlands contained a different plant community to natural peatlands. Three replicated studies in peatlands in the UK\\u00a0and fens in Germany\\u00a0reported that rewetting typically had no effect, or insignificant effects, on the plant community.\\nCharacteristic plants (11 studies): Five studies (including one replicated site comparison) in peatlands in Canada, the UK, China\\u00a0and Poland\\u00a0reported that rewetting (sometimes\\u00a0along with other interventions) increased the abundance of wetland- or peatland-characteristic plants. Two replicated site comparison studies in fens or fen meadows in central Europe\\u00a0found that rewetting reduced the number of fen-characteristic plant species. Two studies (one replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after) in fens in Sweden\\u00a0reported that rewetting had no effect on cover of fen-characteristic plants.\\u00a0Two before-and-after studies in fens in the USA\\u00a0and New Zealand\\u00a0reported that upland plant cover decreased following rewetting.\\u00a0\\nMoss cover (19 studies):\\u00a0Twelve studies (five replicated, two also paired and controlled) in the UK, Ireland, Germany,\\u00a0Sweden, Latvia, Canada\\u00a0and Spain\\u00a0reported that rewetting bogs, fens or other peatlands (sometimes\\u00a0along with other interventions) increased Sphagnum moss cover or abundance. Three of these studies\\u00a0reported mixed responses by species. Two additional replicated studies, in bogs in Latvia\\u00a0and forested fens in Finland, reported that rewetting had no effect on Sphagnum\\u00a0cover. Five studies (one paired, controlled, before-and-after) in Finland, Sweden\\u00a0and Canada\\u00a0reported that rewetting bogs or fens had no effect on cover of non-Sphagnum mosses (or mosses/lichens). However, two controlled studies in bogs in Ireland\\u00a0and the UK\\u00a0reported that rewetting reduced cover of non-Sphagnum mosses\\u00a0or bryophytes. One site comparison study in Finland\\u00a0reported that a rewetted peatland had similar moss cover (Sphagnum and total) to a natural peatland, but another site comparison study in Canada\\u00a0reported that a rewetted bog had lower moss cover (Sphagnum and other) than nearby target peatlands.\\nHerb cover (25 studies): Twenty-one studies (including four replicated, paired, controlled) reported that rewetting (sometimes\\u00a0along with other interventions) increased cover of at least one group of herbs. These studies were in bogs, fens or other peatlands in the UK, Finland, Ireland, the Czech Republic, the USA, the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, China, Latvia, Poland, Canada\\u00a0and Spain. Specifically, rewetting increased other/total sedge cover in 13 of 15 studies, increased cottongrass cover in eight of nine studies, and increased reed/rush cover in five of seven studies. Three\\u00a0of four before-and-after studies in peatlands in the UK and Sweden reported that rewetting reduced purple moor grass cover; the other study\\u00a0reported no effect. One replicated site comparison study in forested fens in Finland\\u00a0reported that rewetting had no effect on total herb cover.

Two before-and-after studies in fens in Sweden\\u00a0and Germany\\u00a0reported that rewetting increased tree/shrub cover. One before-and-after study in a bog in the UK\\u00a0reported mixed effects of rewetting on different tree/shrub species.\\nOverall vegetation cover (4 studies): Of four before-and-after studies (three also controlled) that examined the effect of rewetting on overall vegetation cover, two in bogs in Ireland\\u00a0and Sweden\\u00a0reported that rewetting increased it. One study in a fen in New Zealand\\u00a0reported that rewetting reduced vegetation cover.

However, five studies found no effect: in bogs in the Czech Republic\\u00a0and Latvia, fens in Sweden\\u00a0and Germany, and forested fens in Finland. One study in fen meadows in the Netherlands\\u00a0found scale-dependent effects. One paired, controlled, before-and-after study in a peatland in Finland\\u00a0reported that rewetting reduced plant diversity.

Programmes using multiple restoration interventions (excluding moss layer transfer) increased total moss/bryophyte cover, herb cover (including cottongrass and other graminoids), overall vegetation cover, and shifted communities toward those of natural bogs in some comparisons [1803]. Adding organic mulch after planting often improved outcomes, including higher survival of planted mosses or sedges, increased growth of transplanted sedges, greater vegetation cover (total, mosses/Sphagnum, or vascular plants) after 1–3 seasons, and higher germination for some species, though several studies reported no cover effects [1828]. Mulching without planting had limited effects on cover (no change in fen-characteristic plant cover or Sphagnum in two studies) but increased the number of fen-characteristic species present in one study [1813]. Disturbing the peat surface without planting altered community development, led to colonization by wetland/fen-characteristic species, but also promoted weedy species from the seed bank and did not lead to colonization by peat-forming species in one fen [1811]. Peat surface stabilization with pegged coconut fibre rolls on almost-bare peat did not change total, moss, shrub or cottongrass cover in one study [1815].",

Two replicated site comparison studies in fens or fen meadows in central Europe\\u00a0found that rewetting reduced the number of fen-characteristic plant species. Two studies (one replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after) in fens in Sweden\\u00a0reported that rewetting had no effect on cover of fen-characteristic plants.\\u00a0Two before-and-after studies in fens in the USA\\u00a0and New Zealand\\u00a0reported that upland plant cover decreased following rewetting.\\u00a0\\nMoss cover (19 studies):\\u00a0Twelve studies (five replicated, two also paired and controlled) in the UK, Ireland, Germany,\\u00a0Sweden, Latvia, Canada\\u00a0and Spain\\u00a0reported that rewetting bogs, fens or other peatlands (sometimes\\u00a0along with other interventions) increased Sphagnum moss cover or abundance. Three of these studies\\u00a0reported mixed responses by species. Two additional replicated studies, in bogs in Latvia\\u00a0and forested fens in Finland, reported that rewetting had no effect on Sphagnum\\u00a0cover. Five studies (one paired, controlled, before-and-after) in Finland, Sweden\\u00a0and Canada\\u00a0reported that rewetting bogs or fens had no effect on cover of non-Sphagnum mosses (or mosses/lichens). However, two controlled studies in bogs in Ireland\\u00a0and the UK\\u00a0reported that rewetting reduced cover of non-Sphagnum mosses\\u00a0or bryophytes. One site comparison study in Finland\\u00a0reported that a rewetted peatland had similar moss cover (Sphagnum and total) to a natural peatland, but another site comparison study in Canada\\u00a0reported that a rewetted bog had lower moss cover (Sphagnum and other) than nearby target peatlands.\\nHerb cover (25 studies): Twenty-one studies (including four replicated, paired, controlled) reported that rewetting (sometimes\\u00a0along with other interventions) increased cover of at least one group of herbs. These studies were in bogs, fens or other peatlands in the UK, Finland, Ireland, the Czech Republic, the USA, the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, China, Latvia, Poland, Canada\\u00a0and Spain. Specifically, rewetting increased other/total sedge cover in 13 of 15 studies, increased cottongrass cover in eight of nine studies, and increased reed/rush cover in five of seven studies. Three\\u00a0of four before-and-after studies in peatlands in the UK and Sweden reported that rewetting reduced purple moor grass cover; the other study\\u00a0reported no effect. One replicated site comparison study in forested fens in Finland\\u00a0reported that rewetting had no effect on total herb cover.

Two before-and-after studies in fens in Sweden\\u00a0and Germany\\u00a0reported that rewetting increased tree/shrub cover. One before-and-after study in a bog in the UK\\u00a0reported mixed effects of rewetting on different tree/shrub species.\\nOverall vegetation cover (4 studies): Of four before-and-after studies (three also controlled) that examined the effect of rewetting on overall vegetation cover, two in bogs in Ireland\\u00a0and Sweden\\u00a0reported that rewetting increased it.

Peat surface stabilization with pegged coconut fibre rolls on almost-bare peat did not change total, moss, shrub or cottongrass cover in one study [1815].\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"1756\",\n    \"1803\",\n    \"1828\",\n    \"1813\",\n    \"1811\",\n    \"1815\"\n  ]\n}"

Covers other than mulch applied after planting had mixed effects: fleece or fibre mats showed positive or no effects on germination depending on species; shading with plastic mesh increased survival of planted mosses and sometimes had no effect or increased survival for some peat swamp tree species; growth responses varied with increases for planted Sphagnum under transparent plastic or shade, reductions for planted fen mosses under shade, and shaded seedlings growing taller and thinner; cover of planted mosses often increased under shade, plastic mesh increased Sphagnum shoot numbers over transparent sheets, but shading sometimes had no effect on overall vegetation cover (1829). Adding inorganic fertilizer before/after planting sometimes increased survival of planted tree species but in other cases had no effect or reduced survival; fertilizer typically increased growth of planted mosses, herbs or trees but sometimes had no effect, and in a nursery it typically had no effect on peat swamp tree seedlings; vegetation cover often increased (total vegetation, vascular plants, bryophytes), though responses varied with increases in sedge but not total vegetation or Sphagnum in one study, and increases for a sown shrub and rush depending on fertilizer chemistry and peat preparation (1826). Liming before/after planting reduced survival of planted fen herbs but increased survival of planted fen mosses; growth often did not increase and was reduced for Sphagnum and many peat swamp tree seedlings, though growth of planted fen mosses increased in one study; cover of sown mosses increased in one study, but liming had no effect on total vegetation, vascular plant or bryophyte cover in another (1825). Adding fresh peat before planting increased cover of two sown plant species compared to tilled bog surface, but for one species this benefit was cancelled by fertilization (1837). Burying the upper layer of peat/soil before planting has no documented evidence of effects on peatland vegetation (1836).",

Spreading moss fragments on the surface: Thirteen studies (eleven in bogs, two in fens) reported Sphagnum presence in at least some sown plots within 1–4 growing seasons, with cover ranging from negligible to >90%; six controlled studies found higher Sphagnum cover/abundance in sown than unsown plots; in one study Sphagnum only survived at one of three sites and only with mulching; one study found adding Sphagnum to bog pools did not affect Sphagnum; four studies reported other moss/bryophyte cover up to 76% after 2–3 seasons, though in the fens cover was <1% unless mulched, shaded or limed (1821). A specific fragment-based approach, the moss layer transfer technique in Canadian bogs, led to restored areas with greater moss/bryophyte cover than unrestored after 4–8 years, development of bog-characteristic plant communities within 11 years, and higher plant species richness than unrestored areas (1804).",

Following removal, cover of wetland- or peatland‑characteristic plants often increased over 4–13 years, and fen‑characteristic plant richness increased in one replicated comparison [1809]. Rush, reed, or sedge cover commonly increased within 2–6 years, while purple moor grass cover decreased for 2–5 years in two controlled studies; one study found no effect on sedge or bentgrass cover after five years [1809]. Vegetation biomass was reduced for up to 18 years in two studies, though another study reported no effect after four years [1809]. Total plant species richness frequently increased over 2–18 years, though results were mixed across sites and studies, and richness increased over time after stripping in one study [1809]. Disturbing the peat surface (without planting) altered plant community development over 2–3 years; in one study, disturbance promoted greater cover of weedy seed‑bank species, and in another, disturbed and undisturbed communities diverged over time [1811]. Disturbed plots saw colonization by wetland/fen‑characteristic species in both studies, but peat‑forming species did not colonize in one fen [1811]. Reprofiling degraded bogs (without planting) produced plant communities different from nearby natural fens and resulted in lower Sphagnum, other moss, and vascular plant cover after five years [1807].",

    "relevant_summary": "Across 14 studies in fens and fen meadows, mowing/cutting herbaceous plants altered plant community composition in most cases and often increased plant species richness; effects on characteristic fen plants and mosses were frequently positive, while single cuts typically showed little or no effect on richness, bryophytes, shrubs, or vegetation height; herb cover of several groups (e.g., reeds, sedges, purple moor grass) was often reduced, though one study reported sedge increases when combined with other interventions (1759). Changing the season of mowing in a fen meadow produced similar community shifts across spring, summer, and autumn in one study, but another study in a mixed peatland found different community types after summer vs. winter mowing; in the fen meadow, species richness increased more with summer mowing over two years (1771). Removing plant litter in a fen and a fen meadow did not change overall community composition; one fen study reported no effect on bryophyte or tall moor grass cover, while a fen meadow study reported increased species richness and diversity but another fen study found no change in vascular plant diversity (1760). Cutting/removing shrubs or trees in fens was associated with plant communities becoming more like target fen meadows and increases in fen meadow species abundance in a Polish fen; in a forested fen in the USA, cutting and removing trees increased herb cover but did not change shrub cover, and increased herb biomass and height in a peat swamp (1761). Where tree removal was combined with rewetting, studies in fens reported mixed or small changes in overall plant community composition, increases in wetland-characteristic plants, mixed effects on Sphagnum and other mosses, frequent increases in herb cover (including sedges and cottongrasses), increased ground vegetation height in one study, and mixed results for overall richness/diversity (1732).",
