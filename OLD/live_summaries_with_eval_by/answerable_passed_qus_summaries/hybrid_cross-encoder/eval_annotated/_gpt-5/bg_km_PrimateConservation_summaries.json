A black howler monkey population in Belize increased by 138% over 13 years after a tourism project was implemented [1512]. In contrast, numbers of Tana River red colobus and crested mangabeys in Kenya decreased despite a tourism project [1512]. An intensive tourism project for Tibetan macaques in China that included food provisioning and range restrictions increased stress levels, with infant mortality reaching 100% in some years [1512]. Following a tourism project in Madagascar, population size and/or body size and group size declined for two lemur species while one lemur species increased [1512]. Additional evidence linked to tourism visitation practices reported that mountain gorilla numbers increased by 168% over 41 years while being visited by researchers and visitors wearing face-masks, keeping safety distances, and restricting visits to healthy individuals, alongside other interventions [1537, 1538, 1546].

Limiting the time researchers/tourists spend with habituated animals was associated with reintroduced Sumatran orangutans behaving more like wild conspecifics in one controlled study, and mountain gorilla numbers increasing by 168% over 41 years in one before-and-after study, both alongside other interventions (1539). Wearing face-masks by visitors/researchers was reported alongside the successful reunion of a confiscated young chimpanzee with its mother in Uganda in one study, and with mountain gorilla numbers increasing by 168% over 41 years in one before-and-after study, both alongside other interventions (1537). Keeping a safety distance from habituated animals was reported with most reintroduced chimpanzees surviving over five years in one before-and-after study, a 33% decline in reintroduced orangutans over 31 years in one controlled study despite distance rules, and a 168% increase in mountain gorillas over 41 years in one before-and-after study, all alongside other interventions (1538). Additional proposed actions with no direct quantitative evidence found include: avoiding contact between wild primates and human-raised primates (1555); implementing quarantine for people arriving at and leaving sites (1540); implementing health programmes for local communities (1557); not allowing people to consume food where primates can view them (1508); wearing gloves when handling primate food or tool items (1548); installing primate-proof garbage bins (1505); and controlling potential ‘reservoir’ species to reduce pathogen sources (1552).",

Wearing face-masks by visitors/researchers was reported alongside the successful reunion of a confiscated young chimpanzee with its mother in Uganda in one study, and with mountain gorilla numbers increasing by 168% over 41 years in one before-and-after study, both alongside other interventions (1537). Keeping a safety distance from habituated animals was reported with most reintroduced chimpanzees surviving over five years in one before-and-after study, a 33% decline in reintroduced orangutans over 31 years in one controlled study despite distance rules, and a 168% increase in mountain gorillas over 41 years in one before-and-after study, all alongside other interventions (1538). Additional proposed actions with no direct quantitative evidence found include: avoiding contact between wild primates and human-raised primates (1555); implementing quarantine for people arriving at and leaving sites (1540); implementing health programmes for local communities (1557); not allowing people to consume food where primates can view them (1508); wearing gloves when handling primate food or tool items (1548); installing primate-proof garbage bins (1505); and controlling potential \\u2018reservoir\\u2019 species to reduce pathogen sources (1552).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"1546\",\n    \"1539\",\n    \"1537\",\n    \"1538\",\n    \"1555\",\n    \"1540\",\n    \"1557\",\n    \"1508\",\n    \"1548\",\n    \"1505\",\n    \"1552\"\n  ]\n}"

Habituation to human presence showed varied results: an introduced golden lion tamarin population declined after one year, whereas most introduced black-and-white ruffed lemurs and diademed sifakas survived over 30 months, and a mountain gorilla population increased over 41 years following habituation, all alongside other interventions [1519]. Continuous on-site veterinary monitoring was associated with a 168% increase in mountain gorilla population size over 41 years, alongside other interventions [1554]. Training anti-poaching ranger patrols was associated with no gorillas killed over 21 months, increased numbers of immature gorillas, growth of a hoolock gibbon population, and a three-year period with no incidents of primate poaching, all alongside other interventions [1477]. Implementing monitoring/surveillance systems to guide law enforcement was followed by increased observations of gorillas and chimpanzees in Nigeria [1481].",

Put up signs to warn people about not feeding primates: one review in Japan found aggressive interactions between Japanese macaques and humans declined after prohibiting tourists from feeding monkeys [1507]. Do not allow people to consume food within natural areas where primates can view them: no evidence for effects on primate populations [1508]. Install ‘primate-proof’ garbage bins: no evidence for effects on primate populations [1505]. Remove human food waste that may potentially serve as food sources for primates: no evidence for effects on primate populations [1561]. Implement multimedia campaigns using theatre, film, print media, discussions: two before-and-after studies in Belize found black howler monkey numbers increased by 61–138% over 3–13 years after a multimedia campaign or opening a museum for wildlife education, alongside other interventions; two before-and-after studies in Brazil and Colombia found education programs focusing on tamarins improved attitudes and knowledge; one study in the Republic of Congo found large numbers of people were informed about lowland gorillas through theatre and film; one before-and-after study in Madagascar found poaching of diademed sifakas and black and white ruffed lemurs appeared to have ceased after distributing conservation books in schools; one before-and-after study in India found hoolock gibbon numbers increased by 66% over five years after an education and awareness programme, alongside other interventions; one before-and-after study in four African countries found visitors’ knowledge about primates increased after an education programme [1571].",

Three studies reported that the majority of primates survived with regular supplementary feeding (Brazil; South Africa; Indonesia). One study reported the majority of introduced chimpanzees survived for at least one year (Liberia). One controlled study found introduced black-and-white ruffed lemurs showed different diets from a resident wild group after a year of regular supplementation (Madagascar) [1526]. Scarce-period-only feeding: One before-and-after study reported the majority of chimpanzees survived for at least five years (Republic of Congo). One before-and-after study reported wild olive baboons survived for at least 17 years after drought-period feeding soon after translocation (Kenya). One controlled study reported that black-and-white ruffed lemur diets were similar to wild individuals after scarce-period feeding (Madagascar) [1527]. Limited-time feeding: One study reported a chimpanzee population increase after two months of post-reintroduction feeding (Tanzania). One before-and-after study reported a golden lion tamarin population declined after one year following supplementary feeding (Brazil). One study reported an abandoned infant muriqui was retrieved by its mother and rejoined the wild group after feeding (Brazil). Four studies reported that only a minority of reintroduced primates survived (Brazil; Madagascar; South Africa). One study reported the majority of introduced chimpanzees survived for at least 27 months (Guinea). Three studies reported a majority of primates survived reintroduction while being supplementary fed (Gabon; South Africa; Vietnam). Two studies reported the majority of lowland gorillas survived for at least nine months to four years (Gabon; Republic of Congo) [1528].\",\"action_ids\":[\"1526\",\"1527\",\"1528\"]}",
