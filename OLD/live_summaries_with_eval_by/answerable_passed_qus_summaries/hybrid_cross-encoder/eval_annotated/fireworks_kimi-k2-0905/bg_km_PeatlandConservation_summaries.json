    "relevant_summary": "When restoring peatlands afforested for commercial forestry, cutting trees and rewetting peat (Action 1732) shows more comprehensive restoration outcomes compared to only cutting trees (Action 1731). The combined approach increases abundance of wetland-characteristic plants (Action 1732), while tree removal alone only increases cover of some herb species like cottongrasses and sedges (Action 1731). Sphagnum moss responses differ significantly - the combined intervention increases Sphagnum cover (Action 1732), whereas tree removal alone decreases Sphagnum cover over three years (Action 1731). Both approaches increase plant species richness, though one study found the effect is smaller when trees are removed from rewetted plots compared to drained plots (Action 1731). Action 1756 (rewetting alone) demonstrates that water table management is crucial for peatland restoration, showing increased Sphagnum moss cover, reduced tree/shrub cover, and increased herb cover including sedges and cottongrasses.",

The lack of evidence means that the effectiveness and potential harmful impacts of these management interventions remain unassessed.\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"1751\",\n    \"1752\",\n    \"1753\",\n    \"1754\",\n    \"1749\",\n    \"1755\",\n    \"312\",\n    \"1619\",\n    \"3022\",\n    \"3023\",\n    \"3024\",\n    \"3025\"\n  ]\n}"

Sphagnum moss cover typically increases following rewetting, with 12 of 19 studies showing increased abundance, though responses can be species-specific (1756, 1732). Herb cover generally increases, particularly sedges (13 of 15 studies), cottongrass (8 of 9 studies), and reeds/rushes (5 of 7 studies) (1756, 1732). Tree and shrub cover typically decreases or shows no effect in 10 of 13 studies (1756). Overall plant species richness and diversity may increase, though results are mixed with some studies showing no effect or reduced diversity (1756, 1732). When combined with tree removal, rewetting increases wetland-characteristic plants and herb cover while reducing forest-characteristic vegetation (1732).",

Two replicated site comparison studies in fens or fen meadows in central Europe\\u00a0found that rewetting reduced the number of fen-characteristic plant species. Two studies (one replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after) in fens in Sweden\\u00a0reported that rewetting had no effect on cover of fen-characteristic plants.\\u00a0Two before-and-after studies in fens in the USA\\u00a0and New Zealand\\u00a0reported that upland plant cover decreased following rewetting.\\u00a0\\nMoss cover (19 studies):\\u00a0Twelve studies (five replicated, two also paired and controlled) in the UK, Ireland, Germany,\\u00a0Sweden, Latvia, Canada\\u00a0and Spain\\u00a0reported that rewetting bogs, fens or other peatlands (sometimes\\u00a0along with other interventions) increased Sphagnum moss cover or abundance. Three of these studies\\u00a0reported mixed responses by species. Two additional replicated studies, in bogs in Latvia\\u00a0and forested fens in Finland, reported that rewetting had no effect on Sphagnum\\u00a0cover. Five studies (one paired, controlled, before-and-after) in Finland, Sweden\\u00a0and Canada\\u00a0reported that rewetting bogs or fens had no effect on cover of non-Sphagnum mosses (or mosses/lichens). However, two controlled studies in bogs in Ireland\\u00a0and the UK\\u00a0reported that rewetting reduced cover of non-Sphagnum mosses\\u00a0or bryophytes. One site comparison study in Finland\\u00a0reported that a rewetted peatland had similar moss cover (Sphagnum and total) to a natural peatland, but another site comparison study in Canada\\u00a0reported that a rewetted bog had lower moss cover (Sphagnum and other) than nearby target peatlands.\\nHerb cover (25 studies): Twenty-one studies (including four replicated, paired, controlled) reported that rewetting (sometimes\\u00a0along with other interventions) increased cover of at least one group of herbs.

The evidence shows mixed but generally limited effects: most studies found no effect on herb cover including cottongrass and sedges, no consistent effect on Sphagnum moss cover, and no effect on shrub cover in many cases, though some studies showed increased shrub cover. One study found that livestock exclusion increased vegetation biomass but effects varied between wetter and drier areas of bogs.\n\nReducing Grazing Intensity (Action ID 1735): Only one study evaluated this approach specifically in bogs. This study found that lower grazing intensity was associated with greater total vegetation cover, greater shrub cover, greater cottongrass cover (for one species), and higher vegetation biomass.\n\nThe key comparison suggests that reducing grazing intensity shows more consistent positive effects on vegetation cover and biomass based on limited evidence, while complete livestock exclusion shows more variable results with many studies finding no significant effects on key peatland vegetation components.",

Cutting/mowing typically increases plant species richness and moss/bryophyte cover while reducing herb cover and abundance of reeds, sedges, and purple moor grass. Annual mowing regimes are particularly effective at altering plant community composition and increasing fen-characteristic plants. In contrast, grazing effects are more variable - it can increase cover of some herb groups like cottongrasses and sedges, but may reduce Sphagnum moss cover. One comparative study found that grazed fen meadows contained fewer plant species and fewer fen-characteristic species than mown meadows.

One site comparison study in Chile\\u00a0found that excluding livestock (along with other interventions) increased overall herb cover, but one replicated, paired, controlled study in bogs in Australia\\u00a0found that excluding livestock had no effect on overall herb cover.\\nMoss cover (6 studies): Five replicated, paired, controlled studies in bogs in the UK\\u00a0and Australia\\u00a0found that excluding livestock typically had no effect on\\u00a0Sphagnum\\u00a0moss cover. Responses sometimes varied between species and sites. Three of the studies in the UK also found no effect on cover of other mosses.\\u00a0One before-and-after study in a poor fen in Spain\\u00a0reported that Sphagnum moss appeared after excluding cattle (and rewetting).\\nTree/shrub cover (8 studies): Four replicated, paired, controlled studies in bogs in the UK\\u00a0and Australia\\u00a0found that excluding livestock had no effect on shrub cover (specifically heather\\u00a0or a heathland community). One replicated, paired, controlled study in a bog in the UK\\u00a0found that excluding sheep had no effect on heather cover in wetter areas, but increased heather cover in drier areas. Three studies (including two site comparisons) in bogs in the UK, fens in the USA\\u00a0and a peatland in Chile\\u00a0found that excluding or removing livestock increased shrub cover.\\nVegetation structure (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in a bog in the UK\\u00a0found that excluding sheep increased total vegetation, shrub and bryophyte biomass but had no effect on biomass of grass-like herbs.\"\n}"

For organic mulch covers after planting, multiple studies document benefits including increased germination rates for some species (grass and shrub), improved survival of planted mosses and sedges, increased growth of transplanted sedges, and increased vegetation cover (total vegetation, mosses/bryophytes, Sphagnum mosses, or vascular plants). However, some studies found no effect on vegetation cover, and one study reported that oil palm fruit mulch reduced survival of planted peat swamp tree seedlings.\n\nFor inorganic fertilizers, benefits include increased vegetation cover, plant species richness, herb and shrub growth (especially with phosphorus), increased survival of some planted tree species, and increased growth of planted mosses, herbs, and trees. However, fertilizers also showed harms including reduced survival of some tree species, no effect on growth for some species or in some conditions, and the benefits often depend on the specific chemical composition with phosphorus showing more effects than nitrogen or potassium.\n\nFresh peat amendment showed mixed results with higher cover of sown plant species compared to original bog surface, but fertilization could cancel out this beneficial effect. Organic mulch without planting increased the number of fen characteristic plants present but did not consistently affect their cover or Sphagnum moss cover.",

Direct planting of mosses (Action 1818) showed survival rates where 47 out of 50 Sphagnum-dominated sods survived for one year in a Lithuanian bog, with five before-and-after studies reporting increased moss cover after planting in at least some cases, including one study showing planted moss spread beyond the introduction site. In contrast, spreading moss fragments on the surface (Action 1821) involved thirteen studies across bogs and fens, with eleven studies showing Sphagnum moss presence after 1-4 growing seasons, though cover ranged from negligible to greater than 90%, and six controlled studies finding higher Sphagnum cover in sown versus unsown plots, with survival often requiring additional interventions like mulching. The moss layer transfer technique (Action 1804) represents a specific restoration approach using multiple interventions that showed development of bog-characteristic plant communities within 11 years and greater moss cover than unrestored areas after 4-8 years. Additional research comparing these specific methods directly could provide more definitive guidance for restoration practitioners.",

When combined with rewetting, tree removal shows more consistent benefits including increased cover of wetland-characteristic plants, Sphagnum moss cover, and herbaceous vegetation including cottongrasses and sedges (Action ID: 1732).\n\n**Water Table Management:**\nRewetting (raising the water table) is a fundamental intervention that shows increased wetland-characteristic plant abundance, improved Sphagnum moss cover (12 of 19 studies), and enhanced herb cover including sedges and cottongrasses (21 of 25 studies) (Action ID: 1756). This intervention typically reduces tree and shrub cover while promoting peatland vegetation.\n\n**Direct Planting:**\nDirect planting interventions include planting peatland mosses (Action ID: 1818), herbs (Action ID: 1819), and trees/shrubs (Action ID: 1820). Studies show planted mosses can survive and spread, increasing moss coverage. Planted herbs typically survive over 2-3 years, and most planted trees/shrubs show >50% survival over periods up to 13 years.\n\n**Seed Introduction:**\nIntroducing seeds of peatland trees/shrubs shows mixed results, with some studies reporting successful germination and survival of heather and willow seeds, and increased shrub cover in some cases (Action ID: 1824).\n\n**Site Stabilization Techniques:**\nAdditional interventions include stabilizing the peatland surface using materials like coconut fibre rolls (Action ID: 1815), applying organic mulch (Action ID: 1813), and using the moss layer transfer technique (Action ID: 1804) which has shown development of bog-characteristic plant communities within 11 years.\n\n**Supporting Interventions:**\nBuilding artificial bird perches can encourage seed dispersal (Action ID: 1817), and reprofiling/relandscaping (Action ID: 1807) can help prepare sites for vegetation recovery.",

    "relevant_summary": "Mowing benefits: Cutting/mowing in fen meadows altered overall plant community composition and increased cover of fen- or wet meadow-characteristic plants in multiple studies from Switzerland, Germany, Czech Republic and Poland. Mowing increased total moss or bryophyte cover in four studies from Belgium, Switzerland and Czech Republic. Eight studies in fens and fen meadows across the UK, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Czech Republic and Poland found that mowing increased plant species richness compared to no mowing or grazing. Mowing reduced cover of problematic herbs including bindweed, reeds, sedges, purple moor grass and grass-like plants overall, and reduced shrub cover in some cases.\n\nMowing trade-offs: Some studies found mixed effects on vegetation biomass and structure. Three studies reported that single mowing events had no effect on vegetation height, and two studies found single mows had no effect on bryophyte cover or plant species richness.\n\nGrazing benefits: Two UK studies reported that grazing with cattle or horses increased cover of some herb groups (cottongrasses, sedges or all grass-like plants) and reduced purple moor grass cover in some cases. One UK study found that plant species richness increased after grazing was reinstated. Grazing reduced shrub cover in one UK study.\n\nGrazing trade-offs: One replicated, paired, site comparison study in Germany found that grazed fen meadows contained fewer fen-characteristic plant species and fewer plant species overall than mown meadows. The overall plant community composition differed between grazed and mown fen meadows. Grazing reduced Sphagnum moss cover in one UK study and typically had no effect on shrub cover in another UK study. Two before-and-after studies in UK fens reported that there was typically no effect on plant species richness.",

Vegetation cover responses vary: four studies in Belgium, Switzerland, and the Czech Republic found mowing increased total moss or bryophyte cover, while studies in Sweden showed mixed effects on Sphagnum moss cover. Cutting problematic herbaceous plants typically increased Sphagnum moss cover while reducing purple moor grass cover. For large tree/shrub management, cutting and removal has been shown to alter plant community composition toward more open fen conditions, with studies in Sweden and the USA reporting increased species richness and cover of fen-characteristic plants. Physical removal of problematic plants such as moss carpets had mixed effects on herb cover and typically reduced total bryophyte and Sphagnum cover in the short term, though effects varied depending on drainage conditions. Tree removal from forest plantations increased herb cover including cottongrasses and sedges, while reducing forest-characteristic moss cover.

For large tree/shrub management, cutting and removal has been shown to alter plant community composition toward more open fen conditions, with studies in Sweden and the USA reporting increased species richness and cover of fen-characteristic plants. Physical removal of problematic plants such as moss carpets had mixed effects on herb cover and typically reduced total bryophyte and Sphagnum cover in the short term, though effects varied depending on drainage conditions. Tree removal from forest plantations increased herb cover including cottongrasses and sedges, while reducing forest-characteristic moss cover. The timing of cutting/mowing matters: summer mowing increased plant species richness more than spring or autumn mowing in UK fen meadows. Overall plant species richness typically increased with regular mowing regimes across 8 studies from various European fens.\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"1770\",\n    \"1761\",\n    \"1771\",\n    \"1768\",\n    \"1772\",\n    \"1731\",\n    \"1759\"\n  ]\n}"

The only alternative with direct evidence is reducing grazing intensity, which showed greater total vegetation and shrub cover compared to higher intensity grazing, with cottongrass responses varying by species, and higher vegetation biomass where grazing intensity was lower (1735). Changing livestock type, limiting livestock density near peatlands, and changing grazing timing have no direct evaluation studies, so their effectiveness remains unassessed (1736, 1786, 1737). Complete livestock exclusion typically had no effect on herb, moss, or shrub cover in most studies, with effects varying by site conditions - some showing increased shrub cover in drier areas or favoring dry moorland plants (1734). These findings suggest that moderate grazing intensity reduction may be a viable alternative to complete exclusion, though more research is needed on other livestock management modifications.",

Direct planting of Sphagnum mosses (action 1818) has demonstrated success across multiple studies, with Sphagnum cover ranging from negligible to >90% after 1-4 growing seasons, and six controlled studies showing higher cover in planted versus unplanted plots.\n\nThe moss layer transfer technique (action 1804) proved effective in Canadian bogs, with restored areas developing greater moss cover (including Sphagnum) than unrestored areas after 4-8 years, and vegetation becoming more similar to local natural bogs.\n\nAdding moss fragments to the peatland surface (action 1821) showed variable results, with Sphagnum present in sown plots across multiple studies, though survival was sometimes dependent on additional interventions.\n\nReplacing blocks of vegetation after extraction (action 1738) helped maintain Sphagnum cover similar to undisturbed fens, though one study noted Sphagnum cover declined in translocated bog blocks.\n\nSupporting techniques enhanced Sphagnum establishment: covering with organic mulch after planting (action 1828) increased Sphagnum cover in six studies across Canada, the USA, and Sweden; reprofiling basins before planting (action 1833) improved Sphagnum survival and cover compared to raised plots; and removing competing vegetation (action 1840) enabled Sphagnum survival where it otherwise failed.",
