    "relevant_summary": "Several management strategies for uncropped field margins have been shown to effectively support bumblebees on European farmland. Sowing uncropped margins with agricultural nectar and pollen mixes, particularly those containing perennial leguminous flowering plants, attracts significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated, grassy or cropped margins - though these mixes require re-sowing every few years as their value degrades over time. Native wildflower seed mixes also support higher abundance and species richness of bumblebees compared to cropped edges, with perennial leguminous herbs providing important forage sources, especially for long-tongued species. Naturally regenerated uncropped margins can support more bumblebees than cropped margins, though their value is often based on thistle species considered pernicious weeds and their benefits are not consistent year-to-year. Providing grass strips at field margins can enhance bumblebee abundance and diversity, with 6 m wide margins showing positive effects. Conservation headlands (unsprayed field margins within crops) do not attract more foraging bumblebees than conventional fields. Rough grassland areas in field margins also attract nest-searching queen bumblebees at higher densities than other habitat types during spring.",

Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes. In one trial, these introduced species more commonly occupied the boxes than native bees.\\nA small trial tested three soil-filled nest boxes for the mining bee Andrena flavipes in the UK, but they were not occupied.\"\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "Several evidence-based actions can support wild bee populations in urban areas and along infrastructure corridors. For power line corridors, evidence from Maryland, USA shows that managing land under power lines as scrub habitat supports more bee species than equivalent areas of annually mown grassland (Action 31). Stopping herbicide use on pavements and road verges increases butterfly species richness and abundance, with evidence from restored roadside prairies in the USA showing greater butterfly species richness where herbicide application was restricted compared to verges dominated by non-native vegetation (Action 3899). Managing land under power lines for butterflies and moths through mechanical cutting increases species richness compared to unmanaged land, with optimal timing being 2-4 years after scrub and trees are cleared (Action 3855). Altering mowing regimes on greenspaces and road verges to reduce mowing frequency or stop mowing entirely increases butterfly and moth species richness and abundance, with evidence from Germany and the UK showing less frequently mown urban greenspaces had higher butterfly and moth species richness and diversity (Action 3841). Establishing green infrastructure in urban areas, such as green roofs, provides habitat though evidence from Taiwan shows green roofs had lower butterfly species richness than urban parks (Action 3837). Restoring or maintaining species-rich grassland along road verges by sowing with native wildflowers and butterfly larval food plants increases both butterfly species richness and abundance, with evidence from Germany, UK, USA and Finland showing roadside prairies sown with more butterfly species' larval food plants had greater butterfly and burnet moth abundance (Action 3854).",

One trial found that over four years of artificial rearing, Bombus terrestris queens gradually decreased in weight.\\nThree trials have tried to rear North American bumblebees now declining or thought to be declining. Two induced spring queens of the half-black bumblebee B. vagans to rear adults in captivity, one trial induced queen yellow-banded bumblebees B. terricola (attempted in all three trials) and red-belted bumblebees B. rufocinctus (only attempted in one trial) to rear adults in captivity. All three trials tried to rear the yellow bumblebee B. fervidus and in all cases the queens laid eggs but the larvae died before becoming adults. One trial found the same pattern for the rusty-patched bumblebee and the American bumblebee B. pensylvanicus. One study reports rearing the large garden bumblebee B. ruderatus, a Biodiversity Action Plan species in the UK.\\nTwo trials have reported laboratory rearing of a pocket-making bumblebee, the Neotropical B. atratus.\\nThree replicated trials demonstrated that the pollen diet of captively reared bumblebees influences reproductive success. In one trial, buff-tailed bumblebee B. terrestris colonies fed on freshly frozen pollen produced larger queens that survived better and produced larger colonies themselves than colonies fed on dried, frozen pollen. Two replicated trials demonstrated that B. terrestris workers can produce more offspring when fed types of pollen with a higher protein content.\\nTwo replicated experiments showed that an artificial light regime of eight hours light, 16 hours darkness, can reduce the time taken for artificially reared queen B. terrestris to lay eggs, relative to rearing in constant darkness.\\nWe have captured two replicated trials examining the effect of different artificial hibernation regimes in B. terrestris. One showed that hibernation of queens at 4-5\\u00b0C for 45 days enhanced egg-laying and colony formation rates, but hibernated queens produced smaller colonies than non-hibernated queens. The second showed that queens should weigh more than 0.6 g (wet weight) and be hibernated for four months or less to have a good chance of surviving.\"\n}"

Agricultural nectar and pollen mixes containing perennial leguminous plants attract significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated, grassy or cropped field margins (action 18). However, these mixes degrade in their value over time and need to be re-sown every few years. Native wildflower mixes also support higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees compared to cropped edges, grassy margins or naturally regenerated areas (action 19), with perennial leguminous herbs being particularly important forage sources for long-tongued bumblebee species. Planting dedicated floral resources including phacelia has shown substantial foraging by wild bees, with trials recording 8-35 bee species visiting planted patches (action 17). Comparisons between mix types show that agricultural forage plant mixtures (including legumes) attract greater numbers of bumblebees than perennial wildflower mixes, at least in the first year after establishment. The evidence indicates that both agricultural and native wildflower mixes are effective, with agricultural mixes showing stronger initial attraction but requiring more frequent re-sowing to maintain effectiveness.",

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes. In one trial, these introduced species more commonly occupied the boxes than native bees.\\nA small trial tested three soil-filled nest boxes for the mining bee Andrena flavipes in the UK, but they were not occupied.\"\n}"

Another studied action is restricting certain pesticides - an Italian study showed that avoiding late summer applications of the insecticide fenitrothion can prevent reductions in solitary bee species that would otherwise occur. Providing buffer strips to reduce pesticide and nutrient run-off into field margins has also been examined, with a UK study finding that margins managed with restrictions on fertilizer and pesticide use had greater abundance of moths than conventionally managed margins. Reducing the intensity of farmland meadow management (which includes limited agrochemical use) was studied in four European trials, with two finding enhanced numbers and diversity of wild bees on meadows with delayed first cutting and little agrochemical use, while two others found no difference in bee diversity or abundance. More broadly, 38 studies across European countries investigated general reduction of fertilizers, pesticides or herbicides, with 34 studies finding benefits to some invertebrates, plants, or farmland birds, though 25 studies found negative, mixed, minimal or no effects on various organisms.",

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes.

At the local patch scale, fourteen trials in Europe and North America recorded substantial numbers of wild bees foraging on perennial or annual sown flowering plants in agricultural environments, with ten trials monitoring bees on phacelia patches finding substantial foraging wild bees, particularly bumblebees (Action ID: 17). However, evidence for wider population responses to local patches is mixed - one trial showed planted lupine patches enhanced reproductive success of blue orchard mason bees in apple orchards, but one Netherlands trial found no higher bee numbers or species richness in farmland 50-1,500 m from planted flower patches, and two German trials found few solitary bees nesting on set-aside fields sown with phacelia or clover (Action ID: 17). For field margin scale interventions, three UK trials on uncropped grassy field margins showed mixed effects - one showed 6 m wide margins enhanced wild bee abundance but not diversity at field boundaries, one showed enhanced bumblebee abundance and diversity within margins, while a third showed no differences (Action ID: 14).",

Four replicated trials demonstrated enhanced diversity and/or abundance of foraging wild bees under various European agri-environment schemes including Swiss Ecological Compensation Areas, German organic arable farming, Dutch botanical and meadow bird agreements, and Scottish Rural Stewardship Scheme. However, four other replicated trials found no enhancement in bee numbers or species under different schemes including Dutch wet grassland meadow bird agreements, Spanish steppe bird protection measures, and English 6m grass field margin strips. Two UK landscape-scale trials found bumblebee populations were not enhanced on farmland under agri-environment schemes. Specific location-based findings show that field margins sown with wild flowers in the UK supported higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees compared to cropped or grassy margins, while 6m wide grassy field margins showed mixed results with some UK trials enhancing abundance and diversity but others showing no difference. The effectiveness appears to depend on scheme design, with floral resource provision generally showing more positive results than simple grass margin creation.",

Four replicated trials in Europe found enhanced diversity and/or abundance of wild bees on meadows with reduced management intensity, specifically those with delayed first cutting and minimal agrochemical use (Action ID 22). Agri-environment schemes that include reduced management intensity have shown benefits for foraging wild bees in some European countries including Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Scotland (Action ID 24).\n\nRegarding specific management changes, reducing cutting frequency generally benefits pollinators including wild bees. Meadows cut once per year support higher species richness and abundance of butterflies and other pollinators compared to those cut two or more times per year (Action ID 3961). Delaying mowing or first grazing dates also provides benefits, with eight studies showing positive effects on invertebrates including increased insect visits to flowers (Action ID 131).\n\nHowever, the effects of completely ceasing management are more complex. While cessation of mowing or grazing to allow early succession can benefit some insect species, it may not be optimal for all wild bee species as succession progresses (Actions ID 3957, 3956). Rotational approaches that create varied sward heights and maintain some management appear beneficial, with studies showing that mowing parts of sites at different times and leaving some areas uncut can enhance pollinator species richness and abundance (Action ID 3966).",

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types.

One large replicated controlled trial (action 21, 362) found that the average abundance of long-tongued bumblebees on field margins was positively correlated with the number of pollen and nectar agri-environment agreements in a 10 km grid square, suggesting landscape-scale benefits from multiple interventions. However, for interventions targeting natural habitat restoration and connectivity, no evidence was found demonstrating effects on bee diversity or abundance in neighboring farms (action 6) or effects on wild bee communities from connecting habitat patches (action 10). While butterfly and moth studies show increased species richness and abundance with greater proportions of semi-natural habitat in landscapes (action 3910), specific evidence for bees is lacking. One study found more wild bee species and individuals in planted flower strips compared to unplanted strips (action 1406), but this represents immediate site effects rather than landscape-scale spillover.",

High rates of parasitism and mortality have been documented, with mortality rates ranging from 2-56% across different studies. Parasitism rates reached 36% for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India, and overall mortality reached 56% for the same species. Nest boxes can facilitate the spread and establishment of introduced species, with European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species using boxes more commonly than native bees in California, USA. This led to the development of exclusion methods specifically targeting introduced earwigs. Certain nest box designs have proven problematic - plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive due to parasitism or mould. Some nest box types, particularly surface wooden boxes commonly marketed for wildlife gardening, show very low uptake rates (0-2.5% in recent UK trials), questioning their effectiveness. For bumblebees, wooden surface or above ground boxes are not the most effective design and show consistently low occupancy rates. Additionally, soil-filled nest boxes for mining bee Andrena flavipes in the UK were not occupied at all in a small trial, suggesting this approach is ineffective.",

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes.
