A replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the UK (action 3415) found that removing turf before sowing seeds increased both grass and forb species richness in most cases compared to simply disturbing the soil before sowing. Topsoil removal also showed additional benefits including increased plant community similarity to intact steppe, enhanced species richness of sown plants, and improved seedling survival rates (3415). However, soil disturbance alone also showed some positive effects, such as increased abundance or species richness of specialist and generalist plant species (1728) and increased heathland plant numbers when combined with spreading heathland plant clippings (1711). Both approaches can reduce unwanted species - topsoil removal reduced cover of perennial rye-grass (1711) and common knapweed (3415), while soil disturbance reduced wavy hair grass cover (1685). The choice between methods may depend on specific restoration goals and site conditions, with topsoil removal showing more consistent positive outcomes but potentially requiring more intensive management.",

Annual mowing after sowing seeds also increased plant community similarity to natural grassland in Hungary (Action 3419). However, cutting and removing vegetation reduced sown grass and forb species cover compared to cutting without removal (Action 3419).\n\nIn comparison, grazing with livestock after sowing seeds showed mixed results. One UK study found that grazing with livestock after sowing reduced plant species richness compared to cutting vegetation after sowing (Action 3423). However, grazing with cattle after sowing increased sown species richness compared to grazing with sheep (Action 3423). The cover of sown species was reduced under cattle grazing compared to sheep grazing (Action 3423).\n\nA controlled study in the UK directly comparing the two management types found that cutting vegetation yearly after sowing seeds increased plant species richness compared to grazing with livestock (Actions 3419, 3423).",

Annual mowing after sowing seeds was found to increase plant community similarity to natural grassland in one study.\n\n**Vegetation removal before seeding/planting** (3416): Two studies examined this method with one showing increased germination rate of sown species when vegetation was removed, while the other showed mixed results across different species.\n\n**Sowing seeds in prepared gaps** (3409): One study found that sowing seeds in large gaps within vegetation led to greater cover of sown target plant species compared to smaller gaps.\n\n**Using erosion blankets** (3431): Three studies showed mixed results, with one finding increased plant species richness and density with organic blankets, while two others found no effect on vegetation cover.\n\n**Direct planting methods** showed variable success rates depending on the ecosystem and species involved, with some studies reporting good survival and others showing poor establishment.",

Six studies examined this approach - four in the UK, one in Switzerland, and one in Belgium. The effects showed some consistency across countries: five of six studies found that sowing parasitic plants (yellow rattle, European yellow rattle, or marsh lousewort) increased plant species richness and/or diversity, including studies in the UK, Switzerland, and Belgium. In the UK specifically, studies found that sowing yellow rattle led to decreased total plant biomass in three of four studies. In Belgium, sowing marsh lousewort seeds increased the abundance of six target plant species. Swiss studies showed that European yellow rattle decreased grass cover but did not alter forb cover. UK research demonstrated that yellow rattle establishment helped other target meadow species colonize and resulted in more plant species being present when yellow rattle was established.",

Adding topsoil before seeding increased plant species richness and the biomass of sown species in most cases, according to one study (Action 3420). When topsoil was added alongside seeding, it increased grass biomass but reduced forb biomass compared to adding topsoil alone (Action 1857). Conversely, removing topsoil before seeding increased plant species richness and community similarity to intact habitats, while also increasing the survival of seedlings and planted species (Actions 3415, 1711). Soil amendments with bacteria or fungi increased microbial diversity, soil organic matter, and crop yields in agricultural trials (Action 888), while compost amendments increased soil organic matter, microbial biomass, and fruit yield (Actions 889, 891).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from action documents, several management practices have been shown to affect plant survival in grassland restoration when combined with seeding or planting. Planting grassland plants directly (action 3399) resulted in 44% of new seedlings surviving over four months, and combining planting with seeding increased the number of both total plant species and native plant species compared to seeding alone. \n\nUsing nurse plants alongside seeding or planting (action 3402) showed mixed results for plant survival - one study found increased survival of planted plants when grown under nurse plants, while another found that any initial survival benefit disappeared after 2-3 years. Adding mulch before or after seeding/planting (action 3405) showed variable effects, with one study finding increased seed germination in most cases, and another finding that adding mulch after planting native prairie plants did not alter the growth of any of seven plant species.\n\nTiming of management interventions appears crucial for plant survival, as studies examining grazing at different times (action 2291) found differences in plant survival between plots grazed at different times in some comparisons. For maintaining established grasslands, traditional management practices including mowing and grazing have been shown to affect plant communities, with some studies finding that extensively managed semi-natural grasslands (through light grazing or annual mowing) can support higher species richness and abundance of plants compared to intensively managed areas.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on European grassland restoration studies, several site preparation techniques show effectiveness for increasing species richness before seeding. Soil disturbance before seeding, such as rotovating, has been found to increase both grass and forb species richness compared to lighter disturbance methods like harrowing (action 3413). Adding sulphur to soil before seeding showed mixed results, with one UK study finding it reduced plant species richness and vegetation cover (action 3428). Sowing seeds of parasitic species like yellow rattle has been shown to effectively increase plant species richness and diversity across five of six European studies (action 3404). For overall species-rich grassland restoration, effective techniques included in combination: grazing, introducing plant species, hay spreading and mowing (action 133). The evidence suggests that mechanical soil disturbance combined with sowing appropriate seed mixes, including parasitic species where suitable, provides the most consistent approach for increasing species richness in European grassland restoration projects.",

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done.

Thirty-four studies (of which 21 were replicated and controlled and seven also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found some positive effects on earthworms, some invertebrates (other than earthworms), weeds or farmland birds, of reducing tillage compared to conventional management. Positive effects included increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms, greater abundance of some invertebrates other than earthworms, increased numbers of some weeds and/or weed species, higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying date and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields, and greater abundance of some birds - including Eurasian skylark, seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in late winter on non-inversion or conservation tillage. A review found tillage had negative effects on invertebrate numbers and no-till systems had more invertebrate bird food resources.\\nTwenty-six studies (of which 13 replicated and controlled and three also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found reducing tillage had either negative, no effect or no consistent effects on abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates (other than earthworms), earthworm abundance, biomass, or species richness, number of different plant species found as seeds, number of some weed species, mammal abundance, some bird species, and one study found bird preferences for conservation tillage fields decreased over time.

One study in Spain specifically found that soil disturbance increased seedling survival, though another study in China found no effect on planted species survival (Action ID: 3413).\n\nTopsoil removal also showed positive effects on seedling survival, with two controlled studies showing that removing topsoil before planting significantly increased plant survival rates (Action ID: 3415). Additionally, topsoil removal increased species richness of sown plants and led to higher cover of planted species compared to other preparation methods.\n\nHerbicide application before seeding showed mixed results. While one study found herbicide application increased sown species richness, and another study found it increased the cover of sown grass species, one study found it reduced the density of native forb species (Action ID: 3418). A German study found that herbicide application increased seedling emergence in five of eight wildflower species tested.\n\nVegetation removal (without soil disturbance) showed moderate benefits, with one UK study finding it increased germination rate of sown species and another Belgian study finding it increased seedling numbers for some species (Action ID: 3416).",

    "relevant_summary": "The evidence on how grassland seeding and planting interventions affect vegetation structure is very limited. Across 13 different seeding and planting interventions examined, only 3 studies reported any effects on vegetation structure. For hydroseeding (spraying slurry of seed, mulch and water), one replicated, controlled study in Italy found that this intervention led to an increase in the height of herb species. For sowing grassland seeds from a local source, two replicated studies (one controlled and one site comparison) in the USA and Italy found that this intervention did not alter vegetation height compared to sowing non-native grass seeds or a commercial seed mix. No other vegetation structure measurements were reported for any of the other interventions including: adding topsoil before seeding/planting, removing vegetation before seeding/planting, sowing seeds in prepared gaps within vegetation, adding fertilizer to soil before or after seeding/planting, removing leaf litter before seeding/planting, adding woody debris to protect seeds/plants, using erosion blanket after seeding/planting, applying herbicide before seeding/planting, transferring plant material from intact grassland, and sowing seeds at a higher density. The vast majority of studies focused on vegetation community composition, abundance, and germination/survival outcomes rather than structural characteristics.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on studies from North American grasslands, sowing grass seeds has shown several documented impacts on native forbs and shrubs. In studies of sowing native grass and forbs (action 3432), three of four replicated, randomized, controlled studies in the Czech Republic and the USA found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased the cover or density of forb species. However, studies of sowing grass seeds alone (action 3397) showed negative impacts: two replicated studies in the USA and Canada found that sowing grass seeds reduced the abundance of native forb species in one study, while the other found no change in native forb density. For shrubs specifically, two replicated studies in the USA and Canada found that sowing grass seeds reduced the abundance of shrub species. Additionally, when examining sowing seeds at higher density (action 3405), one site comparison study in the USA found that sowing grass seeds at higher density reduced the cover of native grassland shrubs. These findings suggest that while sowing a mix of native grasses and forbs can benefit forb abundance, sowing grass seeds alone tends to have neutral to negative effects on native forb and shrub abundance in North American grasslands.",

For mowing management, one UK study (action 3419) found that cutting vegetation yearly after sowing seeds increased plant species richness compared to grazing with livestock, and another UK study found that cutting sown plots each year and removing cut vegetation increased sown grass and forb species richness compared to not removing cut vegetation. Mowing after seeding also increased the richness and abundance of sown forb species in UK studies, with more frequent mowing increasing abundance of multiple sown forb species. For grazing management after seeding, one UK study (action 3423) found that grazing with livestock reduced plant species richness compared to cutting vegetation after sowing, but increased sown species richness when cattle were used instead of sheep. However, cattle grazing reduced the cover of sown species compared to sheep grazing. One UK study found that grazing with livestock after sowing seeds reduced plant species richness compared to cutting vegetation after sowing, while winter grazing resulted in higher survival of cut-leaved cranesbill seedlings. The comparison between mowing and grazing cessation shows that ceasing mowing (action 3957) and ceasing grazing (action 3956) leads to early succession changes, with abandoned grasslands showing different community composition and abundance patterns compared to managed areas.",
