    "relevant_summary": "Ten studies evaluated the effects of coppicing on butterflies and moths, eight in the UK, one in France, and one in Germany [3939]. Fourteen studies assessed the impact of clearing or opening patches in forests on butterflies and moths, with five in the UK, two in Finland, two in Japan, one in Sweden, one in the USA, one in Canada, one in the Czech Republic, and one review across Europe [3938]. Six studies investigated the effects of thinning trees on butterflies and moths, with three in the USA and one in each of Côte d’Ivoire, Finland, and the Czech Republic [3940].\n\nThree replicated studies in the UK, Japan, and the Czech Republic found that cleared forest patches had a higher species richness of butterflies but a lower species richness of moths than unmanaged areas or closed-canopy forests [3938]. Similarly, a study in the Czech Republic showed that partially-cleared forest plots had more butterfly species but fewer moth species than closed-canopy forests [3940]. One study in the UK discovered that wider woodland rides and coppiced woodland hosted more unique macro-moth species than standard-width rides or mature forest [3938, 3939]. Another UK study found that coppiced woodland had a greater butterfly species richness than unmanaged woodland, while a separate study noted lower macro-moth species richness in coppiced woodland compared to mature forest [3939]. The species richness and diversity of fruit-feeding butterflies were similar between a thinned forest and an unmanaged one in Côte d’Ivoire, although rarer species were less common in the thinned forest [3940]. In the UK and France, moth and butterfly communities differed in coppiced woodlands of varying ages [3939].\n\nFive studies in the UK, Finland, Sweden, and Japan revealed that cleared forest patches had a higher abundance of butterflies, including species like the chequered blue, woodland brown, high brown fritillary, and small pearl-bordered fritillary, compared to unmanaged or coppiced areas [3938]. Conversely, a UK study indicated that wider rides had a lower abundance of macro-moths than standard-width rides or mature forest [3938]. Four studies in the USA and Finland found that thinned coniferous woodland, sometimes combined with other management like prescribed burning, had a higher abundance of all or specialist butterflies than unmanaged woodland [3940]. Two UK studies reported a higher abundance of butterflies in general, and the heath fritillary in particular, in coppiced woodland versus unmanaged woodland [3939]. However, another UK study observed lower macro-moth abundance in coppiced woodland compared to mature forest, with no change based on the age of the coppice [3939]. The timing of management is also a factor, with one UK study showing that patches cleared 2–4 years prior had a greater abundance of heath fritillary than patches cleared 7–11 years ago or within the first year of clearance [3938]. Similarly, studies in the UK, France, and Germany found butterfly abundance to be higher in woodland coppiced 2, 2–4, 5–7, or 12–15 years ago than in areas coppiced 5–11 or more than 15 years ago [3939]. A review across Europe reported that clearing small forest patches benefited 19 out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern [3938]. Finally, a UK study reported an increase in breeding sites for the pearl-bordered fritillary and Duke of Burgundy in cleared forest patches that were also managed with cutting, grazing, and ride widening [3938].",

Four replicated studies in the USA found that under a rotational burning plan, the abundance of prairie specialist butterflies was higher on prairies that had been burned more than one, two, or four years ago compared to those burned more recently (3883). However, other studies found that rotational burning in prairies resulted in more strongly declining populations of grass-skipper butterflies compared to unmanaged fields and had negative impacts on the abundance of three fritillary species in at least one region (3883). Furthermore, a replicated, randomized, controlled study in the USA found no difference in the species richness of butterflies between prairies managed with annual rotational burning and those under complete burning (3883).",

    "relevant_summary": "Altering mowing regimes on greenspaces and road verges has been shown to affect butterflies and moths. Two studies found that less frequently mown or unmown urban greenspaces had a higher species richness and diversity of butterflies and moths than more frequently mown areas (3841). Unmown public parks and road verges also had a higher abundance of all adult butterflies (3841). One study reported that roadsides mown in late summer had more ringlet butterflies than those mown in mid-summer (3841). Furthermore, road verges mown less frequently or later in the summer had fewer dead butterflies killed by traffic (3841). One study found that scarce copper butterflies more frequently occupied less frequently mown urban grasslands (3841). However, one study found that the management of road verges and land under power lines did not affect butterfly species richness (3841). In the Netherlands, one study noted that butterflies were only recorded on mowed verges where hay was removed (3841).\n\nRegarding herbicide use, one study in the USA found that restored roadside prairies with restricted herbicide application had greater butterfly species richness and abundance and a lower butterfly mortality risk compared to verges dominated by non-native weeds and grasses with no herbicide restrictions (3899). Conversely, a Canadian study found that transmission lines (road verges and power lines) that were not sprayed or mown had a similar species richness of butterflies to those that were sprayed and mown (3899).\n\nFor land under power lines, two studies in Finland found that land managed by mechanical cutting had a higher species richness of butterflies than unmanaged land, with the highest richness observed 2-4 years after scrub and tree clearance (3855). One study in Canada, however, found similar butterfly species richness under power lines and on road verges, regardless of whether they were mown once or twice a year, or left unmown (3855). In terms of abundance, one study found that mechanically cut land under power lines had a higher abundance of butterflies than unmanaged land (3855). Another study found that land under power lines and on road verges managed by mowing had a lower abundance of some butterfly species but a similar abundance of others when compared to unmown areas (3855). The time since management also plays a role, with one study finding that chequered skipper abundance was highest in areas cleared within the last two years (3855), and another study noting that pearl-bordered fritillaries used areas where scrub had been cleared one or two years earlier, but not three or more years ago (3855).",

One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in Australia found that managing a tropical savanna and floodplain with early season burning for 2-5 years increased the abundance of caterpillars, but management with late season burning did not [3878].\\n\\nConversely, one replicated, before-and-after study in Australia reported that in the spring after selective burning of eucalyptus forest, there were fewer Eltham copper caterpillars than before the burn [3877]. One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that one out of nine specialist butterfly species was less abundant in pine barrens and prairies where unburned areas were left during prescribed burning compared to at sites without unburned areas [3879].\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"3877\",\n    \"3878\",\n    \"3879\"\n  ]\n}"

Forty-one studies from eight European countries (including five reviews and twenty-three replicated controlled studies, of which one randomized and two site comparisons) found evidence that flower strips had a positive influence on invertebrate numbers with increased abundance, species richness/diversity, or both. Ten studies (nine replicated of which two controlled) found invertebrates visited or foraged on flower strips but did not specify increases/decreases in numbers. Two studies found effects on ground beetles other than changes in numbers. One replicated controlled study showed that ground beetles were more active or had enhanced feeding/reproductive conditions in flower strips. A review found flower strips supported ground beetle species that were rarely found in crops. Fifteen studies reported mixed or negative effects of flower strips on invertebrates. Six studies found no significant effects.\\n\\n\\nTwenty-one studies looked at the effects of flower strips on plants. Sixteen studies from seven European countries (including ten replicated controlled studies of which one randomized) found evidence that flower strips had higher plant cover, number of flowers, diversity, and species richness. One review found flower strips benefited plants but did not specify how. Four studies found negative or no effects of flower strips on the number or diversity of plant species.\\u00a0Five studies described the effects of different margin establishment or management techniques on plants.\\n\\n\\nSeven studies investigated birds and wildflower strips. Four replicated, controlled studies from Switzerland and the UK (two of which were randomized) and one review of European studies found evidence that plots sown with a wildflower or legume seed mix had a positive influence on birds. Flower strips attracted more birds or bird species and the number of birds using flower strips increased over time. Eurasian skylarks preferentially foraged in, and nested in or near, sown weed patches and were less likely to abandon their territories when they included sown weed patches. However one replicated trial in Switzerland found barn owls avoided sown wildflower areas. Two winter recording periods of the same replicated, controlled study in the UK found there were not more bird species or individuals on wildflower plots compared to control margins.\\n\\n\\nAll five studies investigating the effects of wildflower strips on small mammals (four replicated studies from Switzerland and one review of studies from north-western Europe) found evidence that small mammals benefit from strips sown with wildflowers or flowers rich in pollen and nectar, with increases in abundance, density and species richness. One replicated study from Switzerland reported that most common vole home ranges and core regions of their territories were found within a wildflower strip.\\n\\n\\nNineteen studies (of which eight replicated, controlled) reported positive effects on biodiversity of sowing specific plant species including\\u00a0phacelia,\\u00a0and/or other plant species such as borage and red clover. Three replicated studies (two also controlled) found negative impacts or no effects on biodiversity of sowing phacelia.\"\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "Ceasing mowing on grasslands has shown varied effects on butterfly populations. Two studies found that the butterfly and moth community composition in grasslands abandoned for over 5 years was similar to that in managed grasslands [3957]. However, another study reported that over 6 years of abandonment, the butterfly community became dominated by generalist species [3957]. In terms of species richness, five of seven studies found that grasslands abandoned for 3-20 years had a similar number of butterfly and moth species to mown grasslands [3957]. In contrast, one study found that grasslands abandoned for more than 50 years had lower butterfly species richness [3957]. The abundance of butterflies also showed mixed results, with some studies finding a lower abundance of certain butterfly species in grasslands abandoned for over a year [3957], while others found a higher abundance of all butterflies in grasslands left uncut for a summer [3957]. Some studies also noted a shift in community composition, with an increase in woodland and hedgerow butterfly species but a decrease in grassland species in abandoned meadows [3957].\n\nSimilarly, the cessation of grazing on grasslands has led to a range of outcomes for butterflies. Two studies found that the butterfly and moth community composition in grasslands abandoned for more than 5 years was similar to that in grazed grasslands [3956]. However, another study observed that after 6 years of abandonment, the butterfly community was dominated by generalist species [3956]. Butterfly species richness in abandoned grasslands was found to be similar to grazed grasslands in six of nine studies [3956], while some studies found lower richness [3956] and others found higher richness in abandoned grasslands [3956]. One study also found that species richness was highest in grasslands where grazing had ceased for 2-9 years compared to those abandoned for longer or those currently being grazed [3956]. Butterfly abundance also varied, with some studies reporting higher numbers in abandoned grasslands [3956], while others found lower [3956] or similar numbers [3956]. Additionally, some studies found that an increase in woodland and hedgerow butterflies was accompanied by a decrease in grassland species, with the extinction of some species in abandoned meadows [3956]. A review in Europe noted that ceasing grazing benefited six out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern [3956].",

For moths, studies found that their abundance and species richness were similar in woodland that was coppiced 1-4, 5-8, and 12-20 years ago (3939).

Excluding predators, such as birds, mammals, spiders, and ants, was found to increase the survival of large copper caterpillars, Boisduval silkworm eggs and caterpillars, and Appalachian brown eggs and juveniles in three of five studies. However, two studies showed no increase in monarch caterpillar survival after excluding vertebrate or terrestrial predators (3889). Fencing out or reducing non-native pigs and deer was found in two of four studies to increase butterfly and macro-moth species richness (3891). Another two studies showed mixed effects on species richness after excluding elk, and one global review found no effect from reducing or removing grazing in certain forests (3891). The abundance of butterflies, moths, and caterpillars was found to increase in five of eight studies when excluding or reducing deer, sheep, pigs, and other large herbivores, while a global review also found that reducing or removing grazing increased butterfly and moth abundance (3891). In one study, the survival of Glanville fritillary caterpillar nests was 100% in a fenced-off area to exclude sheep, compared to 88% in a grazed area, and fewer nests were damaged (3891).",

    "relevant_summary": "The success of captive breeding and release programs for butterflies and moths is influenced by several factors. Releasing captive-bred individuals has led to populations persisting for 2-28 years and increasing in abundance (3914). However, other studies show populations dying out within 1-12 years, with one review indicating that only 25% of released populations survive for more than three years, and only 8% for more than ten years (3914). Similarly, translocated populations have been reported to persist for between 2 and 49 years, while others have died out in as little as 0-7 years (3909). The success of these programs can be dependent on continued releases to supplement the population (3914, 3909). \n\nHabitat management at the release site is a significant factor. Practices such as coppicing, selective felling, planting, fencing, host plant translocation, invasive plant removal, sheep grazing, and scrub clearance have been associated with the persistence and increased abundance of translocated populations (3909). For example, captive-bred pearl-bordered fritillaries released into coppiced woodland successfully bred at least once (3914). The life stage at which individuals are released varies, with releases of eggs, caterpillars, pupae, and adults all being recorded (3914). The specific conditions of the release site are also important; for instance, the survival of large blue caterpillars was higher when they were translocated into nests of the ant Myrmica sabuleti that did not have a queen present (3909). Comparative studies have found that translocated large copper caterpillars had a higher survival rate than captive-bred ones (3909), and that released, captive-bred large copper caterpillars had lower survival rates than their captive, wild, or translocated counterparts (3914). Nineteen years after translocation, a population of large blue butterflies in the UK showed similar genetic diversity to its Swedish source population (3909). Following a release of captive-bred large coppers, the number of eggs laid per female increased over the first three years (3914).",

    "relevant_summary": "Planting new hedges and managing existing ones provides numerous benefits for butterfly and moth conservation on farmland. Studies in the UK, Ireland, and Canada have shown that established hedgerows support a higher species richness of butterflies and macro-moths compared to other farm habitats like beetle banks, crops, or pastures (3976). The abundance of butterflies and moths is also greater along hedgerows than in open fields or on grass margins (3976). The composition of the hedge is important, as planting species like gorse, oak, and blackthorn can support a higher number of arthropod species, including caterpillars, than the more commonly planted hawthorn (3976).\n\nThe management of existing hedgerows also plays a crucial role. Hedgerows with a more complex structure, such as those with trees, have a higher diversity of butterflies and moths (3975). Management practices like cutting hedgerows less frequently (every 2-3 years), cutting in autumn, or allowing for incremental growth can increase the abundance of butterflies, moths, and their caterpillars (3975). The height and shape of the hedge also matter; hedgerows kept between 1-2 meters tall in Italy and those with scalloped edges in Belgium have been found to support more butterflies and their eggs (3975). Laid or coppiced hedges in the UK also had a higher abundance of butterflies than unmanaged ones (3975). Furthermore, providing training and advice to landowners about agri-environment schemes has resulted in the management of large areas of farmland for the benefit of species like the marsh fritillary butterfly (3846).",

In contrast, traditional hay meadows mown once a year supported a higher abundance of heath fritillary adults and caterpillars than old, abandoned meadows (3908). Summer-grazed or mown grasslands were found to have a lower abundance of woodland butterflies and burnet moths than abandoned grasslands (3908). Additionally, after a reduction in management, the abundance of two butterfly species decreased, and 12 species of moth showed a preference for more intensively managed grasslands (3958).\n\nPotential benefits of abandoning or reducing management intensity on grasslands include a higher species richness of butterflies and moths (3958). Less intensively managed grasslands may also support more specialist moth species, species of conservation concern, and butterfly species with specific host plant requirements (3958). Several studies found that the abundance of butterflies, micro-moths, and declining macro-moths was higher in low-input or unfertilized, ungrazed grasslands (3958). One study found that butterflies were less abundant in managed grasslands compared to unmanaged ones (3908). Similarly, unmown grasslands were found to have a higher abundance and species richness of nocturnal moths compared to mown grasslands (3908).

    "relevant_summary": "In European forests, comparing the effects of coppicing and clearing patches on butterfly and moth communities reveals varied impacts.\n\nIn terms of community composition, coppiced woodland and wider woodland rides were found to have more unique species of macro-moths than mature forest or standard width rides (3938, 3939). Different aged coppiced woodlands supported different communities of butterflies and moths (3939).\n\nFor species richness and diversity, cleared patches in forests showed a greater species richness of butterflies but a lower species richness of moths when compared to unmanaged patches, coppiced woodland, or closed-canopy forests (3938). One study noted a decline in butterfly species richness over the first three years after clearing (3938). In contrast, coppiced woodland was found to have a greater species richness of butterflies than unmanaged woodland (3939). However, it also had a lower species richness of macro-moths than mature forest, and the age of the coppice did not affect this (3939). Another study found that woodland coppiced two years prior had a greater butterfly species richness than woodland coppiced more than 15 years prior (3939). The species richness of moths was similar in woodland that was coppiced 1-4, 5-8 and 12-20 years ago (3939).\n\nRegarding population abundance, cleared forest patches that were also coppiced and grazed had a higher abundance of butterflies in general, including species like the chequered blue, woodland brown, high brown fritillary, and small pearl-bordered fritillary, compared to unmanaged or solely coppiced areas (3938). However, the abundance of butterflies in these cleared patches declined over the first three years after clearing (3938). Larger cleared patches supported a higher abundance of butterflies than undisturbed forest (3938), while wider rides had a lower abundance of macro-moths than standard width rides or mature forest (3938). In coppiced woodlands, a higher abundance of butterflies, particularly the heath fritillary, was observed compared to unmanaged woodland (3939). Populations of pearl-bordered fritillary and small pearl-bordered fritillary were also more likely to persist in coppiced woodland (3939). Conversely, the abundance of macro-moths was lower in coppiced woodland than in mature forest, with no change in abundance based on the age of the coppice (3939). The timing of coppicing was also a factor, with higher butterfly abundance found in woodlands coppiced 2, 2-4, 5-7, or 12-15 years ago compared to those coppiced 5-11 or over 15 years ago (3939). After coppicing along with other management like scrub control and grazing, the abundance of high brown fritillary and small pearl-bordered fritillary increased (3939). Across Europe, clearing small patches in forests was reported to benefit 19 out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern (3938).",
