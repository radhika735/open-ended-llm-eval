However, one study on northern leopard frogs did not find this heat treatment to be effective [770].

    "relevant_summary": "In Mallorca, captive-bred Mallorcan midwife toads released as tadpoles, toadlets, or adults established breeding populations at 38% to 100% of sites (873). One study in the UK found that while predator defenses were maintained in a reintroduced captive-bred population, genetic diversity was reduced (873). Captive-bred Mallorcan midwife toads have been successfully raised to metamorphs or toadlets, with one UK study showing an 85% survival rate to metamorphosis (837). However, long-term captive breeding of this species (nine or more generations) has been associated with slower tadpole development, a reduction in one predator defense trait, and decreased genetic diversity (837). In contrast, reintroduction programs for the green and golden bell frog in Australia have had less success. Studies found that captive-bred green and golden bell frogs, released mainly as tadpoles, either did not establish breeding populations or only established them in one out of four release programs (872). Some captive-bred green and golden bell frogs released as tadpoles were found to have survived for at least 13 months after release (872). Other studies in Australia showed that a high proportion of captive-bred frogs released as eggs survived to metamorphosis, and there was limited breeding by released frogs (870). Additionally, the removal of viperine snakes in Mallorca led to an increase in the number of Mallorcan midwife toad larvae (830), and the addition of salt to a pond in Australia helped a population of green and golden bell frogs remain free of chytridiomycosis for at least six months (762).",

    "relevant_summary": "Two studies in Germany found that closing roads during breeding migrations protected large numbers of amphibians from death (842). This was the case at sites with only road closures and at sites that also had assisted crossings and barrier fences (842). Seven of eight studies found that installing barrier fencing along with culverts decreased amphibian road deaths (756). The effectiveness of these barriers can be dependent on the length and material of the fence (756). Some amphibians, such as treefrogs and 10% of common toads, were found to be able to climb over barrier fencing (756). For green frogs and leopard frogs, barriers of at least 0.6 m high were required to prevent them from climbing over (756). One study found that only a low number of amphibians were diverted by barriers (756). In six of seven studies, the installation of culverts or tunnels as road crossings was found to significantly decrease amphibian road deaths, although one of these studies noted this was only true when barrier fencing was also installed (884). One study found no effect on road deaths from installing culverts or tunnels (884). Fifteen of twenty-four studies found that culverts and tunnels were used by amphibians, however, five studies found that they were used by less than 10% of amphibians or not used at all (884). The use of culverts and tunnels by amphibians can be affected by their diameter, length, lighting, and substrate (884). Some culvert designs were found to be unsuitable for amphibians, and one study highlighted that thousands of amphibians were still killed on the road where tunnels were installed (884).",

In one instance, 70% of release sites were populated (875), and for Mallorcan midwife toads, breeding populations were established at 38% to 100% of sites (873). Head-starting amphibians has also been shown to establish or increase populations of frogs and toads. Nine out of ten studies found that head-started amphibians metamorphosed, survived their first season, winter or year, or bred successfully (881). Furthermore, four studies found that frog survival to metamorphosis and size at metamorphosis was greater, and time to metamorphosis was shorter in head-started individuals when compared to their wild counterparts (881).\n\nHowever, there are also documented negative impacts. The release of captive-bred toads did not lead to established populations in one study (875). In Puerto Rico, the survival of released captive-bred Puerto Rican crested toads was low, with 25% being predated within just two days of release (875). For the Mallorcan midwife toad, a reintroduced population that was captive-bred was found to have reduced genetic diversity (873).

Antifungal treatments have been found to be effective in many cases, with twelve out of sixteen studies showing they cured or increased the survival of amphibians with the disease (882). Specifically, the fungicide itraconazole was effective at curing amphibians in six of eight studies (882). Additionally, temperature treatment has shown promise, with four out of five studies demonstrating that increasing the enclosure or water temperature to 30–37°C for over 16 hours cured frogs and toads of chytridiomycosis (770).\n\nHowever, these treatments are not always successful. In four studies, antifungal treatments did not cure the disease but only reduced infection levels or had mixed results (882). Furthermore, some fungicides were found to cause death or other negative side effects in amphibians in six studies (882). One study found that itraconazole only reduced infection levels, and another reported mixed effects (882). Temperature treatment also has its limitations, as one study found that heat treatment did not cure northern leopard frogs (770). Lastly, a study on wild midwife toads found that treating them with a fungicide, in conjunction with pond drying, only reduced infection levels and did not eradicate the chytridiomycosis (767).",
