Two of these studies also found that grassland abandoned for 4\\u00a0or 5\\u201310\\u00a0years had a similar species richness of butterflies and day-flying moths\\u00a0and all moths\\u00a0to grassland lightly grazed by cattle\\u00a0or sheep/sheep and cattle.\\n\\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (24 STUDIES)\\n\\nAbundance (24 studies): Six of 20 replicated studies (including one paired, controlled, before-and-after study, three randomized controlled studies, and 15 site comparison studies) in Germany, the USA, the UK, Switzerland, Finland, Sweden, Spain, the Czech Republic\\u00a0and Israel\\u00a0found that grasslands which had been abandoned for 1-25 years had a higher abundance of Scotch argus, butterflies and day-flying moths, nocturnal moths, caterpillars, and of small insects including caterpillars, than grasslands grazed by goats, sheep\\u00a0and/or cattle. Two of these studies only found a difference compared to grazing at commercial/intensive, not low, densities. Four of the studies found that grasslands which had been abandoned for two weeks, 5\\u201320 years\\u00a0or an undetermined time\\u00a0had a lower abundance of butterflies\\u00a0and spring webworm caterpillars\\u00a0than grasslands grazed by cattle\\u00a0or a mix of livestock\\u00a0(in two studies grazing and mowing were not distinguished). A further four of the studies found that grasslands which had been abandoned for 5-15 years had a similar abundance of butterflies, burnet moths, day-flying moths\\u00a0and meadow neb moth caterpillars\\u00a0to grasslands grazed by sheep, horses and cattle\\u00a0or a mix of livestock. A further four of the studies found that in grasslands which had been abandoned for &gt;10 years, many years\\u00a0or an unspecified number of years, and in one case with burning, abundance or density was mixed depending on butterfly\\u00a0and moth\\u00a0species compared to grasslands grazed by cattle\\u00a0or unspecified grazers\\u00a0or grazed with cattle and burned. The other study found that butterfly density was higher in grasslands where grazing ceased 2\\u20139 years ago than those abandoned &gt;10 years ago or those currently grazed. Two replicated studies (including one controlled, before-and-after study and one site comparison study) in Spain\\u00a0and Germany\\u00a0found that grasslands which had been abandoned for 1\\u20136 years\\u00a0or an unspecified time period\\u00a0had a higher abundance of woodland and hedgerow butterflies\\u00a0and burnet moths, but a lower abundance of grassland\\u00a0or farmland\\u00a0species, than grasslands managed by grazing and/or mowing (results not distinguished). Two studies also found that the large blue\\u00a0and silver-studded blue\\u00a0went extinct in some abandoned meadows. One replicated, site comparison study in Sweden\\u00a0found that grasslands which were ungrazed for the year had a lower abundance of clouded Apollo butterflies than lightly grazed grasslands, but a higher abundance than heavily grazed grasslands. One review in Europe\\u00a0reported that ceasing grazing on grassland benefitted six out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (3 STUDIES)\\n\\nUse (3 studies): One replicated, paired, site comparison study in Germany\\u00a0found that grassland which had been abandoned for &gt;5 years had a similar occurrence of hoary bell moth caterpillars to grassland grazed by sheep. One replicated, site comparison study in the UK\\u00a0found that a similar proportion of grasslands which had been abandoned for one year, and grazed grasslands, contained &gt;20 marsh fritillary caterpillar webs. One replicated, site comparison study in Spain\\u00a0found that grizzled skipper and painted lady occurred less frequently, but small pearl-bordered fritillary occurred more frequently, in meadows which had been abandoned for at least 1\\u20132 years than in meadows managed by grazing or mowing (results not distinguished).\"\n}"

One study found that it did not alter plant species richness (3429), while another found it increased the abundance of target species that were a local conservation priority (3429). Mycorrhizal inoculation was also found to increase the height of giant sacaton plants, but it did not increase their biomass or emergence (3429). Another study found that inoculating soil with mycorrhizal fungi before sowing seeds initially increased vegetation cover, but this effect was not present after three years (3429). There is no evidence for the effect of inoculating tree seedlings with mycorrhizae (1160).\n\nAdding topsoil before seeding or planting has been shown to be beneficial in some cases. One study found that adding topsoil before sowing seeds increased plant species richness and the biomass of sown species in most cases (3420). Another study found that the addition of topsoil alongside sowing of seed increased the biomass of grasses but reduced the biomass of forbs when compared to the addition of topsoil alone (1857).\n\nOther soil amendments have also been studied. Amending the soil with a mix of manure and inorganic fertilizers has been found to increase microbial biomass, activity, and diversity, as well as the amount of organic carbon in the soil and maize yield (902). The addition of fresh plant material or crop remains to the soil has been shown to increase microbial biomass and carbon levels, and in some cases, has led to a reduction in soil loss and an increase in crop yields (910). Incorporating plant remains that produce weed-controlling chemicals can reduce weed growth, but the effects can be variable and may not last long. The impact of these remains on crop growth and yield is mixed, with some studies showing inhibition and others showing positive effects (728).",

This approach in Germany also increased the cover of these target species (3406). Furthermore, another study in Germany showed that sowing seeds from a local source increased the abundance of one of the four sown characteristic plant species (3400). In the broader context of sowing native seeds in Europe, multiple studies have noted positive outcomes. Six out of nine studies in Europe found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased the species richness of characteristic grassland plants (3432). Additionally, three studies in the UK and the Czech Republic reported an increase in the richness of sown species after sowing native grass and forbs (3432). Of twenty-eight studies conducted in Europe, North America, and New Zealand, sixteen found an increase in overall plant species richness from sowing native grass and forb seeds (3432).",

In the US, a study on hydroseeding demonstrated an increased abundance of half of the sown plant species compared to drill seeding (3412).

However, two replicated, controlled studies in the USA, one of which was randomized, found that increasing the number of species in a seed mix led to an increase in the species richness of sown plants (3406). Regarding plant cover, one of two replicated, controlled studies in the USA, one of which was randomized, reported that increasing the number of species in a seed mix increased the cover of sown plant species, while the other study found no change (3406).\n\nWhen using seeds from a local source, one replicated study in the USA and Germany showed an increase in vegetation cover over time compared to areas sown with non-native seeds, but a decline in the density of individual plants (3400). Another replicated, randomized, controlled experiment in the USA found that sowing Sandberg bluegrass seeds from a local source did not affect the survival of sown plants compared to non-local varieties (3400). Furthermore, a replicated study in the USA and Italy indicated that sowing grassland seeds from a local source did not change vegetation height compared to sowing non-native grass seeds (3400).\n\nSowing native grass and forbs has shown some positive results in North American studies. Out of 28 studies, sixteen in Europe, North America, and New Zealand found an increase in overall plant species richness from sowing native grass and forb seeds (3432). Specifically in the USA, one replicated, controlled study found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased the species richness of native plants (3432). In terms of abundance, three of eight replicated, controlled studies in Europe and North America found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased overall vegetation cover, biomass, or density (3432). In the USA, two of three replicated, randomized, controlled studies found an increased cover of grass species, and three of four similar studies showed an increased cover or density of forb species (3432). Native plant species cover was also found to be increased in one replicated, controlled study in the USA (3432).
