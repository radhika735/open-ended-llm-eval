One study indicated that larger bat boxes had higher occupancy rates (1024). The material of the box also matters, with one study finding that resin boxes were occupied more quickly than wooden ones, and another showing higher occupancy in concrete boxes compared to wood (1024).

The orientation of the box and its exposure to sunlight can affect occupancy (1024). While the effect of height is debated, with some studies showing it matters and others finding no effect, boxes on buildings were found to have higher occupancy than those on trees (1024). The surrounding habitat is a factor, with higher occupancy observed in farm forestry over native forest and in pine stands over mixed deciduous stands (1024). Additionally, higher success rates are seen when boxes are installed in areas where bats were already known to roost, and installing a greater number of boxes across a site increases the likelihood of occupation (1024).\n\nHowever, when creating alternative roosts as part of a development, bat boxes or bat lofts that were built to replace destroyed roosts were four times less likely to be used by returning bats than roosts that were retained during development (949).
