    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence, removing topsoil entirely before seeding generally produces more favorable outcomes than simply disturbing the soil. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the UK found that removing turf before sowing seeds increased both grass species richness and forb species richness in most cases compared to disturbing the soil before sowing (Action 3415). Studies on topsoil removal show multiple benefits: one replicated, randomized, controlled study in France found that removing topsoil before sowing seeds increased plant community similarity to that of intact steppe and increased plant species richness, while a replicated, controlled study in the UK found that removing topsoil before sowing seeds increased the species richness of sown plants (Action 3415). Two replicated, controlled studies in the USA found that removing topsoil before planting or sowing increased the survival of native grass seedlings and plants (Action 3415). In contrast, studies on soil disturbance alone show more limited benefits: one randomized, replicated, controlled study in the UK found that soil disturbance increased the abundance or species richness of specialist and generalist plant species, but a controlled study in South Africa found that digging soil did not alter vegetation cover or the density of native plants (Action 1728). Additionally, studies combining soil disturbance with seeding show that soil disturbance using a rotovator and spreading clippings of heathland plants increased the number of heathland plants, while stripping surface soil layers and adding seed reduced the cover of perennial rye-grass more effectively (Action 1711).",

One site comparison study in the USA found that sowing grass seeds at a higher density reduced the cover of native grassland shrubs (Action 3405). Studies examining grass seeding generally found that sowing grass seeds reduced native grass cover or did not alter native grass density in three of four replicated studies in the USA and Canada, with one study showing that after two years grass cover was higher in seeded areas but after seven years there was no longer a difference (Action 3397). Additionally, one of two replicated studies in the USA and Canada found that sowing grass seeds reduced the abundance of native forb species (Action 3397). Two replicated studies in the USA and Canada found that sowing grass seeds reduced the abundance of shrub species (Action 3397). Regarding species diversity, three of four studies in the UK, Hungary, Iceland and the USA found that sowing grass seeds did not change or reduced overall plant species richness (Action 3397). However, one replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the USA found that sowing seeds at a higher density increased forb species richness, though this appears to be an exception to the general pattern (Action 3405).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on European studies, both mowing and livestock grazing after seeding show effectiveness for enhancing sown species, with some important differences. For mowing management after seeding, a UK study found that cutting vegetation yearly after sowing seeds increased plant species richness compared to grazing with livestock (3419). Additionally, mowing after sowing increased the richness of sown species and the abundance of sown forb species (3419). More frequent mowing also proved beneficial, with a German study showing that mowing more frequently after sowing seeds increased the abundance of five of seven sown forb species (3419). For livestock grazing after seeding, an Italian study found that grazing with livestock after sowing seeds increased plant species richness compared to sowing without grazing (3423). However, a UK study found that grazing with cattle after sowing seeds reduced sown species cover compared to grazing with sheep, and grazing with cattle reduced the cover of sown species compared to cutting vegetation (3423). The evidence suggests differential effects between cattle and sheep grazing, with a UK study showing that grazing with cattle after sowing seeds increased sown species richness compared to grazing with sheep (3423). Direct comparisons indicate mixed results: one UK study found cutting vegetation yearly after sowing increased plant species richness compared to grazing with livestock, while another found winter grazing after sowing resulted in higher survival of cut-leaved cranesbill seedlings (3423, 3419). The frequency and timing of management also matter, with German studies showing that cutting vegetation three times per year after sowing increased characteristic grassland species richness compared to cutting once per year (3419).",

In the UK, sowing yellow rattle seeds led to decreased total plant biomass in three of four studies (action 3404). The Belgian study found that sowing marsh lousewort seeds increased the abundance of six target plant species (action 3404). In Switzerland, sowing European yellow rattle seeds decreased grass cover but did not alter forb cover (action 3404). UK reviews found that adding yellow rattle seed helped target meadow species colonize and resulted in more plant species when yellow rattle was present, with successful establishment possible through slot seeding (action 129).",

For mycorrhiza inoculation, five studies examined effects on grassland vegetation and found mixed results (action 3429). Mycorrhiza inoculation before seeding initially increased vegetation cover in one study, but after three years vegetation cover did not differ between inoculated and non-inoculated areas. One study found mycorrhiza addition increased abundance of target conservation priority species, while another found it increased cover of three of 38 native prairie species. Mycorrhiza inoculation increased plant height but did not affect plant biomass or emergence rates. However, mycorrhiza did not alter plant species richness in one study. For topsoil addition, documented effects include increased plant species richness and increased biomass of sown species in most cases when topsoil was added before seeding (action 3420). When topsoil was added alongside seeding, it increased grass biomass but reduced forb biomass compared to topsoil addition alone (action 1857). More generally, topsoil addition increased cover or abundance of plant species, increased plant cover and number of species, though these remained lower than undisturbed sites, and increased number of seedlings for majority of plants tested (action 1686). Additional soil amendments showed varied effects: adding carbon to soil after seeding either reduced or did not alter density of sown forb species (action 3433), while adding charcoal before seeding did not alter overall plant biomass or grass cover but increased legume cover (action 3422). Soil amendment with bacteria and fungi resulted in higher microbial diversity, increased soil organic matter content, and higher crop yields (action 888).",

For drill seeding (action 3410), studies in the USA found mixed results: in most cases drill seeding led to no change or a reduction in the abundance of sown plants compared to hydroseeding or hand sowing, though one study found drill seeding increased the density of two sown grass species and warm-season grass abundance compared to hand sowing. For hydroseeding (action 3412), studies in Spain, USA, and Italy showed that hydroseeding increased the abundance of half of the sown plant species compared to drill seeding in one USA study, and in Spain it increased overall plant cover in most cases. For slot/strip seeding (action 3411), UK studies found that while this method increased grass and forb species richness, a review found that in the majority of cases strip seeding resulted in failed introductions of sown species. The evidence suggests hydroseeding may be more effective than drill seeding for establishing sown species abundance, while slot/strip seeding shows promise for increasing species diversity but has high failure rates for establishing target species.",

Action 3413 reports that one of two replicated, controlled studies in the UK and Germany found that disturbing soil before sowing seeds increased plant and seedling species richness, and a UK study found that rotovating soil before sowing seeds increased both grass and forb species richness in most cases compared to harrowing before sowing. Four of five replicated, controlled studies found that disturbing soil before sowing seeds increased plant emergence in most cases compared to sowing alone.\n\nOther site preparation techniques showed mixed or limited effectiveness for species richness. Adding sulphur to soil before seeding had negative effects, with Action 3428 showing that one UK study found adding sulphur to soil before sowing seeds reduced plant species richness and overall vegetation cover, though low amounts of sulphur increased the cover of three of six sown species. \n\nMycorrhizal inoculation showed minimal benefits for species richness, as Action 3429 reports that one replicated, randomized, controlled study in Germany found that inoculating soil with mycorrhizal fungi and sowing seeds of grassland species did not alter plant species richness.\n\nThe broader context from Action 133 indicates that 20 European studies found restoring species-rich grassland resulted in higher plant species richness than other types of grassland, with effective techniques including grazing, introducing plant species, hay spreading and mowing.",

    "relevant_summary": "Several studies from the USA provide evidence regarding the effectiveness of altering seed mix characteristics for grassland restoration. Regarding species diversity in seed mixes, four studies examined increasing the number of species in seed mixes in the USA (Action 3406). Two replicated, controlled studies found that increasing the number of species in a seed mix increased the species richness of sown plants, while one of these studies also found increased cover of sown plant species. However, one replicated, site comparison study found that increasing the number of species in a seed mix did not change overall plant species richness. For seed density effects, four studies were conducted in the USA examining sowing seeds at higher density (Action 3405). One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study found that sowing seeds at a higher density increased both forb species richness and forb cover, as well as increased grass cover and increased the number of purple needlegrass seedlings. However, one site comparison study found that sowing grass seeds at a higher density reduced the cover of native grassland shrubs, and one replicated, controlled study found that higher density seeding did not alter the cover of sown plant species. Studies on broader grassland restoration approaches in the USA show mixed results. Twelve studies in North America examined sowing native grass and forbs (Action 3432), with some studies finding increased overall plant species richness, increased species richness of native plants, and increased cover of native plant species and sown species. However, effectiveness varied, with some studies showing no change in vegetation abundance. Six studies in North America examined sowing grass seeds only (Action 3397), with three of four studies finding that this approach did not change or reduced overall plant species richness, and some studies finding reduced abundance of native forb species and shrub species. Overall grassland restoration studies from the USA, Canada and Iceland found that species richness on restored grassland sites was similar to remnant habitats or higher than unrestored sites, with some target species using restored grasslands and higher abundances or densities of some species compared to unrestored sites (Action 361).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence, multiple actions can increase the abundance of sown or planted species in grassland restoration projects. \n\n**Seeding strategies and timing:** Sowing seeds at a higher density can increase the cover of individual plant species like thickspike wheatgrass and increase the number of purple needlegrass seedlings, though effects on overall sown species cover are mixed (Action 3405). Sowing seeds at the start of the growing season increased the cover of sown grass and forb species compared to autumn sowing and increased the number of sown species (Action 3407). Increasing the number of species in seed mix showed mixed effects, with one study finding increased cover of sown plant species while another found no change (Action 3406).\n\n**Site preparation methods:** Applying herbicide before seeding increased the cover of sown grass species and increased sown species richness (Action 3418). Disturbing soil before sowing seeds increased plant emergence in most cases and improved seedling survival in some studies (Action 3413). Removing leaf litter before seeding showed mixed effects on seedling emergence of sown species (Action 3414).\n\n**Soil amendments and treatments:** Adding fertilizer to soil before or after seeding showed mixed results, with some studies finding increased cover and density of sown species while others found no change (Action 3427). Inoculating soil with mycorrhiza before seeding increased the abundance of target species considered a local conservation priority and increased cover of some native prairie species (Action 3429).\n\n**Post-establishment management:** Mowing after seeding increased the abundance of sown forb species and increased sown species richness, with more frequent mowing increasing abundance of five of seven sown forb species (Action 3419). Using erosion blankets after seeding showed mixed effects on vegetation (Action 3431).\n\n**Direct planting approaches:** Plant grassland plants increased species richness of grasses in 50% of cases and forbs in 83% of cases, with planted species having mixed effects on abundance (Action 3399). Sowing native grass and forb seeds increased the abundance of sown species in most cases, with five of six studies finding positive effects (Action 3432).\n\n**Spatial strategies:** Sowing seeds in prepared gaps within vegetation led to greater cover of sown target plant species when using large gaps compared to smaller gaps (Action 3409). Sowing grassland seeds from a local source increased the abundance of some characteristic plant species and increased cover of target plant species when combined with increased species diversity (Action 3400).\n\n**Water management:** Irrigating after seeding showed limited evidence, with one study finding no change in vegetation cover (Action 3430).",

Using erosion blankets after seeding showed mixed effects on vegetation (Action 3431).\\n\\n**Direct planting approaches:** Plant grassland plants increased species richness of grasses in 50% of cases and forbs in 83% of cases, with planted species having mixed effects on abundance (Action 3399). Sowing native grass and forb seeds increased the abundance of sown species in most cases, with five of six studies finding positive effects (Action 3432).\\n\\n**Spatial strategies:** Sowing seeds in prepared gaps within vegetation led to greater cover of sown target plant species when using large gaps compared to smaller gaps (Action 3409). Sowing grassland seeds from a local source increased the abundance of some characteristic plant species and increased cover of target plant species when combined with increased species diversity (Action 3400).\\n\\n**Water management:** Irrigating after seeding showed limited evidence, with one study finding no change in vegetation cover (Action 3430).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"3405\",\n    \"3406\",\n    \"3407\",\n    \"3408\",\n    \"3409\",\n    \"3399\",\n    \"3400\",\n    \"3413\",\n    \"3414\",\n    \"3418\",\n    \"3419\",\n    \"3427\",\n    \"3429\",\n    \"3430\",\n    \"3431\",\n    \"3432\"\n  ]\n}"

Topsoil or turf removal before seeding showed positive effects on survival, with two studies in the USA finding that removing topsoil before planting California oatgrass or sowing and planting purple needlegrass increased the survival of seedlings and plants (action 3415). Herbicide application before seeding demonstrated benefits for emergence, with one study in Germany finding that spraying with herbicide before sowing seeds increased seedling emergence for five of eight wildflower species (action 3418). In direct comparisons within European studies, removing turf before sowing seeds increased both grass and forb species richness in most cases compared to disturbing the soil before sowing in a UK study (action 3415). One UK study found that rotovating soil before sowing seeds increased both grass and forb species richness compared to harrowing before sowing (action 3413). French studies showed that removing topsoil before sowing seeds increased plant species richness and community similarity to intact steppe (action 3415).",

Topsoil or turf removal before seeding showed positive effects on survival, with two studies in the USA finding that removing topsoil before planting California oatgrass or sowing and planting purple needlegrass increased the survival of seedlings and plants (action 3415). Herbicide application before seeding demonstrated benefits for emergence, with one study in Germany finding that spraying with herbicide before sowing seeds increased seedling emergence for five of eight wildflower species (action 3418). In direct comparisons within European studies, removing turf before sowing seeds increased both grass and forb species richness in most cases compared to disturbing the soil before sowing in a UK study (action 3415).

The evidence base focuses primarily on species establishment, abundance, and diversity outcomes rather than structural characteristics of the vegetation.\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"3400\",\n    \"3405\",\n    \"3406\",\n    \"3409\",\n    \"3416\",\n    \"3420\",\n    \"3414\",\n    \"3430\"\n  ]\n}"

According to action 3397, forb abundance studies found that one of two replicated studies in the USA and Canada found that sowing grass seeds reduced the abundance of native forb species, while the other study found no change in the density of native forb species. For shrub abundance, two replicated studies (one randomized, controlled study and one site comparison) in the USA and Canada found that sowing grass seeds reduced the abundance of shrub species. Additionally, action 3405 reported that one site comparison study in the USA found that sowing grass seeds at a higher density reduced the cover of native grassland shrubs. Action 3397 also found that three of four replicated studies in the USA and Canada found that sowing grass seeds either reduced native grass cover or did not alter native grass density, indicating competitive effects on native vegetation generally. These studies were part of thirteen total studies examining grass seeding effects, with six studies conducted in North America specifically.",

    "relevant_summary": "Post-seeding management practices in grasslands show distinct effects on vegetation outcomes. Mowing after seeding/planting increased plant species richness compared to grazing with livestock in UK studies (Action 3419). Specifically, cutting vegetation yearly after sowing seeds resulted in higher plant species richness than livestock grazing (Action 3419). Mowing also increased the richness of sown species after seeding, with one UK study showing that mowing after sowing seeds increased sown species richness (Action 3419). Additionally, cutting sown plots each year and removing cut vegetation increased sown grass and forb species richness compared to cutting without removing vegetation (Action 3419). \n\nFor grazing effects, one UK study found that grazing with cattle after sowing seeds increased sown species richness compared to grazing with sheep (Action 3423). However, the same study also found that grazing with cattle reduced the cover of sown species compared to sheep grazing (Action 3423). Grazing with livestock after sowing seeds generally reduced plant species richness compared to cutting vegetation after sowing (Action 3423).\n\nRegarding mowing frequency, cutting vegetation three times per year after sowing seeds increased the richness of characteristic grassland species compared to cutting once per year in German studies (Action 3419). More frequent mowing also increased the abundance of five of seven sown forb species (Action 3419).\n\nThe timing of management also matters, as studies showed that delaying mowing dates resulted in higher plant species richness in some cases (Action 131).",
