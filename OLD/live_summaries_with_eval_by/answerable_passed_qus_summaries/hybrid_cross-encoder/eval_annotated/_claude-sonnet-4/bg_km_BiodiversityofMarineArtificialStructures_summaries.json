Long flexible habitats had mixed effects on fish species richness around structures, depending on fish presence when flexible habitats were created, and mixed effects on the abundance of fishes or seahorses depending on species and timing (Action 3451). For invertebrates, long flexible habitats had mixed effects on mobile and non-mobile invertebrate abundance depending on species group and survey week, with one study reporting that flexible habitats decreased mussel abundance on structure surfaces but the flexible habitats themselves supported higher biomass than structure surfaces (Action 3451). Short flexible habitats had mixed effects on mobile and non-mobile invertebrate community composition depending on density or length of flexible habitats (Action 3450). Short flexible habitats also had mixed effects on mobile and non-mobile invertebrate abundance depending on survey week, species group, and flexible habitat length, and mixed effects on seahorse abundance depending on survey week (Action 3450). Long flexible habitats were used by seahorses, while behavioral data was not available for short flexible habitats (Actions 3451, 3450).",

Rock pools also supported species that were absent from structure surfaces without pools.\n\n**Pit habitats (1-50 mm)** showed strong effectiveness, with eight of 12 replicated controlled studies finding that pit habitats increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness and/or diversity (Action ID: 3475). Pit habitats also supported macroalgae, invertebrate and/or fish species that were absent from surfaces without added habitats.\n\n**Hole habitats (>50 mm)** demonstrated consistent positive effects, with three replicated controlled studies finding that hole habitats increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species diversity and/or richness (Action ID: 3467). Hole habitats also supported species that were absent from structure surfaces without added habitat features.\n\n**Combinations of grooves and small ridges/ledges (1-50 mm)** showed effectiveness, with six of 11 replicated controlled studies finding that these combinations increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species diversity and/or richness (Action ID: 3474). These combinations also supported species that were absent from structure surfaces without grooves and ridges.\n\n**Moderately Effective Methods:**\n\n**Groove habitats (1-50 mm)** alone showed mixed results, with three of six replicated controlled studies finding increased species richness and/or diversity (Action ID: 3473). However, grooves consistently supported species that were absent from structure surfaces without grooves.\n\n**Small protrusions (1-50 mm)** when combined with other habitat types showed positive effects, with two replicated controlled studies finding increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness (Action ID: 3462).\n\n**Less Effective Methods:**\n\n**Small ridges or ledges (1-50 mm)** alone showed limited effectiveness, with mixed results and typically supporting lower species richness than grooves created between them (Action ID: 3464).\n\n**Large ridges or ledges (>50 mm)** showed inconsistent results, with only one of two studies finding increased species diversity (Action ID: 3465).\n\n**Textured surfaces (≤1 mm)** had mixed effects on species richness depending on the type of texture and site (Action ID: 3466).\n\n**Short flexible habitats (1-50 mm)** actually decreased combined species richness in one study (Action ID: 3459).\n\nThe evidence suggests that creating water-retaining features (rock pools, holes, pits) and three-dimensional complexity through combinations of habitat types are most effective for enhancing species richness and diversity on intertidal artificial structures.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on studies conducted in European marine environments, the outcomes of creating textured surfaces on intertidal structures vary considerably depending on the type of texture created, the specific site, and the species being measured. \n\nStudies from the UK and Netherlands demonstrate that creating textured surfaces (≤1 mm) had mixed effects on combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness on structure surfaces, with outcomes depending on both the type of texture created and the site (Action 3466). The same studies found that creating textured surfaces, along with using environmentally-sensitive material, had mixed effects on barnacle and mobile invertebrate abundances, depending on the site, while one study found increased barnacle abundance regardless of texture type, though different textures supported different abundances (Action 3466). Creating textured surfaces did not increase macroalgal abundance on structure surfaces according to two studies in the Netherlands (Action 3466).\n\nFor larger-scale surface modifications, creating natural rocky reef topography on intertidal structures in the UK had mixed effects on barnacle and mobile invertebrate abundances depending on the site, and did not increase combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness (Action 3435). However, natural topography was colonized by macroalgae and limpets, with limpets using shaded grooves and water-retaining depressions (Action 3435).\n\nCreating groove habitats (1-50 mm) on intertidal structures showed varied outcomes across European studies. In the UK and Netherlands, creating groove habitats did not increase macroalgal abundance on structure surfaces according to two studies (Action 3473). For invertebrate responses, three of four studies from Australia, the Netherlands and the UK found that creating groove habitats did not increase invertebrate, limpet or chiton abundances (Action 3473). However, groove habitats were reported to be used by mussels and periwinkles in Netherlands studies (Action 3473).\n\nCreating pit habitats (1-50 mm) on intertidal structures also showed variable outcomes in European environments. Studies from the UK and Netherlands found that creating pit habitats did not increase macroalgal abundance on structure surfaces according to three of four studies (Action 3475). For invertebrates, studies in the Netherlands and UK found mixed results, with some showing no increase in invertebrate abundance while others found mixed effects on barnacle and mobile invertebrate abundances depending on site, species, animal size, and pit characteristics (Action 3475).\n\nCombined modifications involving grooves and small protrusions, ridges or ledges (1-50 mm) demonstrated varied outcomes depending on multiple factors. UK studies found mixed effects on mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate, limpet, mussel, juvenile oyster and barnacle abundances, with outcomes depending on the depth/height of grooves and ridges, the presence of large ledges or water-retaining and light-shading covers, the shore level, and the site (Action 3474).",

Creating structural habitat features shows promise, with long flexible habitats (>50 mm) supporting fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without flexible habitats and having mixed effects on fish abundance depending on species and fish presence when created (3451). Small adjoining cavities or 'swimthrough' habitats (≤100 mm) supported six fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without swimthroughs and had mixed effects on juvenile fish community composition and abundance depending on site and survey conditions (3436). Large adjoining cavities or 'swimthrough' habitats (>100 mm) supported fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without swimthroughs, increased overall fish species richness and abundance, though individual species responses varied (3456). \n\nCreating hole habitats (>50 mm) combined with other features like grooves and pits supported fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without added habitat features, though effects on fish abundance were mixed depending on species group (3434). Similarly, groove habitats (1-50 mm) when combined with holes, pits and environmentally-sensitive material supported fish species that were absent from similar structures without added habitat features, but had mixed effects on fish abundances depending on species group (3448).\n\nManagement approaches also show benefits, with harvesting restrictions supporting fish species that were absent from unrestricted structures and higher fish species richness, though effects on total fish abundance were mixed (3457). Reducing maintenance activities can increase seahorse abundance on structure surfaces (3447). Using environmentally-sensitive materials such as ECOncrete™ combined with habitat features supported fish species that were absent from standard-concrete or fibreglass structure surfaces, though effects on fish abundances were mixed depending on species group (3470). Creating artificial reefs with different 3-D structures and materials showed no consistent differences in combined mobile invertebrate and fish richness or abundance between different reef designs (2259).",

The survival of canopy algae transplants varied depending on wave-exposure and surrounding habitat, with some studies reporting that no canopy algae transplants survived regardless of protective measures (Action 3471). The presence and mesh size of cages around transplants significantly affected both survival and cover, with two studies finding that canopy algae cover increased and/or was higher when transplanted under cages but decreased and/or was lower when left uncaged (Action 3471). Surface orientation was found to affect growth but had no effect on survival in one study (Action 3471). Wave-exposure influenced the growth of canopy algae transplants, with growth varying depending on this factor and surface orientation (Action 3471). Distance from source populations also played a role, as the abundance of kelp recruits on subtidal artificial structures varied depending on the distance from transplanted kelp individuals (Action 3471). Creating natural rocky reef topography on subtidal artificial structures did not increase the abundance of juvenile canopy macroalgae that settled onto structure surfaces, regardless of topography depth (Action 3446). Surface texture also influenced algae establishment, with textured surfaces having mixed effects on macroalgal abundance depending on the species group and site (Action 3449). Maintenance activities affected algal growth, as reducing the frequency of cleaning on subtidal artificial structures increased macroalgal abundance on structure surfaces (Action 3447).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on multiple studies across various geographic locations, several habitat modifications have been consistently effective for altering ecological communities on intertidal artificial structures:\n\n**Pit habitats (1-50 mm)** are among the most extensively studied and effective modifications. Twenty-two studies found that creating pit habitats altered community composition in four of six studies and increased species richness in eight of 12 studies (Action ID: 3475). These habitats supported macroalgae, invertebrate and fish species that were absent from unmodified surfaces.\n\n**Groove habitats (1-50 mm)** demonstrated consistent effectiveness across 14 studies. Creating grooves altered fish community composition and increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness in three of six studies (Action ID: 3473). Grooves, along with pits, supported species absent from surfaces without these modifications.\n\n**Flexible habitats** showed promise with both long (>50 mm) and short (1-50 mm) versions altering community composition. Long flexible habitats supported macroalgae, mobile and non-mobile invertebrates absent from unmodified surfaces (Action ID: 3460). Short flexible habitats altered combined macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate community composition (Action ID: 3459).\n\n**Hole habitats (>50 mm)** consistently increased species diversity and richness across three studies and altered community composition, supporting species absent from unmodified surfaces (Action ID: 3467).\n\n**Small protrusions (1-50 mm)** increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness in two studies conducted in Singapore (Action ID: 3462).\n\n**Environmentally-sensitive materials** showed mixed results, with hemp-concrete and ECOncrete™ (along with added habitat features) altering community composition and increasing species richness, while other materials like shell-concrete showed limited effects (Action ID: 3469).\n\n**Large protrusions (>50 mm)** supported species absent from unmodified surfaces but did not consistently increase species richness (Action ID: 3463).\n\nThe most consistently effective modifications across multiple studies were pit habitats, groove habitats, and flexible habitats, which reliably altered community composition and increased species diversity while supporting species not found on unmodified artificial structures.",

    "relevant_summary": "The evidence for creating adjoining cavities or 'swimthrough' habitats on artificial structures varies significantly between subtidal and intertidal zones and depends on cavity size. For subtidal structures, there is substantial evidence supporting swimthrough habitats. Four studies examined small swimthrough habitats (≤100 mm) on subtidal structures in France, Morocco, Mayotte, and France, finding mixed effects on juvenile fish community composition, species richness, and abundance depending on site, survey month, and species (Action 3436). Two studies examined large swimthrough habitats (>100 mm) on subtidal structures in Mayotte and the USA, with one study finding that large swimthroughs increased overall fish species richness and abundance on structure surfaces, though effects varied by fish size class and species (Action 3456). Both small and large subtidal swimthroughs were reported to be used by various species including juvenile spiny lobsters, sea firs, adult fish, juvenile fish, and groupers (Actions 3436, 3456). For intertidal structures, the evidence is much more limited. Two studies examined small swimthrough habitats (≤100 mm) on intertidal structures in the UK, Netherlands, and South Africa, finding that they did not alter mobile invertebrate community composition, increase species richness or diversity, but did increase mobile invertebrate abundance on structure surfaces (Action 3468). Notably, no studies were found that evaluated large swimthrough habitats (>100 mm) on intertidal artificial structures, indicating a complete absence of evidence for this intervention in intertidal zones (Action 3438).",

Studies in Italy and Croatia found that cover of canopy algae transplanted onto subtidal artificial structures increased when transplanted under cages but decreased when left uncaged (Action 3471). In Japan, kelp recruit abundance on subtidal artificial structures varied depending on distance from transplanted kelp individuals and surface orientation (Action 3471). Survival of transplanted canopy algae varied depending on wave exposure, surrounding habitat, and presence of protective cages (Action 3471). For intertidal structures, macroalgae transplanted onto artificial structures were more likely to survive at mid- and highshore locations than at lowshore (Action 3472).\n\n**Creating Textured Surfaces:** Creating textured surfaces (≤1 mm) on intertidal artificial structures did not increase macroalgal abundance on structure surfaces according to two studies in the Netherlands (Action 3466). Similarly, creating textured surfaces on subtidal artificial structures had mixed effects on macroalgal abundance depending on species group and site in Italy (Action 3449).\n\n**Creating Topographical Features:** Creating natural rocky reef topography on subtidal artificial structures did not increase abundance of juvenile canopy macroalgae in Italy (Action 3446). Creating small protrusions (1-50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures had mixed effects on macroalgal abundance depending on species in Japan (Action 3453). Creating large ridges or ledges (>50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures, combined with grooves and small protrusions, increased rockweed abundance in the USA (Action 3465).\n\n**Creating Flexible Habitats:** Creating short flexible habitats (1-50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures had mixed effects on macroalgal abundance depending on species group and site in Australia (Action 3459).\n\n**Modifying Structure Slope:** Reducing the slope of intertidal artificial structures did not increase macroalgal abundance on structure surfaces in Australia (Action 3461).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available studies, biodiversity outcomes of creating large hole habitats (>50mm) on artificial structures show notable differences between subtidal and intertidal zones across the specified regions.\n\nIn subtidal zones in Israel and Sweden (Action 3434), three studies found that creating hole habitats altered the combined macroalgae and invertebrate or mobile invertebrate and fish community composition on and around structures, and supported mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate and/or fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without added habitat features. However, biodiversity outcomes were mixed: two of three studies found increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness and/or diversity, while one study found no increase in combined mobile invertebrate and fish species richness or diversity. Population-level effects were generally limited, with one study showing no increase in combined mobile invertebrate and fish abundance, and mixed effects on species-specific abundances depending on the species group.\n\nIn intertidal zones in Australia and Europe (Action 3467), five studies examined hole habitats on artificial structures in southeast Australia, the UK, the Netherlands, and northern Israel. These studies consistently found that hole habitats altered the combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition on structure surfaces and supported macroalgae and/or non-mobile invertebrate species that were absent from structure surfaces without added habitat features. All three studies examining richness/diversity found that creating hole habitats increased the combined macroalgae and invertebrate species diversity and/or richness on structure surfaces. However, population-level effects were limited, with studies showing no increase in macroalgal abundance and mixed effects on invertebrate abundance. One study in Australia reported that hole habitats were used by sea slugs, urchins and octopuses.\n\nThe key difference appears to be that intertidal hole habitats showed more consistent positive effects on species diversity/richness across studies, while subtidal hole habitats showed more variable outcomes for diversity measures and generally limited population-level effects.",

On intertidal structures, these features alter the combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition and support species that are absent from structures without these modifications (action 3474). Six of 11 studies found that creating grooves and small ridges/ledges increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species diversity and/or richness on structure surfaces, while five studies found mixed effects depending on the depth/height of grooves and ridges, shore level, species group, and site (action 3474). The effects on overall abundance are variable, with studies finding no increase, increases when combined with other features or covers, or mixed effects depending on size, arrangement, shore level, and site (action 3474). For invertebrate abundance specifically, five of seven studies found mixed effects on mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate, limpet, mussel, juvenile oyster, and barnacle abundances, depending on the depth/height of grooves and ridges, presence of large ledges or water-retaining covers, shore level, and site (action 3474). On subtidal structures, the effects are more limited in scope but similar in nature - one of two studies found that groove habitats and small ledges altered community composition and increased species richness and diversity, while effects on abundance were mixed depending on surface orientation (action 3452). The created features are actively colonized by microalgal species on intertidal structures (action 3474) and by macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrates on subtidal structures (action 3452).",

Creating short flexible habitats (1-50 mm) had mixed effects on non-mobile invertebrate abundance on structure surfaces and mobile invertebrate abundance during high tide, depending on species group and site (Action 3459). Creating natural rocky reef topography had mixed effects on barnacle and mobile invertebrate abundances depending on site (Action 3435).\n\n**Material composition**: Using environmentally-sensitive materials had variable effects - using limestone-cement along with creating pits, grooves, small ridges and texture had mixed effects on mobile invertebrate and barnacle abundance depending on site and wave-exposure, while some studies found no increase in tubeworm, oyster, limpet, barnacle and combined invertebrate abundances when using different materials (Action 3469).\n\n**Site characteristics**: Multiple studies found that effects on invertebrate abundance varied significantly depending on the specific site where modifications were implemented (Actions 3475, 3459, 3435, 3469, 3476, 3467).\n\n**Shore level and depth**: Creating rock pools had mixed effects on invertebrate abundances depending on shore level and pool depth (Actions 3476, 3467).\n\n**Wave exposure**: The effects of material modifications on invertebrate abundance varied depending on wave-exposure levels (Action 3469).\n\n**Species group**: Effects varied depending on the specific invertebrate species or groups being measured, with different responses observed for mobile vs. non-mobile invertebrates, and for different taxonomic groups (Actions 3475, 3459, 3476, 3467).\n\n**Structural slope**: Reducing the slope of intertidal artificial structures did not increase oyster or mobile invertebrate abundance on structure surfaces (Action 3461).",

    "relevant_summary": "Several interventions have been shown to alter the overall community composition of organisms on subtidal artificial structures. Use of environmentally-sensitive materials: Six of 11 studies found that using shell-concrete or quarried rock instead of standard-concrete, or using ECOncrete™ instead of standard-concrete or fibreglass, along with creating texture, grooves, holes, pits and/or small ledges, altered the combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition on structure surfaces (3470). Three studies also reported that ECOncrete™ surfaces with added habitats supported mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate and/or fish species that were absent from standard-concrete or fibreglass structure surfaces (3470). Creating habitat features: Creating textured surfaces (≤1 mm) altered community composition in two of three studies (3449). Creating hole habitats (>50 mm) along with grooves, environmentally-sensitive material and pits or small ledges altered combined macroalgae and invertebrate or mobile invertebrate and fish community composition in three studies, and these features supported species that were absent from structure surfaces without added habitat features (3434). Creating pit habitats (1–50 mm) along with holes, grooves and environmentally-sensitive material altered combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition and supported mobile and non-mobile invertebrate and fish species absent from structures without these features (3455). Creating groove habitats (1–50 mm) along with holes, pits and environmentally-sensitive material altered combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition and supported species absent from structures without added habitat features (3448). Creating grooves and small protrusions, ridges or ledges (1–50 mm) altered community composition in one of two studies (3452). Creating long flexible habitats (>50 mm) resulted in these features supporting macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate or fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without flexible habitats in two studies (3451). Creating short flexible habitats (1–50 mm) had mixed effects on mobile and/or non-mobile invertebrate community composition in two studies (3450). Structural modifications: Different artificial reef structure and material types showed that scrap tyres developed similar sessile invertebrate community composition as concrete modules, while pyramids made of \"sea-friendly\" concrete developed different invertebrate community compositions compared to traditional concrete structures (2259). Management practices: Managing or restricting harvesting resulted in different fish community composition around structures with restrictions compared to unrestricted structures, with restricted structures supporting species absent from unrestricted ones (3457). However, reducing the frequency of cleaning on subtidal artificial structures did not alter combined invertebrate and fish community composition (3447).",

For subtidal structures, action 3470 reported that using quarried rock or shell-concrete in place of standard-concrete did not increase the combined macroalgae and invertebrate abundance on structure surfaces in three of seven studies. However, two studies found mixed effects, depending on the type of quarried rock or concrete tested and/or the location. One study found that using ECOncrete in place of fibreglass, along with creating textured surfaces, increased the live cover and biomass. Specifically for invertebrate abundance, action 3470 found that using quarried rock in place of concrete on subtidal artificial structures, or using ECOncrete, along with creating grooves, holes and pits, had mixed effects on the abundance of non-mobile invertebrates, mobile invertebrates or coral recruits on structure surfaces, depending on the type of rock tested, the species group and/or the site.

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from action documents, several interventions have shown effectiveness for increasing invertebrate abundance on intertidal artificial structures, though results often vary by site, species group, and design specifics.\n\nCreating large ridges or ledges (>50 mm) showed positive results, with two replicated, controlled studies in the USA and UK finding that large ledges or ridges increased the abundance of mussels or limpets, but not barnacles, on structure surfaces (Action 3465). \n\nTransplanting or seeding organisms, particularly oysters, demonstrated mixed but generally positive effects. Three replicated, randomized, controlled studies in Hong Kong and Australia found that transplanting oysters had mixed effects on mobile invertebrate abundance depending on the presence of grooves and small ridges or ledges on surfaces and/or the site, with one study finding increased oyster and mobile invertebrate abundance and another finding increased non-mobile invertebrate and oyster recruit abundance while decreasing barnacle abundance (Action 3472).\n\nCreating small adjoining cavities or 'swimthrough' habitats (≤100 mm) showed promise, with one replicated, controlled study in South Africa finding that small swimthrough habitats increased mobile invertebrate abundance on structure surfaces (Action 3468).\n\nCreating groove habitats (1-50 mm) produced variable results. Six studies examining groove habitats found that three of four replicated, controlled studies in Australia, the Netherlands and the UK did not increase invertebrate, limpet or chiton abundances, though one study found that grooves supported higher mobile invertebrate and oyster abundances than small ledges created in between them (Action 3473).\n\nCreating rock pools showed mixed results across multiple studies. Two replicated, controlled studies in Australia found that rock pools had mixed effects on limpet or combined invertebrate abundances, depending on the shore level, pool depth, species group and/or site (Action 3476).\n\nThe combination of grooves and small protrusions, ridges or ledges (1-50 mm) produced variable outcomes. Seven replicated, randomized, controlled studies found that this combination had mixed effects on mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate, limpet, mussel, juvenile oyster and/or barnacle abundances, depending on various design factors and site conditions, though two studies found that this combination increased oyster but not mobile invertebrate abundance on structure surfaces (Action 3474).\n\nOther interventions showed less consistent results: creating small ridges or ledges (1-50 mm) found that small ledges supported lower mobile invertebrate and oyster abundances than grooves (Action 3464), while creating hole habitats (>50 mm) showed mixed effects or no increase in invertebrate abundance (Action 3467).",

Large ridges/ledges increased abundance of mussels or limpets but not barnacles, and one study reported increased rockweed abundance and juvenile salmon feeding activity (Action 3465). In contrast, small ridges or ledges (1-50 mm) showed more mixed results, with one of two studies finding no increase in species richness, while another found that small ridges along with other features did increase species richness (Action 3464). Small ridges supported lower species richness than grooves created between them, and had mixed effects on abundance depending on shore level, site, and arrangement (Action 3464). For protrusions specifically, large protrusions (>50 mm) did not increase combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness in two studies, but did support species absent from surfaces without protrusions and increased limpet abundance (Action 3463). Small protrusions (1-50 mm) increased species richness in two Singapore studies, particularly when combined with other habitat features, but had mixed effects on abundance (Action 3462). When grooves are combined with small protrusions, ridges or ledges, six of 11 studies found increased species diversity and/or richness, with effects varying by depth/height of features, shore level, and site (Action 3474).",

For subtidal structures (3471), transplanting oysters altered the combined invertebrate and fish community composition on and around structure surfaces. For intertidal structures (3472), three studies found that oysters transplanted onto structures supported macroalgae, mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate and fish species that were absent from surfaces without transplanted oysters.\n\n**Creating textured surfaces** shows consistent effectiveness for community alteration. For subtidal structures (3449), two of three studies found that creating textured surfaces altered the combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition on structure surfaces, with one study reporting that textured surfaces with environmentally-sensitive material supported mobile and non-mobile invertebrate species that were absent from untextured surfaces.\n\n**Using environmentally-sensitive materials** demonstrates strong evidence for community composition changes. For intertidal structures (3469), two of four studies found that using hemp-concrete or ECOncrete™ with added habitats altered the combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition, with studies reporting that these surfaces supported macroalgae, mobile invertebrate and/or non-mobile invertebrate species that were absent from standard-concrete surfaces. For subtidal structures (3470), six of 11 studies found that using materials like shell-concrete, quarried rock, or ECOncrete™ with added habitat features altered the combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition, with three studies reporting that these surfaces supported mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate and/or fish species that were absent from standard surfaces.\n\n**Creating short flexible habitats** also shows effectiveness. For intertidal structures (3459), one study found that creating short flexible habitats altered the combined macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate community composition on structure surfaces. For subtidal structures (3450), two studies found that creating short flexible habitats had mixed effects on mobile and/or non-mobile invertebrate community composition, with one study finding that it altered the non-mobile invertebrate community composition.",

Long flexible habitats supported higher combined macroalgae and invertebrate biomass than structure surfaces without flexible habitats, with deeper flexible habitats supporting higher biomass than shallower ones (Action 3451). While both short and long flexible habitats had mixed effects on invertebrate abundance, long flexible habitats specifically decreased mussel abundance on structure surfaces but the flexible habitats themselves supported higher biomass, mostly mussels, than the structure surfaces (Action 3451). Long flexible habitats were also documented as being used by seahorses (Action 3451), whereas short flexible habitats showed mixed effects on seahorse abundance depending on survey week (Action 3450). Fish species richness showed mixed effects with long flexible habitats depending on fish presence when habitats were created, while short flexible habitats did not increase mobile or non-mobile invertebrate species richness (Action 3450).",

Action 3475 reports that six studies were conducted on island coastlines in the Singapore Strait examining the creation of pit habitats (1-50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures. The outcomes showed that creating pit habitats altered the combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition on structure surfaces and supported macroalgae, invertebrate and fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without added habitats. Action 3475 indicates that creating pit habitats along with grooves increased fish species richness on and around structure surfaces, fish abundance, and the number of bites fishes took from structure surfaces. Action 3473 reports that two studies were conducted on island coastlines in the Singapore Strait examining the creation of groove habitats (1-50 mm). The outcomes showed that groove habitats created along with pits altered the fish community composition on and around structure surfaces, supported species that were absent from surfaces without grooves and pits, increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness and diversity, fish species richness, fish abundance, and the number of bites fishes took from structure surfaces. Action 3462 indicates that two studies were conducted on island coastlines in the Singapore Strait examining small protrusions (1-50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures. The outcomes showed that creating small protrusions along with grooves, small ridges and pits increased the combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness on structure surfaces, with mixed effects on community composition and abundance depending on site and size/arrangement of features.

Two studies found mixed effects on juvenile fish abundances depending on species, site, survey month and development stage (Action 3436). Three studies reported that small swimthroughs were used by juvenile spiny lobsters, sea firs, adult fish and juvenile fish (Action 3436). For large swimthrough habitats (>100 mm) on subtidal structures, two studies showed more positive results - one study in the USA found that large swimthroughs supported fish species absent from surfaces without swimthroughs, increased overall fish species richness and abundance, though effects varied by fish size class and species (Action 3456). One study in Mayotte reported use by juvenile spiny lobsters, groupers, sea firs and adult fishes from five families (Action 3456). For intertidal structures, evidence is more limited - two studies on small swimthroughs found no effects on mobile invertebrate community composition, species richness or diversity, but did find increased mobile invertebrate abundance and altered invertebrate abundance patterns (Action 3468).

Creating physical habitat features, including hole habitats (>50 mm), altered the combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition on and around structures and supported mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate and fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without added habitat features (Action 3434). Creating groove habitats and small protrusions, ridges or ledges (1-50 mm) altered the combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition on structure surfaces and supported non-mobile invertebrate species that were absent from structure surfaces without added habitat features (Action 3452). Creating textured surfaces (≤1 mm) altered the combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition on structure surfaces, with textured surfaces using environmentally-sensitive material supporting mobile and non-mobile invertebrate species that were absent from fibreglass surfaces without texture (Action 3449). Creating groove habitats (1-50 mm) altered the combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition on structure surfaces and supported macroalgae, non-mobile invertebrate and fish species that were absent from similar structures without added habitat features (Action 3448). Creating pit habitats (1-50 mm) altered the combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition on structure surfaces and supported mobile and non-mobile invertebrate and fish species that were absent from similar structures without the added habitat features (Action 3455). Using environmentally-sensitive materials, such as shell-concrete, quarried rock, or ECOncrete™ in place of standard-concrete or fibreglass, altered the combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition on structure surfaces, with ECOncrete™ surfaces with added habitats supporting mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate and fish species that were absent from standard-concrete or fibreglass structure surfaces (Action 3470). Creating short flexible habitats (1-50 mm) had mixed effects on mobile and/or non-mobile invertebrate community composition, depending on the density or length of flexible habitats and/or the site, with one study finding it altered the non-mobile invertebrate community composition (Action 3450). Creating long flexible habitats (>50 mm) supported macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate or fish species that were absent from on and around structure surfaces without flexible habitats (Action 3451).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on studies examining oyster transplantation onto intertidal artificial structures, several factors influence effectiveness for enhancing biodiversity in Australian estuaries. Surface texture features significantly affect outcomes - transplanting oysters onto surfaces with grooves and small ridges (1-50 mm) shows mixed effects on species richness and diversity depending on the presence and size of these features and the site (action 3472). Studies in southeast Australia found that oyster survival was higher when transplanted into grooves compared with on ridges, while survival in grooves and on ledges varied depending on the site (action 3472). The presence of hole habitats (>50 mm) on structures, along with grooves and small ridges, supported macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate species that were absent from structure surfaces without added habitat features, and increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species diversity and richness on structure surfaces (action 3467). Material composition affects colonization success - environmentally-sensitive materials like hemp-concrete or reduced-pH-concrete can alter community composition and support species absent from standard-concrete surfaces (action 3469). Shore level positioning influences transplant success, with studies showing that survival and abundance effects vary depending on the intertidal zone where oysters are placed (action 3472). Site-specific conditions create variable outcomes, as multiple studies found that transplantation effects depend on the particular location within Australian estuaries (actions 3472, 3474). The effectiveness for enhancing wider biodiversity shows mixed results - while transplanted oysters supported additional macroalgae, mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate and fish species that were absent from surfaces without oysters, the actual increases in species richness and diversity varied depending on site and structural features (action 3472).",

In Australia, the effectiveness varied by pool depth, shore level and site, with mixed effects on community composition depending on these factors (Action 3476).

Creating groove habitats (1-50 mm) can increase combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness and diversity on structure surfaces, with three of six studies showing positive effects, and grooves supporting higher species richness than small ridges or ledges (Action 3473). Creating hole habitats (>50 mm) along with other features like rock pools or grooves can increase combined macroalgae and invertebrate species diversity and richness on structure surfaces, with three studies showing positive effects (Action 3467). Using environmentally-sensitive materials such as ECOncrete along with creating grooves, small ledges and holes can increase species richness and diversity, though hemp-concrete, shell-concrete or reduced-pH-concrete showed mixed or no effects on species richness (Action 3469). Creating short flexible habitats (1-50 mm) decreased the combined macroalgae, invertebrate and fish species richness during low tide in one study (Action 3459). Small ridges or ledges (1-50 mm) showed limited effectiveness, with small ridges supporting lower species richness than grooves in comparative studies (Action 3464). Reducing the slope of intertidal artificial structures along with creating rock pools increased combined macroalgae, invertebrate and fish species richness in one study (Action 3461). Creating natural rocky reef topography did not increase combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness in one study (Action 3435).",

    "relevant_summary": "Multiple studies conducted in Australian estuaries have documented diverse biodiversity outcomes from interventions on intertidal artificial structures. Transplanting or seeding organisms onto intertidal artificial structures (Action ID: 3472) showed that oysters transplanted onto structures supported macroalgae, mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate and fish species that were absent from surfaces without transplanted oysters, with increased mobile invertebrate species richness observed in some cases. However, effects on fish species richness were mixed depending on site and presence of grooves and ridges. Creating 'rock pools' on intertidal artificial structures (Action ID: 3476) demonstrated that pools supported macroalgae, mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate and fish species absent from structure surfaces without pools, with most studies showing higher combined species diversity and richness compared to surfaces without pools. Rock pools were documented to be used by sea slugs, urchins, octopuses, macroalgae, invertebrates and fishes. Creating hole habitats (Action ID: 3467) on structures along with other features like rock pools or grooves supported macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate species absent from surfaces without added habitat features, and increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species diversity and richness on structure surfaces. Creating short flexible habitats (Action ID: 3459) altered combined macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate community composition on structure surfaces, but decreased combined macroalgae, invertebrate and fish species richness during low tide. Creating small ridges or ledges (Action ID: 3464) showed mixed results, with some studies finding no increase in species richness and others showing that ridges supported lower species richness than grooves created between them. Creating pit habitats (Action ID: 3475) altered combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition and increased species richness in some studies, but results varied by site and arrangement of features. Using environmentally-sensitive materials (Action ID: 3469) such as hemp-concrete showed altered community composition and increased mobile invertebrate species richness compared to standard concrete. Reducing slope (Action ID: 3461) combined with creating rock pools increased combined macroalgae, invertebrate and fish species richness on structures.",

When grooves and small protrusions, ridges or ledges were created together on intertidal structures, studies showed mixed effects on mobile invertebrate abundance depending on factors such as the depth/height of grooves and ridges, the presence of large ledges or water-retaining covers, shore level, and site location (Action 3474). Two studies found that creating grooves and small ridges/ledges increased oyster but not mobile invertebrate abundance (Action 3474). For subtidal structures with grooves and small protrusions, ridges or ledges, one study found mixed effects on combined macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate abundance depending on the orientation of structure surfaces (Action 3452). For large ridges or ledges (>50 mm) on intertidal structures, studies found that they increased the abundance of mussels or limpets, but not barnacles (Action 3465). Large protrusions on intertidal structures were found to support mobile and non-mobile invertebrate species that were absent from structure surfaces without protrusions, and increased limpet but not barnacle abundance (Actions 3463).

Long flexible habitats (>50 mm) supported macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate or fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without flexible habitats, and altered non-mobile invertebrate community composition (Action 3451). Hole habitats (>50 mm) altered combined macroalgae and invertebrate or mobile invertebrate and fish community composition when combined with other features like grooves and pits, and supported species that were absent from surfaces without added habitat features (Action 3434). Groove habitats (1-50 mm) altered combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition and supported macroalgae, non-mobile invertebrate and fish species that were absent from structures without added habitat features (Action 3448). Pit habitats (1-50 mm) altered combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition and supported mobile and non-mobile invertebrate and fish species that were absent from structures without the added habitat features (Action 3455). Grooves and small protrusions/ridges/ledges (1-50 mm) altered combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition and supported non-mobile invertebrate species that were absent from structure surfaces without added habitat features (Action 3452). Short flexible habitats (1-50 mm) had mixed effects on mobile and/or non-mobile invertebrate community composition but did alter non-mobile invertebrate community composition in one study (Action 3450). Small adjoining cavities or 'swimthrough' habitats (≤100 mm) had mixed effects on juvenile fish community composition but supported six species that were absent from structure surfaces without swimthroughs (Action 3436). Textured surfaces (≤1 mm) showed mixed results, with two of three studies finding altered combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition (Action 3449).",
