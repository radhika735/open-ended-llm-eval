      "relevant_summary": "To increase soil organic matter in Mediterranean vineyards, you can implement several evidence-based actions. Planting or maintaining ground cover in vineyards significantly increases soil organic matter according to ten studies from Mediterranean and similar climates (Action 1367). This practice also enhances soil microbial biomass and reduces erosion. Adding compost to vineyard soils consistently increases organic matter levels, as demonstrated in twelve studies from Mediterranean countries including Italy and Spain (Action 1362). Using reduced tillage practices shows strong benefits for soil organic matter, with fourteen Mediterranean studies finding increased organic matter compared to conventional tillage (Action 1371). Additionally, growing cover crops during fallow periods and amending soils with manures or compost (Action 911) effectively builds soil organic carbon and nutrient levels. Retaining crop residues on vineyard soils also contributes to higher soil organic carbon and nitrogen content (Action 907). These practices work synergistically and can be combined for maximum benefit in Mediterranean vineyard conditions.",

Cover crops also reduce soil erosion (two studies from Israel and USA found less erosion with cover crops compared to fallows) and increase water-stable soil aggregates. For crop production, effects are more variable: six studies found lower cash crop yields with cover crops, three found higher yields, and eight found inconsistent differences, while seven studies found no yield differences. Legume cover crops performed better than non-legumes, with eight studies showing higher cash crop yields when legumes were used as cover crops. Water management shows mixed results, with some studies finding reduced water availability but others showing less water loss through drainage, runoff, or evaporation. The Mediterranean climate context is specifically supported by evidence from Italy, Spain, and Israel, showing that cover crops are particularly effective at building soil organic matter and reducing erosion in these conditions.",

The benefits were greatest with permanent cover crops compared to temporary ones.\n\n2. **Growing cover crops between crop rows** (Action ID: 897). Studies from France and the USA demonstrated reduced erosion under cover crops. One randomized replicated study specifically found that cover crops reduced soil loss, with soil stability being highest under grass cover.\n\n3. **Adding compost to the soil** (Action ID: 1362). Two controlled studies from Spain found less soil erosion with added compost compared to soils without compost in some or all comparisons. Compost application also improved soil stability and increased organic matter content.\n\nThese soil conservation measures are particularly effective because they not only reduce erosion but also improve soil structure, increase organic matter content, enhance water retention, and support beneficial soil organisms including microbial biomass and mycorrhizal fungi.",

Reducing grazing intensity has been found to increase plant species diversity and abundance in several replicated controlled studies (Action 704). The use of grazers to manage vegetation shows mixed results, with some studies finding higher plant cover and abundance with cattle, sheep, or goat grazing compared to ungrazed plots, while other studies found lower cover or no difference (Action 1419). Using fewer grazers resulted in higher cover of some plant species in areas with lower grazing intensities, though plant diversity responses were inconsistent across studies (Action 1418). Seasonal grazing showed different effects on plant cover and diversity depending on timing, with some studies finding differences in species number and diversity between plots grazed at different times (Action 1421). Rotational grazing demonstrated limited evidence, with one study finding higher native plant cover after adoption, while another found no difference in plant density but more reproductive stems under rotational grazing (Actions 1420, 3965). Excluding grazers entirely showed complex effects, with 32 studies finding higher biomass, cover, or abundance of some plant groups in ungrazed areas, while 14 studies found lower abundance of some plant groups, and plant diversity responses varied significantly (Action 1417). Ceasing grazing to allow early succession revealed that grasslands abandoned for different time periods showed varying species richness compared to grazed grasslands, with some studies finding higher richness in abandoned grasslands and others finding lower richness (Action 3956). The evidence consistently indicates that Mediterranean grassland plant biodiversity responses to grazing management are highly context-dependent, varying with grazing intensity, timing, and specific environmental conditions.",

However, two replicated site comparison studies from France and Ireland found no increase in plant species numbers on farms with riparian buffer strips compared to those without. One study found that ground beetle diversity was higher in grazed riparian zones and narrow fenced strips than in wide riparian buffer strips, though the beetle assemblages in wide buffers were more distinct from adjacent pasture fields. Managing ditches to benefit wildlife showed more consistent positive results, with five out of eight studies from the Netherlands and UK finding increased invertebrate biomass, plant species richness, emergent plant cover, amphibian diversity, and bird visit rates.

Growing cover crops beneath main crops or between crop rows increases soil stability, with studies from France showing reduced erosion under cover crops and controlled studies demonstrating highest soil stability under grass covers. Maintaining ground cover in orchards and vineyards also significantly improves soil aggregation, with four replicated randomized controlled studies from Chile and Spain finding that soil aggregates were more water-stable in plots with seeded cover crops compared to tilled or bare soils. Retaining crop residues on fields reduces soil erosion and improves aggregation, as shown by a Canadian replicated site comparison study that found mixed effects on soil physical properties including the size of soil aggregates. Adding mulch to crops increases soil stability and reduces erosion, with five studies from India, France, Nigeria and the UK finding that mulches increased soil stability and reduced both soil erosion and runoff.

Planting or maintaining ground cover in orchards and vineyards has been shown to provide benefits, with studies from Mediterranean olive orchards in Greece finding more bee species and deposited pollen grains in managed orchards with ground cover compared to abandoned orchards (1404). Reducing cutting frequency on grasslands has demonstrated positive effects for pollinators including butterflies and moths, with studies from Italy and Germany showing meadows cut once/year had higher species richness compared to those cut multiple times/year (3961). Vineyard management practices that encourage native plants and reduce chemical inputs have been shown to increase butterfly abundance in Spain (3919). No-tillage practices in arable fields have evidence of benefit, with studies finding more pollinators in plots with no tillage compared to deep tillage (1405, 2516). Creating or retaining hedgerows provides significant benefits for pollinator communities, with studies showing higher bee species richness and abundance in fields with hedgerows (2515). Managing landscapes to enhance floral resources has shown positive correlations with pollinator abundance (362), and providing set-aside areas in farmland has been documented to benefit various wildlife groups including pollinators (156). Diversifying ground vegetation and canopy structure around woody crops like olive groves has shown higher reptile diversity and abundance, indicating ecosystem benefits that could extend to pollinators (3526).",

However, one replicated, randomized, controlled study found fewer invertebrates in plots with simulated grazing compared to ungrazed plots, though similar numbers of invertebrate species were found (Action 1419). One replicated, randomized, controlled before-and-after study in wet grasslands found more aquatic invertebrate species in continuously grazed plots compared to seasonally grazed plots in some comparisons (Action 1421).\n\nFor mammals, studies demonstrate varied responses: Two replicated, controlled studies in US grasslands found that abundances of some or all rodents were higher or increased more on sheep- or cow-grazed plots compared to ungrazed plots, though some species were less abundant or had lower monthly survival on grazed plots (Action 1419). Four studies examining grazer exclusion found mixed results, with two site comparisons in US grasslands finding more mammal species and higher mammal abundance in areas with cattle or sheep excluded compared to grazed areas in some comparisons (Action 1417).\n\nThe evidence primarily comes from grassland systems, though specific Mediterranean climate conditions are not explicitly addressed in these action documents.",

A meta-analysis from multiple Mediterranean countries found that both reduced tillage and no-tillage systems consistently increased soil organic matter compared to conventional tillage. Specifically, 14 studies found more organic matter in soils with reduced tillage versus conventional tillage, while a meta-analysis and 14 additional studies found more organic matter in no-tillage soils compared to tilled soils.\n\nConservation tillage practices are most effective when combined with crop residue retention and cover cropping. Retaining crop residues on fields was shown to increase soil organic carbon and nitrogen levels in multiple studies from Australia and China. Growing winter cover crops in arable fields significantly increased soil organic matter (measured as carbon) in Mediterranean-type climates, with a meta-analysis and ten controlled studies from Italy, Spain, and the USA demonstrating consistent benefits.\n\nThe research indicates that the combination of no-tillage or reduced tillage with residue retention and cover crops creates optimal conditions for soil organic matter accumulation. These practices work synergistically to reduce soil erosion, improve soil aggregation, and enhance microbial biomass. Implementation should be long-term, as studies showed higher soil quality and greater organic matter accumulation in plots with long-term conservation tillage compared to short-term implementations.",

The yield impacts varied by cover crop type, with legumes generally providing better outcomes than non-legumes.\n\nFor water availability, the evidence reveals several trade-offs: seven studies found less water in soils with winter cover crops, while two found more water in some comparisons. However, five studies found that less water was lost through drainage, runoff, or evaporation from plots with cover crops. Two Spanish studies showed conflicting results on water use - one found cover crops used more water than bare fallows, while another found no difference. The water content effects also varied with implementation, as Spanish studies found more water in soils with long-term versus short-term cover crops, and differences in water availability between different cover crop types.\n\nAdditional Mediterranean-specific findings include reduced nitrate leaching in Spanish studies with cover crops, and implementation options matter significantly - legume cover crops generally performed better for both yield and water conservation outcomes compared to non-legumes.",

Growing non-crop plants that produce chemicals attractive to natural enemies has been shown to increase parasitism and natural enemy numbers while reducing pest populations. Using reduced tillage practices may support natural enemy populations by preserving soil habitat, though effects vary by species. Allowing natural regeneration of ground cover beneath crops provides habitat and increases natural enemy numbers, with some studies finding more natural enemies in natural ground cover compared to bare ground.

Hedgerows supported more bee species, syrphid fly species, and specialist bees compared to field edges without hedgerows (actions 1407, 2515).
