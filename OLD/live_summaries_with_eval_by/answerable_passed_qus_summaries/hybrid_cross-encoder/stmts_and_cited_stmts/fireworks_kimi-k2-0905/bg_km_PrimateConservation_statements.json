One controlled, replicated, before-and-after study in Indonesia found that using noise deterrents along with tree nets reduced orangutan crop raiding, and a study in the Democratic Republic of Congo found that chasing gorillas with random noise resulted in gorillas returning from plantations to areas near protected forest. In contrast, there is currently no evidence available for the effectiveness of using bright lights to deter primate crop-raiding. The search found no studies that directly and quantitatively tested bright lights as a deterrent method, making it impossible to assess their effectiveness for this purpose.",

A before-and-after study in Cameroon found that no incidents of gorilla poaching occurred over three years after implementation of community control and monitoring of illegal activities (Action ID: 1482). A site comparison study in Nigeria found that there were more gorillas and chimpanzees in an area managed by a community conservation organisation than in areas not managed by local communities (Action ID: 1482). However, no evidence was found for the effectiveness of many other proposed conservation actions, including using set-asides for primate protection within logging areas, incorporating forested corridors or buffers into logged areas, providing domestic meat to logging workers to reduce hunting, closing non-essential roads after logging operations, reducing forestry team sizes, certifying forest concessions as primate friendly, implementing road blocks to inspect cars for illegal primate bushmeat, avoiding slashing of specific vegetation types, and implementing small and dispersed logging compartments.",

Additionally, all six monitored lemur species in Madagascar used bridges to cross roads and pipelines. For rope bridges between canopies, nine studies across Australia, Brazil, and Peru documented that rope bridges were used by a range of mammal species, with seven studies showing between three and 25 species utilizing the bridges. One study confirmed that arboreal marsupials using rope bridges did not experience high predation rates during crossing attempts.\n\nFor green bridges (overpasses), no evidence was found for effects specifically on primate populations, highlighting a significant research gap in this area. However, studies on general overpass structures for terrestrial mammals show promising results. Twenty-two studies found that overpasses were used by a wide range of mammals including rodents, carnivores, ungulates, bears, and marsupials, with four studies demonstrating that overpasses combined with fencing reduced vehicle-mammal collisions.

Limiting the time that researchers and tourists spend with habituated animals reduces prolonged exposure opportunities (Action 1539). Regular disinfection of clothes, boots, and other equipment prevents pathogen transfer (Action 1547). Keeping a safety distance from habituated animals minimizes close contact that could facilitate disease transmission (Action 1538). Implementing a strict no-feeding policy for wild primates prevents close contact during feeding activities that could spread diseases (Action 1502). Wearing gloves when handling primate food items or tools provides additional protection (Action 1548).

However, a majority of juvenile western lowland gorillas survived for at least seven years after nesting platforms were provided in Gabon, alongside other interventions.

However, evidence from translocating other problem mammals (such as bears) away from residential areas provides relevant insights. Studies show that translocated mammals often have poor survival outcomes - fewer than half of black bears translocated from conflict situations survived after one year, and grizzly bears translocated away from conflict situations had lower survival rates than non-translocated bears. A significant drawback is that many translocated mammals return to their original capture locations and continue causing nuisance, with some black bears returning up to six times following translocation. In the case of leopards translocated from human-dominated areas, attacks on humans and livestock actually increased compared to before translocation. Brown bears that returned to capture areas continued to cause nuisance problems, suggesting that relocation may not effectively resolve human-wildlife conflict long-term.",

A review across the USA, Canada and Sweden found that longer roadside fencing led to greater reduction of collisions between large mammals and cars.
