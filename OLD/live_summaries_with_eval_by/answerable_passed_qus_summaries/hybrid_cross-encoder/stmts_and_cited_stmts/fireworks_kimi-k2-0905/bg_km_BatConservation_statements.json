Preventing turbine blades from turning at low wind speeds through 'feathering' also proved effective, with five of six studies showing reduced bat fatalities (Action 970). Automatically reducing turbine blade rotation when bat activity is predicted to be high was effective in both German and US studies, significantly reducing fatalities for all bat species combined and for individual species (Action 971). Slowing turbine blade rotation at low wind speeds was found to reduce bat fatalities in a Canadian study (Action 2939).

Using ultraviolet filters on lights can also be beneficial, with one study finding that hedges lit with ultraviolet filtered lights had higher soprano pipistrelle activity than those lit with unfiltered light (action ID: 1020). Low intensity lighting is another strategy, with one controlled study in caves finding that low intensity white lights or red lights resulted in fewer bat flights than full white lighting (action ID: 1994). Directing lighting away from bat access points or habitats is recommended as a strategy, though no studies have yet evaluated its effectiveness (action ID: 2019).

Bat boxes showed variable occupancy rates across 44 studies, with 31 species using them as maternity roosts, though only 18 species used them commonly (action 1024). Design factors significantly influence success: black bat boxes were used more than grey, white, or wooden alternatives (action 1024), and bats showed preferences for specific designs including multi-compartment boxes and concrete versus wooden materials. Position matters - bat box orientation and sunlight exposure affected occupancy, with boxes on buildings having higher occupancy than those on trees (action 1024). Height effects varied between studies, while location type influenced success, with farm forestry sites showing higher occupancy than native forest (action 1024). Artificial caves and hibernacula demonstrated gradual adoption, with one study showing increasing bat numbers over nine years after construction (action 2049). Success was enhanced when artificial roosts were installed in areas where bats were known to roost previously (action 1024). Tree hollow creation showed promise, with eight of 16 artificial tree hollows being used by long-eared bats (action 2047), suggesting that mimicking natural roost characteristics improves acceptance.",

Placement factors include: orientation and sun exposure (affects occupancy with orientation and sunlight amount being important), height (studies show mixed results with some finding height affects occupancy while others found no effect), location type (higher occupancy on buildings than trees in some studies), habitat context (farm forestry sites vs native forest, pine vs mixed deciduous stands), and prior bat presence (higher occupancy in areas where bats were known to roost before installing boxes). Additional factors include the number of boxes installed (greater numbers across a site increase occupancy likelihood) and microclimate management (modifying roost temperatures can increase bat numbers). However, 22 studies found bats occupying less than half of provided boxes (0-49%), while nine studies found occupancy rates above 50% (54-100%), indicating that even optimally designed and placed boxes may not always be used.",

      "relevant_summary": "Based on action documents, eight studies evaluated captive breeding effects, showing that 6-100% of female bats captured in the wild successfully conceived, gave birth and reared young in captivity across studies in the USA, UK, Italy and Brazil. Two studies found that two of five and two of three bats born in captivity successfully gave birth to live young. Seven studies found that 20-100% of bat pups born in captivity survived from 10 days to adulthood. However, no studies evaluated the effects of releasing captive-bred bats back to the wild. Four studies evaluated rehabilitation of injured/orphaned bats. One study in Brazil found two hand-reared orphaned greater spear-nosed bats survived over three months in captivity and reached normal species size after 60 days. Two studies in the UK and Italy found 70-90% of hand-reared pipistrelle bats survived 4-14 days after wild release, with six of 21 bats joining wild colonies. One UK study found 13% of ringed hand-reared pipistrelle bats were found alive in bat boxes 38 days to four years after release. Another UK study found bats that flew in large flight cages for longer periods survived longer and were more active after release. Importantly, no studies evaluated breeding bats specifically to supplement wild populations affected by white-nose syndrome.",
