      "relevant_summary": "Opening forest canopies through clearing, coppicing, or thinning has mixed effects on butterfly and moth communities. Clearing or opening patches in forests generally increases butterfly species richness and abundance but can decrease moth species richness (Action ID 3938). Studies found higher butterfly abundance and species richness in cleared patches compared to unmanaged forest, with 19 out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern benefiting from small forest clearings. However, wider woodland rides had lower moth abundance than standard width rides or mature forest.\n\nCoppicing woodland typically increases butterfly abundance and species richness while potentially reducing macro-moth abundance compared to mature forest (Action ID 3939). Coppiced woodlands supported higher abundance of butterflies generally and heath fritillary specifically, as well as eastern eggar moth caterpillars. Different aged coppice supported different butterfly and moth communities, though macro-moth species richness did not change with coppice age.\n\nThinning trees within forests increases both butterfly species richness and abundance (Action ID 3940). Coniferous woodlands that had been thinned, sometimes with prescribed burning or mulching, showed greater butterfly species richness and abundance compared to unmanaged woodland. One study found that partially-cleared forest plots had higher butterfly species richness but lower moth species richness than closed-canopy forest.\n\nUsing thinning instead of clearcutting generally maintains moth species richness better than other harvesting methods (Action ID 3868). A controlled study found macro-moth species richness was higher after thinning than after patch-cutting or clearcutting, with richness similar to unharvested forest.",

Evidence from multiple studies supports the use of shielded \"full cut-off\" lights, which reduced the number of individual moths and moth species attracted to lights in a study in Slovenia (Action ID: 3904). Using low intensity lighting was also effective, with a study in Germany finding that fewer moths were attracted to low intensity lights that emitted yellow light with little UV compared to higher intensity lights with broader spectra (Action ID: 3902). \n\nThe use of 'warmer' lighting colors (red/yellow) rather than other colors has the strongest evidence base, with five studies across Germany, the Netherlands, Slovenia, and UK finding that fewer individual moths and moth species were attracted to yellow, green, white, or red lights compared to UV, actinic, blue, or conventional metal halide lights (Action ID: 3906). \n\nOther available actions include restricting the use of polarized light (Action ID: 3903), minimizing road lighting to reduce insect attraction (Action ID: 3852), restricting timing of lighting to conserve natural light regimes (Action ID: 3901), using glazing treatments to reduce light spill from buildings (Action ID: 3905), using barriers or vegetation to block artificial light (Action ID: 3618), and limiting or prohibiting industrial and urban lighting at night (Action ID: 2208).

A study found only 3 of 10 captive-bred barberry carpet moth populations successfully established, with at least one persisting 5 years.

Planting parks, gardens and road verges with appropriate native species has been shown to increase species richness of butterflies and moths, with studies in Germany and the USA finding greater richness in areas with native plants compared to mixed or non-native plantings. Practising wildlife gardening by avoiding insecticides and herbicides has demonstrated higher butterfly abundance in urban gardens. Altering mowing regimes on greenspaces and road verges to be less frequent or unmown increases both species richness and abundance of butterflies compared to regularly mown areas, as shown in studies from Germany, the UK, and Canada. Protecting existing greenfield sites or undeveloped land within urban areas maintains higher butterfly species richness than developed urban parks. Establishing green infrastructure such as green roofs can provide habitat, with older green roofs containing more nectar plant species supporting higher butterfly abundance. Stopping herbicide use on pavements and road verges creates habitat corridors, particularly when restored roadside prairies replace non-native weed-dominated verges, leading to greater butterfly abundance and species richness while reducing butterfly mortality risk.",

Three of four studies found that coniferous forests restored by burning (often in combination with thinning) had higher species richness of butterflies than unburned forests. Similarly, two studies found pine forests restored by burning had higher butterfly abundance than unburned forests. These benefits appear to be most pronounced 1-2 years after burning, with some studies showing increased abundance of specific species like Fender's blue caterpillars and eggs. However, there are also documented negative impacts. The primary negative impact is direct mortality during the fire event. One study in Australia reported fewer Eltham copper caterpillars in the spring after selective burning of eucalyptus forest compared to before burning. Additionally, research on Fender's blue butterfly found that caterpillar survival was lower in prairie plots burned one year before compared to unburned plots, indicating that recently burned areas may have reduced survival rates for early life stages. The timing of burning is also critical - one study found that early season burning increased caterpillar abundance, while late season burning did not have this benefit. Management considerations include leaving some areas unburned during prescribed burning operations, which can help mitigate negative impacts. Studies show that Karner blue butterflies increased in abundance over 2-3 years in areas where unburned patches were left, and six out of nine specialist butterfly species were more abundant when unburned areas were retained.",

Community responses showed that lightly grazed saltmarsh had different micro-moth communities than heavily grazed areas, with some studies finding similar species richness between grazed and unmanaged areas, while others found greater species richness with light grazing. Population responses were also mixed - some studies found higher butterfly abundance on grazed fenland and coastal dunes compared to unmanaged areas, while others found lower abundance on grazed meadow steppe.

Behavior studies indicated that brown argus and Alcon large blue butterflies were more likely to occupy areas managed by cattle or pony grazing compared to unmanaged land.\n\nPrescribed fire studies: Evidence from 13 studies showed that prescribed burning in grasslands and open habitats also produced variable results. Community composition was generally similar between burned and unburned areas, though one study found lower species richness in patch-burned pastures compared to rotationally grazed ones. Population responses showed that some species (heath fritillary adults, marsh fritillary caterpillars, Fender's blue caterpillars and eggs) had higher abundance after burning, while others (Brenton blue butterfly, rosy marsh moth caterpillars, regal fritillary adults) had lower abundance on burned land.

Long-term captivity can affect butterfly condition, with populations becoming heavier but developing smaller wings over generations. Release success rates are variable, with only 25% of programs surviving >3 years and 8% surviving >10 years, often requiring continued supplementation. Captive-bred individuals frequently show lower survival than wild or translocated counterparts.",

Studies show that established hedgerows support higher species richness of butterflies and macro-moths compared to crops, pasture, and beetle banks, with hedgerows having greater species richness than grass banks between fields. The abundance of butterflies, moths, and macro-moths is consistently higher along hedgerows than in field interiors or grass margins without hedgerows. Managing hedgerows through practices like cutting every 2-3 years instead of annually, cutting in autumn rather than winter, allowing incremental growth, maintaining hedgerows with trees, and keeping hedgerows between 1-2 meters tall significantly increases the abundance and diversity of butterflies and moths. Specific management techniques that benefit Lepidoptera include hedgerows with more complex structure, those containing trees, and those with scalloped edges. These management approaches create better habitat conditions, provide nectar sources, and support higher populations of both adult butterflies and moths as well as their caterpillars and pupae.",

One UK study found that larger cleared patches supported higher butterfly species richness and abundance than undisturbed forest, while another found both wider and standard width rides had similar macro-moth species richness to mature forest. Woodland coppicing also created habitat for butterflies, with studies showing higher butterfly species richness in coppiced woodland compared to unmanaged woodland, and higher abundance of butterflies generally and heath fritillary specifically.
