In contrast, a study on isolating beneficial ant colonies reported an increase in cashew yields (773). Delaying herbicide application resulted in lower yields in one study, and no effect in another (774). The use of push-pull cropping systems, which combine trap and repellent crops, was found to increase yields in four out of five studies (753).\n\nThe impact on pests and their natural enemies also varies. Earlier insecticide application was linked to a higher presence of natural enemies and, in two of four studies, a reduction in pests or disease-related damage (723). Threshold-based pesticide use was found to boost the populations of natural enemies in two out of three years, though these effects were sometimes short-lived (750). Isolating beneficial ant colonies led to more trees being occupied by these predatory ants and a decrease in pest-related damage (773). Delayed herbicide use was associated with an increase in natural enemies, but also more weeds (774). Push-pull systems were found to have more natural predators and increased parasitism of stem borer larvae (753).",

      "relevant_summary": "Several studies have documented the financial impacts of various natural pest control strategies, primarily focusing on crop yield. The use of crop rotations has been found to result in higher crop yields in some instances when compared to monocultures (1354). Similarly, adding compost to the soil has led to higher crop yields in some comparisons (1346), and in one case, fewer dead tomato plants (1392). The addition of pig slurry to the soil has also been associated with higher crop yields in some studies (1349).\n\nThe effects of other strategies have been more varied. For example, while planting flowers has been shown to increase crop yields in certain situations (1360) and lead to greater pest reduction (1400), it has also been linked to increased pest numbers and crop damage in other cases (1400), and smaller lettuces in one study (1360). The use of organic fertilizer has an inconsistent effect on yields, with some studies reporting higher, lower, or similar yields compared to inorganic fertilizers (1350).\n\nDifferent tillage practices also show mixed results. Reduced tillage has been found to lead to higher, lower, or similar yields depending on the type of crop (1359). Similarly, studies on no-tillage systems have reported a range of outcomes, with yields being higher, lower, or the same as conventional tillage depending on the specific circumstances (1355, 1358).\n\nThe use of ground cover has also shown variable results. While allowing natural ground cover to regenerate can have mixed effects on pest populations (720), planting or maintaining ground cover in orchards and vineyards has been found to decrease grape and avocado yields in some studies, while increasing chestnut and mushroom yields in others (1352). Furthermore, growing cover crops in arable fields has been found to result in lower, inconsistent, or no difference in cash crop yields in a number of studies (1351).",

Additionally, weevils can be employed to infect creeping thistle with systemic rust (123).
