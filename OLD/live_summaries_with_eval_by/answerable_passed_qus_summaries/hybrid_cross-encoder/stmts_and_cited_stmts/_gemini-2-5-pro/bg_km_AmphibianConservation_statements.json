Two studies in Germany found that closing roads during seasonal amphibian migration protected large numbers of amphibians from death [842].

However, one study found that this was only effective when barrier fencing was also installed [884]. The use of these crossings by amphibians is supported by 15 of 24 studies, which found that 23-100% of culverts or tunnels were used by amphibians [884]. The effectiveness and use of these crossings can be influenced by their design, including diameter, length, lighting, and substrate [884]. Some culvert designs, such as those with one-way tunnels and vertical entry chutes, were found to be unsuitable and resulted in high mortality rates [884]. One study also noted that despite the installation of culverts, thousands of amphibians were still killed on the road [884]. Human assistance for migrating amphibians has also been studied. Despite efforts to move large numbers of amphibians across roads, two studies in Italy and the UK observed population declines of 64-70% over 6-10 years in toad populations that were being assisted [784].

For shelterwood harvesting, three studies in the USA found that it led to higher, similar, or initially higher and then similar salamander abundance in comparison to clearcutting (851). In the case of thinning, two of four studies in the USA discovered higher amphibian abundance or a less negative overall response in thinned forests, while the other two studies had mixed results depending on the species and time since harvest (852). One study found that emigrating salamanders used thinned forests significantly more than clearcuts (852).\n\nIn contrast to unharvested areas, harvesting trees in small groups was found in two US studies to significantly decrease salamander abundance and alter species composition (844). Similarly, two out of three US studies showed that shelterwood harvesting also decreased salamander abundance and changed the composition of species when compared to areas with no harvesting (851). Studies on thinning compared to unharvested forests have shown mixed effects, with some species' abundance increasing while others, like the ensatina salamanders, decreased (852). Another study noted a negative overall response of amphibians to thinning, although one study found that a high volume of pre-existing downed wood helped prevent population declines after thinning (852).",

One study in the UK found that while predator defenses were maintained in a reintroduced captive-bred population, genetic diversity was reduced (873). Captive-bred Mallorcan midwife toads have been successfully raised to metamorphs or toadlets, with one UK study showing an 85% survival rate to metamorphosis (837). However, long-term captive breeding of this species (nine or more generations) has been associated with slower tadpole development, a reduction in one predator defense trait, and decreased genetic diversity (837). In contrast, reintroduction programs for the green and golden bell frog in Australia have had less success. Studies found that captive-bred green and golden bell frogs, released mainly as tadpoles, either did not establish breeding populations or only established them in one out of four release programs (872). Some captive-bred green and golden bell frogs released as tadpoles were found to have survived for at least 13 months after release (872). Other studies in Australia showed that a high proportion of captive-bred frogs released as eggs survived to metamorphosis, and there was limited breeding by released frogs (870). Additionally, the removal of viperine snakes in Mallorca led to an increase in the number of Mallorcan midwife toad larvae (830), and the addition of salt to a pond in Australia helped a population of green and golden bell frogs remain free of chytridiomycosis for at least six months (762).",

Six of these ten studies, which included five replicated studies in Denmark, Spain, the UK, and the USA, along with a global review, found that releasing head-started tadpoles, metamorphs, or juveniles led to the establishment of breeding frog populations or an increase in the populations of frogs or toads [881]. Two other studies showed mixed results, with breeding populations established in 12 of 17 studies reviewed or at two of four sites [881]. Conversely, two studies found that head-started metamorphs or adults did not prevent a frog population decline or establish a breeding toad population [881]. For five of these studies, other interventions like the release of captive-bred individuals, translocation, or habitat management were also implemented [881]. Nine of ten studies, including nine replicated studies in Australia, Canada, Europe, and the USA, reported that head-started amphibians released as tadpoles, metamorphs, or adults successfully metamorphosed, tended to survive the first season, winter, or year, or bred successfully [881].

This was the case at sites with only road closures and at sites that also had assisted crossings and barrier fences (842). Seven of eight studies found that installing barrier fencing along with culverts decreased amphibian road deaths (756). The effectiveness of these barriers can be dependent on the length and material of the fence (756). Some amphibians, such as treefrogs and 10% of common toads, were found to be able to climb over barrier fencing (756). For green frogs and leopard frogs, barriers of at least 0.6 m high were required to prevent them from climbing over (756). One study found that only a low number of amphibians were diverted by barriers (756). In six of seven studies, the installation of culverts or tunnels as road crossings was found to significantly decrease amphibian road deaths, although one of these studies noted this was only true when barrier fencing was also installed (884). One study found no effect on road deaths from installing culverts or tunnels (884). Fifteen of twenty-four studies found that culverts and tunnels were used by amphibians, however, five studies found that they were used by less than 10% of amphibians or not used at all (884). The use of culverts and tunnels by amphibians can be affected by their diameter, length, lighting, and substrate (884). Some culvert designs were found to be unsuitable for amphibians, and one study highlighted that thousands of amphibians were still killed on the road where tunnels were installed (884).",

The use of culverts or tunnels as road crossings has been found to significantly decrease amphibian road deaths in six of seven studies (884). For these tunnels to be effective, they often need to be used in conjunction with barrier fencing to guide amphibians to the entrances (884). One study found that barriers need to be at least 0.6 m high to prevent some frog species from climbing over (756).\n\nSeveral design characteristics of the tunnels themselves have been shown to affect their use by amphibians. Wider culverts were used more in three of six studies, while long culverts were avoided in one of two studies (884). The substrate within the tunnel is also a factor, with natural substrates being used more in three of six studies (884). Other factors that have been studied with mixed effects include lighting, the presence of water, entrance location, and tunnel climate (884). Certain designs have proven to be unsuitable, such as one-way tunnels with vertical entry chutes, which led to high mortality in common toads, and steel culverts, from which condensation deposits had very high metal concentrations (884). In one case, raising a road on a viaduct to restore connectivity between two wetlands also significantly decreased the deaths of migrating amphibians (840).",

Antifungal treatments have been found to be effective in many cases, with twelve out of sixteen studies showing they cured or increased the survival of amphibians with the disease (882). Specifically, the fungicide itraconazole was effective at curing amphibians in six of eight studies (882). Additionally, temperature treatment has shown promise, with four out of five studies demonstrating that increasing the enclosure or water temperature to 30–37°C for over 16 hours cured frogs and toads of chytridiomycosis (770).\n\nHowever, these treatments are not always successful. In four studies, antifungal treatments did not cure the disease but only reduced infection levels or had mixed results (882). Furthermore, some fungicides were found to cause death or other negative side effects in amphibians in six studies (882). One study found that itraconazole only reduced infection levels, and another reported mixed effects (882). Temperature treatment also has its limitations, as one study found that heat treatment did not cure northern leopard frogs (770). Lastly, a study on wild midwife toads found that treating them with a fungicide, in conjunction with pond drying, only reduced infection levels and did not eradicate the chytridiomycosis (767).",

For the Mallorcan midwife toad, three studies in Mallorca found that releasing captive-bred individuals as tadpoles, toadlets, or adults established breeding populations at 38% to 100% of sites (873).\n\nSurvival rates can be low, as seen in two Puerto Rican studies where captive-bred crested toads had low survival, and 25% were predated within two days of release (875). In contrast, a review of ten studies on head-started amphibians found that in nine cases, they tended to survive the first season or year and bred successfully (881). Head-starting amphibians has been found to increase populations of toads in some cases, though one study found it did not establish a breeding toad population (881).
