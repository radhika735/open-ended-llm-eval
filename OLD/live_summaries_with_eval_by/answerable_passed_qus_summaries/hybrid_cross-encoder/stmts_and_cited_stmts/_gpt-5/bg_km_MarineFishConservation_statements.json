Mesh escape panels/windows showed mixed effects: modifying panel position/size sometimes improved size-selectivity for haddock and whiting while effects for cod were similar to standard trawls, and reductions in unwanted catches were inconsistent across species and studies [2717]. Combining devices tended to enhance selectivity and bycatch reduction: panels/windows plus grids reduced unwanted fish, rays, sharks, and total discards in several studies and increased size-selectivity of whiting, with escape occurring via either device depending on species/size [2727]; grids combined with large supported openings reduced unwanted fish and sharks/rays in most studies, with exceptions (no reduction in sharks in one study; no reduction in sawfish) [2726].",

Both reviews reported that catch share fisheries had lower rates of over-exploitation than non-catch share fisheries, and a higher proportion met or exceeded management target levels for rates of exploitation [3812]. A global systematic review also reported that, in terms of reaching biomass-based management targets, fisheries with fleet-wide catch quotas were no different to those managed by catch shares or effort controls; however, along with catch share fisheries, fewer catch quota stocks were over-exploited than those with effort controls [3811].",

A Northeast Atlantic tagging study reported adult cod spent nearly a third of their time inside a seasonally closed spawning area during implementation (2664). In the North Sea, fixed temporary closures had little effect on cod fishing effort, whereas real-time area closures reduced the annual amount of cod caught (retained and discarded) (2664). In targeted fisheries, catch rates of red mullet and total catch (fish and invertebrates combined) increased after temporary closures over 10 years, but not European hake (2664); another Atlantic before-and-after, site comparison found no change in cod catches over nine years (2664). During a grouper closure, spear-fisher catches of herbivores increased, indicating a shift in targeting (2664). Long-term closures: Across five studies, replicated before-and-after work in the Norwegian Sea found higher weights of young salmon (but similar or lower weights of older salmon) after long-term closure of a commercial coastal fishery, and more young salmon (but similar older salmon) returning to rivers compared to before (2655). Site comparisons found mixed abundance responses: higher abundance for only one of seven species and lower monkfish abundance inside year-round groundfish closures of six–eight years (2655). In the North Sea, lesser sandeel biomass and density peaked but did not show an overall increase three years after long-term closure, and annual sandeel catches varied after an indefinite closure (2655). Inside an area closed to customary fishing for eight years, six of seven species had reduced flight response distance (2655). Additional outcomes included reduced unwanted cod catch where long-term closures were combined with gear-limited areas, and reduced overall fishing effort for lesser sandeel (2655).",

Adding artificial lights to gear reduced unwanted fish in shrimp trawls when lights were fitted to the fishing line (but not when attached to a size-sorting grid), and lights did not improve size-selectivity for several fish species on a grid [2695]. For reptiles, lights on gillnets reduced green and loggerhead turtle bycatch in multiple studies, with one study reporting no loggerhead mortalities in UV-lit nets compared to some in unlit nets, while increasing longline light sticks had mixed effects on loggerhead and leatherback catch rates [3554]. Visual deterrents (e.g., floating shark shapes) on gillnets reduced green turtle catch in one study, though captive tests showed mixed behavioural responses to shark-shaped and spherical deterrents [3553].",

Protecting spawning fish from capture via seasonal or permanent closures shows mixed population outcomes: a North Atlantic before‑after comparison found no increase in cod spawning stock biomass, survival, or size and no change in commercial catches over nine years, while tracking showed substantial use of closed spawning/nursery areas by cod and juvenile sharks, and a seasonal grouper closure shifted spear‑fishing effort toward herbivores [2938]. Establishing temporary fishery closures similarly showed no cod biomass, survival, or size increase over nine years in one Atlantic study, but tagged cod spent about one‑third of time inside a seasonal spawning closure during implementation, real‑time area closures reduced annual cod caught, some targeted fisheries showed increased catch rates after closures, and spear‑fishers targeted herbivores more during a grouper closure [2664]. Areas allowing only periodic fishing had greater fish biomass than openly fished areas and similar biomass to permanently closed areas, with higher catch rates than open areas over 18 months to six years [2679].",

Region‑specific findings included: Mediterranean—more eggs of four commercially targeted fish species inside a no‑take reserve enforced for three years, and higher small‑scale commercial catch rates closest to a 22‑year no‑take reserve, decreasing with distance [2682]; Indian Ocean—higher fish grazing rates in no‑take areas protected for 1 and 24 years, highest reef‑fish stock biomass in enforced no‑take areas compared to other management regimes, and most individuals of five fish species remaining within a no‑take reserve over nine years [2682].",
