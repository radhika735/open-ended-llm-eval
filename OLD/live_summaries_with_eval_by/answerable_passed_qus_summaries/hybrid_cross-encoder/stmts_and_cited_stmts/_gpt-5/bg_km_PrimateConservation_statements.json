Reported potential benefits from cases where problem primates were removed and relocated, alongside other interventions, include survival at or near non-residential release sites for at least four years for translocated rhesus monkeys (India) and western lowland gorillas (Republic of Congo and Gabon), and long-term survival for crop-raiding olive baboons comparable to non-translocated populations after 16 years (Kenya) (1422). Potential drawbacks, drawn from broader mammal translocations in residential-conflict contexts, include lower survival after translocation compared to non-translocated animals in several species (e.g., grizzly bears and some deer; most translocated Amur tigers not surviving one year) and individuals returning to capture locations and/or continuing nuisance behavior, sometimes repeatedly (bears), with one case of increased attacks on humans and livestock after leopard translocation; though one study found translocated brown bears occurred less often inside high-conflict areas than non-translocated bears (2336). Additional evidence on habituated mammals indicates that nearly half of translocated nuisance black bears returned to capture sites, while returns were less likely when younger bears were moved farther and across barriers (2341).",
