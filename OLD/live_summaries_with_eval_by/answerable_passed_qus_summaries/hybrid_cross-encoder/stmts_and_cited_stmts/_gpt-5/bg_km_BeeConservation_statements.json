Leaving margins to naturally regenerate sometimes supported more bumblebees than cropped margins, but outcomes were inconsistent between years and often depended on thistles, which may require control; in some trials naturally regenerated margins did not exceed cropped margins for bumblebee abundance or diversity [20]. Sown grassy field margins showed mixed results, with some trials finding higher bumblebee abundance (and sometimes diversity) and others finding no improvement over cropped margins [14]. At a broader scale, farms implementing agri‑environment scheme options (including field margin measures) sometimes showed enhanced foraging wild bee abundance or diversity compared to conventional management, but other trials found no enhancement, and population‑level benefits for bumblebees were not consistently detected [24].

In longer-term artificial rearing, B. terrestris queens decreased in weight over four years [50]. Husbandry factors influenced success: fresher, higher‑protein pollen improved reproductive output and queen quality; an 8L:16D light regime reduced time to first egg laying; hibernation at 4–5°C for ~45 days enhanced egg‑laying and colony formation but yielded smaller colonies than non‑hibernated queens; survival after hibernation was better for queens >0.6 g and with ≤4 months hibernation [50]. Field reintroductions of lab‑reared colonies showed variable queen production: some trials produced few or no new queens, while others produced good numbers [52]. Social parasitism by cuckoo bumblebees was sometimes high (25–66% and 79%), and was reduced when colonies were placed in intermediate‑resource landscapes and later in the season; other trials reported no parasitism [52]. Supplementary feeding in the field improved reproductive success in one trial but not productivity in another and did not reduce parasite load; released B. terrestris colonies foraged mostly >100 m from nests [52]. Overall, outcomes ranged from successful rearing and reproduction to larval mortality and reduced queen condition, with key challenges including diet quality, rearing regime, hibernation parameters, variable field productivity, and parasitism risk [50, 52].",

Placement relative to forage is important: nest sites should be within about 150–600 m of floral resources [47][80]. Nest design and materials influence productivity: reed stems and wooden grooved-board designs produced more bees per nest than several alternatives, whereas plastic-lined holes and plastic or paper tubes were less productive due to parasitism or mould; for Centris analis, cardboard straws in drilled wooden holes were more productive than grooved boards [47][80]. Repeated provision over multiple years increased use, with occupied nests approximately doubling over three years at given sites, and increases in foraging Osmia or local emergence where boxes were provided [47][80]. Parasites and predators reduce productivity, with measured brood losses from parasitism and other mortality in multiple studies; introduced earwigs and non-native bees sometimes occupied boxes [47]. Excluding ants from nest sites increased offspring production in a replicated controlled trial [46]. Under management, populations nesting in drilled blocks or stacked boards can increase markedly when conditions are good and plentiful floral resources are provided, indicating resource availability strongly affects productivity [54]. Species-specific suitability of designs matters: some species or designs (e.g., soil-filled boxes for a mining bee) were not occupied [47].",

Regarding planted floral resources, four replicated trials quantified wider responses: in the Netherlands, bee numbers and species richness were not higher 50–1,500 m away from planted flower patches, while in Nova Scotia orchards, patches of Lupinus polyphyllus significantly enhanced the reproductive success of Osmia lignaria [17]. A replicated controlled trial also found planted perennial leguminous herbs were more attractive to bumblebees in landscapes with a greater proportion of arable farming [17].

Certain materials perform poorly: plastic-lined holes and plastic or paper tubes were less productive due to parasitism or mould (47).\n- Non-target and introduced species, including European earwigs and introduced European leafcutter bees, frequently occupy solitary bee boxes; in one trial, introduced species used boxes more commonly than native bees (47). Earwig presence in boxes reduced use by native bees, necessitating exclusion measures (44).\n- Some nest box deployments fail to attract target bees: one trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using solitary bee boxes, soil-filled boxes for Andrena flavipes were not occupied, and a trial with stingless bee boxes in Brazil found no uptake (47; 49). Reported solitary bee occupancy can also be low, with 1–26% of available cavities used in some studies (80).\n- Placement and design constraints limit effectiveness: solitary bee boxes need to be within approximately 150–600 m of forage resources, and material choice (e.g., reed stems or certain wooden designs) affects productivity (80; 47).\n- Introducing nest boxes stocked with solitary bees has no evidence of effects on farmland wildlife, representing an evidence gap (81).",

Supplementary feeding had mixed effects: it improved reproductive success in one Canadian trial but did not reduce parasite load, and a USA trial found no increase in colony productivity with feeding [52]. Diet quality during captive rearing affected reproduction: freshly frozen pollen yielded larger, better-surviving queens and larger subsequent colonies than dried, frozen pollen, and higher-protein pollen increased worker offspring production [50]. Husbandry conditions also mattered: an 8h light/16h dark regime reduced time to egg-laying by B. terrestris queens compared to constant darkness [50]. Hibernation regimes affected outcomes: hibernating queens at 4–5°C for 45 days enhanced egg-laying and colony formation but produced smaller colonies than non-hibernated queens; queens >0.6 g and hibernated ≤4 months had higher survival [50]. Field outcomes of releases varied, with some trials producing few or no new queens and others producing good numbers [52].",
