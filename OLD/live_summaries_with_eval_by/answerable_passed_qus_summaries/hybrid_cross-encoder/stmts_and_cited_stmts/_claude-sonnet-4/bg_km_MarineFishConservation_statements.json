Long-term fishery closures demonstrated more positive outcomes, with two site comparison studies finding higher abundance of fish species in areas closed to groundfish fisheries for six to eight years compared to open areas (Action 2655). Additionally, one study found more young salmon returning to rivers in the five years after long-term closure of a commercial coastal fishery (Action 2655). In contrast, temporary fishery closures showed limited or no positive effects on fish abundance. One before-and-after, site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean found no increase in the biomass of the spawning stock of cod following a temporary fishery closure compared to fished areas over nine years (Action 2664). Similarly, the same study found no change in cod catches following temporary fishery closure compared to fished areas (Action 2664). The evidence suggests that while long-term closures can lead to increased fish abundance and biomass in protected areas, temporary closures may not provide sufficient time for fish populations to recover and show measurable increases in abundance.",

Regarding fish abundance, 30 of 54 site comparison studies found that marine protected areas prohibiting all fishing for up to 25 years or more had higher abundances (density and/or biomass) of all fish, fishery targeted fish species, non-fishery targeted fish species, and all or most individual fish species/groups monitored compared to unprotected fished areas (Action ID: 2682). Five of six reviews across the world found that non-fished marine reserves with one to 27 years of protection had higher abundances of all fish and all fish and invertebrates combined compared to fished areas (Action ID: 2682). Two systematic reviews found that marine protected areas prohibiting all fishing had greater overall invertebrate abundance and biomass compared to fished areas (Action ID: 2224).\n\nFor fish diversity and species richness, 14 of 20 site comparison studies found that marine protected areas that had prohibited all fishing for between one to more than 25 years had higher fish species richness compared to fished areas (Action ID: 2682). However, six studies found similar fish species richness between one and 20 years after all fishing was banned in protected areas compared to fished areas, and one systematic review found no difference in species richness between unfished protected areas and fished areas (Action ID: 2682). One study found higher number of fish species in the no-fishing/no access zone of a multi-zoned marine protected area compared to partially fished zones and unprotected fished areas 10 to 15 years after implementation (Action ID: 2674).\n\nThe research also shows that fish in protected areas are larger than those in fished areas. Two global review studies and two systematic reviews found that prohibiting all fishing in marine protected areas for one to 27 years resulted in larger fish overall compared to fished areas (Action ID: 2682). Eight of 11 site comparison studies found that non-fished protected areas had larger fish overall and larger individuals of all or most fish species/groups monitored compared to fished areas, after one to 22 years (Action ID: 2682).\n\nCommunity composition changes were also observed, with seven site comparison studies finding that protected areas where all fishing had been prohibited for between three and 16 years had different fish community composition compared to fished areas (Action ID: 2682).",

Two of four studies found that modifying the position and/or size of mesh escape panels improved size-selectivity of haddock and whiting, while the other two studies found size-selectivity was similar for cod compared to standard trawls (Action 2717). When combined with size-sorting grids, one study found that size-selectivity of whiting was increased compared to standard nets (Action 2727).\n\n**Size-Sorting Grids:** These devices demonstrate more consistent effectiveness for size-selectivity. Two of three studies found that size-sorting escape grids improved size-selection of haddock, but not saithe or cod, compared to standard nets without grids (Action 2720). Different designs and configurations of size-sorting grids show variable results - three of seven studies found better size-selectivity for unwanted redfish and Greenland halibut and commercial target hake compared to other designs, while three studies found effects varied between fish species, and one study found no improvement (Action 2728). When combined with square mesh codends, grids effectively reduced unwanted catches of whiting, plaice, cod, and haddock but not hake (Action 2725).\n\n**Large Supported Openings:** The evidence shows these devices are primarily effective for reducing unwanted catch rather than improving size-selectivity. Six of seven studies found that large supported escape openings (including Fisheyes, Bigeyes and radial escape sections) reduced overall catches of unwanted fish, immature red snapper and total unwanted catch compared to standard nets, but no specific size-selectivity improvements were reported (Action 2723). When combined with grids, three of four studies found reduced catches of unwanted fish and sharks and rays (Action 2726).\n\n**Combined Approaches:** The combination of mesh escape panels with size-sorting grids appears more effective than individual devices, with studies showing reduced unwanted catch and improved size-selectivity when both devices are used together (Action 2727).",

The Mediterranean also showed increased adult red mullet sizes after closure (Action 2673). Additionally, Mediterranean studies of bottom trawling prohibitions showed different invertebrate community composition compared to trawled areas after 15-20 years, with mixed results on diversity depending on study duration (Action 2099).\n\nIn the Indian Ocean, results varied significantly between studies and species. One study found increased abundance of long-snouted seahorses but not short-snouted seahorses after one year of prohibiting mobile bottom fishing gears (Action 2673).

Studies in the English Channel found that square mesh codends caught less non-commercial unwanted invertebrates in one of two areas, with similar amounts in the other area, compared to diamond mesh codends (Action ID: 2136). In the Bristol Channel, one study found that short-term survival of two of six fish species was higher after escaping through square mesh compared to diamond mesh codends (Action ID: 2714). Studies across European waters including the Aegean Sea, Mediterranean Sea, English Channel, and Bristol Channel found that square mesh codends reduced unwanted catches of all fish species monitored, young individuals of most commercially targeted fish, and total unwanted catch in some studies, though four studies found no reduction in catches of unwanted small rockfish and flatfish or total unwanted catch (Action ID: 2714). In the North Sea, studies found that trawl nets with escape grids and square mesh codends caught fewer unwanted whiting, plaice, cod, and haddock compared to diamond mesh codends (Action ID: 2725). Additionally, studies in the Adriatic Sea, Aegean Sea, English Channel, Mediterranean Sea, and the Kattegat and Skagerrak found that square mesh codends improved size selectivity for several species including European hake, horse mackerel, poor cod, greater forkbeard, and blue whiting, though five studies found no difference in size selectivity for other species like Atlantic mackerel and long rough dab (Action ID: 2714).",

In contrast, the South Atlantic Ocean showed different results - one site comparison study found no change in species composition between a reserve closed to all commercial fishing for 40 years and unprotected fished areas (Action 2667). Furthermore, the same South Atlantic Ocean study found no difference in overall fish diversity between the protected area closed to all commercial fishing for 40 years compared to unprotected fished areas (Action 2667). Regarding fish abundance, the South Atlantic Ocean study found that there were higher abundances of one of four commercially targeted fish species in the protected area compared to unprotected fished areas (Action 2667).

One global systematic review comparing different management approaches found that catch share fisheries performed similarly to fleet-wide catch quotas in terms of reaching biomass-based management targets, and along with catch quota fisheries, fewer catch share stocks were over-exploited than those with effort controls (action 3811).",

      "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence, there are notable differences between the effects of long-term versus temporary fishery closures on marine fish populations.\n\n**Temporary Fishery Closures (Action 2664):**\nFive studies found limited positive effects of temporary fishery closures. One study in the Atlantic Ocean found no increase in cod spawning stock biomass, no change in cod survival, and no change in cod length composition over nine years compared to fished areas. However, tagged adult cod spent nearly a third of their time inside seasonally closed spawning areas, providing increased protection from bottom-dwelling fish gear during spawning periods. Studies showed mixed results on commercial catch, with some fish groups showing increased catch rates during temporary closures while others showed no change.\n\n**Long-Term Fishery Closures (Action 2655):**\nFive studies examining long-term closures showed more consistent positive effects. Studies found higher abundance of young salmon returning to rivers five years after closure, though effects varied by species. Fish in long-term closed areas showed reduced flight response distances, making them more vulnerable to capture. Long-term closures resulted in reduced overall fishing effort and varied annual catch rates. However, effects were still mixed, with some studies finding lower abundance of certain species like monkfish in closed areas.\n\n**Complete Fishing Prohibitions (Actions 2667, 2681, 2682):**\nThe most comprehensive evidence comes from 79 studies on complete fishing prohibitions in marine protected areas. These studies found that areas prohibiting all fishing for one to 27 years showed higher fish abundances, larger fish sizes, higher species richness, and different community composition compared to fished areas. However, effects varied between species, with some showing similar abundances between protected and fished areas. The duration of protection influenced effectiveness, with longer protection periods generally showing stronger positive effects.\n\n**Comparative Effectiveness:**\nThe evidence suggests that complete, long-term fishing prohibitions are more effective than temporary closures. While temporary closures provide some protection during critical periods like spawning, they show limited population-level benefits. Long-term closures and complete fishing prohibitions demonstrate more substantial and consistent positive effects on fish abundance, size, and community structure, though the magnitude of effects varies among species and depends on factors such as enforcement, habitat type, and the level of fishing pressure in adjacent areas.",

Two of four studies found that fishing gear (longlines and traps) fitted with electropositive deterrent materials caught fewer unwanted spiny dogfish, longnose skate, sharks and rays, and fewer undersized halibut, compared to standard fishing gear (Action 2696). However, two other studies and a global systematic review found that electropositive deterrents resulted in similar catches of unwanted spiny dogfish, sharks, blue shark and sharks and rays compared to gear with no deterrents (Action 2696). For behavioral effects, three of four studies found that electropositive materials reduced the frequency of feeding attempts and bait consumption of spiny dogfish, great hammerhead and draughtboard sharks, while one study found no reduction in bait consumption by bonnethead and young lemon sharks (Action 2696).\n\nArtificial lights on fishing gear demonstrated more consistent positive effects. One study found that shrimp trawl nets with artificial lights caught fewer unwanted fish when fitted to the fishing line, but not when fitted to a size-sorting grid (Action 2695). For marine turtles, four controlled studies found that gillnets with LED lights, light sticks or UV lights caught fewer green turtles and loggerhead turtles than nets without lights (Action 3554).

Action 2682 found that ceasing or prohibiting all types of fishing in marine protected areas resulted in higher fish abundances, larger fish sizes, different community composition, and higher species richness/diversity across multiple studies. These areas provided protection for commercially important reef fish species and shark species for large proportions of time, effectively protecting them from fishing pressure.\n\nTemporary and seasonal fishery closures provide targeted protection during critical spawning periods. Action 2938 found that spawning and nursery areas closed seasonally or permanently to fishing were used by tagged adult Atlantic cod for nearly a third of time during spawning, and by young school sharks for up to 80% of time. Action 2664 showed that tagged adult cod spent nearly a third of time inside seasonally closed cod spawning areas during implementation, providing increased protection from bottom-dwelling fish gears during spawning periods.\n\nLong-term fishery closures demonstrate varied effectiveness. Action 2655 found that areas closed to groundfish fisheries for six to eight years showed higher abundance of some fish species, and areas closed to customary fishing for eight years resulted in fish having lower flight response distances, making them less wary of capture.\n\nPeriodic fishing restrictions offer a balanced approach. Action 2679 found that protected areas fished only for short periods over 18 months to six years had greater fish biomass than openly fished areas and similar biomass to areas permanently closed to fishing for six years.\n\nHabitat protection measures supplement fishing restrictions. Action 2228 found that marine protected areas prohibiting dredging for approximately 2.5 years had different invertebrate and fish community composition and greater cover of habitat-forming species compared to unprotected dredged sites. Action 2654 showed that areas where fishing gears targeting bottom-dwelling species had been prohibited for 15 years had higher numbers of larger and older cod than openly fished areas.",

Fish sizes were also larger in Mediterranean no-take areas, with 8 of 11 studies across multiple regions including the Mediterranean finding larger fish in protected areas after 1-22 years compared to fished areas (Action 2682). One Mediterranean study found greater reproductive success, with more eggs of four commercially targeted fish species in a 3-year-old reserve compared to fished areas (Action 2682). In the Indian Ocean, 15 studies examined the effects of prohibiting all fishing, with similar positive patterns observed (Action 2682). Indian Ocean protected areas showed different fish community composition compared to fished areas after 3-16 years of protection (Action 2682).
