Natural control agents include using cleaner wrasse, with studies showing that corkwing and goldskinny cleaner wrasse were as effective at controlling lice infestation as chemical treatments, though rockcook cleaner wrasse were ineffective at preventing lice outbreaks (Action ID: 738). Environmental modifications include altering lighting, with studies showing lower numbers of lice on salmon kept in low intensity artificial light or natural lighting compared to intense artificial light (Action ID: 741), and altering cage size, with larger cages recording lower levels of amoebic gill disease compared to smaller cages (Action ID: 742). Nutritional and biological interventions include using probiotics and immunostimulants, which reduced the number of salmon infected with lice by 28% when fed a diet composed of fish meal and 28% plant-based protein, with beta-glucans decreasing lice infection levels by a further 28% (Action ID: 732). Vaccination provides higher survival rates post exposure to disease-causing bacteria including Aeromonas salmonicida, Yersinia ruckeri, marine flexibacteriosis, bacterial kidney disease, and infectious salmon anaemia (Action ID: 733). Breeding for resistance traits shows increased survival levels in salmon exposed to infectious pancreatic necrosis when families are bred for high disease resistance (Action ID: 735). Management practices include establishing fallowing systems, which recorded lower lice numbers on Atlantic salmon in cages, though showed no difference in mortality from Amoebic Gill Disease (Action ID: 1026). Freshwater bathing provides mixed results for reducing amoebic gill disease, with one study showing reduction in amoebae numbers for up to 10 days, while another found similar levels in treated and untreated salmon (Action ID: 739). Aerobic training, particularly interval training, shows higher survival rates in salmon exposed to infectious pancreatic necrosis (Action ID: 740).",

Vaccinations demonstrate consistent effectiveness, with controlled studies from Iceland and Norway finding higher survival rates in vaccinated salmon compared to unvaccinated controls when exposed to disease-causing bacteria including Aeromonas salmonicida spp.achromogenes and Yersinia ruckeri (Action 733). Additional controlled studies in Australia and Canada reported higher survival in salmon infected with marine flexibacteriosis and bacterial kidney disease post-vaccination, with similar results for salmon vaccinated against infectious salmon anaemia (Action 733). Aerobic training shows promise, with a controlled study in Norway finding higher survival rates in salmon exposed to infectious pancreatic necrosis when they had undergone aerobic training, with interval training being more effective than continuous training (Action 740). Breeding for resistance traits proved effective, with a controlled study in Norway finding increased survival levels in salmon exposed to infectious pancreatic necrosis when families were bred for high resistance compared to those bred for low resistance (Action 735). Probiotics and immunostimulants show benefits, with a study in Scotland finding increased survival in salmon fed probiotics before exposure to four different disease-causing bacteria over 28 days compared to controls (Action 732). Environmental management strategies include fallowing systems, which recorded lower lice numbers on Atlantic salmon in cages in Scotland (Action 1026), and using larger cage sizes, which recorded lower levels of amoebic gill disease in salmon compared to smaller cages in Australia (Action 742).

Four replicated, controlled studies from Norway and Scotland found reduced final body weights in salmon fed plant-based protein diets compared to fish meal-based diets (Action 924). Feeding efficiency showed mixed results, with two replicated, controlled studies from Norway finding lowered levels of feeding efficiency when using plant-based proteins (Action 924). Digestibility was negatively affected in two replicated, controlled studies, showing lower digestibility of feed components when diets contained plant proteins compared to fish meal (Action 924). Morphological changes were observed, with the morphology of the distal intestine being altered in two randomised, replicated, controlled studies where salmon were fed diets containing plant-based proteins (Action 924). Positive or neutral effects include some studies finding similar growth rates between plant-based and fish meal diets, with three replicated and/or controlled studies from Norway, Canada and Scotland showing no difference (Action 924). Two controlled studies from Norway found similar final body weights between both diet types (Action 924). One study in Norway found increased feeding efficiency levels in salmon fed plant-based protein diets, and two studies in Canada and Scotland found similar feeding efficiency levels across both diet types (Action 924). Two randomised, replicated, controlled studies in Scotland and Norway found similar levels of digestibility across both diet types (Action 924). Survival rates and appetite were not affected by plant- or fish meal-based protein diets in two studies (Action 924). One randomised, replicated, controlled study found increased condition in salmon fed plant-based protein diets, though two other replicated studies found reduced condition (Action 924).",

One replicated study in Scotland found increased survival in salmon fed a probiotic before exposure to four different disease-causing bacteria over a 28 day period compared with controls (Action 732). A replicated, controlled study in Norway found the number of salmon infected with lice was reduced by 28% when fed a diet composed of fish meal and 28% plant-based protein, and adding beta-glucans to the diet decreased lice infection levels by a further 28% compared with controls (Action 732). The same study found the addition of mannan oligosaccharides improved gut function by preventing the development of soybean-induced enteritis compared with controls (Action 732). For training interventions, a randomised, replicated, controlled study in Norway found higher survival rates in salmon exposed to infectious pancreatic necrosis if they had undergone aerobic training, with interval training being more effective than continuous training (Action 740). Additionally, vaccination studies provide supporting evidence, with two controlled studies from Iceland and Norway finding higher survival rates in vaccinated salmon compared to unvaccinated control groups post exposure to disease-causing bacteria Aeromonas salmonicida spp.achromogenes and Yersinia ruckeri, respectively (Action 733).",

      "relevant_summary": "Based on studies in Australia, several husbandry practices have shown mixed or limited success in managing diseases and environmental impacts from salmon farming. Freshwater bathing has provided mixed evidence for reducing amoebic gill disease, with one study in Australia finding a reduction in numbers of amoebae on salmon gills persisting for up to 10 days after bathing, while another replicated, controlled study found similar levels of amoebae in the gills of treated and untreated salmon (Action 739). Fallowing systems showed limited effectiveness for disease management, as one study in Australia found no difference in mortality from Amoebic Gill Disease in cages where a fallowing system had been used (Action 1026). However, fallowing did show some success for pollution reduction, with a trial in Tasmania finding sediment community structure under Atlantic salmon cages became more similar to non-impacted sites over two fallowing cycles (Action 1027). Altering cage size showed positive results, with a replicated study in Australia recording lower levels of amoebic gill disease in salmon kept within larger compared to smaller cages (Action 742).",
