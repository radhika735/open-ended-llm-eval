    "relevant_summary": "Forest canopy opening through clearing, coppicing, and thinning has different effects on butterfly and moth communities. Clearing or opening patches in forests generally benefits butterflies but can negatively impact moths. Studies found that cleared patches in forests had greater species richness of butterflies but lower species richness of moths than unmanaged patches or closed canopy forest (action 3938). Butterfly abundance was higher in cleared patches that were also managed with coppicing and grazing compared to before management or unmanaged areas, though butterfly abundance declined over the first three years after clearing (action 3938). Larger cleared patches supported higher species richness and abundance of butterflies than undisturbed forest, while smaller patches did not show this benefit (action 3938). For moths, wider woodland rides had lower abundance of macro-moths than standard width rides or mature forest (action 3938). Coppicing woodland shows positive effects for butterflies, with coppiced woodland having greater species richness of butterflies than unmanaged woodland, and higher abundance of butterflies generally and heath fritillary specifically (action 3939). However, coppiced woodland had lower species richness and abundance of macro-moths than mature forest (action 3939). The timing of coppicing matters, with woodland coppiced 2-4 years ago showing greater butterfly abundance than woodland coppiced 5-11 or >15 years ago (action 3939). Thinning trees within forests combined with other management practices like prescribed burning or mulching resulted in greater species richness and abundance of butterflies compared to unmanaged woodland or before management (action 3940). Studies found that partially-cleared forest plots had higher butterfly but lower moth species richness than closed-canopy forest plots (action 3940). When comparing different harvesting methods, thinning resulted in higher macro-moth species richness than patch-cutting or clearcutting, with richness similar to unharvested forest (action 3868).",

For leaving unburned areas during prescribed burning, one replicated study reported that Karner blue butterfly abundance increased over 2-3 years in oak savannas and prairies where unburned patches were left, and Karner blue butterflies were recorded using all 11 unburned patches surveyed (Action 3879). Additionally, one study found that six out of nine specialist butterfly species were more abundant in pine barrens and prairies where unburned areas were left compared to sites without unburned areas (Action 3879).\n\nFor rotational burning, multiple studies show that the total abundance of prairie specialist, grassland and all butterflies was higher on prairies burned more than one, two or four years ago than on prairies burned in the last one or two years under rotational burning management (Action 3883). Two studies found that species richness of butterflies was higher on prairies burned more than one or four years ago than on prairies burned in the last one or two years under rotational burning management (Action 3883). The abundance of grassland and generalist butterflies was highest in the third year after burning, and migrant butterflies in the first year after burning under rotational management (Action 3883).\n\nHowever, rotational burning showed mixed effects for different species. Four of six studies found that rotational burning in prairies had mixed effects on butterflies compared to unmanaged sites, and one study found that prairies managed by rotational burning had more strongly declining populations of grass-skipper butterflies than unmanaged areas (Action 3883). For fritillary species, rotational burning had variable effects, with some species showing lower abundance in rotationally burned prairies in at least one surveyed region (Action 3883).

Using shielded \"full cut-off\" lights to remove outwards lighting was found to attract fewer individual moths and moth species than conventional lights without blinds or filters in a study in Slovenia (action 3904). Low intensity lighting also reduces moth attraction, with a study in Germany finding that fewer moths were attracted to low intensity lights that emitted a narrower range of yellow light with little UV compared to higher intensity lights with broader spectra including UV (action 3902). The use of \"warmer\" (red/yellow) lighting rather than other lighting colors shows promise, with four studies in Germany, the Netherlands, Slovenia and the UK finding that fewer individual moths and moth species were attracted to yellow, green, white or red lights compared to UV, actinic, blue or conventional metal halide lights (action 3906). Additional potential actions include restricting use of polarized light (action 3903), using glazing treatments to reduce light spill from inside lit buildings (action 3905), restricting timing of lighting to conserve areas with natural light regimes (action 3901), minimizing road lighting to reduce insect attraction (action 3852), removing or changing turbine lighting to reduce insect attraction (action 3843), and using barriers or vegetation to reduce artificial light (action 3618), though no studies were found evaluating the effects of these specific actions on moth populations.",

Specifically for large copper, translocated populations survived for up to 38 years but ultimately died out or required supplementation by further releases (Action 3909).\n\nFor captive-bred releases, six studies reported that populations persisted for 2-28 years and increased in abundance, while two studies found that captive-bred populations died out one, two, or 12 years after release, or required further releases to survive (Action 3914). One study found that only three of 10 captive-bred barberry carpet moth populations established, with at least one persisting for five years (Action 3914).\n\nFor translocation outside known range, two of three studies reported that populations persisted and increased in abundance over eight and 28 years, while one population died out within one year (Action 3911). \n\nCaptive breeding programs showed that populations could be successfully maintained, with some species reared for 12 generations or more than 25 years in captivity (Action 3916).

One review\\u00a0reported that attempts to rear caterpillars of four species of large blue had mixed success.\\nReproductive success (5 studies): One controlled study in the UK\\u00a0reported that female large copper laid more eggs, and these eggs had a higher hatching success, in a cage kept in a greenhouse than in a cage kept outside. One study in South Africa\\u00a0reported that a Dickson\\u2019s copper butterfly laid eggs in captivity in the presence of black cocktail ants from the site where she emerged but not from 10 km away.

The sixth study\\u00a0found that mountain Alcon blue caterpillars had a similar survival rate in ant nests with or without queens present. Two of these studies, and one replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the USA, found that the survival of large blue, mountain Alcon blue\\u00a0and monarch\\u00a0caterpillars differed when reared in ant nests of different species\\u00a0or on different species of milkweed.

One of these studies also found that Puget blue caterpillars kept in refrigerators while overwintering had a lower survival than caterpillars kept in environmental chambers or outside.

One study in South Africa\\u00a0reported that wild-caught final instar Cape Peninsula butterfly caterpillars reared in an artificial pugnacious ant nest successfully pupated and became adults, but captive-hatched first instar Cape Peninsula and Riley\\u2019s skolly butterfly caterpillars placed next to a nest did not survive to pupation.\\nCondition (5 studies): Two studies (including one controlled study) in the UK\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0found that adult large white from a population kept in captivity for &gt;25 years were heavier, and had smaller wings, than individuals from a population in its third generation in captivity, and captive-reared Puget blue adults were smaller than wild-caught butterflies. One of these studies also found that Puget blue caterpillars raised in environmental chambers or outdoor enclosures reached a similar size as adults. One replicated, controlled study in Spain\\u00a0found that mountain Alcon blue caterpillars reared in ant colonies with winged females were lighter than caterpillars reared in colonies without winged females. One replicated, controlled study in Israel\\u00a0found that spring webworm caterpillars fed vegetation from cattle-grazed pasture had a similar growth rate to caterpillars fed vegetation from an ungrazed paddock. One study in South Africa\\u00a0reported that Brenton blue butterfly caterpillars reared on Indigofera erecta leaves with no ants became dwarf adults, but those reared on whole Indigofera plants with an ant colony became full-sized adults.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\"\n}"

Protecting greenfield sites or undeveloped land in urban areas is effective, with protected native forest and grassland having higher species richness of butterflies than urban parks or non-native plantations (Action 3836). Planting parks, gardens and road verges with appropriate native species shows positive results, with native species supporting greater species richness of butterfly and moth adults and caterpillars compared to mixed or exclusively non-native plant species (Action 3842). Additionally, native milkweed species planted in gardens support higher abundance of monarch butterfly eggs and caterpillars (Action 3842). Wildlife gardening practices can be beneficial, with planted buddleia and marjoram being visited by adult butterflies and moths more frequently than other plant species (Action 3834). Stopping the use of pesticides as seed dressings and sprays in flower beds and greenspaces increases butterfly abundance, specifically showing that gardens where insecticides and herbicides were not used had higher abundance of butterflies (Action 3900). Green infrastructure such as green roofs can support butterflies, with older green roofs containing more nectar plant species in larger areas having higher butterfly abundance (Action 3837).",

Additionally, moth species richness recovered faster after shelterwood harvesting compared to clearcutting in one replicated, controlled study (Action 3871). Another study found that forests managed by shelterwood harvesting had similar moth species richness to forests managed by single tree harvesting, group selection harvesting, or clearcutting, but lower richness than unharvested forests (Action 3871). Regarding group selection harvesting and thinning, one controlled study found that macro-moth species richness was higher after thinning than after clearcutting or patch-cutting, with thinned forest richness being similar to unharvested forest (Action 3868). Group selection harvesting showed similar moth species richness to single tree harvesting or clearcutting, but lower than unharvested forest, and moth species richness recovery occurred at a similar rate after group selection harvesting or clearcutting, though both recovered slower than shelterwood harvesting (Action 3868). For selective logging, one replicated study found that single tree selection resulted in similar moth species richness to group selection harvesting or clearcutting, but lower richness than unharvested forest (Action 3867). In selectively logged forests in Sweden, there was higher abundance of exposed moth caterpillars but similar abundance of concealed moth caterpillars compared to clearcut forests (Action 3867).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"3871\",\n    \"3868\",\n    \"3867\"\n  ]\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "Different management methods for linear features have varying effects on butterflies and moths according to the evidence. Under power lines, mechanical cutting increases butterfly species richness and abundance compared to unmanaged areas, with highest species richness occurring 2-4 years after scrub and trees are cleared (action 3855). The timing of management matters - butterfly abundance is higher in areas cleared \u22642 years ago compared to areas cut \u22654 years earlier, and areas cleared 2-4 years earlier have higher abundance than those cleared 1 year or 6-8 years earlier (action 3855).\n\nFor road verge mowing regimes, less frequent mowing or unmown areas show consistently positive effects. Less frequently mown or unmown urban greenspaces have higher species richness and diversity of butterflies and moths than more frequently mown areas (action 3841). Unmown road verges support higher abundance of all adult butterflies than regularly mown areas (action 3841). Road verges mown less frequently or later in summer have fewer dead butterflies killed by traffic than more frequently or earlier mown verges (action 3841, 3854).\n\nRotational mowing proves beneficial, with grasslands managed by mowing strips in alternate years or leaving rotational areas uncut showing higher abundance and species richness of butterflies and burnet moths than areas cut in full (action 3966). Twenty-nine out of 32 butterfly species preferred meadows that were half mown to those cut in full twice per year (action 3966).\n\nHerbicide cessation on road verges shows positive effects, with restored roadside prairies where herbicide application was restricted having greater species richness and abundance of butterflies than verges with unrestricted herbicide use (action 3899). Timing of management is crucial - delaying cutting until July or September results in greater abundance of butterflies compared to cutting in May or June, though effects vary by year (action 3967). Wide road verges support higher species richness and abundance of butterflies than narrow verges (action 3854), and verges sown with native wildflowers and more butterfly larval food plants have higher species richness and diversity than those dominated by non-native vegetation (action 3854). Marking caterpillar webs before mowing can help preserve populations, with one study showing increased web numbers the following year after marking (action 3970).",

Excluding vertebrate herbivores has been more extensively studied than invertebrate herbivore exclusion. For invertebrate herbivore exclusion, one study in the UK found that sites fenced to exclude grazing animals had higher density of pearl-bordered fritillary butterflies than unfenced sites (Action 3885).\n\nFor vertebrate herbivore exclusion, effects on species richness and diversity showed mixed results. Four studies found that forest plots fenced to exclude or reduce density of non-native pigs and deer had greater species richness of butterflies and macro-moths than unfenced plots, while two studies found mixed effects on butterfly and arthropod species richness when excluding elk, depending on fire intensity and year. One global systematic review found that reducing or removing grazing or browsing by wild or domestic herbivores in temperate and boreal forests did not affect species richness of butterflies and moths (Action 3891).\n\nAbundance effects were more consistently positive. Eight studies found that forest and grassland plots fenced to exclude or reduce density of deer, sheep, pigs and large herbivores had higher abundance of butterflies, moths, caterpillars, rare macro-moths and New Forest burnet moths than unfenced plots. However, effects varied by herbivore type - two studies found mixed effects when excluding elk depending on fire intensity and year, and one study found that excluding sika deer resulted in similar abundance of all moths but lower abundance of tree-feeding moths (Action 3891).\n\nSurvival and condition of butterflies improved with herbivore exclusion. One study found that all Glanville fritillary caterpillar nests survived in grassland fenced to exclude sheep compared to 88% in grazed areas, and fewer caterpillar nests were damaged in fenced areas (Action 3891).\n\nIn contrast, intensive grazing showed negative effects.

However, effects varied by herbivore type - two studies found mixed effects when excluding elk depending on fire intensity and year, and one study found that excluding sika deer resulted in similar abundance of all moths but lower abundance of tree-feeding moths (Action 3891).\\n\\nSurvival and condition of butterflies improved with herbivore exclusion. One study found that all Glanville fritillary caterpillar nests survived in grassland fenced to exclude sheep compared to 88% in grazed areas, and fewer caterpillar nests were damaged in fenced areas (Action 3891).\\n\\nIn contrast, intensive grazing showed negative effects. Studies found that intensively grazed grasslands had lower abundance of adult butterflies, adult burnet moths, adult regal fritillaries and spring webworm caterpillar nests compared to ungrazed or lightly grazed grasslands (Action 3962).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"3885\",\n    \"3891\",\n    \"3962\"\n  ]\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "Restoring grassland from arable land shows positive benefits for butterfly communities, with several studies demonstrating that 4-5-year-old created grasslands and abandoned cropland had greater species richness of butterflies, burnet moths and all moths than conventionally managed grassland or cultivated farms (Action 3929). Grasslands restored from arable land by sowing grasses, legumes and other non-woody, broadleaved plants had higher species richness and abundance of butterflies than grasslands established with grass-only mixes or less competitive species (Action 3929). Over 10 years after restoration, restored grassland from arable land had higher abundance of moths than conventional grassland and similar abundance to semi-natural grasslands, though abundance did not increase with time since restoration (Action 3929).\n\nIn contrast, restoration outcomes from abandoned meadows show more variable results. Semi-natural grasslands restored by scrub clearance and reintroduction of grazing or mowing had different butterfly communities to existing species-rich grasslands and did not become more similar over time (Action 3955). Some studies found that semi-natural grasslands restored by cattle grazing had lower species richness of butterflies and day-flying moths than unrestored and continuously managed grasslands (Action 3955). However, grasslands restored by scrub clearing showed higher density of blue-spot hairstreak eggs and egg batches than unrestored or continuously managed grasslands (Action 3955).\n\nFor grasslands where management ceased on existing meadows, effects varied by time since abandonment. Grasslands abandoned for 3-13 years had similar species richness of butterflies and burnet moths to grasslands managed by mowing, while grasslands abandoned for more than 50 years had lower species richness than annually mowed grasslands (Action 3957). Grasslands abandoned for 5-20 years showed mixed abundance patterns depending on butterfly species compared to grazed grasslands (Action 3956), and after abandonment, butterfly communities became dominated by generalist species with fewer generations per year (Action 3956).",

    "relevant_summary": "The evidence on wetland habitat restoration for butterfly conservation shows mixed but generally positive effects across different wetland types. For floodplain restoration, wetland prairie restored by seeding willow dock and seasonal flooding had higher abundance of great copper eggs than degraded, unflooded prairie, and restored wetland prairie with native seed mixes and annual flooding was used more by adult great copper than degraded prairie (Action 3949). However, survival of great copper eggs and caterpillars was lower in restored wetland prairie than in degraded, unflooded prairie (Action 3949). For peatland restoration, evidence shows substantial benefits: mires restored by raising water tables and removing large trees had higher species richness of mire specialist butterflies than before restoration or unrestored drained mires, achieving similar species richness to pristine mires (Action 3948). Bogs re-wetted by blocking drains and mires restored by raising water tables had higher abundance of rosy marsh moth caterpillars and mire specialist butterflies than before restoration or unrestored mires (Action 3948). However, some negative effects were observed - large heath butterfly caterpillars had lower winter survival in areas where water levels had risen due to peatland restoration, and wet heathland with recently raised water levels were less frequently occupied by Alcon large blue than sites where water levels had not been raised (Action 3948). For wetland management, recently cut fens had fewer large copper eggs and lower caterpillar survival than uncut fens, though fens managed by mowing had greater butterfly species richness than those managed by cattle grazing (Action 3950). One study found that wetland creation increased macroinvertebrate diversity including butterflies and moths, with species richness increasing with wetland age and reaching levels similar to mature ponds (Action 3949).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on documented research, prescribed fire in forest ecosystems shows both beneficial and negative impacts on butterfly and moth populations. \n\nBenefits documented include: Three of four studies found that coniferous forest restored 1-2 years ago by burning (in combination with thinning) or burned once within the last 20 years had higher species richness of butterflies than unburned forest (Action 3877). Two studies found that pine forest restored 1-2 years ago by burning (in combination with thinning) had higher abundance of butterflies than unburned forest (Action 3877). Leaving unburned patches during prescribed burning showed positive effects, with Karner blue butterfly abundance increasing over 2-3 years in oak savannas and prairies where unburned patches were left, and six out of nine specialist butterfly species were more abundant in pine barrens and prairies with unburned areas compared to sites without unburned areas (Action 3879). Karner blue butterflies were documented using all 11 unburned patches surveyed within oak savannas and prairies managed by burning (Action 3879).\n\nNegative impacts documented include: One study found that mixed forest and shrubland sites burned the year before had similar butterfly species richness to unburned sites, showing no benefit (Action 3877). One study reported that in the spring after selective burning of eucalyptus forest there were fewer Eltham copper caterpillars than before (Action 3877). Management with late season burning did not increase caterpillar abundance, while early season burning or no burning for 2-5 years did increase abundance (Action 3878). \n\nThe timing of prescribed burning appears important, as one study found that early season burning or no burning for 2-5 years increased caterpillar abundance in tropical savanna and floodplain, but late season burning did not (Action 3878).",

Establishing green infrastructure such as green roofs shows promise, though one study found green roofs had lower species richness than urban parks, but higher abundance on older green roofs with more nectar plant species in larger areas (Action 3837).\n\nPlanting parks, gardens and road verges with appropriate native species is effective, with studies showing that gardens planted with native species had greater species richness of butterfly and moth adults and caterpillars than those with non-native species, and higher abundance of caterpillars (Action 3842). Wildlife gardening practices can help, though studies found mixed results - gardens without insecticides and herbicides had higher butterfly abundance, and planted buddleia and marjoram were visited more frequently by adult butterflies and moths (Action 3834).\n\nPlanting nectar flower mixtures and wildflower strips is highly beneficial, with studies showing sown wildflower strips had higher species richness and diversity of butterflies and moths than conventional field margins, and higher abundance of all butterflies, generalist butterflies, and specialist butterflies (Action 3932). Field margins sown with wildflowers had greater species richness and abundance of butterflies than grass-only margins.\n\nChemical management is important - stopping pesticide use in flower beds and greenspaces increased butterfly abundance (Action 3900), and stopping herbicide use on pavements and road verges led to greater species richness and abundance of butterflies, with lower butterfly mortality risk (Action 3899).\n\nAltering mowing regimes on greenspaces and road verges benefits butterflies and moths, with less frequently mown or unmown urban greenspaces having higher species richness and diversity of butterflies and moths than frequently mown areas, and higher abundance of adult butterflies (Action 3841). Road verges mown less frequently or later in summer had fewer traffic-killed butterflies.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on extensive research studies, ceasing grassland management shows mixed effects on butterfly abundance and diversity depending on the time since abandonment and butterfly species characteristics.\n\n**Effects on Species Richness/Diversity:**\nWhen mowing ceases, five of seven studies found that grasslands abandoned for 3-13 years had similar butterfly species richness to managed grasslands, though grasslands abandoned for more than 50 years showed lower species richness than annually mowed areas (Action 3957). For grazing cessation, six of nine studies found that grasslands ungrazed for >5 years had similar butterfly and moth species richness to grazed grasslands, with one study showing that grasslands abandoned for 5-15 years had greater species richness than sheep-grazed areas (Action 3956).\n\n**Effects on Abundance:**\nCeasing mowing produced variable results: four studies found grasslands abandoned for >1-20 years had lower butterfly abundance than mowed areas, while four other studies found abandoned grasslands had higher abundance than managed areas (Action 3957). For grazing cessation, six of 20 studies found grasslands abandoned for 1-25 years had higher butterfly abundance than grazed areas, while four studies found lower abundance in abandoned areas compared to grazed grasslands (Action 3956).\n\n**Species-Specific Effects:**\nBoth types of management cessation led to community shifts toward generalist species and species with fewer generations per year over 6 years (Actions 3956, 3957). Woodland and hedgerow butterfly species increased in abandoned grasslands, while grassland specialist species decreased (Actions 3956, 3957). Some specialist species like large blue and silver-studded blue went extinct in abandoned meadows (Action 3956).\n\n**Timing Effects:**\nThe timing since abandonment matters significantly - intermediate periods (2-9 years post-abandonment) often showed higher butterfly density than either currently managed or long-abandoned (>10 years) grasslands (Action 3956).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, several alternatives to prescribed fire exist for maintaining disturbance in forest habitats that benefit butterflies and moths:\n\n**Coppicing woodland** (Action 3939) involves cutting trees at ground level to stimulate regrowth. Studies found that coppiced woodland supported different communities of moths and butterflies compared to mature forest, with some studies showing greater species richness of butterflies than unmanaged woodland. Coppiced woodland had higher abundance of butterflies generally and specific species like heath fritillary compared to unmanaged woodland. Multiple studies found that woodland coppiced 2-15 years ago had higher abundance of butterflies and moths than woodland coppiced over 15 years ago.\n\n**Clearing or opening patches in forests** (Action 3938) creates forest openings that benefit butterflies and moths. Studies found that cleared patches in forests had greater species richness of butterflies but lower species richness of moths than closed canopy forest. Larger cleared patches supported higher species richness and abundance of butterflies than undisturbed forest. Cleared patches managed with coppicing and grazing had higher abundance of butterflies generally and specific species like chequered blue, woodland brown, high brown fritillary and small pearl-bordered fritillary than unmanaged areas.\n\n**Thinning trees within forests** (Action 3940) involves selective removal of trees to reduce forest density. Studies found that coniferous woodland thinned along with prescribed burning, mulching or nearby felling had greater species richness and abundance of butterflies than unmanaged woodland. Partially-cleared forest plots had higher butterfly species richness than closed-canopy forest plots.\n\n**Selective or reduced impact logging** (Action 3867) provides an alternative to conventional logging. Studies found that selectively logged forests had higher abundance of exposed moth caterpillars than clearcut forests and similar abundance of all moth caterpillars to undisturbed forests. Forests managed by reduced impact logging had similar or higher abundance of butterflies compared to primary forest.\n\n**Group tree harvesting or thinning instead of clearcutting** (Action 3868) showed that forests harvested by thinning had higher species richness of macro-moths than forests managed by patch-cutting or clearcutting, with richness similar to unharvested forest.\n\n**Rough grazing** (Action 3944) in semi-natural habitats can be applied to forest edges and openings. Studies found that areas managed by cattle or pony grazing had similar or higher species richness and abundance of butterflies compared to unmanaged land, with some grazed areas being more likely to be occupied by specific butterfly species.",

Four studies have specifically evaluated the effects of restoring or creating new habitats after mining and quarrying on butterflies and moths, conducted in the Czech Republic, UK, and New Zealand (action 3862). Key findings include: technically restored quarries had lower species richness of butterflies and day-flying moths than quarries left to restore naturally, and flattened spoil heaps had lower species richness of moths than unflattened spoil heaps (action 3862). However, one Czech study found that 15% of 380 invertebrate species (including 208 moth species) were only found on flattened spoil heaps, compared to 30% which were only found on unflattened heaps, suggesting both restoration approaches support unique species communities (action 3862). Positive restoration outcomes were also documented: a peat bog restored after mining in New Zealand supported similar density and size of Fred the thread moth caterpillars to undisturbed bogs, and on slate waste tips in the UK, trees with applied fertilizer had similar abundance of caterpillars to unfertilized trees (action 3862). Notably, no studies were found that evaluated the effects of protecting or restoring brownfield or ex-industrial sites specifically for butterflies and moths (action 3835).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, several effective methods for reducing grazing intensity on grasslands have been shown to benefit butterfly populations:\n\n**Reducing Stocking Density (Action 3959):** Five of eight studies found that grasslands grazed with lower stocking densities of sheep, cattle or mixed livestock had greater species richness of adult butterflies, moths and burnet moths compared to higher stocking densities. Eight studies found that lower stocking densities resulted in greater abundance of butterflies, moths, burnet moths and their caterpillars.\n\n**Seasonal Removal of Livestock (Action 3960):** Three controlled studies found that grasslands where cattle or mixed cattle and sheep were removed in summer, or sheep removed in winter, had higher abundance of butterflies and caterpillars than grasslands grazed throughout the season. One study found greater species richness when cattle were removed in summer.\n\n**Multiple Low-Intensity Interventions (Action 3958):** Six of ten studies found that less intensively managed grasslands had higher species richness of butterflies and moths than conventionally managed grasslands. Three of four studies showed higher abundance of butterflies, micro-moths and declining macro-moths in low-input or unfertilized, ungrazed grassland managed with a single cut.\n\n**Rotational Grazing (Action 3965):** Two of four studies found that rotationally grazed grasslands had greater species richness of butterflies and burnet moths than continuously grazed grassland. Two studies showed higher abundance of butterflies, burnet moths and caterpillars in rotationally grazed compared to continuously grazed grasslands.\n\n**Delayed Grazing/Cutting Dates (Action 3967):** Three of four studies found that grassland cut in July or September had greater abundance of butterflies, burnet moths and caterpillars than grassland cut in May or June. One study found meadows where grazing commenced after 15 June had higher abundance of clouded Apollo butterflies.\n\n**Reduced Cutting Frequency (Action 3961):** Two of three studies found that meadows cut once per year had higher species richness of butterflies and moths than meadows cut multiple times per year. Two studies showed higher abundance in occasionally cut or once-yearly cut grasslands.\n\n**Livestock Type Changes (Action 3963):** Two studies found that grasslands grazed by cattle or horses had greater species richness and abundance of butterflies and burnet moths compared to sheep-grazed grasslands.\n\n**Complete Grazing Cessation (Action 3956):** Results varied with time since abandonment, with some studies showing benefits in early succession stages (2-9 years post-cessation) but mixed results for longer abandonment periods.",
