For sea lice control specifically, cleaner wrasse (corkwing and goldskinny species) can be as effective as chemical treatments, though rockcook cleaner wrasse were found to be ineffective (Action 738). Altering lighting conditions can reduce lice numbers, with lower intensity artificial light or natural lighting resulting in fewer lice compared to more intense artificial lighting (Action 741). Dietary modifications using probiotics and immunostimulants can reduce lice infection levels by 28%, and adding beta-glucans to diets can decrease infection levels by an additional 28% (Action 732). For disease control, vaccinations provide higher survival rates against various bacterial diseases including Aeromonas salmonicida, Yersinia ruckeri, marine flexibacteriosis, bacterial kidney disease, and infectious salmon anaemia (Action 733). Breeding for resistance traits increases survival levels when salmon are exposed to infectious pancreatic necrosis (Action 735). Fallowing systems reduce lice numbers on Atlantic salmon (Action 1026). Environmental modifications include using larger cage sizes to reduce amoebic gill disease levels (Action 742) and aerobic training, particularly interval training, to improve survival rates against infectious pancreatic necrosis (Action 740). Freshwater bathing shows mixed results for reducing amoebic gill disease, with some studies showing reduction in amoebae numbers persisting for up to 10 days while others show no difference (Action 739).",

Vaccinations appear highly effective, with controlled studies from Iceland and Norway showing higher survival rates in vaccinated salmon compared to unvaccinated control groups after exposure to disease-causing bacteria Aeromonas salmonicida spp.achromogenes and Yersinia ruckeri (Action 733). Additional controlled studies in Australia and Canada reported higher survival in salmon infected with marine flexibacteriosis and bacterial kidney disease following vaccination, and two controlled studies in Norway reported similar positive results for salmon vaccinated against infectious salmon anaemia (Action 733). Aerobic training shows promise, with a study in Norway finding higher survival rates in salmon exposed to infectious pancreatic necrosis when they had undergone aerobic training, with interval training being more effective than continuous training (Action 740). Breeding for resistance traits also demonstrates effectiveness, as a controlled study in Norway found increased survival levels in salmon exposed to infectious pancreatic necrosis when families were bred for high resistance compared to families bred for low resistance (Action 735). Probiotics and immunostimulants show potential, with a study in Scotland finding increased survival in salmon fed probiotics before exposure to four different disease-causing bacteria over 28 days compared to controls (Action 732). Environmental management approaches also show benefits: larger cage sizes resulted in lower levels of amoebic gill disease compared to smaller cages in Australian studies (Action 742), while altered lighting conditions, specifically low intensity artificial light or natural lighting, resulted in lower numbers of lice on salmon compared to more intense artificial light in Norwegian studies (Action 741).",

For genetically modified alternatives, three controlled, replicated studies (two randomised) in Norway found no difference in growth rate of Atlantic salmon fed diets containing either GM or non-GM soybeans, and one randomised, replicated, controlled study found no differences in fish histology between GM and non-GM soybean diets (Action 928). For yeast as an alternative protein source, one replicated, controlled experiment in Norway found no differences in weight between Atlantic salmon fed diets containing Yarrowia lipolytica yeast compared to a control diet containing fishmeal (Action 920). Regarding plant-based proteins, Norwegian studies produced varied results: some found decreased growth rates and reduced final body weights in salmon fed plant-based protein diets compared to fish meal-based diets, while others found similar growth rates and final body weights between plant-based and fish meal diets (Action 924). For plant-based oils, three replicated studies (two controlled) in Norway found growth rates were similar in salmon fed diets containing fish oil and vegetable oil, with one replicated study finding higher growth rates in vegetable oil diets (Action 926). Norwegian studies also examined bacterial protein sources, with two replicated, controlled studies finding similar growth rates in salmon fed either 100% fish meal or experimental diets containing up to 25% bacterial protein, though 50% bacterial protein resulted in lower growth rates (Action 918). For krill meal substitutes, two replicated studies in Norway found similar final weight gain between salmon fed diets containing fish meal only or krill meal substitute (Action 916). Studies on reduced fish meal showed that two replicated studies in Norway found similar final weights in salmon fed diets containing low, medium or high levels of fish meal (Action 915). Additionally, one controlled, replicated study in Norway found no difference in weight gain of salmon fed diets with or without taurine supplementation (Action 930). A replicated, controlled study in Norway also found that salmon fed a diet with 28% plant-based protein had 28% reduced lice infection levels, with beta-glucans providing additional 28% reduction compared to controls (Action 732).",
