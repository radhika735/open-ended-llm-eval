However, a separate study in Colombia found no difference in deforestation rates between community-managed forests, unmanaged forests, and national parks (1152). In Belize, the implementation of a multimedia campaign and a wildlife education museum, among other interventions, was followed by a 61-138% increase in black howler monkey populations over 3-13 years (1571). Similarly, in India, an education and awareness program, along with other interventions, was associated with a 66% increase in hoolock gibbon numbers over five years (1571). A study in Madagascar suggested that the distribution of conservation books in primary schools may have led to the cessation of poaching of certain lemur species (1571). Education programs in Brazil and Colombia improved attitudes toward and knowledge of tamarins (1571). Furthermore, a study in four African countries showed that an education program at a primate sanctuary increased visitors' knowledge (1571). Multimedia campaigns in the Republic of Congo informed a large number of people about lowland gorillas (1571). General awareness campaigns have also shown some success; in Estonia and the UK, such campaigns, combined with other actions, led to an increase in natterjack toad numbers and the creation of 1,023 amphibian ponds (831). In Mexico, an awareness campaign increased tourists' knowledge of axolotls (831). However, not all campaigns are effective; a study in Taiwan found that press conferences for frog conservation had no effect on a green tree frog project (831).",
