Ultraviolet filtering on lights increased soprano pipistrelle activity at hedges compared to unfiltered lights, with no increase for common pipistrelle (1020). Measures that can change insect attraction include using low-intensity, narrow yellow/low-UV lighting, which attracted fewer moths than higher-intensity, broader-spectrum UV\u2011including lights in Germany (3902), and using shielded \u201cfull cut\u2011off\u201d lights fitted with blinds and shorter\u2011wavelength filters, which attracted fewer individual moths and species than conventional lights in Slovenia (3904). Additional strategies suggested but with no direct bat-population studies found include directing lighting away from bat access points or habitats (2019), using glazing treatments to reduce light spill from inside buildings (2022), and choosing \u2018warm white\u2019 rather than \u2018cool\u2019 LEDs (2020).",
