    "relevant_summary": "The most beneficial actions for creating field margins to support wildlife on arable farms include planting nectar flower mixtures or wildflower strips, sowing uncropped arable field margins with agricultural nectar and pollen mixes, leaving cultivated uncropped margins or plots, planting grass buffer strips/margins, creating uncultivated margins, and creating beetle banks. Planting nectar flower mixture/wildflower strips (Action 3932) provides the strongest evidence of benefits, with 23 studies showing these strips increase species richness and abundance of butterflies, moths, and generalist butterflies. Sowing uncropped arable field margins with agricultural nectar and pollen mixes (Action 18) attracts significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated, grassy or cropped field margins. Leaving cultivated, uncropped margins or plots (Action 562) provides benefits to farmland bird species, plants, invertebrates including spiders and ground beetles, and improves breeding success of birds like northern lapwing and Eurasian skylark. Planting grass buffer strips/margins (Action 3982) increases butterfly and moth abundance, with wider margins (up to 6m) being more effective than narrower ones. Creating uncultivated margins (Action 3981) benefits butterflies when not cut or only cut in spring/autumn rather than summer, with longer and wider margins being more effective. Creating beetle banks (Action 3927) provides habitat but has lower butterfly abundance compared to hedgerows.",

Supplementary food feeding studies (Action ID 648) found it increased farmland bird abundance, breeding population size, density, body mass, hatching and nestling growth rates, and specifically increased overwinter survival of a declining house sparrow population. However, effects varied between species and studies, with some showing no clear effects on breeding abundance or territory density. For winter cover, planting wild bird seed or cover mixtures (Action ID 594) showed positive effects with 21 of 30 studies finding benefits including higher abundance, density, species diversity and richness of birds compared to other farmland habitats, and birds showed preference for wild bird cover. Overwinter stubbles (Action IDs 695, 203) also provided benefits with 13 of 18 studies finding positive effects including higher densities of farmland birds in winter and increased grey partridge productivity, though effects were inconsistent across species with only certain species like Eurasian skylark showing positive associations. Both approaches showed mixed results depending on species, with supplementary food directly improving survival metrics while cover crops/stubbles provided habitat and food sources, suggesting both strategies may be complementary for supporting farmland bird communities during winter.",

    "relevant_summary": "Research shows several effective methods for controlling invasive species on farmland to benefit native wildlife. For invasive plants, mechanical/manual removal has shown mixed results - one study found it increased understory plant biomass while another found no effect on plant diversity. The most effective method for giant hogweed is removing all flower heads at peak flowering time, which dramatically reduced seed production. Herbicide application has also proven effective, with studies showing that areas where invasive plants were removed by cutting and applying herbicide had greater butterfly species richness and abundance compared to untreated sites. For controlling reed canarygrass, mowing before herbicide application was found to provide similar results to herbicide alone. In terms of invasive animals, removing American bullfrogs significantly increased populations of native California red-legged frogs and expanded the range of leopard frogs. One systematic review found that the herbicide asulam effectively reduced bracken abundance when applied repeatedly, with cutting being equally effective. However, some control methods showed no evidence of effectiveness - particularly for grey squirrel control, wild deer management, and coarse fish removal where no studies have yet evaluated their impacts on farmland wildlife.",

For invasive plants, mechanical/manual removal has shown mixed results - one study found it increased understory plant biomass while another found no effect on plant diversity. The most effective method for giant hogweed is removing all flower heads at peak flowering time, which dramatically reduced seed production. Herbicide application has also proven effective, with studies showing that areas where invasive plants were removed by cutting and applying herbicide had greater butterfly species richness and abundance compared to untreated sites. For controlling reed canarygrass, mowing before herbicide application was found to provide similar results to herbicide alone. In terms of invasive animals, removing American bullfrogs significantly increased populations of native California red-legged frogs and expanded the range of leopard frogs. One systematic review found that the herbicide asulam effectively reduced bracken abundance when applied repeatedly, with cutting being equally effective. However, some control methods showed no evidence of effectiveness - particularly for grey squirrel control, wild deer management, and coarse fish removal where no studies have yet evaluated their impacts on farmland wildlife.\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"104\",\n    \"106\",\n    \"111\",\n    \"110\",\n    \"825\",\n    \"1228\",\n    \"3890\",\n    \"2173\",\n    \"823\",\n    \"3699\",\n    \"3697\",\n    \"3106\",\n    \"105\"\n  ]\n}"

Establishing wild flower areas has shown positive effects, with studies finding more wood mice, small mammals and common hamsters compared to other agricultural areas. Creating uncultivated margins around intensive arable or pasture fields can increase small mammal abundance, with one study finding higher numbers of small mammals, bank voles and brown hares relative to crops. Planting and maintaining hedgerows has been found to increase small mammal abundance compared to arable land. Providing supplementary food through specific crop planting can increase small mammal abundance in winter months. Creating beetle banks has been shown to support higher densities of harvest mouse nests. Planting trees on farmland can support higher small mammal abundance than arable land. However, providing set-aside areas has shown mixed results, with some studies finding no enhancement of small mammal numbers relative to cropland. Reducing tillage practices has shown mixed effects, with some positive impacts on farmland wildlife but inconsistent effects specifically on mammal abundance.",

Five reports from three studies found positive effects on invertebrate densities and ground beetle diversity in spring/summer, though effects varied between grass species sown and between invertebrate groups. Six studies on birds found two reviews and one trial showing positive effects on bird numbers or usage, while two studies found mixed effects and one study found no farmland bird species associated with beetle banks. One study found beetle banks had higher densities of harvest mouse nests than field margins. One review found they acted as nest sites for harvest mice.\n\nHEDGEROWS: Ten studies found managing hedges for wildlife increased berry yields, species diversity of plants and invertebrates, and abundance/diversity of farmland birds. However, five studies found no effects on plant species richness, bumblebee queens or farmland birds, and two studies showed mixed or adverse effects including reduced hawthorn berry yield. Seven studies found some bird species increased with hedge management or were more likely to use managed hedges, though four studies found some species declined or showed no response.\n\nCOMPARISONS: Five studies found established hedgerows had higher butterfly and moth species richness and abundance than beetle banks, crops or pasture. Three studies found beetle banks had similar caterpillar abundance to field margins and crops, but lower adult butterfly abundance than hedgerows.\n\nSTONE-FACED HEDGE BANKS: No evidence was found for the effects of managing stone-faced hedge banks on wildlife populations.",
