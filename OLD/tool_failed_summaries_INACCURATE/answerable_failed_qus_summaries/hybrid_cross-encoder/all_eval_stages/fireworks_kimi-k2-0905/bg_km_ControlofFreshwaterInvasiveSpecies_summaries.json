For water primrose, herbicide type and adjuvant use significantly affect control outcomes. Triclopyr TEA applied at 0.25% concentration achieved 100% mortality within two months (Action ID: 1139). Glyphosate effectiveness was enhanced when combined with adjuvants, showing 97% mortality when mixed with a non-oil based sticking agent and 100% mortality when combined with TopFilm (Action ID: 1139). Halosulfuron-methyl (Sempra) also proved effective for water primrose control without apparent toxicity to rice plants (Action ID: 1139). For parrot's feather, multiple herbicide types have demonstrated effectiveness, including 2,4-D, carfentrazone-ethyl, and endothall, with laboratory studies consistently showing growth reduction (Action IDs: 1676, 1681, 1606). The combination of 2,4-D with MCPA completely eliminated parrot's feather in field studies (Action ID: 1606), while 2,4-D combined with carfentrazone-ethyl showed improved short-term control compared to dichlobenil (Action ID: 1606). However, timing of application appears important, as endothall-treated parrot's feather showed initial reduction but later regained pre-treatment coverage levels (Action ID: 1681).",

For water primrose, herbicide type and adjuvant use significantly affect control outcomes. Triclopyr TEA applied at 0.25% concentration achieved 100% mortality within two months (Action ID: 1139). Glyphosate effectiveness was enhanced when combined with adjuvants, showing 97% mortality when mixed with a non-oil based sticking agent and 100% mortality when combined with TopFilm (Action ID: 1139). Halosulfuron-methyl (Sempra) also proved effective for water primrose control without apparent toxicity to rice plants (Action ID: 1139). For parrot's feather, multiple herbicide types have demonstrated effectiveness, including 2,4-D, carfentrazone-ethyl, and endothall, with laboratory studies consistently showing growth reduction (Action IDs: 1676, 1681, 1606). The combination of 2,4-D with MCPA completely eliminated parrot's feather in field studies (Action ID: 1606), while 2,4-D combined with carfentrazone-ethyl showed improved short-term control compared to dichlobenil (Action ID: 1606).
