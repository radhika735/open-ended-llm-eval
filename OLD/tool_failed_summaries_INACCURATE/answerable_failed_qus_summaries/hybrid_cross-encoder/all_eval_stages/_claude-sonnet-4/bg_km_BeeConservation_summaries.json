    "relevant_summary": "The success of providing artificial nest sites differs significantly between solitary bees and bumblebees. For solitary bees, 30 replicated trials across 10 countries showed that 29 trials demonstrated occupancy by bees (Action 47). Ten studies from Germany, Poland and the UK found that solitary bee nest boxes were readily used by bees, with occupancy rates between 1 and 26% of available cavities where reported (Action 80). The number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site (Action 47, Action 80). In contrast, bumblebee nest boxes show much lower success rates. Eleven replicated trials of bumblebee nest boxes showed very low uptake rates of 0-2.5% for various nest box designs in three recent UK trials since 1989, though earlier trials in the USA or Canada showed higher rates of 10-48% (Action 48). Two replicated trials testing bumblebee nest boxes found very low uptake of 2% or less (Action 80). The most effective bumblebee nest boxes are those buried 5-10 cm underground with entrance pipes, showing 6-58% occupancy in seven trials, while wooden surface boxes show only 0-1.5% occupancy in recent UK studies (Action 48). No evidence exists for the effects of providing nest boxes on bumblebee populations, whereas solitary bee populations and emerging numbers have increased with nest box provision (Action 48, Action 80).",

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes. In one trial, these introduced species more commonly occupied the boxes than native bees.\\nA small trial tested three soil-filled nest boxes for the mining bee Andrena flavipes in the UK, but they were not occupied.\"\n}"

Reducing the intensity of farmland meadow management shows mixed results, with two trials finding enhanced numbers and diversity of wild bees on meadows with delayed first cuts and little agrochemical use, while two trials found no difference between conventional and reduced intensity management (Action 22). Converting to organic farming also shows equivocal evidence, with three trials showing higher wild bee abundance under organic arable farming than conventional farming, while three other trials found no significant difference in bee numbers or species between conventional and organic farms (Action 25). Reducing tillage practices has mixed evidence, with one trial showing no difference in bee abundance between tilled and untilled farms, while another found three times more squash bees on no-till farms compared to conventional farms (Action 11). Reducing pesticide or herbicide use generally showed that one trial found no effect on numbers of foraging bees on squash farms from responsible pesticide use (Action 27). Introducing agri-environment schemes has variable results, with four trials showing enhanced diversity and/or abundance of foraging wild bees under various European schemes, while four other trials found no enhancement in bee numbers or species, and two landscape-scale trials found bumblebee populations were not enhanced (Action 24). Supporting these reduced intensity approaches, planting dedicated floral resources on farmland attracts substantial numbers of wild bees across fourteen trials, particularly on phacelia patches (Action 17), and sowing uncropped field margins with agricultural nectar and pollen mixes attracts significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated or grassy margins in four trials (Action 18).",

Artificial nest sites for solitary bees can be provided through nest boxes made of cut hollow stems, tubes, or blocks of wood drilled with holes, with 30 replicated trials across 10 countries showing occupancy by bees including endangered species (Action 47). These nest boxes should be placed within 150-600 meters of foraging resources and can double the number of occupied solitary bee nests over three years with repeated provision (Action 47, 80). Reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes are more productive than plastic-lined holes or plastic/paper tubes due to reduced parasitism and mould (Action 47). Creating patches of bare ground can provide nesting sites for ground-nesting solitary bees and wasps, with artificially exposed areas of bare soil being successfully colonized in the first or second year (Action 13). Set-aside areas on farmland that are annually mown and left to naturally regenerate for two years or more show higher species richness of nesting bees compared to other management regimes or arable crop fields (Action 7). Grass strips at field margins can enhance bee abundance and diversity, with 6-meter wide grassy field margins enhancing bumblebee abundance and diversity within the margin (Action 14). Uncropped field margins left for natural regeneration provide foraging habitat for more bumblebees and bee species than cropped margins (Action 20). Additional modifications include excluding ants from solitary bee nesting sites, which can increase offspring production (Action 46).",

One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs.

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes.

Converting to organic farming shows mixed results, with three replicated trials in Europe or Canada showing higher wild bee abundance in organic arable farming compared to conventional farming, while three other trials found no significant differences (Action 25). Planting dedicated floral resources on farmland demonstrates substantial benefits, with fourteen trials in Europe and North America recording wild bees foraging on perennial or annual sown flowering plants, particularly phacelia which attracted wild bees in ten trials (Action 17). Agri-environment schemes show variable effectiveness, with four replicated trials in Europe showing enhanced diversity and abundance of wild bees on land managed under schemes like Swiss Ecological Compensation Areas and German organic arable farming options, though four other trials found no enhancement (Action 24). Creating and retaining hedgerows provides measurable benefits, with five replicated studies from the USA finding more bee species in fields with hedgerows or in hedgerows themselves compared to fields without hedgerows (Action 2515). Increasing areas of rough grassland specifically benefits bumblebee nesting, with one trial in Scotland showing grassy field margins attracted nest-searching queen bumblebees at higher densities than other habitat types (Action 12). Intercropping also shows promise, with studies indicating increased beneficial arthropod abundance when crops like cabbage are intercropped with French beans or clover (Action 124).",

One replicated controlled before-and-after trial attempted to eradicate European buff-tailed bumblebees from trial sites in Japan by catching and killing foraging bees, which led to an increase in numbers of two native bumblebee species, but did not eradicate the invasive species (Action 38). For small hive beetle control, one replicated trial in the USA tested the effect of using mite-killing strips in commercial honey bee transport packages to reduce the spread of small hive beetle, however more than half the beetles escaped the packages and were not killed by the strip (Action 41). For ectoparasite control, six of seven studies that investigated infestation rates found lower rates in nests treated for ectoparasites, with one study using microwaves to treat nests not finding fewer parasites (Action 438).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence, several management practices have proven beneficial for wild bees in temperate forest and grassland ecosystems. In temperate forests, controlling fire risk using a combination of mechanical shrub control and prescribed burning increases herbaceous plant cover in subsequent years, which benefits bee conservation (Action 37). For grassland management, reducing the intensity of farmland meadow management through delayed first cuts and little agrochemical use has enhanced numbers and diversity of wild bees in two European trials (Action 22). Restoring species-rich grassland vegetation attracts more nest-searching queen bumblebees and restored grasslands have similar flower-visiting insect communities to ancient species-rich grasslands (Action 8). Managing land under power lines as scrub rather than annually mown grassland resulted in more bee species in a Maryland trial (Action 31). Agri-environment schemes have shown mixed results, with four European trials demonstrating enhanced diversity and abundance of foraging wild bees, while other trials found no enhancement (Action 24). Providing artificial nest sites for solitary bees has proven successful across 29 of 30 trials in 10 countries, with many species readily nesting in boxes including endangered species, though boxes must be within 150-600m of foraging resources (Action 47). Planting dedicated floral resources attracts substantial numbers of wild bees, with phacelia being particularly effective for bumblebees in most trials, and planted flower patches can enhance reproductive success of managed bee species like Osmia lignaria (Action 17). Sowing uncropped field margins with agricultural nectar and pollen mixes, particularly those containing perennial leguminous flowering plants, attracts significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated or grassy margins (Action 18). Managing agricultural landscapes to enhance floral resources through pollen and nectar agri-environment agreements positively correlates with long-tongued bumblebee abundance (Action 362).",

Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes. In one trial, these introduced species more commonly occupied the boxes than native bees.\\nA small trial tested three soil-filled nest boxes for the mining bee Andrena flavipes in the UK, but they were not occupied.\"\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, several alternatives to sowing uncropped field margins with agricultural nectar mixes exist for increasing floral resources for bees on farmland:\n\n**Plant dedicated floral resources:** Fourteen trials in Europe and North America have recorded substantial numbers of wild bees foraging on perennial or annual sown flowering plants in the agricultural environment, with ten trials showing substantial numbers of foraging wild bees on patches sown with phacelia (Action 17).\n\n**Plant nectar flower mixture/wildflower strips:** Forty-one studies from eight European countries found evidence that flower strips had a positive influence on invertebrate numbers with increased abundance, species richness/diversity, or both. Nineteen studies reported positive effects on biodiversity of sowing specific plant species including phacelia, borage and red clover (Action 442).\n\n**Plant wild bird seed or cover mixture:** Seven studies from the UK found positive effects, with farmland habitats sown with wild bird cover mix having higher abundance or species richness of butterflies and/or bees than other farmland habitats. One study found that bees and butterflies showed preferences for particular plant species (Action 594).\n\n**Retain/create hedgerows:** Five replicated studies from the USA found more bee species in fields with hedgerows, or in hedgerows themselves, compared to fields or field edges without hedgerows. Two studies found more native bee and hoverfly individuals or more specialist bees in hedgerows (Action 2515).\n\n**Provide or retain set-aside areas:** Twenty studies from Austria, Finland, Germany and the UK showed benefits to or higher use by all wildlife groups considered, including pollinators (Action 156).\n\n**Convert to organic farming:** Three replicated trials in Europe or Canada have shown that the abundance of wild bees is higher under organic arable farming than under conventional farming, with one showing higher bee diversity in organically farmed wheat fields (Action 25).\n\n**Restore arable land to permanent grassland:** Two of three replicated studies in the UK and Finland found that grasslands established by sowing grasses, legumes and other broadleaved plants had a higher species richness and abundance of butterflies and other pollinators than grasslands established with grass-only mixes (Action 3929).\n\n**Reduce field size:** Two studies found that arable farms and landscapes with smaller fields had a higher species richness and abundance of butterflies and burnet moths than areas with larger fields (Action 3974).",

Sixteen studies from seven European countries (including ten replicated controlled studies of which one randomized) found evidence that flower strips had higher plant cover, number of flowers, diversity, and species richness. One review found flower strips benefited plants but did not specify how. Four studies found negative or no effects of flower strips on the number or diversity of plant species.\\u00a0Five studies described the effects of different margin establishment or management techniques on plants.\\n\\n\\nSeven studies investigated birds and wildflower strips. Four replicated, controlled studies from Switzerland and the UK (two of which were randomized) and one review of European studies found evidence that plots sown with a wildflower or legume seed mix had a positive influence on birds. Flower strips attracted more birds or bird species and the number of birds using flower strips increased over time. Eurasian skylarks preferentially foraged in, and nested in or near, sown weed patches and were less likely to abandon their territories when they included sown weed patches. However one replicated trial in Switzerland found barn owls avoided sown wildflower areas. Two winter recording periods of the same replicated, controlled study in the UK found there were not more bird species or individuals on wildflower plots compared to control margins.\\n\\n\\nAll five studies investigating the effects of wildflower strips on small mammals (four replicated studies from Switzerland and one review of studies from north-western Europe) found evidence that small mammals benefit from strips sown with wildflowers or flowers rich in pollen and nectar, with increases in abundance, density and species richness. One replicated study from Switzerland reported that most common vole home ranges and core regions of their territories were found within a wildflower strip.\\n\\n\\nNineteen studies (of which eight replicated, controlled) reported positive effects on biodiversity of sowing specific plant species including\\u00a0phacelia,\\u00a0and/or other plant species such as borage and red clover. Three replicated studies (two also controlled) found negative impacts or no effects on biodiversity of sowing phacelia.\"\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "Multiple alternative landscape approaches have been tested to benefit bees beyond on-farm habitat creation. Urban and residential settings have shown promising results: planting parks and gardens with appropriate flowers has demonstrated increased wild bee species and individuals in gardens with bee forage or native plants compared to conventionally managed gardens in trials from the USA and Canada (Action 1). Wildlife gardening practices with lower management intensity resulted in more bumblebee species in UK domestic gardens (Action 2). Planting parks, gardens and road verges with native species has been tested but primarily for butterflies and moths rather than bees specifically (Action 3842).\n\nArtificial nest provisioning represents another tested approach: providing nest boxes for solitary bees showed ready usage with occupancy rates between 1-26% of available cavities, and nest box provision increased local red mason bee populations, with the number of occupied solitary bee nests almost doubling over three years in German trials (Action 80). However, bumblebee nest boxes showed very low uptake of 2% or less (Action 80).\n\nHabitat restoration along watercourses has been tested, with one USA study finding similar numbers of bees and bee species in restored versus remnant sites, though with different bee communities present (Action 1408). Hedgerow establishment showed multiple benefits: studies from the USA found more bee species in fields with hedgerows compared to fields without hedgerows, with five replicated studies demonstrating increased bee species in hedgerows themselves (Actions 2515, 1407).\n\nUrban green infrastructure has been evaluated, with one Taiwan study finding that green roofs had lower butterfly abundance than urban parks, though older green roofs with more nectar plant species showed higher abundance (Action 3837). Wildflower strips and nectar flower mixtures have been extensively tested, with multiple studies showing higher species richness and abundance of pollinators compared to conventional field margins, though this evidence primarily focuses on butterflies and moths rather than bees specifically (Action 3932).",

Hedgerow establishment showed multiple benefits: studies from the USA found more bee species in fields with hedgerows compared to fields without hedgerows, with five replicated studies demonstrating increased bee species in hedgerows themselves (Actions 2515, 1407).\\n\\nUrban green infrastructure has been evaluated, with one Taiwan study finding that green roofs had lower butterfly abundance than urban parks, though older green roofs with more nectar plant species showed higher abundance (Action 3837). Wildflower strips and nectar flower mixtures have been extensively tested, with multiple studies showing higher species richness and abundance of pollinators compared to conventional field margins, though this evidence primarily focuses on butterflies and moths rather than bees specifically (Action 3932).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"1\",\n    \"2\",\n    \"3842\",\n    \"80\",\n    \"1408\",\n    \"2515\",\n    \"1407\",\n    \"3837\",\n    \"3932\"\n  ]\n}"

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes. In one trial, these introduced species more commonly occupied the boxes than native bees.\\nA small trial tested three soil-filled nest boxes for the mining bee Andrena flavipes in the UK, but they were not occupied.\"\n}"

Reducing tillage shows mixed evidence, with two replicated trials on squash farms in the USA producing contrasting results - one showed no difference in bee abundance between tilled and untilled farms, while another found three times more squash bees on no-till farms than on conventional farms (Action 11). Protecting nests from livestock to reduce trampling has proven beneficial for ground-nesting species, as studies show that physical protection reduces nest destruction (Action 237). Excluding ants from solitary bee nesting sites increases offspring production, with one replicated controlled trial showing increased production in the endemic Australian bee Exonuera nigrescens when ants were excluded (Action 46). Managing and rearing populations of solitary bees can increase local populations up to six-fold in one year under good conditions with plentiful floral resources, particularly for species in the family Megachilidae that readily nest in drilled wooden blocks or stacked grooved boards (Action 54). Additional habitat management through maintaining or creating bare ground may also support ground-nesting species, though specific evidence for bees is not detailed in this intervention (Action 3935).",

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes.

These nest boxes can accommodate between 4.6 and 33 bee species and show occupancy rates between 1 and 26% of available cavities. For bumblebees specifically, action 80 indicates that bumblebee nest boxes have very low uptake of 2% or less. Another approach is providing artificial nest sites for solitary bees, as detailed in action 47, which shows 29 out of 30 replicated trials demonstrated occupancy by bees across 10 countries including Europe, North and South America and Asia. These artificial nest sites can be made using cut hollow stems or tubes (23 replicated trials showing occupancy), blocks of wood drilled with holes (11 trials demonstrating occupation), or wooden boxes without stems or confining walls inside (two trials in Neotropical secondary forest). Action 47 indicates that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees per nest than four other types, while nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, plastic or paper tubes were much less productive due to parasitism or mould. For optimal placement, action 80 specifies that nest boxes should be positioned 150-600 m from forage resources, and the highest production of red mason bees per nest comes from nesting materials of reed stems or wood.",

One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes.

Specific nest box designs affect success rates, with reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes producing more bees per nest than plastic-lined holes or plastic tubes due to reduced parasitism and mould (Action 47). For bumblebees, artificial nest sites include wooden or brick surface boxes, underground tin or wooden boxes, and boxes attached to trees (Action 48). Underground nest boxes buried 5-10 cm with entrance pipes are generally most effective, showing 6-58% occupancy rates across seven trials (Action 48). General bee nest boxes have shown occupancy rates of 1-26% for solitary bees and support 4.6-33 bee species, with two studies finding local population increases when nest boxes were provided (Action 80). Natural nesting habitat can be created by establishing patches of bare ground, which one controlled trial in Germany and four small trials showed can be successfully colonised by ground-nesting solitary bees and wasps in the first or second year (Action 13).

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould.

The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes.

However, there is no evidence captured for the effects of managing land under power lines to benefit wildlife on farmland wildlife more broadly (action 99).\n\nFor road verges, one replicated controlled trial in Kansas, USA showed that road verges planted with native prairie vegetation supported a greater number and diversity of bees than frequently mown grassed verges (action 30). Additionally, studies on butterflies and moths found that restored roadside prairies and verges sown with native wildflowers had higher species richness and diversity than verges dominated by non-native vegetation (action 3854). Road verges managed by mowing once or twice a year had similar species richness and abundance of butterflies to remnant prairies (action 3854).\n\nFor gardens and parks, two replicated trials in the USA and Canada found more wild bees (either more species or more individuals) in gardens planted with bee forage or native plants, relative to conventionally managed gardens (action 1). Another USA trial found more bee species after the addition of bee forage plants to a community garden (action 1). A site comparison study in one UK city found more species of bumblebee in domestic city gardens with lower intensity of management, though solitary bees were not affected by this measure (action 2). Studies found that gardens planted with native species had greater species richness of butterfly and moth adults and caterpillars than gardens with mixed or exclusively non-native plant species, though some studies found similar species richness of adult butterflies between areas with native or non-native flowers (action 3842).\n\nMowing regimes on greenspaces and road verges also affect pollinator abundance, with studies showing that less frequently mown or unmown urban greenspaces had higher species richness and diversity of butterflies and moths than more frequently mown areas (action 3841). One study in France found that gardens where insecticides and herbicides were not used had a higher abundance of butterflies (action 3900).",

A site comparison study in one UK city found more species of bumblebee in domestic city gardens with lower intensity of management, though solitary bees were not affected by this measure (action 2). Studies found that gardens planted with native species had greater species richness of butterfly and moth adults and caterpillars than gardens with mixed or exclusively non-native plant species, though some studies found similar species richness of adult butterflies between areas with native or non-native flowers (action 3842).\\n\\nMowing regimes on greenspaces and road verges also affect pollinator abundance, with studies showing that less frequently mown or unmown urban greenspaces had higher species richness and diversity of butterflies and moths than more frequently mown areas (action 3841). One study in France found that gardens where insecticides and herbicides were not used had a higher abundance of butterflies (action 3900).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"31\",\n    \"99\",\n    \"30\",\n    \"3854\",\n    \"1\",\n    \"2\",\n    \"3842\",\n    \"3841\",\n    \"3900\"\n  ]\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence, there are distinct differences between local patch scale and landscape scale implementation of floral resources for bees. At the local patch scale, fourteen trials in Europe and North America have recorded substantial numbers of wild bees foraging on perennial or annual sown flowering plants in agricultural environments (Action 17). Ten trials monitoring bees foraging on patches sown with phacelia found substantial numbers of foraging wild bees, particularly bumblebees, with six trials recording 8 to 35 bee species per patch (Action 17). One trial showed that planted patches of bigleaf lupine in commercial apple orchards significantly enhanced the reproductive success of blue orchard mason bees (Action 17). However, local patch effects appear limited in distance, as one trial in the Netherlands showed that bee numbers and species richness are not higher in farmland 50-1,500 m away from planted flower patches (Action 17). At the landscape scale, one large replicated controlled trial showed that the average abundance of long-tongued bumblebees on field margins was positively correlated with the number of pollen and nectar agri-environment agreements in a 10 km grid square (Actions 21, 362). This suggests that landscape-scale implementation may have broader spatial effects than individual patches. Additionally, one replicated controlled trial in the UK showed that planted perennial leguminous herbs were more attractive to bumblebees in landscapes with a greater proportion of arable farming, indicating that landscape context influences patch effectiveness (Action 17).",

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes.
