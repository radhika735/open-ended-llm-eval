    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, several farmland management practices have been shown to increase butterfly and moth abundance. Converting to organic farming (Action 3907) demonstrates that organic arable farms had greater abundance of butterflies, burnet moths, and all moths than conventionally managed farms, with butterfly abundance increasing with time since conversion to organic management. Providing or retaining set-aside areas (Action 3980) shows that sown set-aside had higher abundance of butterflies and day-flying moths than cereal fields, especially when sown with less competitive grasses. Planting nectar flower mixtures and wildflower strips (Action 3932) resulted in higher abundance of all butterflies, generalist butterflies, specialist butterflies and meadow brown butterflies than conventional field margins, unsown margins, cropped fields, and conventional grassland. Sowing uncropped arable field margins with native wildflower seed mix (Action 19) supported higher abundance of foraging bumblebees than cropped field edges, grassy margins or naturally regenerated margins. Managing hedgerows to benefit wildlife (Action 3975) found that hedgerows cut once every 2-3 years, cut in autumn, or cut to allow incremental growth had higher abundance of adult butterflies and moths than hedgerows cut to the same size every winter. Planting new hedges (Action 3976) showed that abundance of butterflies, moths, and macro-moths was higher along hedgerows than on beetle banks, grass margins without hedgerows, or in field interiors. Increasing or maintaining natural or semi-natural habitat in farmed landscapes (Action 3910) resulted in higher abundance of butterflies and moths on farms with greater proportion of semi-natural habitat compared to conventional farmland. Reducing fertilizer, pesticide or herbicide use generally (Action 3897) showed that areas with reduced or no chemical inputs had higher abundance of adult butterflies and moths than areas with conventional chemical applications. Using rotational mowing (Action 3966) demonstrated that grasslands managed by mowing strips in alternate years or leaving rotational areas uncut had higher abundance of butterflies and burnet moths than grasslands cut in full annually. Reducing farmland meadow management intensity (Action 22) found enhanced numbers of wild bees on meadows with delayed first cut and little agrochemical use.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, several alternative management strategies to prescribed burning can be used to maintain open grassland habitats for butterflies:\n\nMowing regimes: Changing mowing regimes on grassland shows mixed results - prairies managed by haying had higher abundance of prairie specialist butterflies but lower abundance of generalist and migrant butterflies than prairies managed by burning (action ID 3945). Reducing cutting frequency on grassland to once per year shows that meadows cut once/year had higher species richness of butterflies and moths than meadows cut two or more times/year (action ID 3961).\n\nRotational mowing: Studies show that grasslands managed by mowing strips in alternate years or by leaving a rotational area uncut on each mow had higher abundance of butterflies and burnet moths than grasslands cut in full once or twice per year (action ID 3966). Rotational mowing benefitted 27 out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern (action ID 3966).\n\nGrazing management: Rotational grazing shows positive results with rotationally sheep-grazed and cattle-grazed grasslands having greater species richness of butterflies and burnet moths than continuously grazed or patch-burned grassland (action ID 3965). Reducing grazing intensity by seasonal removal of livestock also shows benefits - grasslands where cattle or sheep were removed in summer had higher abundance of butterflies and caterpillars than grasslands grazed throughout the summer (action ID 3960). However, increasing grazing intensity had negative effects - grasslands with more intensive grazing had lower abundance of adult butterflies and burnet moths than ungrazed or lightly grazed grasslands (action ID 3962).\n\nSpecies-rich grassland maintenance: Maintaining species-rich, semi-natural grassland through various management approaches shows that semi-natural grasslands managed by extensive sheep, cattle or livestock grazing had similar or higher abundance of butterflies compared to annual mowing, rotational burning or unmanaged grasslands (action ID 3908).\n\nGeneral mowing: Mowing or cutting natural grasslands can provide an alternative to burning, though specific outcomes for butterflies were not detailed in this action (action ID 338).",

Well connected low quality habitat patches were more likely to retain Alcon large blue populations than less well connected patches, though connectivity did not affect occupancy of high quality patches (action 3832). Butterflies were more likely to move between connected habitat patches than unconnected patches, with common buckeye and variegated fritillary showing this pattern (action 3934).

    "relevant_summary": "Several grassland management techniques in UK agricultural settings have been shown to be beneficial for increasing butterfly and moth abundance. Reducing management intensity on permanent grasslands shows strong benefits, with six of 10 studies finding higher species richness of butterflies and moths in less intensively managed grasslands compared to conventionally managed grasslands (Action 3958). Three of four studies found that low-input or unfertilized, ungrazed grassland managed with a single cut had higher abundance of butterflies, micro-moths and declining macro-moths than intensively managed grassland (Action 3958). One UK before-and-after study found that after grazing was reduced and chemical application stopped, the total abundance of large moths and the abundance of five out of 23 butterfly species increased (Action 3958).\n\nRotational mowing techniques demonstrate significant benefits, with three of four studies finding that grasslands managed by mowing strips in alternate years, mowing and burning one half of the meadow each year, or mowing parts of a site at different times while leaving some areas uncut, had greater species richness and diversity of butterflies than grasslands cut in full once per year (Action 3966). Two controlled studies found that grasslands managed by mowing strips in alternate years or leaving a rotational area uncut on each mow had higher abundance of butterflies and burnet moths than grasslands cut in full once or twice per year (Action 3966). One UK study reported that two heath fritillary populations survived on rotationally mown grasslands while six populations went extinct on unmanaged grasslands (Action 3966).\n\nReducing chemical inputs also benefits butterfly and moth populations, with eight studies finding that areas managed with less frequent, reduced or no pesticide, herbicide, fertilizer or unspecified chemical input had greater species richness of adult butterflies and moths than areas with more frequent or conventional chemical applications (Action 3897). Six studies found higher abundance of adult butterflies and moths in areas with reduced chemical inputs (Action 3897).\n\nRestoring arable land to permanent grassland shows promise, with three studies finding that 4-5-year-old created grasslands and abandoned cropland had greater species richness of butterflies, burnet moths and all moths than conventionally managed grassland or cultivated farms (Action 3929). Two studies found that grasslands established by sowing grasses, legumes and other non-woody, broadleaved plants had higher species richness and abundance of butterflies than grasslands established with grass-only mixes (Action 3929). One UK before-and-after study found that after adopting an Environmentally Sensitive Areas scheme including reverting arable land to permanent grassland, the species richness and abundance of large moths and five butterfly species increased (Action 3929).\n\nEmploying semi-natural habitat for rough grazing can also be beneficial, with one UK study finding that upland rough grassland managed by livestock grazing had greater species richness and higher abundance of butterflies than permanently or partially grazed improved grassland (Action 3944). Two UK studies found that fenland managed by cattle grazing for two years had higher abundance of large copper eggs and four of 13 butterfly species than unmanaged land (Action 3944).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence from action documents, several alternatives to prescribed burning have been shown to benefit butterflies in forest management:\n\nClearing or opening patches in forests (Action 3938) showed positive effects for butterflies, with studies finding that cleared patches had greater species richness of butterflies than unmanaged patches, coppiced woodland, or closed canopy forest. Five studies found that cleared patches, often combined with coppicing and grazing, had higher abundance of butterflies generally and specific species including chequered blue, woodland brown, high brown fritillary, and small pearl-bordered fritillary than before management or compared to unmanaged areas. A European review reported that clearing small patches in forests benefitted 19 out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern.\n\nThinning trees within forests (Action 3940) demonstrated benefits, with four studies finding that coniferous woodland thinned along with either prescribed burning, mulching, or nearby felling had greater species richness and higher abundance of butterflies than unmanaged woodland or before management, measured one to four years after management.\n\nSelective or reduced impact logging (Action 3867) showed some positive results, with studies finding that forests managed by reduced impact logging had similar or higher species richness and abundance of butterflies compared to primary forest, though community composition differed from pristine forest.\n\nHarvesting groups of trees or using thinning instead of clearcutting (Action 3868) showed that thinning resulted in higher macro-moth species richness than patch-cutting or clearcutting, with richness similar to unharvested forest.\n\nShelterwood harvesting instead of clearcutting (Action 3871) demonstrated that moth species richness recovered faster after shelterwood harvesting than after group selection harvesting or clearcutting.\n\nManaging woodland edges for maximum habitat heterogeneity (Action 3942) showed increased species richness of butterflies, diurnal moths and bumblebees two years after felling woodland edges and thinning adjacent forest compared to before management or unmanaged edges.\n\nCreating young plantations within mature woodland (Action 3941) found that pearl-bordered fritillary and small pearl-bordered fritillary populations were more likely to persist for up to 20 years in woodlands with larger areas of young plantations than in mature woodland.",

Studies were conducted in the UK (18 studies), Switzerland (8 studies), Finland (2 studies), Sweden, Czech Republic, USA and Germany (1 study each) according to action 3915. For species richness and diversity, 12 of 15 studies found that grassland, field margins, wildflower strips or whole farms managed under agri-environment schemes had higher species richness or diversity of butterflies and moths than conventional fields or farms, while only 3 studies found similar species richness according to action 3915. For abundance measures, 17 of 19 studies found that butterflies and moths in woodland, grassland, field margins, wildflower strips or whole farms managed under agri-environment schemes had higher abundance than in unmanaged woodland or conventional fields or farms, with only 2 studies finding similar abundance according to action 3915. Landscape-scale effects were also positive, with 3 of 4 studies finding higher butterfly abundance on farms or in landscapes with higher proportions of land managed under agri-environment schemes according to action 3915. Specific agri-environment practices showed variable effectiveness: reducing fertilizer, pesticide or herbicide use generally resulted in greater species richness in 8 studies across Europe, USA, UK, Spain, Mexico and Switzerland, and higher abundance in 6 studies according to action 3897. However, some practices showed mixed results - leaving uncropped cultivated margins showed variable effects with only 1 of 3 studies finding higher butterfly species richness, and undersowing spring cereals showed limited evidence with only 2 studies from UK and Switzerland according to actions 3923 and 3926. Grazing management under agri-environment schemes also demonstrated complex outcomes, with reducing grazing intensity by lowering stocking density benefiting butterflies and moths in 5 of 8 studies for species richness and 8 of 11 studies for abundance according to action 3959. A European review reported that reducing grazing intensity benefited 41 out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern according to action 3959. Rotational mowing practices benefited 27 out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern across Europe according to action 3966.",

Additionally, vineyards managed with fewer chemicals had greater species richness of butterflies than conventionally managed vineyards (action 3919). Regarding chemical management, studies in the USA and Germany found that orchards, vineyards, and agricultural landscapes managed with less frequent, reduced or no pesticide, herbicide, fertilizer or chemical input had greater species richness of adult butterflies and moths compared to areas with more frequent or conventional chemical applications (action 3897).
