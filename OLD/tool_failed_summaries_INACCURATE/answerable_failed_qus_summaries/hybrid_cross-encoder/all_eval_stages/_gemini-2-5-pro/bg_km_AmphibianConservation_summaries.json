Twenty-three out of thirty-three studies indicated that amphibians produced eggs in captivity, and seventeen of these studies reported successful raising of captive-bred frogs to various life stages, from hatching to adulthood (835). Survival rates in captivity have been recorded at 30\u201388% for eggs hatching, 75% for metamorphosis, 17\u201351% for froglets, and 50\u201390% for adults (835). However, some studies have reported mixed results, with certain species being difficult to maintain or raise to adulthood, and one study reported that all breeding frogs died (835). The success of these programs can be influenced by factors such as temperature, simulation of wet and dry seasons, parental care, and population density (835). When captive-bred amphibians are released into the wild, one review found that 41% of release programs showed evidence of breeding in the wild for multiple generations, while 29% showed some evidence of breeding and 12% showed evidence of survival after release (871). Additionally, the use of preserved genetic material and artificial insemination has been found to increase genetic diversity and lower inbreeding in captive populations (2475).",

Twenty-eight studies found that amphibians used some or all of the created ponds [869]. Nine site comparison studies found that the number of amphibian species or breeding species in created ponds could be similar or even higher than in natural ponds, though species composition often differed [869]. Other studies found that amphibians established stable populations in 50-100% of created ponds [869] and that pond creation and restoration could increase amphibian populations or the number of species [869, 878]. Created ponds were found to be colonized by as many as 15 naturally colonizing species, with up to 10 of those species reproducing [869]. Another study observed colonization by 1-7 species in restored and created ponds [878].\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"869\",\n    \"878\"\n  ]\n}"

Five found mixed effects on abundance depending on species and buffer width. One found that amphibian abundance was significantly higher with buffers (747). Eleven studies, including 10 replicated and/or controlled studies in Canada and the USA and one meta-analysis, compared amphibian numbers in forest with riparian buffers retained during harvest to unharvested forest. Six found mixed effects depending on species or volume of existing downed wood. Four found that abundance and species composition were similar to unharvested forest. Two found that numbers of species and abundance were lower than in unharvested forest (747). Two of four replicated studies (including one randomized, controlled, before-and-after study) in Canada and the USA found that numbers of amphibian species and abundance were greater in wider riparian buffer strips. Two found that there was no difference in abundance in buffers of different widths (747).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"792\",\n    \"747\"\n  ]\n}"
