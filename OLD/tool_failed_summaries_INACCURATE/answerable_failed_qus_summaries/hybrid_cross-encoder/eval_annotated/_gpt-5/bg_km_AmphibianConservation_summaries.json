Restore ponds: Pond restoration had mixed effects by site and species; several studies reported increased numbers of amphibian species, maintained or increased populations, and higher occupancy and breeding success after restoration, though some studies found no increase or mixed hatching success (Action ID: 878). Create wetlands: Created wetlands often had similar numbers of species or abundance to natural wetlands, though some studies found fewer species or different communities; 4\u201315 species colonized created wetlands in several studies; outcomes were affected by wetland design, vegetation, water levels, surrounding habitat, fish presence, and distance to source wetlands (Action ID: 880). Manage ditches: Managing ditches increased common toad numbers in one study, and ditches under agri-environment schemes had significantly higher amphibian species numbers and abundance than conventionally managed ditches (Action IDs: 749, 135). Riparian buffer strips along streams: Planting buffer strips did not increase amphibian abundance, species numbers, or adult-to-tadpole ratios in one replicated, controlled study (Action ID: 819). Retain unmown buffers around ponds: Leaving unmown buffers around ponds increased numbers of frog species in one study, with mixed effects on tadpole survival and mass depending on species and site (Action ID: 850). Pay farmers to cover conservation costs: Payments to farmers created amphibian breeding habitat or increased frog or toad populations in several studies; ditches managed under agri-environment schemes had higher amphibian species numbers and abundance than conventional ditches (Action ID: 818).",
