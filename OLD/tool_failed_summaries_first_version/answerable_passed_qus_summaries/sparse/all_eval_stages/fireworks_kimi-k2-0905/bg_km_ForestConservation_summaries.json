Six of seven studies (five replicated, controlled) across Australia, Iran, Nepal, and the USA found that shelterwood harvesting increased abundance, species richness, and diversity of understory plants, as well as growth and survival rate of young trees (Action ID 1223). In contrast, eight of twelve studies (three replicated, randomized, controlled) across multiple countries found that clearcutting increased cover and species richness of understory plants, while three of six studies found it increased density and species richness of young trees (Action ID 1222). However, clearcutting also showed negative effects, with three of nine studies finding decreased density, species richness, and diversity of mature trees, suggesting complex outcomes depending on the specific metrics and ecological contexts examined.",
