    "relevant_summary": "The evidence base for conservation actions designed to mitigate the impacts of commercial logging on primate populations shows mixed results and several gaps in research. For selective logging practices, one site comparison in Sierra Leone found that primate densities were higher in forest logged at low intensity compared to high intensity (Action ID: 1485). Another before-and-after study in Madagascar found that lemur numbers increased following selective logging (Action ID: 1485), while a site comparison study in Uganda found similar primate densities between low and high intensity logged forests (Action ID: 1485). For avoiding logging of important food tree species, one before-and-after study in Belize found that a black howler monkey population increased over 13 years after trees important for food were preserved alongside other interventions (Action ID: 1494).\n\nHowever, several proposed conservation actions lack scientific evidence for their effectiveness. No evidence was found for the effects of using 'set-asides' for primate protection within logging areas (Action ID: 1497), incorporating forested corridors or buffers into logged areas (Action ID: 1495), leaving hollow trees in selective logging areas for sleeping sites (Action ID: 1489), installing billboards for conservation awareness (Action ID: 1566), providing domestic meat to logging workers to reduce hunting (Action ID: 1501), implementing small and dispersed logging compartments (Action ID: 1487), or closing non-essential roads after logging operations (Action ID: 1496).\n\nResearch on selective or reduced impact logging has been conducted on other taxa but not specifically for primates. Studies on bats found that reduced impact logging had smaller effects on bat abundance than conventional logging (Action ID: 989), while butterfly and moth studies showed mixed responses to selective logging practices (Action ID: 3867).",

One site comparison study in Brazil\\u00a0found that a forest managed by reduced impact logging had a similar species richness and diversity of butterflies to primary forest. One replicated, site comparison study in Brazil\\u00a0found that forests managed by reduced impact logging at different intensities had a similar species richness of fruit-feeding butterflies.\\n\\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)\\n\\nAbundance (3 studies): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in Sweden\\u00a0found that selectively logged forests had a higher abundance of exposed moth caterpillars, but a similar abundance of concealed moth caterpillars, to clearcut forests, and a similar abundance of all moth caterpillars to undisturbed forests. One site comparison study in Brazil\\u00a0found that a forest managed by reduced impact logging had a higher abundance of butterflies than primary forest. One replicated, site comparison study in Brazil\\u00a0found that forests managed by reduced impact logging at intermediate intensity had a higher abundance of fruit-feeding butterflies than forests managed by high or low intensity reduced impact logging.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\"\n}"
