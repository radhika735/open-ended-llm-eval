    "relevant_summary": "The evidence shows different effectiveness patterns for acoustic devices between aquaculture systems and fishing gear applications. For aquaculture systems (Action 2775), four of six studies found acoustic devices reduced predation on caged salmon by grey seals, harbour seals and South American sea lions, or reduced harbour seal approaches to fish cages, while two studies found no effect on harbour seal predation or common bottlenose dolphin behavior around fin-fish farms. For fishing gear applications (Action 2808), the evidence is more extensive with 33 studies showing generally stronger effectiveness: nine studies found acoustic devices on fishing nets reduced entanglements of humpback whales, harbour porpoises, Franciscana dolphins, beaked whales and small cetaceans, while three studies showed mixed results with fewer entanglements of some species but not others. Additionally, five of six studies found acoustic devices on fishing gear reduced damage to fish catches and nets caused by common bottlenose dolphins and seals, with only one study showing no effect on California sea lion damage to swordfish catches. Behavioral responses also differed: twelve of 16 studies on fishing gear showed acoustic devices caused marine mammals to approach nets less closely or reduced encounters, while four studies found no significant behavioral effects. The fishing gear applications demonstrate broader geographic coverage across multiple ocean basins and more consistent positive results compared to the more limited and mixed results seen in aquaculture systems.",

In contrast, the evidence for attaching acoustically reflective objects to fishing gear is more limited and shows no effectiveness. Only two studies evaluated this approach, with one controlled study in the Timor Sea and Arafura Sea finding that attaching metallic bead chains to fishing nets did not reduce dolphin entanglements, and another study in the Gulf of Alaska finding that attaching acrylic beads next to fishing hooks did not reduce predation on fish catches by sperm whales (Action 2806). The evidence suggests that incorporating acoustically reflective materials into the gear itself may be more promising than attaching separate reflective objects, though results remain inconsistent across species and locations.\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"2807\",\n    \"2806\"\n  ]\n}"
