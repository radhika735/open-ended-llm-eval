No studies were found assessing native herbivores for floating pennywort [1124]. For water primrose, a controlled, replicated field study in China reported a flea beetle caused heavy feeding destruction in field cages and was specific to prostrate water primrose and Indian toothcup, and a replicated before-and-after field study in the USA found flea beetle introduction significantly reduced abundance of large-flower primrose-willow in a pond [1135]. No studies were found assessing native herbivores for water primrose [1136]. For parrot\u2019s feather, one replicated, controlled laboratory study in Portugal found grass carp did not reduce biomass or cover, while two replicated, randomized field studies in Argentina and the USA found stocking with grass carp reduced biomass or abundance; additionally, a field study in South Africa reported reduced growth following release of a South American leaf-feeding Lysathia [1599].",
