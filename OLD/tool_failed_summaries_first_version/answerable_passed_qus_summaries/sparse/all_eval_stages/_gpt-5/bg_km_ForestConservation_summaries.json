    "relevant_summary": "Across North American forests, prescribed fire showed mixed ecological outcomes: For amphibians, many studies reported no change in abundance or species numbers, with others finding increases or mixed effects by species, year, or season; one study found decreases, and some evidence indicated responses varied with time since burn (877). For mature trees, prescribed fire often reduced tree cover, density, and diversity and increased tree mortality, though effects on tree size were mixed (1217). For young trees, responses varied: several studies found increased density/biomass, some found decreased recruitment, and diversity and survival effects were mixed by species, location, and fire frequency (1220). Following tree planting, prescribed fire sometimes increased survival and sprouting, but other studies found reduced size or no effect (1255). In pine forests, some bird species and guilds (especially open-habitat species) were more abundant and, in some cases, species richness was higher after burning (often combined with thinning), but many studies found no change or lower densities, with closed-forest species and ground nesters tending to fare worse; productivity and survival responses were mixed, and season of burn generally did not alter effects (318). For butterflies, U.S. studies reported higher species richness and abundance in forests restored 1\u20132 years after burning (often with thinning) compared to unburned sites (3877). Managing fire risk using cutting plus prescribed burning increased herbaceous plant cover beneficial for bees (37). Evidence for using prescribed fire specifically to remove invasive plants in forests is currently lacking (1196).",
