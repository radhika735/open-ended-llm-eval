Cutting alone: Two randomized, controlled studies in the UK found that cutting bracken reduced bracken cover or biomass, while one controlled study found that cutting bracken did not decrease the abundance of bracken (Action 1653). The systematic review noted that cutting may be equally effective to herbicide application (Action 105). Combination of cutting and herbicide: Three randomized, controlled studies in the UK and Norway found that cutting and applying herbicide reduced bracken biomass or cover (Action 1654). One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK found that cutting bracken followed by applying herbicide increased plant species richness when compared with applying herbicide followed by cutting, suggesting the order of treatment matters (Action 1654).

However, one site comparison study in the USA found that using fences led to decreased cover of woody plants, while three replicated, controlled studies in the USA and the UK found that fencing either had mixed effects on shrub cover or did not alter shrub cover (Action 1545). Additional effectiveness variations were observed in grass cover responses across countries: studies in the UK and USA found that fencing led to a decline in grass cover, while studies in the USA, UK, and Finland found that fencing did not alter grass cover, and studies in the USA and UK recorded an increase in grass cover (Action 1545).

Allowing shrubland to regenerate without active management was found to be effective, with five before-and-after trials in the USA, UK, and Norway showing increased shrub cover or biomass, and one replicated, paired site comparison in the USA finding that sites allowed to recover without active restoration had similar shrub cover to unburned areas (Action 1679). Two replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after trials in Spain and Portugal found increases in the cover of woody plant species, and one replicated, before-and-after study in South Africa found that the height of three protea species increased after recovery from fire (Action 1679).\n\nActive restoration interventions show mixed results. Adding mulch followed by seeding with shrub seeds increased the seedling abundance of one of seven shrub species in one randomized, controlled study in the USA, though it did not reduce grass cover (Action 1650). Hydroseeding (spraying a slurry of seed, mulch and water) showed variable effectiveness, with one controlled study in Spain finding increased overall plant cover in most cases, while another study found no alteration in vegetation cover (Action 3412). Adding mulch before sowing seeds increased the cover of target plant species in one replicated, controlled study in Germany and increased the number of seedlings in most cases in one replicated, controlled study in Canada (Action 3425). Using erosion blankets after seeding showed mixed results, with one study in Spain finding increased plant species richness and plant density, while two studies in the USA found no alteration in vegetation cover (Action 3431). \n\nPrescribed fire for maintaining or restoring disturbance was shown to reduce tree/shrub cover in two replicated studies in fens in the USA and UK, and increased plant species richness or diversity in two replicated, controlled studies in the USA and New Zealand (Action 1763).",

No studies were found that evaluated the effects of placing signs to discourage access to sensitive areas of shrub habitat (Action 1620). Similarly, no studies were found that evaluated the effects of placing signs to deter gathering of shrubland species (Action 1613). No studies were found that evaluated the effects of planting spiny shrubs to act as barriers to people in shrublands (Action 1621). The systematic searches conducted found no studies that have directly evaluated these actions for shrubland protection, meaning there is currently no evidence base to assess whether these interventions are effective or have any harmful impacts in shrubland ecosystems. While one study in Turkey found that signs and fencing around sea turtle nests increased hatching success (Action 3642), this relates to reptile conservation rather than shrubland vegetation protection. Some evidence exists for fencing/barriers protecting planted wetland vegetation from wildlife damage, but this does not apply to shrubland contexts or human impacts.",

Regarding plant species diversity, one replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after trial in Spain found that cutting increased the number of plant species, though another replicated, randomized, before-and-after trial found that the number of plant species only increased in a minority of cases (Action ID: 1627). Tree cover was affected in Italy, where one site comparison study found a reduction in tree cover following mowing (Action ID: 1627). The studies indicate contrasting effects on heather abundance between the two countries, with Italy showing increases and Spain showing decreases, while both countries demonstrated consistent increases in grass cover from cutting/mowing treatments.",

Five of six studies found that sowing seeds of shrubland species increased shrub cover (Action 1698). One replicated, randomized, controlled study found that shrub seedling abundance increased after seeds were sown, and that the community composition of shrublands where seeds were sown was similar to that found in undisturbed shrublands (Action 1698).

One randomized controlled study found that cutting grass and sowing seeds increased shrub seedling abundance and reduced grass cover (Action 1639). Applying herbicide and sowing seeds of shrubland plants was found in one randomized, controlled study to result in more shrub seedlings than areas that were not treated (Action 1644). This method also increased the number of native plant species in one study, though effects on grass cover were mixed (Action 1644).\n\nAdding mulch combined with seeding showed limited effectiveness, with one study finding it increased seedling abundance of only one of seven shrub species tested (Action 1650).\n\nIndividual plant planting showed mixed results. One study found that a majority of planted plants survived after one year (Action 1697), and planting increased plant cover in one study from South Africa (Action 1697). However, one study found that planting California sagebrush plants did not increase the cover of native plant species compared to sowing of seeds (Action 1697).\n\nCombining planting and seeding did not show additional benefits, with one study finding that planting and sowing of seeds did not increase cover of native plant species compared to either method alone (Action 1700).\n\nAdding topsoil alongside seeding increased grass biomass but reduced forb biomass compared to topsoil addition alone (Action 1857).",

This method also increased the number of native plant species in one study, though effects on grass cover were mixed (Action 1644).\\n\\nAdding mulch combined with seeding showed limited effectiveness, with one study finding it increased seedling abundance of only one of seven shrub species tested (Action 1650).\\n\\nIndividual plant planting showed mixed results. One study found that a majority of planted plants survived after one year (Action 1697), and planting increased plant cover in one study from South Africa (Action 1697). However, one study found that planting California sagebrush plants did not increase the cover of native plant species compared to sowing of seeds (Action 1697).\\n\\nCombining planting and seeding did not show additional benefits, with one study finding that planting and sowing of seeds did not increase cover of native plant species compared to either method alone (Action 1700).\\n\\nAdding topsoil alongside seeding increased grass biomass but reduced forb biomass compared to topsoil addition alone (Action 1857).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"1698\",\n    \"1639\",\n    \"1644\",\n    \"1650\",\n    \"1697\",\n    \"1700\",\n    \"1857\"\n  ]\n}"

However, adding manure to soil increased plant cover and the number of plant species in one study in South Africa (Action 1695). \n\nFor soil amendments more broadly, manures and agricultural composts showed multiple benefits including higher microbial biomass, higher microbial respiration with poultry manure, lower soil loss and water runoff when combined with other treatments, reduced nutrient loss, higher nitrogen levels, and higher carbon levels (Action 911). Mixed organic and inorganic amendments were more effective at reducing soil crack size than inorganic fertilizers alone, increased microbial biomass and activity, increased microbial diversity, increased organic carbon in soils, and increased maize yield (Action 902). Composts increased soil organic matter levels, microbial biomass and fruit yield (Action 889). Fresh plant material or crop remains increased microbial biomass, improved soil structure in some cases, reduced soil loss, increased soil nitrogen levels, reduced nitrate leaching, and increased carbon levels (Action 910).",
