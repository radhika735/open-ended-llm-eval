For tree populations, studies found that prescribed fire had variable effects on young trees - five of 15 studies found it increased density and biomass of young trees while two found it decreased new tree density, with eight showing no effect or mixed effects depending on tree species, location and fire frequency (Action 1220). For mature trees, four of eight studies found prescribed fire decreased tree cover, density and diversity, while one found it increased tree cover and three found no effect or mixed effects (Action 1217). Seven studies found that prescribed fire increased tree mortality (Action 1217). \n\nRegarding understory vegetation, eight of 22 studies found prescribed fire increased cover, density and biomass of understory plants, while six found it decreased plant cover, and eight found no effect or mixed effects (Action 1221). For plant diversity, 14 of 24 studies found prescribed fire increased species richness and diversity of understory plants, while one study found it decreased species richness and nine found no effect or mixed effects (Action 1221).\n\nFor wildlife impacts, eight of 14 studies found no effect of prescribed forest fires on amphibian abundance or numbers of species, while four found mixed effects depending on species, season or year of burn, three found fires increased amphibian abundance, and one found abundance decreased (Action 877). For butterflies and moths, three of four studies found that coniferous forest burned within the last 20 years had higher species richness than unburned forest, while one study found similar species richness between burned and unburned sites (Action 3877). Two studies found pine forest restored by burning had higher butterfly abundance than unburned forest (Action 3877).\n\nAfter tree planting, two of four studies found prescribed fire increased survival and sprouting rate of planted trees, while one found fire decreased planted tree size and one found no effect (Action 1255).

Six of seven studies (including five replicated, controlled studies) in Australia, Iran, Nepal and the USA found that shelterwood harvesting increased abundance, species richness and diversity of understory plants, as well as the growth and survival rate of young trees, with only one study finding decreased plant species richness and abundance (Action 1223). For tree regeneration specifically, three of six studies found that clearcutting increased the density and species richness of young trees, while one found it decreased new tree density and two found no effect or mixed effects depending on the tree species (Action 1222). In contrast, shelterwood harvesting generally showed positive effects on tree regeneration alongside its benefits for plant diversity.

Managing vegetation by hand through selective weeding has been evaluated, with studies showing mixed effects on species abundance (Action 3714). Managing vegetation by cutting or mowing has been tested, with studies finding that areas where vegetation was managed by cutting had similar reptile species richness and abundance compared to areas with no cutting (Action 3713). Physical removal of mid-storey vegetation in forest resulted in increased mammal species richness and abundance (Action 2480). Surface mulch applications showed that mulched and unmulched plots had similar plant species richness over two years, though mulched plots were more likely to contain certain species after 20 months (Action 3248). In contrast, controlling vegetation using herbicides after restoration planting decreased plant species richness and diversity (Action 1241).",

For herbicide control, one replicated, randomized, controlled study in the USA found no effect of invasive plant control using herbicide on the total native plant species richness (Actions 1229, 1314). For mechanical/manual removal, studies show varied outcomes: one replicated, controlled study in Hawaii found that removal of invasive grass species increased understory plant biomass, while another replicated, controlled study in the USA found no effect of invasive shrub removal on understory plant diversity (Action 1228). Additionally, one replicated, controlled study in Ghana found that removal of invasive weed species increased tree seedling height, but one replicated, controlled study in Hawaii found no effect of invasive plant removal on growth rate of native species (Action 1228). For prescribed fire methods, there is no evidence found for the effects of using prescribed fire to remove invasive plant species on forests (Action 1196). Similarly, no evidence was found for the effects of using grazing to remove invasive plant species on forests (Action 1195). For biological control using herbivores, no evidence was found for its effectiveness (Action 1277). One controlled study from Australia found that prescribed burning for lantana control resulted in smaller and less abundant lantana plants compared to unburned areas, and one replicated site comparison from Australia found lantana in a forest burned every three years produced fewer fruits and seeds with higher seedling mortality and slower growth rates compared to other management methods (Action 912). The evidence base remains limited with many methods lacking systematic study in forest contexts.",

For forest-specific interventions, we found no evidence for the effect of raising awareness amongst the general public through campaigns and public information on forests (Action 1157), and no evidence for the effect of providing education programmes about forests on forests (Action 1158). \n\nHowever, evidence from other conservation contexts provides some insights. A review of programmes in the USA and Canada argues that education was not sufficient to change behaviour, although it was necessary as a catalytic factor for economic incentives and law enforcement (Action 162). \n\nFor species conservation more broadly, five out of six studies found increases in bird populations or decreases in mortality following education programmes, though in all but one case, education was one of several interventions employed. A replicated before-and-after study from Canada also found a significant shift in local peoples' attitudes to conservation and exploited species following educational programmes (Action 274).\n\nFor forest management specifically, one before-and-after study in the Republic of Congo found that 70% of central chimpanzees reintroduced to an area where local people were provided non-monetary benefits (including better education), alongside other interventions, survived over seven years. One before-and-after study in India found that numbers of hoolock gibbons increased by 66% over five years after providing local communities with alternative income, alongside other interventions (Action 1510).",

Natural regeneration in former plantations or logged forest (Action 3876) showed varying results for different species groups, with some studies finding greater species richness and abundance of certain groups compared to managed plantations.\n\n**Leaving woody debris after logging** (Action 3632): Studies in the USA generally found that leaving or removing woody debris did not significantly affect reptile species richness, diversity, or abundance, though one study found areas where debris was left had higher reptile species richness and abundance than areas where debris was cleared and burned.\n\n**Prescribed burning on pine forests** (Action 318): Studies found mixed results, with some showing higher bird species richness in burned areas and benefits for open habitat species, while closed-forest species and ground nesters were generally adversely affected by burning.",
