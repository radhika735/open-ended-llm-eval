A study in Norway found that a diet containing 28% plant-based protein reduced infections from sea lice by 28%, and the addition of beta-glucans to the diet further decreased the levels of lice infection by 28% (732). The same study also found that the addition of mannan oligosaccharides improved the function of the gut (732). The use of cleaner wrasse as a natural control agent has had mixed results in two studies in Ireland (738).

    "relevant_summary": "Several studies in Norway and Scotland have documented the effects of including plant-based proteins in salmon feed. Six studies, four of which were replicated and controlled, in Norway, Scotland, and the USA, indicated that this inclusion led to decreased growth rates in salmon. In contrast, three replicated and/or controlled studies from Norway, Canada, and Scotland found similar growth rates between salmon fed plant-based diets and those fed fish meal diets (924). Four replicated, controlled studies in Norway and Scotland, three of which were randomized, observed reduced final body weights in salmon on plant-based protein diets compared to those on fish meal-based diets. However, two controlled studies in Norway, one of which was replicated, found no difference in final body weights between the two diet types (924). Regarding feeding efficiency, two replicated, controlled studies in Norway, one of which was randomized, reported lower efficiency in salmon fed plant-based protein diets. Conversely, a replicated study in Norway noted an increase in feeding efficiency with these diets. Two other replicated studies, one of which was controlled, in Canada and Scotland, found similar feeding efficiency across both diet types (924). The digestibility of feed components was found to be lower in salmon on diets containing plant proteins in two replicated, controlled studies when compared to fish meal. On the other hand, two randomized, replicated, controlled studies in Scotland and Norway reported similar levels of digestibility for both diet types (924). Furthermore, two studies noted that survival rates and appetite were unaffected by either plant- or fish meal-based protein diets. However, the morphology of the distal intestine was altered in two randomized, replicated, controlled studies where salmon were fed diets with plant-based proteins. The condition of the salmon was found to be increased in one randomized, replicated, controlled study, but it was reduced in two other replicated studies (924). In addition to protein, the use of plant-based oils has also been studied. Three replicated studies in Norway, two of which were controlled, found similar growth rates in salmon fed diets with fish oil versus those with vegetable oil. One replicated study in Norway even reported higher growth rates in fish on diets with vegetable oil. Another replicated, controlled study found that salmon growth rates were both lower and higher in vegetable oil diets compared to fish oil diets, depending on the family genetics (926). Two replicated studies in Norway, one of which was controlled, found similar average final body weights between groups of salmon fed both fish oil and vegetable oil diets. Three studies in Norway and Scotland, two of which were replicated and one controlled, showed that the fatty acid profile of salmon flesh reflected the oil source in their diets. A study in Norway also indicated that the oil source in diets did not affect salmon broodstock fecundity, egg weights, fertility rates, or the weights and development of their fry (926). One replicated Norwegian study observed that salmon on vegetable oil diets had high liver lipid and low plasma lipoprotein compared to those on a fish oil diet. A replicated, controlled study found high levels of n-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids compared to diets containing rapeseed oil. In Scotland, a replicated, controlled study revealed that salmon on vegetable oil-based diets had lower concentrations of dioxin and polychlorinated biphenyls in their flesh compared to those on diets with fish oil. A replicated study in Norway also found that fresh, frozen, and smoked salmon flesh from fish fed both types of oil-based diets had similar levels of gaping, texture, and liquid holding capacity, although pigment concentration was lower in the vegetable oil diets (926).",

However, another study in Australia found no difference in mortality from Amoebic Gill Disease in cages where a fallowing system was used [1026]. Regarding freshwater bathing, two studies in Australia presented mixed results for reducing amoebic gill disease. One study found a reduction in the number of amoebae on salmon gills that lasted for up to 10 days after bathing, while a replicated, controlled study found similar levels of amoebae in the gills of both treated and untreated salmon [739].\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"1026\",\n    \"739\"\n  ]\n}"
