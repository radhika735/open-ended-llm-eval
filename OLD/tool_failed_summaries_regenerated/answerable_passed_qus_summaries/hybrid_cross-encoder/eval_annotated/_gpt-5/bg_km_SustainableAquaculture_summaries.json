Similar levels of digestibility across both diet types were identified by two randomised, replicated, controlled studies in Scotland\\u00a0and Norway. \\nTwo of the studies found that survival rates and appetite were not affected by plant- or fish meal-based protein diets. However morphology of the distal intestine was altered in two randomised, replicated, controlled studies where salmon were fed diets containing plant-based proteins.
