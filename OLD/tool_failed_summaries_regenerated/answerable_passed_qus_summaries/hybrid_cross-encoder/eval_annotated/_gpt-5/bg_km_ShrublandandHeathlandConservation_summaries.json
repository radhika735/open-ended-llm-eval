Combining cutting with herbicide reduced bracken biomass or cover; one UK study reported no change in heather biomass, another UK study found no significant effect on the cover of seven plant species, and a replicated UK study found higher plant species richness when cutting was followed by herbicide compared to the reverse sequence [1654].",

    "relevant_summary": "Adding mulch and fertilizer did not increase seedling abundance of seven shrub species and did not change grass cover in one randomized, controlled study in the USA (ID 1694). Applying manures or agricultural composts increased microbial biomass and respiration in several controlled, replicated studies; reduced soil loss and water runoff when combined with other treatments; often reduced nutrient loss and raised nitrogen, though one study found higher nitrate leaching; increased soil carbon; had mixed effects on soil organic matter; improved soil physical properties and aggregation in one study; and increased crop yields in multiple studies (ID 911). Adding manure increased soil organic matter in several studies but showed mixed results in others; increased nitrogen and potassium in some comparisons with mixed effects on phosphorus; had mixed effects on soil pH; reduced erosion and increased soil stability in some studies; and increased carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions in individual studies (ID 1363). Mixing organic and inorganic amendments (e.g., manure with inorganic fertilizers) increased soil microbial biomass and activity, increased soil organic carbon and nutrient levels, improved dry-soil crack reduction relative to inorganic-only or no fertilizer, and increased maize yield in trials; manure alone also increased microbial biomass and organic carbon (ID 902). Green manures increased soil organic carbon and raised grain yields in controlled, randomized, replicated studies (ID 908). Incorporating fresh plant material or crop remains increased microbial biomass, improved soil structure in one study, reduced soil loss in one study with mixed erosion results elsewhere, increased soil nitrogen and sometimes reduced nitrate leaching when straw was incorporated, increased soil organic carbon and aggregation across multiple studies, and increased yields in individual trials (ID 910). Incorporating allelopathic plant residues sometimes reduced weeds but effects varied by timing, species and residue type; weed suppression often lasted only days to weeks; crop growth could be inhibited depending on timing; and yield responses ranged from positive to negative or mixed across studies (ID 728).",
