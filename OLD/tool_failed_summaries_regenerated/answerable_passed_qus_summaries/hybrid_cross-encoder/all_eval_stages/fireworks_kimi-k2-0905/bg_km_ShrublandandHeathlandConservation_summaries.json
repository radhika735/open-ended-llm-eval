    "relevant_summary": "The most beneficial interventions for restoring shrubland vegetation after fire include allowing natural regeneration without active management, which has shown positive results across multiple studies. Specifically, allowing shrubland to recover after fire without intervention increased shrub cover or biomass in five before-and-after trials conducted in the USA, UK, and Norway. This passive restoration approach also resulted in sites having similar shrub cover to unburned areas and increases in heather height and protea species height. Studies showed increases in the cover of woody plant species and vegetation cover overall, though effects on plant species numbers were mixed. Natural regeneration was associated with decreases in grass cover and herbaceous species cover, suggesting successful transition toward shrubland communities. For active restoration interventions, replanting native vegetation has been studied extensively, with evidence showing planted native trees, shrubs, and grasses can achieve similar species richness and abundance of butterflies and other insects compared to naturally regenerating and remnant habitats, though results vary by location and specific planting approach. The evidence base strongly supports passive recovery approaches for shrubland restoration following fire.",

    "relevant_summary": "From the available research evidence, sowing seeds has shown mixed results for shrubland restoration. Five of six studies reported that sowing seeds increased shrub cover, with one study finding higher abundance of specific shrub species like Wyoming big sagebrush and another showing increased shrub seedling abundance (Action ID: 1698). However, one study found no increase in shrub cover, and some studies reported very low germination rates for certain species. Additionally, seed sowing sometimes increased grass cover and did not consistently improve native plant cover compared to other methods (Action ID: 1698, 1700).\n\nPlanting turf showed more consistent positive results in the studies examined. Two randomized controlled studies in heathland restoration found that planting turf from intact sites increased the abundance or cover of target heathland species (Action ID: 1703). These studies also showed increased seedling abundance for most heathland plant species and increased forb cover while reducing grass cover. One study indicated that larger turf samples were more effective than smaller ones for increasing plant species numbers (Action ID: 1703).\n\nWhen these methods were directly compared, one study found that planting California sagebrush shrubs combined with seed sowing did not increase native plant cover compared to either sowing seeds alone or planting shrubs alone (Action ID: 1700).\n\nThe evidence suggests that turf transplantation may provide more immediate and reliable results for shrubland vegetation restoration, particularly for heathland species, while seed sowing offers lower establishment rates but may be more practical for large-scale applications.",

Manure amendments demonstrate more consistent benefits across various soil types, including higher soil organic carbon levels (action 902, 911), improved soil structure and reduced soil loss when applied as composts (action 891), and increased microbial biomass and activity (action 911). Mixed organic and inorganic amendments were more effective than single amendments, showing higher microbial biomass, increased organic carbon, and better reduction of soil cracks (action 902). Green manures increased soil organic carbon and crop yields (action 908), while various manure types improved nutrient retention and reduced nutrient loss (action 911).",
