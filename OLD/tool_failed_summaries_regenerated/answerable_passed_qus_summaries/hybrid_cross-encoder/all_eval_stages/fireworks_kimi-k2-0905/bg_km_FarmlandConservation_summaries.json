Soil health improvements are consistently reported, with twelve studies from Europe and other regions finding higher soil organic carbon in soils under no-tillage or reduced tillage systems compared to conventionally tilled soil. Eight studies found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage, while four trials found higher nutrient retention. Erosion control benefits are documented, with seven European and international trials showing reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. However, potential drawbacks include increased soil compaction, with three replicated trials from Europe finding higher compaction under reduced tillage. Water management challenges are noted, with three European trials finding that conventional ploughing and sub-soiling improved the soil's ability to absorb water and increased soil water content. Yield impacts show mixed results, with one replicated study finding lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage. Some studies found negative effects on certain wildlife, with twenty-six studies from nine European countries finding reducing tillage had either negative, no effect, or no consistent effects on abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates, earthworm abundance, biomass, or species richness, mammal abundance, and some bird species.",

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done.

    "relevant_summary": "Available management techniques for restoring or creating species-rich wet meadows in European agricultural landscapes include multiple approaches that can be used individually or in combination. Water level management is a key technique, with raising water levels in ditches or grassland showing positive effects on wetland plants, invertebrates, and breeding birds (Action 121). Traditional water meadow maintenance involves managing water flow through irrigation systems, with studies from Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and UK showing increased bird populations and plant species richness (Actions 696, 3971, 119).\n\nVegetation management techniques include cutting or mowing, with 20 studies showing that cutting herbaceous plants can increase plant species richness and maintain stable vegetation communities. Summer cutting (June) was found to be particularly effective for maintaining vegetation stability. The timing of cutting is important, with different seasons producing varying effects on plant communities (Actions 3044, 3070, 1759).\n\nGrazing management is another important technique, with studies showing that light to moderate cattle grazing can maintain plant species richness similar to mowing regimes. Grazing intensity affects results, with intermediate cattle grazing showing higher abundance of marsh fritillary caterpillars compared to high or low intensity grazing (Actions 3050, 3112, 3971).\n\nFor restoration of degraded sites, topsoil removal has proven effective, with 6 studies showing increased plant species richness and improved establishment of target species when combined with seeding or planting. Introduction of target plant species through hay spreading, seed transfer, or planting seedlings is commonly used alongside other techniques (Actions 3415, 3221, 3426, 1711).\n\nCombined approaches are often most successful, with studies finding that removing topsoil and introducing target plant species together, plus managing water levels and using appropriate grazing or mowing regimes, provides the best results for restoring species-rich wet meadow communities.",

One before-and-after study in a freshwater marsh in Belgium\\u00a0reported that the overall plant community composition changed over seven years after resuming annual mowing. One replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in wet grasslands in Germany\\u00a0reported that over 20 years, mowing increased the average moisture preference of the vegetation.\\nOverall richness/diversity (11 studies): Seven studies (including two replicated, paired, controlled) in freshwater marshes in Belgium, the UK, Mexico and Estonia\\u00a0reported that cut marshes had higher plant species richness than uncut marshes. Two of these studies reported the same result for diversity. One before-and-after study in a freshwater marsh in Belgium\\u00a0reported that plant species richness increased over seven years after resuming annual mowing. Three replicated, paired, controlled studies in reedbeds in the UK\\u00a0and wet meadows in Germany\\u00a0and Estonia\\u00a0reported that cutting typically had no clear or significant effect on plant species richness, after 3\\u20135 months\\u00a0or over 5\\u201320 years.

Two replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after studies in a marsh in Mexico\\u00a0and wet grasslands in Germany\\u00a0reported that cutting/mowing had no significant or clear effect on vegetation height, after 12 months or over 20 years.

A systematic review found significantly higher densities of farmland birds on set-aside fields compared to conventionally farmed fields in both winter and summer periods. Set-aside management influences outcomes, with naturally regenerated set-aside supporting more bird species than sown set-aside, and older set-aside (>1 year) harboring more plants and insects. \n\nIn contrast, converting arable land to permanent grassland has shown limited benefits for wildlife, with all seven studies finding no clear benefit to wildlife including birds, grey partridges, brown hares, and plants (action IDs 210, 561). One UK study even showed grey partridge numbers declined significantly after arable fields were converted to grassland. However, grassland restoration does show some positive effects on soil organisms, with increased diversity of soil animals, higher microbial biomass, activity and carbon storage under grassland compared to arable use (action ID 905).",

Physical nest protection methods include using individual nest exclosures or barriers around ground-nesting bird nests, which studies from Sweden and the USA found can increase hatching success and reduce predation rates. Habitat management alternatives include leaving cultivated, uncropped margins or plots (including lapwing plots) which provide nesting habitat and have been shown to increase northern lapwing hatching success. Planting wild bird seed or cover mixtures creates beneficial habitat that 32 out of 33 studies found increased bird populations or densities compared to other habitats. Set-aside areas provide important nesting habitat, with systematic reviews showing significantly higher densities of farmland birds on set-aside fields compared to conventionally farmed fields. Other non-lethal alternatives include reducing tillage practices which can increase Eurasian skylark nest density, creating raised nesting areas to protect from weather extremes, and implementing nest marking during harvest operations to prevent accidental destruction by farming activities. Undersowing spring cereals with clover and other cover crops has also shown benefits for bird species including Eurasian skylark and nesting dunnock.",

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes.

Six studies documented positive signs of restoration in less than five years, 11 studies found restoration benefits within 10 years, and two studies determined that restoration required more than 10 years. However, six additional studies noted limited or slow changes in plant communities following restoration efforts. Two specific studies from Germany and UK found that differences in vegetation between restored and existing species-rich grasslands persisted even nine or 60 years after restoration was initiated. The timeframe for seeing positive ecological changes therefore varies considerably, with some benefits apparent within 5 years, most within 10 years, but some grassland communities may take over a decade to show full restoration effects.",
