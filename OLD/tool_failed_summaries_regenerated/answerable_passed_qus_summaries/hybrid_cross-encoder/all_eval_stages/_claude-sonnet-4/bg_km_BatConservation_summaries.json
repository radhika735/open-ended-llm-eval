The only strategy with documented evidence is treating bats with probiotic bacteria (Action 2008). Two studies evaluated probiotic treatment effects: one randomized, controlled study in Canada found that treating little brown bats with a probiotic bacterium at the time of infection with white-nose syndrome increased survival within cages in a laboratory, and one randomized, controlled study in the USA found that treating little brown bats with a probiotic bacterium within a mine increased survival for free-flying bats, but not caged bats (Action 2008). Regarding disease symptoms, the Canadian study found that little brown bats treated with a probiotic bacterium at the time of infection had reduced symptoms of the disease, but bats treated 21 days prior to infection had worse symptoms, while the USA study found that little brown bats kept within cages in a mine and treated with a probiotic bacterium had a similar severity of white-nose syndrome to untreated bats (Action 2008). For all other potential strategies, no studies were found that evaluated their effectiveness, including: culling infected bats (Action 1012), vaccination against the pathogen (Action 1011), captive breeding to supplement affected populations (Action 2009), treating hibernacula environments to reduce pathogen reservoir (Action 2007), decontaminating clothing and equipment (Action 2006), and restricting human access to caves (Action 1010).",

Overpasses are another option, with studies in Ireland and France finding that two or three bat species used overpasses, though up to three-quarters of bats still crossed at traffic height or at other nearby locations (action 977). One UK study found that an overpass with planters was used by two-thirds of crossing bats, while an unvegetated overpass was not used (action 977). Bat gantries or bat bridges have shown mixed results, with UK studies finding fewer bats used gantries than crossed below at traffic height, and one gantry was not used at all, while a French study found a temporary gantry was used by three bat species but almost half of crossing bats flew over the road at other locations (action 978). Additionally, bats can be diverted to safe crossing points using plantings or fencing, with one controlled study in Switzerland finding that up to one fifth of lesser horseshoe bats flew along an artificial hedgerow to commute (action 981).",

Increasing the wind speed at which turbines become operational (cut-in speed) has been evaluated in twelve studies, with ten of twelve studies finding that this operational change resulted in fewer bat fatalities than at conventionally operated turbines (Action 1960). Preventing turbine blades from turning at low wind speeds, known as 'feathering', has been tested in six studies, with five of six studies finding that this practice resulted in fewer bat fatalities than at conventionally operated turbines (Action 970). Additionally, slowing the rotation of turbine blades at low wind speeds has been evaluated, with one study finding that bat fatalities were reduced when turbine blades were slowed at low wind speeds (Action 2939). These operational adjustments focus on reducing turbine activity during low wind conditions when bats are most active and vulnerable to turbine strikes.",

For fruit orchard protection, action 1953 documents effective measures including organic deterrent sprays, hanging plastic flags in trees, covering individual tree branches with nylon net bags to reduce damage to lychees caused by Madagascan flying foxes or Mauritius fruit bats, and ringing bells in lychee trees to deter most Madagascan flying foxes. For wind turbine conflicts, action 968 shows that ultrasonic deterrents can reduce bat fatalities, with studies finding 21-51% fewer bats killed at turbines with ultrasonic deterrents in some cases, though results were mixed across different species and study years. Roost management approaches include creating alternative bat roosts within developments (action 949), where purpose-built roosts like bat boxes or bat lofts/barns were used by bats at 13-74% of development sites, though new roosts were four times less likely to be used than retained roosts. Exclusion methods during building work (action 1930) have been documented, with one study finding that excluding bats from roosts within buildings did not change roost switching frequency or foraging behaviors of soprano pipistrelle colonies. The documents also reference actions for replacing culling with non-lethal methods for preventing vampire bats from spreading rabies to livestock (action 1950) and humans (action 1979), and educating farmers and communities to reduce indiscriminate culling (action 2044), though no studies were found that directly evaluated these specific approaches.",

    "relevant_summary": "Several alternative lighting strategies can be used to minimize disturbance to bats beyond avoiding illumination entirely. Red lighting shows promise as an alternative, with studies finding that more soprano pipistrelles emerged from a roost when lit with red light than when lit with white light (Action 2021). Additionally, one study found that using low intensity white lights or red lights in caves resulted in fewer bat flights than with full white lighting (Action 1994). Ultraviolet filtering is another effective strategy, with one study finding that hedges lit with ultraviolet filtered lights had higher soprano pipistrelle activity than hedges lit with unfiltered light (Action 1020). Shielding lights can also reduce impacts, with studies on shielded \"full cut-off\" lights showing that fewer individual moths and moth species were attracted to lights fitted with blinds to prevent light scattering along with filters to remove shorter wavelengths than to conventional lights (Action 3904). This is relevant for bats since many species feed on insects attracted to lights. Studies also demonstrate the importance of avoiding illumination of specific areas, particularly commuting routes, with research showing that 28-96% of pond bats changed their flight paths along canals to avoid light spill from lamps, and that lesser horseshoe bats and myotis bats had greater activity along unlit hedges than along hedges illuminated with street lights (Action 2017).",

    "relevant_summary": "Several specific actions can be taken to protect bats during and after mine closure and reclamation, though research on their effectiveness is limited. Actions include retaining access points for bats following mine closures (Action 1962), excluding bats from roosts prior to mine reclamation (Action 1961), and reopening entrances to closed mines and making them suitable for roosting bats (Action 1965). Maintaining microclimate in closed/abandoned mines is another approach, with one study in the USA finding that modifying the microclimate of an abandoned mine by closing a man-made entrance resulted in a greater number of bats hibernating within the mine (Action 1964). \n\nFor cases where mines cannot be preserved as bat habitat, providing artificial subterranean bat roosts to replace roosts in reclaimed mines (Action 974) and relocating bats from reclaimed mines to alternative subterranean roost sites (Action 975) are potential mitigation measures. Creating artificial caves or hibernacula for bats has shown some success, with studies in the UK and Germany finding that artificial hibernacula were used by up to four bat species, and the number of bats using an artificial hibernaculum increased in each of nine years after it was built (Action 2049).\n\nInstalling and maintaining gates at mine entrances to restrict public access while allowing bat access is another conservation approach. However, nine studies found mixed results: while 43 of 47 mines continued to be used 12 years after gates were installed, bats abandoned four mines with 'ladder' design gates, and gate installation resulted in fewer bat species entering mines and altered bat behavior at mine entrances (Action 1963).",

In contrast, evidence for legal protection during development (action 1935) comes from only four studies, all conducted in the UK, with no studies measuring community or population responses. The development protection studies focused primarily on behavioral changes and impacts on roost sites, finding that 68% of roosts were destroyed during licensed activities and only 31-67% of compensation roosts were actually used by bats.

Regarding species richness and diversity, five of seven studies found that the number of bat species did not differ between organic and non-organic farms, while two studies found more bat species on organic farms than non-organic farms (Action ID: 961). For bat abundance and activity, five of nine studies found that overall bat activity and common pipistrelle activity did not differ between organic and non-organic farms. However, four studies found higher overall bat activity, bat feeding activity, Brazilian free-tailed bat activity, and activity of four of seven bat species on organic farms than non-organic farms (Action ID: 961). Two UK studies found higher activity of Myotis species over water and rivers on organic farms than non-organic farms, but no differences for other species or habitats. One French study found higher activity for two of three bat species over organic fields than two of three types of conventionally managed fields (Action ID: 961). Additionally, studies examining reduced pesticide, herbicide, and fertilizer use found that farms with few or no chemical inputs had different compositions of bat species and higher overall bat activity compared to farms using high chemical inputs (Action ID: 2013, 2331). One study in Colombia found that great fruit-eating bats in silvopastoral areas with no chemicals had higher body weights and body condition scores than those in conventional farming areas using chemicals (Action ID: 2013).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence, several factors are associated with the successful use of artificial bat roosts by bats. Microclimate management is a key factor - one before-and-after study in Spain found more bats in two artificial roosts within buildings after they had been modified to reduce internal roost temperatures (Action 2052). However, temperature management shows mixed results, as one replicated, before-and-after study in the UK found that heated bat boxes were used by common pipistrelle bats at only one of seven sites, but none were used by maternity colonies (Action 2052). Site location appears important - one review in the USA found that spaces created in road bridges for roosting bats to replace those lost during bridge works were recolonized by bats in similar or greater numbers to the original roosts at four of eight sites (Action 1967). Artificial hibernacula show promise, with one study in the UK finding that the number of bats using an artificial hibernaculum increased in each of nine years after it was built, and multiple studies in Germany and the UK found that artificial hibernacula were used by up to four bat species (Action 2049). Success rates for bat boxes and alternative roosts vary significantly - three studies found that bat boxes or bat lofts/barns were used by bats at 13-74% of development sites, and three of five before-and-after studies found that bat colonies used purpose-built roosts in higher or similar numbers after the original roosts were destroyed, while two other studies found that bats used purpose-built roosts in lower numbers than the original roost (Action 949).

    "relevant_summary": "As alternatives to increasing turbine cut-in speeds, several operational changes can reduce bat mortality at wind farms. Preventing turbine blades from turning at low wind speeds ('feathering') has been shown effective, with five of six studies in the USA and Canada finding that feathering resulted in fewer bat fatalities than at conventionally operated turbines (Action 970). Slowing the rotation of turbine blades at low wind speeds is another alternative, with one replicated, randomized, controlled study in Canada finding that bat fatalities were reduced when turbine blades were slowed at low wind speeds (Action 2939). \n\nAutomatically reducing turbine blade rotation when bat activity is high has proven effective, with two studies in Germany and the USA showing that automatically reducing rotation speed when bat activity is predicted to be high resulted in fewer bat fatalities for all bat species combined and for five bat species (Action 971). Deterring bats from turbines using ultrasound shows mixed results, with three studies in the USA finding varied effectiveness - one study found 21-51% fewer bats killed in the first year but mixed results in the second year, while other studies found ultrasonic deterrents reduced fatalities for some but not all bat species (Action 968). \n\nAdditional operational modifications include applying textured coating to turbines, though one study in the USA found this did not reduce bat activity or observations (Action 1957). Several other potential operational changes lack sufficient research evidence, including removing turbine lighting to reduce bat and insect attraction (Action 969), deterring bats using low-level ultraviolet light (Action 1958), minimizing road lighting to reduce insect attraction (Action 1969), and closing off potential access points on turbines to prevent roosting bats (Action 972).",

Direct treatment approaches include treating bats with probiotic bacteria, where two studies found that treating little brown bats with probiotic bacterium at the time of infection increased survival in laboratory settings and for free-flying bats in mines, and reduced disease symptoms when applied at infection time (action 2008). However, treatment 21 days prior to infection worsened symptoms. \n\nPrevention and containment measures include restricting human access to bat caves to reduce pathogen spread (action 1010), decontaminating clothing and equipment after entering caves (action 2006), treating hibernacula environments to reduce pathogen reservoirs (action 2007), and culling infected bats (action 1012). Vaccination against the white-nose syndrome pathogen has been proposed (action 1011). Population supplementation through captive breeding programs specifically for white-nose syndrome affected populations has been considered (action 2009).\n\nMost of these actions have not yet been scientifically evaluated for effectiveness, with studies available only for probiotic treatment approaches. The available evidence suggests that timing of probiotic treatment is critical for effectiveness.",
