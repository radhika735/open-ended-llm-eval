    "relevant_summary": "The most effective farmland management practices for increasing butterfly and moth abundance include: 1) Planting nectar flower mixture/wildflower strips (Action ID: 3932) - these provide essential nectar sources and habitat, with studies showing higher species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths compared to conventional field margins, cropped fields, or grass-only margins. 2) Converting to organic farming (Action ID: 3907) - organic farms show greater species richness and abundance of butterflies and burnet moths compared to conventional farms, with abundance increasing with time since conversion. 3) Increasing or maintaining natural/semi-natural habitat in the farmed landscape (Action ID: 3910) - farms with greater proportions of semi-natural habitat or woodland in surrounding areas support higher species richness and abundance. 4) Planting grass buffer strips/margins (Action ID: 3982) - particularly wider margins (up to 6m) and floristically enhanced grass buffers show higher abundance and species richness compared to cropped field edges. 5) Delaying cutting or grazing dates (Action ID: 3967) - grasslands cut once in July or September rather than May/June show greater abundance of butterflies and burnet moths. 6) Using rotational mowing (Action ID: 3966) - grasslands with staggered mowing or rotational management have higher species richness and abundance compared to annual full-site mowing. 7) Leaving unsprayed conservation headlands (Action ID: 3898) - these show greater species richness and abundance of butterflies compared to sprayed headlands. 8) Creating uncultivated margins (Action ID: 3981) - longer or wider uncultivated margins that are not cut, or only cut in spring/autumn, support higher species richness and abundance compared to summer-cut margins.",

    "relevant_summary": "Alternative management strategies to prescribed burning for maintaining open grassland habitats for butterflies include rotational mowing, changing mowing regimes, grazing management, mechanical vegetation removal, and herbicide application. Rotational mowing (mowing strips in alternate years or leaving some areas uncut) can increase butterfly species richness and abundance compared to annual complete mowing. Delaying cutting dates to July or September rather than May/June can increase butterfly abundance. Changing mowing regimes (such as mowing in August vs November) can maintain caterpillar populations. Grazing management shows mixed results - intensive grazing generally reduces butterfly abundance compared to light or no grazing, while traditional low-intensity grazing can be beneficial. Mechanical removal of mid-storey or ground vegetation and herbicide application are additional alternatives, though evidence for their effectiveness specifically for butterflies is limited. Maintaining species-rich semi-natural grasslands through extensive management (light grazing or annual mowing) can support butterfly communities.",

One of three replicated, site comparison studies in Germany\\u00a0and Switzerland\\u00a0found that traditional hay meadows mown once/year in June or July had a higher abundance of heath fritillary adults and caterpillars than old, abandoned meadows. One study found that summer-grazed or mown grasslands had a higher abundance of farmland butterflies and burnet moths, but a lower abundance of woodland butterflies and burnet moths, than abandoned grasslands. The third study found that mown grasslands had a lower abundance of moths than unmown grasslands, but grazed grasslands had a similar abundance of moths to ungrazed grasslands. Two replicated, site comparison studies in China\\u00a0and Switzerland\\u00a0found that semi-natural grasslands managed by grazing\\u00a0or cutting twice/year after mid-June\\u00a0had a lower abundance of marsh fritillary eggs and caterpillars\\u00a0and adult butterflies\\u00a0than ungrazed margins and intercrops\\u00a0or sown wildflower strips. One replicated, site comparison study in Hungary\\u00a0found that semi-natural grasslands managed by either light grazing or mowing once/year in May or June had a higher abundance of butterflies than conventional wheat fields.\\nSurvival (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in China\\u00a0found that marsh fritillary eggs had a similar survival rate in uncultivated, grazed meadows and cultivated, ungrazed field margins and intercrops, but the survival of caterpillars was higher in the grazed meadows.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (5 STUDIES)\\nUse (5 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies in Austria\\u00a0and Germany\\u00a0found that 14 species of moth\\u00a0preferred grazed pastures while 24 others avoided them, and three species of butterfly\\u00a0and ten nocturnal moths\\u00a0preferred mown meadows, while 19 nocturnal moth species avoided them. One replicated, site comparison study in Spain\\u00a0found that meadows managed by summer-grazing or hay-mowing were more likely to be occupied by grizzled skipper and painted lady than unmanaged meadows, but small pearl-bordered fritillary occurred less frequently in grazed meadows than in hay meadows or abandoned meadows. One replicated, site comparison study in Finland and Russia\\u00a0found that three of 37 butterfly species preferred meadows which were mown annually in July or August to cattle-grazed pasture, but the other 34 species showed no preference. One replicated, site comparison study in China\\u00a0found that uncultivated, grazed meadows were less likely to be occupied by marsh fritillary eggs and caterpillars than cultivated field margins and intercrops.\"\n}"

Retaining connectivity between habitat patches helps butterfly populations persist, with well-connected low quality habitat patches more likely to retain Alcon large blue populations than less well connected patches. Habitat corridors also facilitate movement, as common buckeye butterflies were more likely to colonize distant habitat patches when released on corridors of suitable habitat. Restoring or creating habitat connectivity has been shown to increase the abundance of multiple butterfly species, including Karner blue, high brown fritillary, small pearl-bordered fritillary, marsh fritillary, and regal fritillary butterflies. Connected habitat patches also promote movement between patches, with common buckeye and variegated fritillary butterflies more likely to move between connected than unconnected patches. Grassland strips providing nectar or shelter were more likely to be used by butterfly species than strips with no resources.",

    "relevant_summary": "Multiple UK studies demonstrate that reducing management intensity on permanent grasslands significantly benefits butterfly and moth populations. Key techniques include: 1) Rotational mowing - cutting strips in alternate years or leaving rotational areas uncut increases butterfly and burnet moth abundance compared to annual complete mowing, with two heath fritillary populations surviving on rotationally mown grasslands while six went extinct on unmanaged grasslands; 2) Delayed cutting - mowing grassland once in July instead of May/June increases butterfly abundance and species richness, with September cutting maintaining stable scarce large blue butterfly populations while May mowing led to decreases over time; 3) Reducing fertilizer and chemical inputs - unfertilized UK grasslands support greater species richness of specialist moths and similar abundance of adult butterflies compared to fertilized grasslands; 4) Altering mowing regimes on road verges and greenspaces - less frequent mowing or leaving areas unmown increases butterfly species richness and abundance compared to regularly mown areas. These findings are supported by evidence that 24 out of 58 moth species prefer less intensively managed UK grasslands, and reducing grazing combined with stopping chemical applications increased both species richness and total abundance of large moths.",

Two replicated, site comparison studies in the Czech Republic\\u00a0and Germany\\u00a0found that species-rich grassland managed by grazing or mowing had a similar community composition of butterflies\\u00a0and burnet moths\\u00a0to abandoned grassland. One replicated, site comparison study in Switzerland\\u00a0found that meadows managed by mowing at least twice/year after mid-June had a different community composition of butterflies to sown wildflower strips.\\nRichness/diversity (11 studies): Three of six site comparison studies (including five replicated studies) in Germany, the USA, Russia and Finland, Italy\\u00a0and the Czech Republic\\u00a0found that the species richness of butterflies was similar on semi-natural grassland managed by light grazing or by annual mowing in July or August, and on prairies managed by cattle grazing and/or rotational burning. One study found that the species richness of butterflies was higher in grassland managed by sheep and cattle grazing than in grassland mown annually for hay in June. One study found that the species richness of moths was higher in grassland managed by annual mowing than grassland managed by grazing, and the species richness of butterflies was highest in grasslands where mowing was staggered throughout the year, with some areas left uncut. The sixth study found that in some areas, the species richness of specialist and grassland butterflies was higher in prairies managed by two-year rotational haying, and in other areas it was higher in prairies managed by grazing, but in all cases richness was higher at sites longer after they were last managed. Two replicated, site comparison studies in Germany\\u00a0found that species-rich grasslands managed by summer-grazing, grazing\\u00a0or mowing\\u00a0had a similar species richness of butterflies and burnet moths\\u00a0and nocturnal moths\\u00a0to unmanaged grassland. However, one of these studies also found that grasslands managed by mowing had a lower species richness of nocturnal moths than unmown grassland. Two replicated, site comparison studies in Germany\\u00a0and Hungary\\u00a0found that old meadows mown in July\\u00a0and lightly grazed or annually mown meadows\\u00a0had a higher species richness of adult butterflies\\u00a0and caterpillars\\u00a0than recently established set-aside\\u00a0or cereal crops. One replicated, site comparison study in Switzerland\\u00a0found that meadows mown at least twice/year after mid-June had a similar species richness of butterflies to sown wildflower strips.\\n\\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (16 STUDIES)\\n\\nAbundance (16 studies): Five of ten site comparison studies (including nine replicated studies) in Germany, the USA, Russia and Finland, Italy, Spain\\u00a0and the Czech Republic\\u00a0found that semi-natural grasslands had a similar abundance of butterflies generally, and individual species of butterflies\\u00a0and moth caterpillars, when managed by extensive sheep, sheep and goat, cattle\\u00a0or livestock\\u00a0grazing compared to annual\\u00a0or occasional\\u00a0mowing, or rotational mowing or burning. Four of these studies found that grasslands managed by cattle, sheep\\u00a0or livestock\\u00a0grazing had a higher abundance of butterflies generally, and individual species of butterflies\\u00a0and moth caterpillars, than grasslands managed by annual mowing, rotational burning\\u00a0or unmanaged grasslands. Three of these studies found that grasslands managed by haying had a higher abundance of individual butterfly species\\u00a0than grasslands managed by grazing\\u00a0or burning\\u00a0or unmanaged grasslands. Four of these studies found that specific butterfly species\\u00a0and all butterflies\\u00a0were less abundant in mown, grazed\\u00a0or rotationally burned\\u00a0grassland than in unmanaged, rotationally burned\\u00a0or grazed and burned grassland.\\u00a0The ninth study found that in some areas, the abundance of specialist and grassland butterflies was higher in prairies managed by two-year rotational haying or by grazing, but in all cases abundance was higher at sites longer after they were last managed. One of three replicated, site comparison studies in Germany\\u00a0and Switzerland\\u00a0found that traditional hay meadows mown once/year in June or July had a higher abundance of heath fritillary adults and caterpillars than old, abandoned meadows. One study found that summer-grazed or mown grasslands had a higher abundance of farmland butterflies and burnet moths, but a lower abundance of woodland butterflies and burnet moths, than abandoned grasslands. The third study found that mown grasslands had a lower abundance of moths than unmown grasslands, but grazed grasslands had a similar abundance of moths to ungrazed grasslands. Two replicated, site comparison studies in China\\u00a0and Switzerland\\u00a0found that semi-natural grasslands managed by grazing\\u00a0or cutting twice/year after mid-June\\u00a0had a lower abundance of marsh fritillary eggs and caterpillars\\u00a0and adult butterflies\\u00a0than ungrazed margins and intercrops\\u00a0or sown wildflower strips. One replicated, site comparison study in Hungary\\u00a0found that semi-natural grasslands managed by either light grazing or mowing once/year in May or June had a higher abundance of butterflies than conventional wheat fields.\\nSurvival (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in China\\u00a0found that marsh fritillary eggs had a similar survival rate in uncultivated, grazed meadows and cultivated, ungrazed field margins and intercrops, but the survival of caterpillars was higher in the grazed meadows.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (5 STUDIES)\\nUse (5 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies in Austria\\u00a0and Germany\\u00a0found that 14 species of moth\\u00a0preferred grazed pastures while 24 others avoided them, and three species of butterfly\\u00a0and ten nocturnal moths\\u00a0preferred mown meadows, while 19 nocturnal moth species avoided them. One replicated, site comparison study in Spain\\u00a0found that meadows managed by summer-grazing or hay-mowing were more likely to be occupied by grizzled skipper and painted lady than unmanaged meadows, but small pearl-bordered fritillary occurred less frequently in grazed meadows than in hay meadows or abandoned meadows. One replicated, site comparison study in Finland and Russia\\u00a0found that three of 37 butterfly species preferred meadows which were mown annually in July or August to cattle-grazed pasture, but the other 34 species showed no preference. One replicated, site comparison study in China\\u00a0found that uncultivated, grazed meadows were less likely to be occupied by marsh fritillary eggs and caterpillars than cultivated field margins and intercrops.\"\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "Management actions for traditional orchards and vineyards in the USA and Germany have been studied with the following findings:\n\nFor traditional orchards: Two studies evaluated maintaining traditional orchards for butterflies and moths, one in the USA and one in Germany. The German study found managed orchards had similar species richness but lower abundance of butterflies and burnet moths compared to abandoned orchards, and similar community composition between managed and abandoned orchards. The USA study found unmanaged and partially managed orchards had greater species richness and diversity of leaf-eating arthropods (including caterpillars) than commercially managed orchards.\n\nFor vineyard management: Two studies evaluated managing vineyards for butterflies and moths, one in the USA and one in Spain. The USA study found grass strips between vine rows had greater butterfly species richness than vine rows themselves, and vineyards with fewer chemicals had greater butterfly species richness than conventionally managed vineyards. Another USA study found vineyards managed to encourage native plants with rare insecticide use had greater butterfly abundance than conventionally managed vineyards.\n\nFor chemical reductions: Eleven studies evaluated reducing fertilizer, pesticide or herbicide use generally, with two studies each in the USA and Germany. These found that orchards, crop edges, farms, vineyards and agricultural landscapes managed with reduced or no chemical inputs had greater species richness and abundance of adult butterflies and moths, or caterpillars, compared to conventional chemical applications.\n\nFor organic farming: Thirteen studies evaluated converting to organic farming, including one study in Germany. Seven of eleven studies found organic farms had greater species richness of butterflies and moths than conventional farms, and seven of eleven studies found organic farms had greater abundance of butterflies and moths than conventional farms.",

The German study found managed orchards had similar species richness but lower abundance of butterflies and burnet moths compared to abandoned orchards, and similar community composition between managed and abandoned orchards. The USA study found unmanaged and partially managed orchards had greater species richness and diversity of leaf-eating arthropods (including caterpillars) than commercially managed orchards.\\n\\nFor vineyard management: Two studies evaluated managing vineyards for butterflies and moths, one in the USA and one in Spain. The USA study found grass strips between vine rows had greater butterfly species richness than vine rows themselves, and vineyards with fewer chemicals had greater butterfly species richness than conventionally managed vineyards. Another USA study found vineyards managed to encourage native plants with rare insecticide use had greater butterfly abundance than conventionally managed vineyards.\\n\\nFor chemical reductions: Eleven studies evaluated reducing fertilizer, pesticide or herbicide use generally, with two studies each in the USA and Germany. These found that orchards, crop edges, farms, vineyards and agricultural landscapes managed with reduced or no chemical inputs had greater species richness and abundance of adult butterflies and moths, or caterpillars, compared to conventional chemical applications.\\n\\nFor organic farming: Thirteen studies evaluated converting to organic farming, including one study in Germany. Seven of eleven studies found organic farms had greater species richness of butterflies and moths than conventional farms, and seven of eleven studies found organic farms had greater abundance of butterflies and moths than conventional farms.\", \"action_ids\": [\"3917\", \"3897\", \"3919\", \"703\", \"240\", \"3907\"]}",
