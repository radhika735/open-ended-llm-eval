    "relevant_summary": "Several alternative management strategies to prescribed burning for maintaining open grassland habitats for butterflies have been studied. One study found that the species richness of butterflies was similar on semi-natural grassland managed by light grazing or by annual mowing (3908). Another study found that grassland managed by sheep and cattle grazing had a higher species richness of butterflies than grassland mown annually (3908). Butterfly species richness was highest in grasslands where mowing was staggered throughout the year, with some areas left uncut (3908). In terms of abundance, five studies found that semi-natural grasslands had a similar abundance of butterflies when managed by extensive grazing compared to annual or occasional mowing (3908). However, some studies also found that grasslands managed by grazing had a higher abundance of butterflies than those managed by annual mowing (3908), while others found that haying resulted in a higher abundance of individual butterfly species than grazing (3908). Rotational grazing has also been explored as an alternative. Some studies found that rotational cattle and sheep-grazed grasslands had a greater species richness of butterflies and burnet moths than continuously grazed or patch-burned grassland (3965) and that rotational grazing, at high stocking densities, could also increase butterfly abundance (3965). Ceasing mowing to allow for early succession is another potential strategy. Some studies found that grasslands that had been abandoned for 3-13 years had a similar species richness of butterflies to managed grasslands, while meadows not cut all summer had a higher species richness of butterflies than those cut multiple times (3957). However, long-term abandonment of over 50 years could lead to lower species richness (3957). The impact of ceasing mowing on butterfly abundance is mixed, with some studies reporting lower abundance and others reporting higher abundance compared to mown grasslands (3957). Additionally, the management of surrounding habitats like hedgerows can benefit butterflies. Hedgerows with a more complex structure, with trees, or those cut less frequently (every 2-3 years) or laid/coppiced, were found to have a higher species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths (3975).",

Mowing coastal grassland in August was found to reduce the abundance of Fisher's estuarine moth caterpillars, while mowing in November or not mowing did not (3945). Restoring arable land to permanent grassland is another beneficial technique. Studies in the UK have shown that this can lead to a higher species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths (3929). Grasslands established by sowing mixes of grasses, legumes, and other forbs had a higher abundance and richness of butterflies than those with grass-only mixes (3929).

    "relevant_summary": "Several studies have looked at the effects of thinning trees on butterfly and moth populations. Four studies in Finland and the USA discovered that thinning coniferous woodland, in some cases with additional management like mulching or prescribed burning, led to a higher abundance and species richness of butterflies (3940). Another study in the Czech Republic showed that forest plots that had been partially cleared had a higher species richness of butterflies, but a lower species richness of moths, than closed-canopy forests (3940). One study in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, however, found that a thinned forest had a similar abundance and diversity of fruit-feeding butterflies as a naturally regenerating, unmanaged forest, but that rarer species were caught less often in the thinned forest (3940).\n\nStudies have also examined the effects of different logging methods on butterfly and moth populations. A study in Brazil discovered that a forest that was managed with reduced-impact logging had a greater abundance of butterflies than a primary forest, as well as a similar diversity and species richness (3867). Another study in Brazil found that fruit-feeding butterflies were most abundant in forests with an intermediate intensity of reduced-impact logging (3867). In contrast, a study in the USA reported that forests where single tree selection harvesting was used had a lower species richness of moths than forests that were unharvested (3867).\n\nThe impact of encouraging natural regeneration in logged forests or former plantations has also been investigated. A study in Uganda showed that naturally regenerating forests had a similar abundance and species richness of butterflies to pristine forests, with both measures being highest 12 to 25 years after felling (3876). In Japan, a study found that moths were more abundant and had a greater species richness in naturally regenerating forests than in plantations (3876). However, a study in Ghana reported that a naturally regenerating forest had a lower species richness of butterflies than a primary forest (3876).
