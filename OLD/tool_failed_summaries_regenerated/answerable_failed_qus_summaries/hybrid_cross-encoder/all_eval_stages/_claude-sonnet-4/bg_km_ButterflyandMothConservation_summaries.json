    "provider": null,
    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from multiple studies, several farmland management practices are effective for increasing butterfly and moth abundance:\n\nConverting to organic farming (action 3907) shows significant benefits, with seven of 11 studies finding that organic arable farms had greater species richness and abundance of butterflies, burnet moths, and all moths than conventionally managed farms. However, effectiveness varies with landscape context, being more pronounced in intensively managed areas, and benefits may be stronger in farms managed organically for less than 6 years.\n\nPlanting nectar flower mixtures and wildflower strips (action 3932) is highly effective, with ten studies showing that sown wildflower strips had higher abundance of all butterflies, generalist butterflies, specialist butterflies, and meadow brown butterflies than conventional field margins, unsown margins, cropped fields, and conventional grassland. Eight of thirteen studies found higher species richness and diversity in wildflower strips compared to conventional alternatives.\n\nReducing fertilizer, pesticide or herbicide use generally (action 3897) benefits butterfly and moth populations, with eight studies finding that areas managed with less frequent, reduced or no chemical inputs had greater species richness of adult butterflies and moths than areas with more frequent or conventional chemical applications. Six studies showed higher abundance of butterflies and moths in areas with reduced chemical use.\n\nIncreasing or maintaining the proportion of natural or semi-natural habitat in the farmed landscape (action 3910) is effective, with nine of eleven studies finding higher species richness of butterflies, burnet moths and all moths on farms with greater proportions of semi-natural habitat compared to conventional farmland.\n\nMaintaining species-rich, semi-natural grassland (action 3908) shows mixed results depending on management approach, with some studies finding higher abundance of butterflies in lightly grazed or annually mown grasslands compared to intensive farming, though effectiveness varies by specific management timing and intensity.\n\nPlanting new hedges (action 3976) increases butterfly and moth populations, with five of six studies finding higher abundance of butterflies, moths, and macro-moths along hedgerows than on beetle banks, grass margins without hedgerows, or field interiors.\n\nUndersowing spring cereals with clover (action 3926) shows promise, with one study finding that spring barley undersown with grasses and legumes had higher species richness and abundance of butterflies than extensively or conventionally managed grassland.\n\nPlanting wild bird seed or cover mixture (action 3930) provides benefits, with two studies finding that plots sown with wild bird seed mixture had greater species richness and higher abundance of butterflies than wheat crop or extensively managed grassland.\n\nFor specific crop types, managing vineyards to benefit butterflies and moths (action 3919) shows effectiveness, with studies finding that grass strips between vine rows and vineyards managed with fewer chemicals had greater species richness and abundance of butterflies than conventionally managed vineyards.",

    "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4",
    "provider": null,
    "relevant_summary": "Alternative management strategies to prescribed burning for maintaining open grassland habitats for butterflies include several mowing, cutting, and grazing approaches. Rotational mowing has shown positive effects, with grasslands managed by mowing strips in alternate years or leaving rotational areas uncut having greater species richness and abundance of butterflies than grasslands cut in full annually (action 3966). Additionally, rotationally mown grasslands benefitted 27 out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern, and two heath fritillary populations survived on rotationally mown grasslands while six populations went extinct on unmanaged grasslands (action 3966). Changing mowing regimes can be effective, with prairies managed by haying showing higher abundance of prairie specialist butterflies than prairies managed by burning, though the abundance was higher in the first year after haying than in the second year (action 3945). Rotational grazing is another alternative, where rotational cattle- and sheep-grazed grasslands had greater species richness of butterflies and burnet moths than continuously grazed or patch-burned grassland (action 3965). Reducing cutting frequency shows benefits, with meadows cut once per year having higher species richness of butterflies and moths than meadows cut two or more times per year (action 3961). Delaying cutting or first grazing dates also helps, with grassland cut once per year in July or September having greater abundance of butterflies, burnet moths and caterpillars than grassland cut once or twice per year in May or June (action 3967). Mechanical cutting of heathland can be effective, with one pine barren managed for 13 years by mechanical cutting having higher abundance of Karner blue butterflies than barrens managed by rotational burning (action 3947). Managing wetlands or ponds by cutting can prevent succession, though recently cut fens had fewer large copper eggs than uncut fens (action 3950).",

Restoring connectivity between habitat patches increased the abundance of multiple butterfly species including Karner blue, high brown fritillary, small pearl-bordered fritillary, marsh fritillary, and regal fritillary (Action 3934). Studies found that common buckeye and variegated fritillary butterflies were more likely to move between connected than unconnected habitat patches (Action 3934). Additionally, grassland strips providing nectar or shelter were more likely to be used by butterfly species than strips with no resources (Action 3934). For population retention, low quality habitat patches that were well connected were more likely to retain Alcon large blue populations than less well connected patches, though connectivity did not affect occupancy of high quality patches (Action 3832). Connectivity also influenced colonization behavior, as common buckeye butterflies were more likely to colonize farther away habitat patches when released on corridors of suitable habitat compared to unsuitable habitat, though this effect was not observed when released close to habitat patches (Action 3832). However, one study found that well connected cleared patches within woodland had similar species richness of butterflies to isolated cleared patches (Action 3832).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on evidence from UK agricultural settings, several grassland management techniques are most beneficial for increasing butterfly and moth abundance. Reducing management intensity on permanent grasslands shows strong benefits, with 7 of 12 studies finding that less intensively managed grasslands had higher species richness of butterflies and moths than conventionally managed grasslands (action 3958). Six of 10 studies found higher species richness, and 3 of 4 studies found higher abundance of butterflies and moths in low-input or unfertilized, ungrazed grassland managed with a single cut compared to intensively managed grassland (action 3958).\n\nRotational mowing techniques provide significant advantages, with 3 of 4 studies showing that grasslands managed by mowing strips in alternate years had greater species richness and diversity of butterflies than grasslands cut in full once per year (action 3966). Two controlled studies found higher abundance of butterflies and burnet moths in grasslands managed by mowing strips in alternate years or leaving rotational areas uncut on each mow compared to grasslands cut in full once or twice per year (action 3966). Additionally, 29 out of 32 butterfly species preferred meadows which were half mown in June and August to meadows cut in full twice per year (action 3966).\n\nConverting to organic farming demonstrates benefits, with 7 of 11 studies finding that organic arable farms had greater species richness and abundance of butterflies, burnet moths, and all moths than conventionally managed farms (action 3907). Reducing fertilizer, pesticide or herbicide use generally also shows positive effects, with 8 studies finding that farms managed with less frequent, reduced or no chemical input had greater species richness of adult butterflies and moths than areas with more frequent or conventional chemical applications (action 3897).\n\nRestoring arable land to permanent grassland provides benefits, with studies showing that restored grasslands had higher abundance of moths than conventional grassland and higher species richness of butterflies when established by sowing grasses, legumes and other non-woody, broadleaved plants compared to grass-only mixes (action 3929). Agri-environment schemes also demonstrate effectiveness, with 12 of 15 studies finding that species richness or diversity of butterflies and moths on grassland managed under agri-environment schemes was higher than on conventional fields or farms (action 3915).",

    "relevant_summary": "Reducing or eliminating chemical inputs on farmland provides several documented benefits for butterflies and moths. Studies show that areas not sprayed with herbicides such as glyphosate and fluazifop-P-butyl have greater species richness and higher total abundance of butterflies compared to sprayed areas (Action 3896). Similarly, plants not sprayed with insecticides like Karate Zeon have higher abundance of moth eggs and caterpillars (Action 3896). \n\nGeneral reduction of fertilizer, pesticide, or herbicide use results in greater species richness of adult butterflies and moths, and higher abundance of these species compared to areas with conventional chemical applications (Action 3897). These benefits include increases in both adult butterflies and moths as well as caterpillars (Action 3897). Additionally, unfertilized grassland shows greater species richness of specialist moths compared to fertilized grassland (Action 3897).\n\nConverting to organic farming, which eliminates synthetic chemical inputs, demonstrates that organic arable farms have greater species richness and abundance of butterflies, burnet moths, and all moths than conventionally managed farms (Action 3907). The abundance of butterflies increases with time since farms converted to organic management (Action 3907). When farms convert to organic management, the species richness of large moths and total abundance of large moths can increase within 4 years (Action 3907).\n\nLeaving headlands in fields unsprayed provides additional benefits, with unsprayed headlands showing greater species richness and abundance of butterflies and caterpillars than headlands sprayed with herbicide and insecticide (Action 3898). Butterflies also exhibit behavioral benefits, spending more time feeding and interacting in unsprayed headlands compared to sprayed areas (Action 3898).",

Selective or reduced impact logging instead of conventional logging, where studies in Sweden and Brazil found selectively logged forests had higher abundance of moth caterpillars compared to clearcut forests and similar or higher abundance of butterflies compared to primary forest (Action 3867). Group selection harvesting or thinning instead of clearcutting, where three studies in the USA found forests managed by thinning had higher moth species richness than those managed by patch-cutting or clearcutting (Action 3868). Managing woodland edges for maximum habitat heterogeneity, where studies in Belgium and Finland found scalloped woodland edges had higher abundance of brown hairstreak eggs than straight edges, and felling 5-meter-wide woodland edges with thinning of adjacent forest increased butterfly and moth species richness and specialist butterfly abundance (Action 3942). Mechanically removing mid-storey or ground vegetation to create fire breaks, where studies in Portugal and France found cork oak woodlands with more recent mechanical clearance had greater butterfly species richness and abundance than those cleared less frequently (Action 3881). Creating young plantations within mature woodland, where a UK study found pearl-bordered fritillary populations were more likely to persist in woodlands with larger areas of young plantations than in mature woodland (Action 3941).",

    "relevant_summary": "The evidence regarding the effectiveness of agri-environment schemes for butterfly and moth conservation across Europe shows mixed but generally positive results. Thirty-two studies have evaluated the effects of paying farmers to cover the costs of conservation measures on butterflies and moths, with the majority of studies conducted in the UK (18 studies), Switzerland (8 studies), Finland (2 studies), and one each in Sweden, Czech Republic, USA, and Germany (Action 3915). \n\nFor species richness and diversity, twelve of 15 studies found that butterflies and moths on grassland, field margins, wildflower strips or whole farms managed under agri-environment schemes had higher species richness or diversity than on conventional fields or farms, while three studies found similar richness. However, one study in Finland found that species richness was lower on agri-environment scheme grassland compared to abandoned, unmanaged grassland (Action 3915).\n\nRegarding abundance, seventeen of 19 studies found that the abundance of butterflies and moths on farms managed under agri-environment schemes was higher than on conventional farms. Three of four studies found higher butterfly abundance on farms or in landscapes with higher proportions of land under agri-environment schemes. However, studies in Finland and Czech Republic found that grassland managed under agri-environment schemes had lower abundance compared to unmanaged grassland (Action 3915).\n\nSpecific interventions show varying effectiveness. For wildflower strips, eight of thirteen studies found higher species richness of butterflies and moths compared to conventional margins, and ten studies found higher abundance (Action 3932). Reducing management intensity on permanent grasslands showed positive effects in six of ten studies for species richness, with three of four studies showing higher butterfly abundance (Action 3958). Set-aside areas demonstrated benefits in three of four studies for species richness and two of five studies for abundance (Action 3980). Rotational mowing proved effective with three of four studies showing greater species richness and positive abundance effects reported in multiple studies (Action 3966).\n\nThe evidence base is strongest for the UK and Switzerland, with fewer studies from other European countries, indicating geographic gaps in the research.",
