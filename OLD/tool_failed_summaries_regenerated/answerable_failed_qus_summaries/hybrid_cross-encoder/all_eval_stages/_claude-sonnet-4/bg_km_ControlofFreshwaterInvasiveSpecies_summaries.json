Three out of four studies found that diquat or diquat alginate reduced cover or eradicated submerged C. helmsii (Action 1279). Salt water treatment showed high effectiveness, with two replicated controlled container trials and two before-and-after field trials finding that seawater eradicated C. helmsii (Action 1288). Among combination approaches, covering with carpet followed by glyphosate treatment killed 80% of the plant (Action 1313).\n\nThe least effective non-physical control methods documented include hydrogen peroxide, which in one controlled study using tank trials did not control C. helmsii (Action 1281). Aquatic dye application to reduce light levels was found ineffective, with one replicated controlled study showing it did not reduce coverage (Action 1293). Some herbicides showed limited effectiveness: dichlobenil led to only partial biomass reduction in one out of two studies (Action 1279), and terbutryne only partially reduced biomass of submerged C. helmsii in container trials (Action 1279). Grazing showed inconsistent results, with one study finding reduced abundance when grazing was excluded, while another found no difference between grazed and ungrazed plots (Action 1301).",

Salt water treatment has proven effective, with two replicated, controlled container trials and two before-and-after field trials in the UK finding that seawater eradicated Crassula helmsii (action 1288). Lightproof barriers using black sheeting or carpet strips showed significant results in five before-and-after studies in the UK, which found that covering Crassula helmsii eradicated or severely reduced plant cover, though progressive recolonization occurred at two sites where initial eradication was reported (action 1294). A combination approach using carpet covering followed by glyphosate herbicide treatment killed 80% of Crassula helmsii in one UK pond study (action 1313). For skunk cabbage eradication, physical removal methods show effectiveness but require sustained effort. A study in Switzerland found that annual physical removal of recently established skunk cabbage plants over five years removed the entire stock, while a study in the Netherlands found manual removal effective for small outbreaks of small-growing plants (action 1101). However, a German study reported that after four years of twice-yearly full removal, a large number of plants still needed to be removed annually (action 1101). Chemical control using herbicides shows mixed results for skunk cabbage. One UK study found that both glyphosate and 2,4-D Amine killed all skunk cabbage plants in test areas, but another UK study found that while 2,4-D amine at 9 litres/ha successfully eradicated skunk cabbage, glyphosate was unsuccessful and only achieved limited reduction in plant growth (action 1102).",

Salt water treatment has proven effective, with two replicated, controlled container trials and two before-and-after field trials in the UK finding that seawater eradicated Crassula helmsii (action 1288). Lightproof barriers using black sheeting or carpet strips showed significant results in five before-and-after studies in the UK, which found that covering Crassula helmsii eradicated or severely reduced plant cover, though progressive recolonization occurred at two sites where initial eradication was reported (action 1294). A combination approach using carpet covering followed by glyphosate herbicide treatment killed 80% of Crassula helmsii in one UK pond study (action 1313). For skunk cabbage eradication, physical removal methods show effectiveness but require sustained effort. A study in Switzerland found that annual physical removal of recently established skunk cabbage plants over five years removed the entire stock, while a study in the Netherlands found manual removal effective for small outbreaks of small-growing plants (action 1101). However, a German study reported that after four years of twice-yearly full removal, a large number of plants still needed to be removed annually (action 1101). Chemical control using herbicides shows mixed results for skunk cabbage. One UK study found that both glyphosate and 2,4-D Amine killed all skunk cabbage plants in test areas, but another UK study found that while 2,4-D amine at 9 litres/ha successfully eradicated skunk cabbage, glyphosate was unsuccessful and only achieved limited reduction in plant growth (action 1102).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"1288\",\n    \"1294\",\n    \"1313\",\n    \"1101\",\n    \"1102\"\n  ]\n}"

Mechanical approaches include regular cleaning of industrial pipes which was found to be an effective method of permanently removing Asian clams in Portugal (Action 1119). The addition of a sand filter was effective at reducing numbers of Asian clams (Action 1119). Suction dredging reduced Asian clam densities by 96% over two weeks with the reduction persisting for a year (Action 1120).

    "relevant_summary": "Several factors influence the success of chemical control for invasive aquatic plants like water primrose and parrot's feather:\n\n**Herbicide Type for Water Primrose:**\nTriclopyr TEA applied at 0.25% concentration killed 100% of young cultivated water primrose within two months (action 1139). Glyphosate controlled water primrose with 97% mortality when mixed with a non-oil based sticking agent and 100% mortality when combined with TopFilm (action 1139). Halosulfuron-methyl (Sempra) resulted in significant reduction in water primrose coverage (action 1139).\n\n**Herbicide Type for Parrot's Feather:**\n2,4-D reduced growth of parrot's feather and led to greater reduction compared to diquat, glyphosate or imazapyr (action 1606). The combined application of 2,4-D and MCPA completely eliminated parrot's feather (action 1606). Triclopyr reduced cover and led to greater reduction than glyphosate (action 1689). Other effective herbicides included carfentrazone-ethyl (action 1676), endothall (action 1681), diquat (action 1680), imazamox, imazapyr, glyphosate, gluphosinate-ammonium, flumioxazin, and florpyrauxifen-benzyl (action 1699). Some herbicides showed limited effectiveness: fluridone, clopyralid and copper chelate did not reduce growth (action 1699).\n\n**Use of Adjuvants:**\nFor water primrose, glyphosate showed differential effectiveness depending on adjuvant type - 97% mortality with non-oil based sticking agent versus 100% mortality when combined with TopFilm (action 1139). For water primrose, glyphosate combined with surface active agent Cygnet-Plus followed by mechanical removal achieved 75% kill rate (action 1140).\n\n**Application Factors:**\nConcentration affects effectiveness, as demonstrated with triclopyr TEA at 0.25% concentration achieving complete mortality in water primrose (action 1139). Some studies showed that effectiveness can vary between laboratory and field conditions, with some herbicides showing reduced effectiveness in field applications compared to laboratory studies (actions 1680, 1681).",

Glyphosate controlled water primrose with 97% mortality when mixed with a non-oil based sticking agent and 100% mortality when combined with TopFilm (action 1139). Halosulfuron-methyl (Sempra) resulted in significant reduction in water primrose coverage (action 1139).\\n\\n**Herbicide Type for Parrot's Feather:**\\n2,4-D reduced growth of parrot's feather and led to greater reduction compared to diquat, glyphosate or imazapyr (action 1606). The combined application of 2,4-D and MCPA completely eliminated parrot's feather (action 1606). Triclopyr reduced cover and led to greater reduction than glyphosate (action 1689). Other effective herbicides included carfentrazone-ethyl (action 1676), endothall (action 1681), diquat (action 1680), imazamox, imazapyr, glyphosate, gluphosinate-ammonium, flumioxazin, and florpyrauxifen-benzyl (action 1699). Some herbicides showed limited effectiveness: fluridone, clopyralid and copper chelate did not reduce growth (action 1699).\\n\\n**Use of Adjuvants:**\\nFor water primrose, glyphosate showed differential effectiveness depending on adjuvant type - 97% mortality with non-oil based sticking agent versus 100% mortality when combined with TopFilm (action 1139). For water primrose, glyphosate combined with surface active agent Cygnet-Plus followed by mechanical removal achieved 75% kill rate (action 1140).\\n\\n**Application Factors:**\\nConcentration affects effectiveness, as demonstrated with triclopyr TEA at 0.25% concentration achieving complete mortality in water primrose (action 1139). Some studies showed that effectiveness can vary between laboratory and field conditions, with some herbicides showing reduced effectiveness in field applications compared to laboratory studies (actions 1680, 1681).\", \"action_ids\": [\"1139\",\"1676\",\"1681\",\"1680\",\"1606\",\"1689\",\"1699\",\"1140\"]}",
