Additionally, temperatures of 36\\u00b0C or higher killed Asian clams within four days in controlled laboratory conditions (action ID: 1116). For Ponto-Caspian gammarids, a UK laboratory study demonstrated that heating water to temperatures above 36\\u00b0C killed all shrimps after 15 minutes exposure, while temperatures exceeding 43\\u00b0C caused immediate death (action ID: 1092). Regarding salinity control for gammarids, mixed results were observed: one replicated laboratory study (one controlled) in Canada and the UK found that increasing salinity levels killed the majority of invasive shrimp within five hours, while another study found that increased salinity did not kill invasive killer shrimp (action ID: 1091).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"1115\",\n    \"1116\",\n    \"1092\",\n    \"1091\"\n  ]\n}"
