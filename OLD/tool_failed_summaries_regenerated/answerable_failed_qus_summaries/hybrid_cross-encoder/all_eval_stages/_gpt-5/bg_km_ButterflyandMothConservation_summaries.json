One study found that the species richness of butterflies was higher in grassland managed by sheep and cattle grazing than in grassland mown annually for hay in June. One study found that the species richness of moths was higher in grassland managed by annual mowing than grassland managed by grazing, and the species richness of butterflies was highest in grasslands where mowing was staggered throughout the year, with some areas left uncut. The sixth study found that in some areas, the species richness of specialist and grassland butterflies was higher in prairies managed by two-year rotational haying, and in other areas it was higher in prairies managed by grazing, but in all cases richness was higher at sites longer after they were last managed.

One of three replicated, site comparison studies in Germany\\u00a0and Switzerland\\u00a0found that traditional hay meadows mown once/year in June or July had a higher abundance of heath fritillary adults and caterpillars than old, abandoned meadows. One study found that summer-grazed or mown grasslands had a higher abundance of farmland butterflies and burnet moths, but a lower abundance of woodland butterflies and burnet moths, than abandoned grasslands. The third study found that mown grasslands had a lower abundance of moths than unmown grasslands, but grazed grasslands had a similar abundance of moths to ungrazed grasslands. Two replicated, site comparison studies in China\\u00a0and Switzerland\\u00a0found that semi-natural grasslands managed by grazing\\u00a0or cutting twice/year after mid-June\\u00a0had a lower abundance of marsh fritillary eggs and caterpillars\\u00a0and adult butterflies\\u00a0than ungrazed margins and intercrops\\u00a0or sown wildflower strips. One replicated, site comparison study in Hungary\\u00a0found that semi-natural grasslands managed by either light grazing or mowing once/year in May or June had a higher abundance of butterflies than conventional wheat fields.\\nSurvival (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in China\\u00a0found that marsh fritillary eggs had a similar survival rate in uncultivated, grazed meadows and cultivated, ungrazed field margins and intercrops, but the survival of caterpillars was higher in the grazed meadows.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (5 STUDIES)\\nUse (5 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies in Austria\\u00a0and Germany\\u00a0found that 14 species of moth\\u00a0preferred grazed pastures while 24 others avoided them, and three species of butterfly\\u00a0and ten nocturnal moths\\u00a0preferred mown meadows, while 19 nocturnal moth species avoided them. One replicated, site comparison study in Spain\\u00a0found that meadows managed by summer-grazing or hay-mowing were more likely to be occupied by grizzled skipper and painted lady than unmanaged meadows, but small pearl-bordered fritillary occurred less frequently in grazed meadows than in hay meadows or abandoned meadows. One replicated, site comparison study in Finland and Russia\\u00a0found that three of 37 butterfly species preferred meadows which were mown annually in July or August to cattle-grazed pasture, but the other 34 species showed no preference.

    "relevant_summary": "Across multiple study types and farm systems, reducing or eliminating fertilizers, pesticides or herbicides was associated with higher species richness and/or abundance of butterflies, moths or their caterpillars compared to conventional or more frequent chemical applications, though some studies reported similar values in certain contexts. Studies reported greater species richness in orchards, crop edges, farms, vineyards, replanted forest stands, coffee plantations and agricultural landscapes with reduced or no chemical inputs, and higher richness of specialist moths on unfertilized grassland, while some sites showed similar richness to conventional management (3897). On permanent grasslands, lower-input management and stopping chemical applications were linked to higher species richness of butterflies and moths, more specialist moths and species of conservation concern, and increases in large moth species richness after grazing was reduced and chemicals stopped (3958). Abundance responses included higher abundance of adult butterflies and moths, and caterpillars under reduced or no chemical inputs in several settings, with some studies reporting similar or mixed results (3897). On low-input or unfertilized, ungrazed grasslands managed with a single cut, abundance of butterflies, micro\u2011moths and declining macro\u2011moths was higher than on intensively managed grassland, and after reducing grazing and stopping chemicals, total abundance of large moths and several butterfly species increased (3958). In vineyards, fewer chemical inputs were linked to greater butterfly species richness in Spain and greater abundance in the USA, while one USA study found similar species richness where insecticide was rarely used (3919). In orchards, unmanaged or partially managed sites had higher richness and diversity of leaf\u2011eating arthropods (including caterpillars) than commercially managed sites, and managed orchards had lower abundance of butterflies and burnet moths than abandoned orchards (3917). Conversion to organic farming was associated in several studies with greater species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths than on conventional farms, sometimes varying with landscape context and time since conversion; a before\u2011and\u2011after study reported increases in large moth abundance and some butterfly species after conversion alongside other management changes (3907).",

    "relevant_summary": "Evidence-based, non-burning disturbance options in forests include: (1) Thinning trees: studies reported higher butterfly richness and/or abundance one to four years after thinning (often alongside mulching or nearby felling) compared to unmanaged woodland, though one study found similar richness/abundance and rarer fruit-feeding species were less frequent in thinned forest; partially-cleared plots had higher butterfly but lower moth richness than closed-canopy forest [3940]. (2) Coppicing woodland: multiple studies found higher abundance of butterflies generally and of species such as heath fritillary in recently coppiced stands; coppice age influenced communities and richness; some studies reported lower macro-moth richness/abundance than mature forest; fritillary populations were more likely to persist for up to 20 years in coppiced or young-plantation woodlands; increases were also reported after coppicing combined with scrub control, felling, and grazing [3939]. (3) Clearing or opening patches (including widening rides): cleared patches often had greater butterfly richness and abundance than unmanaged or closed-canopy forest, with larger patches performing better; benefits were shown for species such as chequered blue, woodland brown, high brown fritillary, and small pearl-bordered fritillary; some studies noted declines over three years post-clearing and lower macro-moth abundance in wider rides; a European review reported benefits for 19 of 67 species of conservation concern; selected pine clearance supported increases and survival of a translocated baton blue population [3938]. (4) Creating young plantations within mature woodland: larger areas of young plantations (or coppicing) were associated with higher persistence of pearl-bordered and small pearl-bordered fritillaries over 20 years compared to mature conifer (both species) and mature deciduous (pearl-bordered fritillary) woodland [3941]. (5) Forest restoration with structural interventions (coppicing, felling, ride management/widening): studies reported that populations of high brown fritillary, pearl-bordered fritillary, wood white and grizzled skipper stayed the same or increased; butterflies such as heath fritillary occupied greater areas post-restoration and were more likely to fly into restored than unrestored areas; high brown fritillary presence was maintained or higher, with associations to brash/bracken litter coverage after restoration [3936]. Additionally, reducing planting density to create warmer woodlands has been proposed, but no studies were found evaluating effects on butterflies or moths [3875].",
