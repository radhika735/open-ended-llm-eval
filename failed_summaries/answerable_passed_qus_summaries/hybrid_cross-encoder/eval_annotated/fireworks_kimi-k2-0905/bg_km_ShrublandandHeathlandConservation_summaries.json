    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from the action documents, here is a comparison of herbicide alone, cutting alone, and combination approaches for controlling bracken in UK heathlands:\n\n**Herbicide alone**: Three randomized, controlled studies in the UK found that herbicide application reduced bracken biomass or cover. One controlled, before-and-after trial in the UK found that herbicide increased heather seedlings, but two other randomized, controlled studies found herbicide did not increase heather cover. One study found herbicide increased plant species richness, while another found no effect on species richness or diversity.\n\n**Cutting alone**: One randomized, controlled, before-and-after trial in Norway and two randomized, controlled studies in the UK found that cutting reduced bracken cover or biomass. One randomized, replicated, controlled study found cutting increased species richness, while another found no change in species richness but increased diversity. Results on heather recovery were mixed, with one study showing increased heather cover/biomass but two others finding no increase in heather cover or seedlings.\n\n**Combination of cutting and herbicide**: Three randomized, controlled studies (including one before-and-after trial) in the UK and Norway found that cutting combined with herbicide reduced bracken biomass or cover. One study found this combination increased heather cover, while another found no effect on heather biomass. One replicated, randomized, controlled study found that cutting followed by herbicide increased plant species richness compared to herbicide followed by cutting.\n\nThe evidence suggests that while all three approaches can reduce bracken abundance, results vary regarding recovery of native heathland vegetation, with combination treatments showing some benefits over single methods in certain contexts.",

In the USA, studies showed more variable results, with one study finding decreased woody plant cover, another showing mixed effects on shrub cover, and some finding no difference in forb cover. In Finland, studies found that fencing did not alter cover of grass species or abundance of herb species.

This approach also resulted in decreased grass cover while allowing woody plant species cover to increase.\n\n**Seed Sowing**: Sowing seeds of shrubland species has proven effective, with five of six studies showing increased shrub cover and seedling abundance. This method also helped restore community composition similar to undisturbed shrublands and increased overall plant diversity.\n\n**Combined Approaches**: Applying herbicide combined with sowing seeds of shrubland plants was found to increase shrub seedlings and native plant species, while also reducing non-native grass cover in some cases.\n\n**Grass Control with Seeding**: Cutting or mowing to control grass while simultaneously sowing shrubland seeds showed positive results, including increased shrub seedling abundance and reduced grass cover.\n\n**Planting Individual Plants**: While evidence is more limited, planting individual shrub plants showed successful establishment with a majority of planted plants surviving after one year.\n\nThese interventions demonstrate that both passive recovery (allowing natural regeneration) and active restoration techniques (seeding, planting, grass control) can be effective for restoring shrubland vegetation following fire events.",

One of three replicated, site comparison studies in Germany\\u00a0and Switzerland\\u00a0found that traditional hay meadows mown once/year in June or July had a higher abundance of heath fritillary adults and caterpillars than old, abandoned meadows. One study found that summer-grazed or mown grasslands had a higher abundance of farmland butterflies and burnet moths, but a lower abundance of woodland butterflies and burnet moths, than abandoned grasslands. The third study found that mown grasslands had a lower abundance of moths than unmown grasslands, but grazed grasslands had a similar abundance of moths to ungrazed grasslands. Two replicated, site comparison studies in China\\u00a0and Switzerland\\u00a0found that semi-natural grasslands managed by grazing\\u00a0or cutting twice/year after mid-June\\u00a0had a lower abundance of marsh fritillary eggs and caterpillars\\u00a0and adult butterflies\\u00a0than ungrazed margins and intercrops\\u00a0or sown wildflower strips. One replicated, site comparison study in Hungary\\u00a0found that semi-natural grasslands managed by either light grazing or mowing once/year in May or June had a higher abundance of butterflies than conventional wheat fields.\\nSurvival (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in China\\u00a0found that marsh fritillary eggs had a similar survival rate in uncultivated, grazed meadows and cultivated, ungrazed field margins and intercrops, but the survival of caterpillars was higher in the grazed meadows.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (5 STUDIES)\\nUse (5 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies in Austria\\u00a0and Germany\\u00a0found that 14 species of moth\\u00a0preferred grazed pastures while 24 others avoided them, and three species of butterfly\\u00a0and ten nocturnal moths\\u00a0preferred mown meadows, while 19 nocturnal moth species avoided them. One replicated, site comparison study in Spain\\u00a0found that meadows managed by summer-grazing or hay-mowing were more likely to be occupied by grizzled skipper and painted lady than unmanaged meadows, but small pearl-bordered fritillary occurred less frequently in grazed meadows than in hay meadows or abandoned meadows. One replicated, site comparison study in Finland and Russia\\u00a0found that three of 37 butterfly species preferred meadows which were mown annually in July or August to cattle-grazed pasture, but the other 34 species showed no preference. One replicated, site comparison study in China\\u00a0found that uncultivated, grazed meadows were less likely to be occupied by marsh fritillary eggs and caterpillars than cultivated field margins and intercrops.\"\n}"

Adding mulch and fertilizer showed limited benefits for shrubland restoration - one randomized controlled study in the USA [1694] found that adding mulch and fertilizer did not increase seedling abundance of seven shrub species and reported no change in grass cover. Similarly, when mulch and fertilizer were added alongside planting/seeding [1707], the same study found it only increased seedling abundance for a minority of shrub species and had no significant effect on grass cover. In contrast, adding manure showed more positive effects - one replicated, randomized, controlled study in South Africa [1695] found that adding manure increased plant cover and the number of plant species. Mixed organic amendments also showed benefits for soil health in agricultural contexts [902], with studies from China, India, and Japan finding higher microbial biomass, increased organic carbon, and greater nutrient levels in soils amended with manure and inorganic fertilizers. Adding organic matter [1250] also showed some benefits, with studies finding increased species richness of young trees and increased total plant cover.",
