    "relevant_summary": "Several actions can enhance fish communities on subtidal artificial structures. Creating large adjoining cavities or 'swimthrough' habitats (>100 mm) on subtidal artificial structures increased overall fish species richness and abundance on and around structure surfaces, and supported fish species that were absent from structures without swimthroughs (action 3456). Creating small adjoining cavities or 'swimthrough' habitats (\u2264100 mm) supported six fish species that were absent from structures without swimthroughs, with mixed effects on juvenile fish community composition, species richness, and abundances depending on site, survey month, species, and juvenile development stage (action 3436). Creating hole habitats (>50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures altered mobile invertebrate and fish community composition, supported mobile invertebrate and fish species that were absent from structures without holes, and in some cases increased species richness and diversity on and around structures (action 3434). Creating long flexible habitats (>50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures supported fish species that were absent from structures without flexible habitats, with mixed effects on fish species richness and abundance depending on fish presence when habitats were created (action 3451). Creating groove habitats (1\u201350 mm) and pit habitats (1\u201350 mm) alongside other habitat features supported fish species that were absent from structures without added features, with mixed effects on fish abundances depending on the species group (actions 3448, 3455). Managing or restricting harvesting of species on subtidal artificial structures resulted in different fish community composition, higher fish species richness, and higher seabream abundances around structures with harvesting restrictions compared to unrestricted structures (action 3457). Transplanting or seeding organisms (such as oysters) onto subtidal artificial structures altered combined invertebrate and fish community composition and increased species richness and diversity on and around structures (action 3471). Ceasing or altering maintenance activities (such as reducing cleaning frequency) increased seahorse abundance on subtidal artificial structures (action 3447).",
