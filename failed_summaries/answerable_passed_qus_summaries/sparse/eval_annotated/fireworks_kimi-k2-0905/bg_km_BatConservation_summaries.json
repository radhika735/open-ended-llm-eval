Installing and maintaining gates at mine entrances to restrict public access has been studied most extensively, with nine studies showing mixed results - while gates can reduce bat collisions with humans and maintain some mine usage, they may also decrease bat abundance and alter behavior, with up to 7% of bats colliding with gates. One study found that maintaining microclimate in closed/abandoned mines by modifying entrances can increase the number of hibernating bats. Other proposed actions include excluding bats from roosts prior to reclamation, retaining bat access points after closure, reopening and modifying closed mine entrances for roosting, relocating bats to alternative subterranean sites, and providing artificial roosts to replace reclaimed mines. However, no studies have evaluated the effectiveness of these latter approaches.\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"1961\",\n    \"1962\",\n    \"1963\",\n    \"1964\",\n    \"1965\",\n    \"975\",\n    \"974\"\n  ]\n}"
