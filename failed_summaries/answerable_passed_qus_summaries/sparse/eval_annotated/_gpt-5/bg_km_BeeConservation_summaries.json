    "relevant_summary": "Across replicated European trials, uncropped margins sown with agricultural nectar\u2013pollen mixes rich in legumes attracted significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated, grassy, or cropped margins, sometimes outperforming perennial wildflower mixes in the first year, but their value declined and required re\u2011sowing every few years [18]. Uncropped margins sown with native wildflower mixes and subsequently mown supported higher bumblebee abundance (and in several trials higher species richness) than cropped, grassy, or naturally regenerated margins; perennial leguminous herbs were important components, and one small trial found long\u2011tongued bumblebees preferred perennial wildflower mixes over annual forage mixes [19]. Naturally regenerated uncropped margins sometimes held more bumblebees than cropped margins, but effects varied between years, often relied on thistles requiring control, and some trials found no increase over cropped margins [20]. Unsprayed conservation headlands did not increase foraging bumblebees and in one trial had fewer bees than naturally regenerated uncropped margins [29]. Evidence for purely grassy field margins was mixed, with some trials showing higher bumblebee abundance and/or diversity and others showing no increase; however, grassy margins attracted higher densities of nest\u2011searching queen bumblebees in spring than several other habitats [14, 12]. Creating uncultivated margins around fields often supported more invertebrates, including bees, than conventionally managed margins, but some studies found lower richness or abundance than sown margins, declines over time, negative impacts of cutting on invertebrates, and increased weeds [63]. Leaving uncropped, cultivated margins or plots delivered wildlife benefits that included increased bumblebees among other taxa, though some studies reported no effects for certain groups and a higher occurrence of pernicious weeds [562].",

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes. In one trial, these introduced species more commonly occupied the boxes than native bees.\\nA small trial tested three soil-filled nest boxes for the mining bee Andrena flavipes in the UK, but they were not occupied.\"\n}"

Diet strongly influenced results: freshly frozen pollen yielded larger, better-surviving queens and larger colonies than dried frozen pollen, and higher-protein pollen increased worker offspring production [50]. An 8L:16D light regime reduced time to egg-laying for artificially reared B. terrestris queens [50]. Hibernation management affected success: 4\u20135\u00b0C for 45 days enhanced egg-laying and colony formation but resulted in smaller colonies, and queens >0.6 g with \u22644 months hibernation had higher survival [50]. After release, seven replicated trials showed variable queen production: two UK trials found very low or zero queens per colony, while two trials reported good numbers of new queens [52]. Social parasitism by cuckoo bees was sometimes high (25\u201366% and 79%), mitigated by placing colonies in intermediate-resource landscapes and later in the season; other trials reported no parasites, and comparisons with natural nests were lacking [52]. Supplementary feeding improved reproductive success in Canada but not parasite load, and did not increase productivity in a USA trial [52].
