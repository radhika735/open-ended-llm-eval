    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from fishery closure studies, long-term and temporary fishery closures show markedly different effects on marine fish abundance. Long-term fishery closures demonstrate mixed but generally more substantial effects on fish populations. According to action 2655, two site comparison studies found higher abundance of only one of seven fish species and lower abundance of monkfish in areas closed to groundfish fisheries for six to eight years compared to open areas. Additionally, one of two replicated before-and-after studies found more young salmon and similar numbers of older salmon returning to rivers in the five years after long-term closure of a commercial coastal fishery, while another study found lesser sandeel biomass and density peaked but showed no overall increase in the three years after a long-term fishery closure.\n\nIn contrast, temporary fishery closures show limited effectiveness for marine fish abundance. Action 2664 reports that one before-and-after, site comparison study found no increase in the biomass of the spawning stock of cod following a temporary fishery closure compared to fished areas over nine years. Similarly, the same study found no change in cod survival or length composition following temporary fishery closure compared to fished areas. However, temporary closures did provide some benefits in terms of fishing effort reduction, with action 3815 showing that move-on rules for temporary closures reduced overall cod discards and fishing effort.\n\nThe evidence suggests that long-term closures are more likely to produce measurable changes in fish abundance, though effects vary by species and are not universally positive. Temporary closures appear to have minimal direct impact on fish abundance but can provide short-term protection and reduction in fishing pressure.",

    "relevant_summary": "The evidence from Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) that prohibit most or all fishing shows mixed but generally positive effects on fish abundance and diversity. \n\n**Fish Abundance Effects:** Marine protected areas prohibiting all fishing had higher abundances of all fish, fishery targeted fish species, and non-fishery targeted fish species compared to unprotected fished areas after up to 25 years or more of protection (Action 2682). Two global systematic reviews found that non-fished marine reserves had higher abundances of all fish compared to fished areas (Action 2682). However, effects varied between individual fish species/groups based on their fished status, position in the food chain, commercial target versus non-target status, fish sizes, depth, and habitat types (Action 2682). Some studies found similar fish abundances between protected and fished areas, particularly in the first 1-20 years after implementation (Action 2682).\n\n**Fish Diversity Effects:** Fourteen of 20 site comparison studies found that marine protected areas prohibiting all fishing for between one to more than 25 years had higher fish species richness compared to fished areas (Action 2682). However, six studies found similar fish species richness between one and 20 years after all fishing was banned compared to fished areas (Action 2682). One systematic review found no difference in species richness between unfished protected areas and fished areas (Action 2682). One study found lower total fish species richness in MPAs closed to all fishing with limited exceptions for up to seven years compared to unprotected areas (Action 2681).\n\n**Fish Size Effects:** Multiple studies and systematic reviews found that prohibiting all fishing in marine protected areas resulted in larger fish overall compared to fished areas, though there were differences between individual fish families or species (Action 2682). Eight of 11 site comparison studies found that non-fished protected areas had larger individuals of all or most fish species/groups monitored compared to fished areas after one to 22 years (Action 2682).\n\n**Community Composition:** Seven site comparison studies found that protected areas where all fishing had been prohibited for between three and 16 years had different fish community composition compared to fished areas (Action 2682). The effects on fish abundance and diversity varied with factors including the age of the protected area, enforcement levels, and the intensity of fishing outside the reserves.",

Eleven of 15 site comparison studies (including replicated, randomized, paired, before-and-after) in the North Atlantic Ocean, the Bristol Channel and the Irish Sea, the Firth of Clyde, the Mediterranean Sea, the North Pacific Ocean, the Florida Keys, the South Pacific Ocean, the Tasman Sea, and the Coral Sea\\u00a0found that inside marine protected areas prohibiting all fishing, the abundances and/or biomasses of lobsters\\u00a0and mud crabs\\u00a0were higher compared to areas where seasonal or unrestricted fishing was allowed, after four to 33 years depending on the study. Four found that they had mixed effects on the abundances of lobster, and crab species, after one to seven years depending on the study.

One also found that the effects on abundance of red sea urchins depended on the age of the protected area and the size of the urchins.\\nEchinoderm condition (1 study): One paired, site comparison study in the South Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found that marine protected areas that had been prohibiting all fishing for over 10 years had heavier Kina sea urchins compared to fished areas.\\nMollusc abundance (10 studies): Four of 10 site comparison studies (including replicated before-and-after, and site comparison) in the North Atlantic Ocean, the North Pacific Ocean\\u00a0the South Pacific Ocean, the Tasman Sea, and the Foveaux Straight\\u00a0found that inside a marine reserve prohibiting all fishing, abundances/biomass of giant clams, adult queen conch, Cook\\u2019s turban snails, rock scallops\\u00a0and green abalone\\u00a0were higher compared to a fished area, after eight to 36 years depending on the study. Six found similar abundances of scallop species, pink abalone, juvenile queen conch, and top shell species, after five to 36 years depending on the study. Three found lower abundances of star limpets after 23 to 25 years\\u00a0and blacklip abalone after 15 to 16 years.

Six studies\\u00a0found similar fish species/richness between one and 20 years after all fishing was banned in protected areas, compared to fished areas. One systematic review in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans\\u00a0found no difference in species richness between unfished protected areas and fished areas. One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that the effects of prohibiting all fishing on fish species richness/diversity after 15 years varied with the sampling method used.\\n\\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (66 STUDIES)\\n\\nAbundance (64 studies): Thirty of 54 site comparison studies (18 replicated, eight replicated and paired, two before-and-after, one paired and before-and-after, and one replicated and before-and-after) in the Indian Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, Pacific Ocean, Tasman Sea, Coral Sea, Philippine Sea, Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and the Sulu Sea, found that marine protected areas that had been prohibiting all fishing for up to 25 years or more, had higher abundances (density and/or biomass) of all fish (total fish biomass, total fish density), fishery targeted fish species, non-fishery targeted fish species\\u00a0and all or most of the individual fish species/groups monitored, except fish densities (all or most)\\u00a0and non-fishery targeted species, compared to unprotected fished areas and/or partly-fished protected areas. The studies also found that in some cases where the total fish biomass or densities were higher in no-fished areas, the effect varied between individual groups of fish based on species family\\u00a0and/or position in the food chain, commercial target and non-target species, fish sizes, depth\\u00a0and habitat types. Eight studies found that inside protected areas prohibiting all fishing there were similar abundances of all fish, and all or most of the individual fish species/groups monitored, compared to fished areas between one and 20 years after implementation. The other sixteen studies\\u00a0found that the effect of prohibiting fishing in protected areas for three to 20 years on fish abundance varied between fish species or groups and on their fished status (fishery target or non-target)\\u00a0and/or position in the food chain. One also found that the effect varied with size or age of the protected areas. Five of six reviews (three systematic) across the world, in the Pacific and/or Atlantic Oceans\\u00a0and in unreported regions\\u00a0found that non-fished marine reserves with one to 27 years of protection had higher abundances of all fish, all fish and invertebrates combined\\u00a0and blue cod\\u00a0compared to fished areas, but there were differences between species/groups and fishing intensity outside reserves. The other review\\u00a0found that fish abundance varied between species in no-take marine reserves between one and 25 years old, and was affected by food chain position, level of exploitation and duration of protection. One replicated study in the Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found a long-term decline in the abundance/presence of eight of 12 shark and ray species inside an established (&gt;15 years) no-fishing protected area, however enforcement was poor. One before-and after, site comparison study in the Pacific Ocean, found no differences in overall fish abundance between a marine reserve closed permanently to fishing for five years and a closed area that was harvested for two years during the same period. One site comparison study in the Coral Sea\\u00a0found that in a no-take zone of an area protected for at least 10 years, fish abundance of four of six fish groups were similar to no-entry and fished zones, but two had lower abundance than the no-entry zone. One replicated, paired, site comparison study in the Tasman Sea\\u00a0found that in a non-fished marine park zone abundance of commercially targeted fish was higher than partly fished zones but lower than unprotected areas after four to eight years.\\nReproductive success (1 study): One site comparison study in the Mediterranean Sea\\u00a0found more eggs of four commercially targeted fish species inside a non-fished marine reserve enforced for three years than in fished areas outside the reserve.\\nSurvival (1 study): One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that prohibiting all fishing in a marine protected area for three years resulted in similar survival of red hind grouper, compared to fished areas.\\nCondition (20 studies): Two global review studies\\u00a0(one systematic) and two systematic reviews in the Pacific Ocean\\u00a0and the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans\\u00a0found that prohibiting all fishing in marine protected areas for one to 27 years resulted in larger fish overall\\u00a0and larger blue cod\\u00a0compared to fished areas, but there were differences between individual fish families or species. Eight of 11 site comparison studies (four replicated, one before-and-after, one paired, and one replicated and paired) in the Tasman Sea, Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, Atlantic Ocean, Java Sea\\u00a0and the Philippine Sea, found that non-fished protected areas had larger fish overall\\u00a0and larger individuals of all or most of the fish species/groups monitored, compared to fished areas, after one to 22 years. The other three studies\\u00a0found similar fish sizes of all or all but one species, compared to fished areas one to 16 years after all fishing was prohibited. Three site comparison studies (one replicated) in the Coral Sea, Caribbean Sea\\u00a0and the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that fish size in protected areas that had not been fished for six to more than 20 years, varied between fish species or food chain groups. One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that red hind grouper were larger, but had similar growth, in an area protected from fishing for three years compared to fished areas. One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that young lemon sharks in areas protected from fishing for 20 years had similar growth rates, but lower condition, than sharks in unprotected fished areas.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)\\u00a0\\n\\nBehaviour change (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in the Pacific and Indian Oceans\\u00a0found that surgeonfish and parrotfish inside established protected areas where fishing was prohibited, showed a similar avoidance response to fishing gears as in fished areas, and this increased with increasing fishing intensity outside the protected areas.

Two other studies\\u00a0found that time spent inside areas closed to all fishing for 20 years\\u00a0and over 30 years, varied between species and with size for three shark species\\u00a0and with size for giant trevally. One replicated study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that most individuals of five fish species remained inside a marine reserve zone closed to fishing over a nine-year period.\\n\\n\\nCatch abundance (2 studies): One of two site comparison studies in the Mediterranean Sea\\u00a0and Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found that commercial fish catch rates in small-scale traditional fisheries were highest closest to a marine reserve closed to all fishing for 22 years, and decreased with increasing distance from the reserve. The other study\\u00a0found that there was no increase in fish catch rates in commercially landed catch in the five years after a no-fishing zone was implemented in a co-managed protected area.\\nStock biomass (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that the stock biomass (the harvested portion of the population) of reef fish species was highest in enforced protected areas closed to all fishing, compared to various other area management regimes.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\nFishing mortality (2 studies): Two site comparison studies in the North Sea\\u00a0and Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found that prohibiting fishing in protected areas resulted in reduced commercial fishing mortality of corkwing wrasse tagged inside non-fished marine reserves compared to fished areas, and that the overall fishing mortality of grey reef sharks tagged inside protected areas was low.\"\n}"

Two global systematic reviews found that non-fished marine reserves had higher abundances of all fish compared to fished areas (Action 2682). However, effects varied between individual fish species/groups based on their fished status, position in the food chain, commercial target versus non-target status, fish sizes, depth, and habitat types (Action 2682).

Two global systematic reviews found that non-fished marine reserves had higher abundances of all fish compared to fished areas (Action 2682). However, effects varied between individual fish species/groups based on their fished status, position in the food chain, commercial target versus non-target status, fish sizes, depth, and habitat types (Action 2682). Some studies found similar fish abundances between protected and fished areas, particularly in the first 1-20 years after implementation (Action 2682).\\n\\n**Fish Diversity Effects:** Fourteen of 20 site comparison studies found that marine protected areas prohibiting all fishing for between one to more than 25 years had higher fish species richness compared to fished areas (Action 2682).
