    "relevant_summary": "Based on 42 individual studies including replicated, controlled and randomized studies from Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Switzerland and the UK (Action 126), the documented benefits of reduced tillage systems on European farms include: increased earthworm biomass, species richness and abundance; greater abundance of some invertebrates other than earthworms; increased numbers of weeds and weed species; higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying date and shorter foraging distances; greater abundance of seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in late winter; and more invertebrate bird food resources (Action 126, 211). Soil benefits include higher soil organic carbon content (Action 906, 1371), increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure (Action 906, 1371), better nutrient retention including nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (Action 1371), increased microbial biomass (Action 1371), reduced soil erosion and runoff (Action 906, 1371), and higher water-stability of soil aggregates (Action 1371). Crop production benefits include higher cereal yields in some comparisons from studies in Egypt, France, Spain and Turkey (Action 1359), higher fruit and vegetable yields in irrigated plots from Italy and USA studies (Action 1359), and improved sunflower seed oil content and fatty acid composition (Action 1359). The documented harms include: negative effects on some invertebrates and earthworms in some studies (Action 126), higher soil compaction in some cases (Action 906), increased greenhouse gas emissions including carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide in some comparisons (Action 1371), lower cereal yields in some studies from Lebanon and Spain (Action 1359), lower legume yields in some comparisons (Action 1359), reduced wheat protein content (Action 1359), and inconsistent effects on bird preferences that decreased over time in some areas (Action 126, 211). Some studies found no effects or mixed results, with outcomes varying by crop type, soil conditions, and specific implementation methods (Action 126, 906, 1359, 1371).",

Thirty-four studies (of which 21 were replicated and controlled and seven also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found some positive effects on earthworms, some invertebrates (other than earthworms), weeds or farmland birds, of reducing tillage compared to conventional management. Positive effects included increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms, greater abundance of some invertebrates other than earthworms, increased numbers of some weeds and/or weed species, higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying date and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields, and greater abundance of some birds - including Eurasian skylark, seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in late winter on non-inversion or conservation tillage. A review found tillage had negative effects on invertebrate numbers and no-till systems had more invertebrate bird food resources.\\nTwenty-six studies (of which 13 replicated and controlled and three also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found reducing tillage had either negative, no effect or no consistent effects on abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates (other than earthworms), earthworm abundance, biomass, or species richness, number of different plant species found as seeds, number of some weed species, mammal abundance, some bird species, and one study found bird preferences for conservation tillage fields decreased over time. Two studies found that crop type affected the number of weeds under different tillage regimes.\\nOne small replicated trial in the UK compared bird numbers under two different forms of reduced tillage, and found more birds from species that make up the \\u2018Farmland Bird Index\\u2019 on broadcast than non-inversion tillage fields.\\nTwo studies looked at the long-term effects of reduced tillage on earthworms (after ten years).

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done. One randomized, replicated study from Portugal found no effect of tillage treatment on yield.\\n\\u00a0\\nSOIL TYPES COVERED: anthrosol, calcareous silt loam, chalky, clay, clay loam, fine sandy loam, loam, loamy-clay, loam - sandy loam, loam \\u2013 silt-loam, loamy sand, loamy silt, non-chalky clay, sandy, sandy clay loam, sandy loam, sandy silt-loam, silt loam, silty, silty-clay, silty clay loam, silty loam.\"\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "Cover crops grown between crop rows (living mulches) and cover crops grown in empty fields (winter cover crops during fallow periods) show distinct differences in their effects. Cover crops between rows increase bacterial numbers and activity, reduce erosion, and show mixed effects on soil organic matter (Action 897). However, they can negatively impact pest regulation, with fewer aphids being parasitized and more aphids found in some comparisons when grown between broccoli plants (Action 1394). In vineyards and orchards, ground cover between rows generally shows similar grape yields compared to bare soil, though two studies found lower grape yields with grass between vine rows (Action 1352).\n\nCover crops in empty fields during winter periods demonstrate more consistent benefits for soil health. They increase soil organic matter in most studies, with one meta-analysis and ten controlled studies showing more organic matter in soils with winter cover crops (Action 1345). These winter cover crops increase nitrogen availability in soils, with ten studies showing more nitrogen compared to soils without them (Action 1345). They enhance microbial biomass, with five studies finding more microbial biomass in soils with cover crops (Action 1345). Winter cover crops also improve water management by reducing nitrate leaching, with four studies showing less nitrate leached from soils with winter cover crops compared to those without (Action 1357). They reduce soil erosion, with two controlled studies finding less erosion compared to fallows or bare soils (Action 1345).\n\nRegarding cash crop yields, winter cover crops show variable effects, with studies finding sometimes higher, sometimes lower, and sometimes no differences in yields compared to plots without cover crops (Action 1351). The choice of cover crop species matters, with eight studies showing higher cash crop yields when legumes were used as winter cover crops compared to non-legumes (Action 1351).",
