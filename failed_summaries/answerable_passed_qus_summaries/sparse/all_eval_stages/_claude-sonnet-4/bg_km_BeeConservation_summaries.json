    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from multiple European trials, the most effective ways to manage uncropped field margins to support bumblebees include: Sowing margins with native wildflower seed mixes, particularly those containing perennial leguminous herbs, which support higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees than cropped field edges, grassy margins, or naturally regenerated margins (Action 19). Agricultural nectar and pollen seed mixes with perennial leguminous flowering plants also attract significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated, grassy, or cropped margins, though their value to bumblebees degrades over time and requires re-sowing every few years (Action 18). Natural regeneration of uncropped margins can support more bumblebees than cropped margins, though the effectiveness is variable year to year and depends on thistle species (Action 20). Grass strips at field margins show mixed results, with some trials showing enhanced abundance and diversity of bumblebees within 6m wide margins (Action 14). Grassy field margins attract nest-searching queen bumblebees in spring at higher densities than cropped margins (Action 12). Agri-environment schemes demonstrate variable effectiveness, with some enhancing bee diversity and abundance while others show no benefits (Action 24). Long-tongued bumblebees particularly benefit from perennial leguminous plants, with common species like Bombus pascuorum and B. hortorum strongly preferring perennial wildflower mixes over annual forage plants (Action 19). Conservation headlands within crops do not attract more foraging bumblebees than conventional fields and are less effective than uncropped margins (Action 29).",

Sowing field margins with native wildflower seed mixes consistently provides greater benefits than natural regeneration - five replicated UK trials showed that wildflower-sown margins support higher abundance of foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated uncropped margins in three trials, with one small trial recording the same number of bee species on both types (Action 19). Agricultural nectar and pollen seed mixes also outperform natural regeneration - four replicated European trials showed that margins sown with perennial leguminous flowering plants attract significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated margins in two trials (Action 18). Natural regeneration shows mixed results - while four replicated UK trials found more bumblebees foraging on naturally regenerated uncropped margins than on cropped margins, one small replicated trial found that neither abundance nor diversity of bumblebees were higher on naturally regenerated margins than on cropped margins (Action 20). The effectiveness of naturally regenerated margins is inconsistent year-to-year and often depends on thistle species considered pernicious weeds (Action 20). Perennial leguminous herbs in seed mixtures are particularly important forage sources for bumblebees, especially for long-tongued species, with common long-tongued bumblebees strongly preferring perennial wildflower seed mixes over annual forage plants (Action 19).

Altering mowing regimes on greenspaces and road verges is beneficial, with studies showing that less frequently mown or unmown urban greenspaces had higher species richness and diversity of pollinators than more frequently mown areas, and unmown public parks and road verges had higher abundance of butterflies than regularly mown areas (Action 3841). Stopping herbicide use on pavements and road verges can help, as restored roadside prairies where herbicide application was restricted had greater species richness and abundance of butterflies than verges with no restrictions on herbicide application (Action 3899). Establishing green infrastructure in urban areas provides some habitat, though green roofs had lower species richness and abundance of butterflies than urban parks, with abundance being higher on older green roofs with more nectar plant species in larger areas (Action 3837). Planting flowers can increase pollinator numbers, with planted flower strips supporting more wild bee species and individuals compared to unplanted strips (Action 1406). Planting hedgerows along field edges provides significant benefits, with five replicated studies from the USA finding more bee species in fields with hedgerows or in hedgerows themselves compared to fields without hedgerows, and more specialist bees in hedgerows compared to field edges without hedgerows (Action 1407). Habitat restoration along watercourses can support similar numbers of bees and bee species as remnant sites (Action 1408). For urban environments specifically, rearing and managing populations of solitary bees shows potential as local populations can increase up to six-fold in one year under management if good conditions and plentiful floral resources are provided (Action 54).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the documented evidence, captive rearing of bumblebees for reintroduction has shown mixed outcomes with several significant challenges. Twenty-two trials from 13 countries have documented captive rearing of bumblebee colonies using various methods including confining mated queens alone, with bumblebee workers, honey bee workers, male bumblebee pupae, or following CO2 anaesthetisation (Action 50). \n\nFor North American declining species, outcomes varied significantly. Two trials successfully induced spring queens of half-black bumblebee B. vagans to rear adults in captivity, and one trial succeeded with queen yellow-banded bumblebees B. terricola and red-belted bumblebees B. rufocinctus. However, all three trials attempting to rear yellow bumblebee B. fervidus failed as queens laid eggs but larvae died before becoming adults, with the same mortality pattern observed for rusty-patched bumblebee and American bumblebee B. pensylvanicus (Action 50).\n\nKey factors affecting success include diet quality, with buff-tailed bumblebee B. terrestris colonies fed freshly frozen pollen producing larger queens with better survival and larger colonies compared to those fed dried, frozen pollen. Higher protein content pollen also increased offspring production (Action 50). Hibernation protocols showed that queens hibernated at 4-5\u00b0C for 45 days had enhanced egg-laying and colony formation rates, though they produced smaller colonies than non-hibernated queens. Queens weighing more than 0.6 g and hibernated for four months or less had better survival chances (Action 50).\n\nFor reintroduction outcomes, seven replicated trials monitored laboratory-reared colony success in the environment. Results were variable - two UK trials produced very low or zero numbers of new queens, while two other trials produced good numbers of new queens (Action 52). A major challenge identified was social parasitism by cuckoo bees Bombus [Psithyrus] species, with highly variable rates ranging from 0% in five trials to 25-66% in Canadian trials and 79% in UK trials. Parasitism was reduced by placing colonies in landscapes with intermediate rather than very high nectar availability and releasing them late rather than early in the season (Action 52).\n\nAdditional challenges include gradual weight decrease in B. terrestris queens over four years of artificial rearing (Action 50), and disease issues such as Nosema bombi infections, for which the antibiotic fumagillin proved ineffective in managed B. occidentalis colonies (Action 42). No evidence was found for the effectiveness of reintroducing laboratory-reared bumblebee queens specifically (Action 51).",

One trial found that over four years of artificial rearing, Bombus terrestris queens gradually decreased in weight.\\nThree trials have tried to rear North American bumblebees now declining or thought to be declining. Two induced spring queens of the half-black bumblebee B. vagans to rear adults in captivity, one trial induced queen yellow-banded bumblebees B. terricola (attempted in all three trials) and red-belted bumblebees B. rufocinctus (only attempted in one trial) to rear adults in captivity. All three trials tried to rear the yellow bumblebee B. fervidus and in all cases the queens laid eggs but the larvae died before becoming adults. One trial found the same pattern for the rusty-patched bumblebee and the American bumblebee B. pensylvanicus. One study reports rearing the large garden bumblebee B. ruderatus, a Biodiversity Action Plan species in the UK.\\nTwo trials have reported laboratory rearing of a pocket-making bumblebee, the Neotropical B. atratus.\\nThree replicated trials demonstrated that the pollen diet of captively reared bumblebees influences reproductive success. In one trial, buff-tailed bumblebee B. terrestris colonies fed on freshly frozen pollen produced larger queens that survived better and produced larger colonies themselves than colonies fed on dried, frozen pollen. Two replicated trials demonstrated that B. terrestris workers can produce more offspring when fed types of pollen with a higher protein content.\\nTwo replicated experiments showed that an artificial light regime of eight hours light, 16 hours darkness, can reduce the time taken for artificially reared queen B. terrestris to lay eggs, relative to rearing in constant darkness.\\nWe have captured two replicated trials examining the effect of different artificial hibernation regimes in B. terrestris. One showed that hibernation of queens at 4-5\\u00b0C for 45 days enhanced egg-laying and colony formation rates, but hibernated queens produced smaller colonies than non-hibernated queens. The second showed that queens should weigh more than 0.6 g (wet weight) and be hibernated for four months or less to have a good chance of surviving.\"\n}"

Two replicated trials in Canada and the UK found high rates (25-66% and 79% respectively).

Five other replicated trials reported no social parasites.

The other trial, in the USA, found supplementary feeding did not increase colony productivity.\\nOne small scale trial in Norway showed that colonies of the buff-tailed bumblebee B. terrestris prefer to forage more than 100 m from their nest sites.\"\n}"
