Additionally, one study in the Democratic Republic Congo found that chasing gorillas and using random noise resulted in the return of gorillas from plantations to areas close to protected forest (Action 1449). In contrast, no evidence was found for the effects of humans chasing primates using bright light to deter crop-raiding on primate populations (Action 1450). Supporting evidence from broader mammal studies shows that loud noises can be effective deterrents, with five of six studies finding that loud noises activated when an animal was in the vicinity reduced or partially reduced crop damage or crop visits by various mammals including elephants and deer (Action 2460).",

Selective logging instead of clear-cutting shows mixed evidence: one site comparison in Sierra Leone found that primate densities were higher in forest logged at low intensity than in forest logged at high intensity, while one site comparison study in Uganda found that primate densities were similar in forest logged at low intensity and forest logged at high intensity. One before-and-after study in Madagascar found that the number of lemurs increased following selective logging (action 1485). For avoiding or minimizing logging of important food tree species for primates, one before-and-after study in Belize found that a black howler monkey population increased over 13 years after trees important for food for the species were preserved, alongside other interventions (action 1494). However, no evidence was found for several proposed mitigation strategies including: using 'set-asides' for primate protection within logging areas (action 1497), incorporating forested corridors or buffers into logged areas (action 1495), implementing small and dispersed logging compartments (action 1487), providing domestic meat to workers of logging companies to reduce hunting (action 1501), and closing non-essential roads as soon as logging operations are complete (action 1496).",
