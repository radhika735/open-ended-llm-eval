    "relevant_summary": "Based on UK studies, leaving uncut strips of rye grass on silage fields shows stronger evidence for wildlife benefits compared to raising mowing height. For uncut strips, two reviews and two replicated controlled trials found benefits to birds including increased numbers, with seed-eating birds particularly preferring rye grass cut once only, though insect-eating birds showed more variable results (Action 132). Two reviews and two replicated controlled studies found that seed-eating birds were more abundant on uncut plots, and that uncut and ungrazed plots supported more seed-eating birds than uncut and grazed plots, though non-seed-eating birds showed less certain responses with some species avoiding uncut rye grass (Action 224). One study found higher ground beetle species diversity in uncut plots in the third year of experimentation (Action 132). In contrast, evidence for raising mowing height is mixed. While a replicated controlled study and review found raised mowing heights benefited Eurasian skylark productivity and were less damaging to amphibians and invertebrates (Action 138), a randomized replicated controlled trial found no effect on numbers of foraging birds or invertebrates (Action 138). Another randomised replicated controlled study found no more foraging birds were attracted to raised mowing height plots compared to shorter grass (Action 222). Additionally, one study found northern lapwing and common starling chicks had greater foraging success in shorter grass (Action 138). A review found that raising mowing height may have increased Eurasian skylark productivity but not sufficiently to maintain local populations (Action 222).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on documented studies from European countries including Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Netherlands, Slovakia, Spain, Switzerland, and the UK, reducing tillage on farmland shows several documented benefits and potential drawbacks.\n\n**Documented Benefits:**\n\n**Soil Health Benefits:** Studies from Spain and Italy found that reduced tillage and no-tillage systems increased soil organic matter content compared to conventional tillage (Action IDs: 1371, 1369, 1370). Reduced tillage also increased nitrogen and phosphorus levels in soils in some comparisons, with Spanish and Italian studies showing more nitrogen in reduced tillage soils (Action IDs: 1371, 1369, 1370). Microbial biomass increased in reduced tillage soils compared to conventional tillage in studies from Italy, Spain and the USA (Action IDs: 1371, 1369).\n\n**Water Benefits:** Studies from Spain and Turkey found that crops used water more efficiently in reduced tillage plots compared to conventional tillage in some comparisons (Action ID: 1386). Spanish studies found more water content in soils with reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage (Action IDs: 1386, 1385). French studies found less water lost through drainage from reduced tillage soils during growing seasons, and less herbicide leaching (Action ID: 1386).\n\n**Biodiversity Benefits:** Studies from nine European countries found positive effects on earthworms, with increased biomass and abundance under reduced tillage (Action ID: 126). Greater abundance of some invertebrates other than earthworms was documented, along with increased numbers of some weeds and weed species (Action ID: 126). Eurasian skylark showed higher nest density, earlier laying dates, and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields, with greater abundance of seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in late winter (Action ID: 126).\n\n**Crop Yield Benefits:** Studies from France, Spain, Turkey and Egypt found higher cereal yields in reduced tillage plots compared to conventional tillage in some comparisons (Action ID: 1359). Italian and USA studies found higher fruit and vegetable yields in reduced tillage plots in some comparisons (Action ID: 1359).\n\n**Potential Drawbacks:**\n\n**Crop Yield Concerns:** Studies from Lebanon and Spain found lower cereal yields in reduced tillage plots compared to conventional tillage (Action ID: 1359). Spanish studies found lower legume yields in reduced tillage plots in some comparisons (Action ID: 1359). Some studies showed lower straw yields in reduced tillage systems (Action ID: 1359).\n\n**Pest Management Issues:** Seven studies from Italy, Lebanon, Spain, Turkey and the USA found more weeds in reduced tillage plots compared to conventional tillage in some or all comparisons (Action ID: 1399). Studies found that weed communities had different compositions in reduced tillage systems (Action ID: 1399).\n\n**Variable Soil Effects:** Some Spanish studies found less nitrogen in reduced tillage soils compared to conventional tillage in certain comparisons (Action IDs: 1371, 1369). Two Spanish studies found less microbial biomass in reduced tillage soils in some comparisons (Action ID: 1371). Spanish studies found mixed results for greenhouse gas emissions, with some finding more carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide in reduced tillage soils (Action IDs: 1371, 1369).\n\n**Mixed Wildlife Effects:** Studies from nine European countries found that reducing tillage had negative effects, no effects, or inconsistent effects on abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates, earthworms, some weed species, mammal abundance, and some bird species (Action ID: 126).",

Thirty-four studies (of which 21 were replicated and controlled and seven also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found some positive effects on earthworms, some invertebrates (other than earthworms), weeds or farmland birds, of reducing tillage compared to conventional management. Positive effects included increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms, greater abundance of some invertebrates other than earthworms, increased numbers of some weeds and/or weed species, higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying date and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields, and greater abundance of some birds - including Eurasian skylark, seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in late winter on non-inversion or conservation tillage. A review found tillage had negative effects on invertebrate numbers and no-till systems had more invertebrate bird food resources.\\nTwenty-six studies (of which 13 replicated and controlled and three also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found reducing tillage had either negative, no effect or no consistent effects on abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates (other than earthworms), earthworm abundance, biomass, or species richness, number of different plant species found as seeds, number of some weed species, mammal abundance, some bird species, and one study found bird preferences for conservation tillage fields decreased over time. Two studies found that crop type affected the number of weeds under different tillage regimes.\\nOne small replicated trial in the UK compared bird numbers under two different forms of reduced tillage, and found more birds from species that make up the \\u2018Farmland Bird Index\\u2019 on broadcast than non-inversion tillage fields.\\nTwo studies looked at the long-term effects of reduced tillage on earthworms (after ten years).

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from European studies, several key management techniques are available to restore or create species-rich wet meadows in agricultural landscapes. Water level management is fundamental, with studies showing that raising water levels in ditches or grassland increases plant species that favour wet conditions and invertebrate numbers (Action 121). Seventeen studies from France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Switzerland and the UK found successful restoration techniques including topsoil removal, introduction of target plant species, raising water levels, grazing, mowing, or a combination of removing topsoil and introducing target plant species, plus livestock exclusion (Action 119). Traditional water meadow management through grazing shows mixed results, with studies indicating that light grazing with cattle or horses maintains butterfly species richness similarly to annual autumn mowing (Action 3971). Cutting and mowing strategies are critical, with studies showing that the timing and frequency of cutting affects vegetation composition - cutting in different seasons (May vs November) produces similar plant species numbers when surveyed in July, though individual species respond differently to seasonal timing (Actions 3066, 3070). Grazing management using cattle or horses can maintain or restore disturbance in freshwater marshes, with studies showing increases in total plant species richness and diversity after resuming grazing, though effects on overall vegetation biomass vary (Action 3050). Studies demonstrate that maintaining traditional water meadows through annual cutting in June maintains relatively stable vegetation, though productivity outcomes for target species vary (Action 696). The restoration success varies with time, with some positive effects achieved within five years, though complete restoration may take longer periods of 5-20 years (Action 119). Species-rich semi-natural grassland maintenance through various cutting regimes and grazing intensities shows that annual mowing in July or August produces similar butterfly species richness to light grazing management (Action 3908).",

    "relevant_summary": "Taking land out of intensive arable production through set-aside or grassland conversion shows mixed effects across different wildlife groups and environmental outcomes. For butterflies and moths, set-aside areas generally provide benefits, with studies showing that sown or naturally regenerating set-aside had greater species richness than cereal fields or pasture, especially when sown with less competitive grasses (Action 3980). Set-aside areas also supported higher abundance of butterflies and day-flying moths compared to cereal fields, particularly in second-year set-aside versus first-year (Action 3980). For bees, set-aside that is annually mown and left to naturally regenerate for two years or more shows higher species richness of nesting and foraging bees relative to other management regimes or arable crop fields (Action 7). \n\nRegarding grassland conversion, restoring arable land to permanent grassland shows positive effects for lepidopterans, with created grasslands and abandoned cropland having greater species richness of butterflies, burnet moths and all moths than conventionally managed grassland or cultivated farms (Action 3929). Grasslands established by sowing grasses, legumes and forbs had higher species richness and abundance of butterflies than grass-only mixes (Action 3929).\n\nHowever, for birds, the evidence shows limited benefits. All five studies looking at reverting arable land to grassland found no clear benefit to birds, and one controlled study showed that grey partridge numbers fell significantly following reversion of arable fields to grassland (Action 210). Similarly, all seven studies examining the effects of converting arable land to grassland found no clear benefit to wildlife including UK birds, wading birds, grey partridges, brown hares, and plants (Action 561).\n\nFor small mammals, effects are mixed. Set-aside areas did not consistently enhance small mammal numbers relative to cropland, though uncultivated field margins showed higher numbers of small mammals, bank voles and brown hares relative to crops in some studies (Action 2365). A systematic review found significantly higher densities of farmland birds on fields under set-aside designation than on conventionally farmed fields in both winter and summer (Action 156).",
