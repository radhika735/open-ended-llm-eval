Chemical control using herbicides, such as glyphosate, has been found to reduce the plant's presence (1279). In one study, a combination of glyphosate and diquat led to a 98% reduction of C. helmsii (1279). Covering the plant with carpet before glyphosate application resulted in an 80% reduction (1279). Application of diquat or diquat alginate has been shown to reduce or eradicate submerged C. helmsii (1279), while other herbicides like dichlobenil, terbutryne, asulam, 2,4-D amine, and dalapon have demonstrated partial to full reductions in biomass or cover (1279). Physical control methods have also been assessed. The use of lightproof barriers, such as black sheeting or carpet strips, has been found to eradicate or severely reduce the cover of C. helmsii, although recolonization was observed at two sites where it had been previously eradicated (1294). Another physical method, the application of salt water, has been shown to eradicate C. helmsii in both container and field trials (1288).",
