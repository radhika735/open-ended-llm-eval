Establishing green infrastructure, such as green roofs, can provide habitat, with older green roofs containing more nectar plant species in larger areas supporting higher butterfly abundance (Action ID: 3837). Protecting greenfield sites or undeveloped land with native forests and grasslands in urban areas has been shown to increase butterfly species richness (Action ID: 3836). Altering mowing regimes on urban greenspaces and road verges to reduce mowing frequency or leave areas unmown increases both species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths, with late summer mowing being more beneficial than mid-summer mowing (Action ID: 3841). Planting parks, gardens and road verges with appropriate native species increases both species richness and abundance of adult butterflies and caterpillars compared to areas with mixed or non-native plant species (Action ID: 3842). Wildlife gardening practices, such as avoiding insecticides and herbicides while maintaining natural features, can increase butterfly abundance (Action ID: 3834).",

Another replicated, controlled study found that moth species richness recovered faster after shelterwood harvesting compared to group selection harvesting or clearcutting. Single tree selection harvesting (a form of selective logging) showed mixed results compared to clearcutting, with similar species richness in one study, but both selective logging and clearcutting had lower species richness than unharvested forests. Group selection harvesting, which involves harvesting small groups of trees, showed similar species richness to clearcutting forests but lower than unharvested forests, and recovery rates were similar to clearcutting but slower than shelterwood harvesting.
