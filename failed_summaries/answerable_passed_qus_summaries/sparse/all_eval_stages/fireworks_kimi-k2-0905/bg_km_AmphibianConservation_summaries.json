    "relevant_summary": "For amphibian conservation in North America, both wetland creation and restoration show positive outcomes for amphibian populations. Based on 17 studies investigating wetland restoration, findings show that 8 of 10 site comparison studies in Canada and the USA found that restored wetlands supported similar amphibian abundance, species numbers, and community composition compared to natural wetlands. Two studies found lower abundance and different species composition in restored wetlands. Seven of nine studies found that restoration increased amphibian species numbers, with breeding populations establishing in some cases. Three studies found restored wetlands were colonized by 3-8 amphibian species.\n\nFor wetland creation, 15 studies showed that 5 of 5 site comparison studies in the USA found created wetlands had similar or higher amphibian species numbers and abundance compared to natural wetlands. Two studies found created wetlands had fewer species or lower abundance. Created wetlands were colonized by 4-15 amphibian species across five studies. A global review found that in 89% of cases, both restored and created wetlands had similar or higher amphibian abundance or species numbers compared to natural wetlands. Both approaches show that outcomes are affected by factors including wetland size, proximity to source ponds, surrounding habitat, wetland age, vegetation, water levels, and fish presence.",

Two replicated, site comparison studies in the USA\\u00a0and Canada\\u00a0reported mixed effects of freshwater marsh restoration/creation on overall algal\\u00a0or plant\\u00a0community composition, depending on the habitat\\u00a0and use of mining waste during creation. Of four replicated, site comparison studies in the USA and Canada, three\\u00a0reported lower quality vegetation in restored/created wetlands than in natural wetlands, but one\\u00a0reported similar vegetation quality in created and natural wetlands.

Seven replicated studies in the USA\\u00a0simply quantified the composition, quality or wetness of the plant community up to 22 years after wetland restoration/creation.\\nOverall richness/diversity (17 studies): Eleven replicated studies, in the USA\\u00a0and Canada, compared overall plant richness/diversity in created/restored and natural/unmanaged freshwater wetlands. Five of the studies\\u00a0found that created/restored wetlands typically had similar plant taxonomic richness to natural/unmanaged wetlands.

Six replicated studies in the USA\\u00a0simply quantified overall plant species richness\\u00a0and/or diversity\\u00a0over 1\\u201316 years after wetland restoration/creation.\\nNative richness/diversity (3 studies): Of two replicated, site comparison studies of freshwater wetlands in the USA, one\\u00a0found that restored/created wetlands contained more native plant species than natural wetlands after 1\\u201311 years. The other\\u00a0found that restored wetlands contained fewer native plant species than natural wetlands after 2\\u20138 years. One replicated study of swamp restoration sites in the USA\\u00a0simply quantified native plant richness over 1\\u20138 years after intervention.\\n\\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\\n\\nOverall abundance (7 studies): Six replicated studies, all in the USA, compared overall vegetation abundance in created/restored and natural wetlands. Four\\u00a0of the studies\\u00a0found that created/restored freshwater wetlands contained less vegetation (cover\\u00a0or biomass) than natural wetlands after 1\\u201318 years. Two of the studies\\u00a0found that created and natural fresh/brackish/saline wetlands contained a similar amount of vegetation (overall cover\\u00a0and density; wetland plant cover) after &gt;1 year. One of these studies\\u00a0reported that restored wetlands had lower vegetation cover than natural marshes \\u2013 but this reflected management goals. One replicated study in the USA\\u00a0simply quantified total vegetation cover and biomass 3\\u201310 years after marsh creation.\\nHerb abundance (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA\\u00a0reported that created wetlands had greater overall cover of herb species, after 7\\u20138 years, than natural wetlands. One replicated study in the USA\\u00a0simply quantified herb biomass in wetland restoration sites after 7\\u201322 years.\\nTree/shrub abundance (1 study): One replicated study in the USA\\u00a0simply quantified the density of woody vegetation in wetland restoration sites after 7\\u201322 years.\\nAlgae/phytoplankton abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA\\u00a0found that \\u226415-year-old restored freshwater marshes contained a similar phytoplankton biomass to natural marshes.\\nIndividual species abundance (9 studies): Nine studies\\u00a0quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species.
