Cutting alone reduced bracken cover or biomass in some UK studies, showed mixed effects in a paired study, and showed no decrease in one controlled study; cutting increased heather cover or biomass in one UK study but did not increase heather cover or heather seedlings in two other UK studies; cutting increased species richness in one UK study, had no effect on richness but increased diversity in another, increased wavy hair-grass and sheep\u2019s fescue, and did not increase gorse or common cow-wheat [1653]. Combining cutting with herbicide reduced bracken biomass or cover in studies that included the UK, had no significant effect on the cover of seven plant species in one randomized, replicated, controlled, paired UK study, and did not alter heather biomass in one randomized, controlled UK study; however, a replicated, randomized, controlled UK study found that cutting followed by herbicide increased plant species richness compared with herbicide followed by cutting [1654].",
