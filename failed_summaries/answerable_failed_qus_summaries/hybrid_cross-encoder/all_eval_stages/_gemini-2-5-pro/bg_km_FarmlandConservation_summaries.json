    "relevant_summary": "Thirty-nine studies from eight European countries have examined the effects of creating uncultivated margins around intensive arable or pasture fields [63]. Nineteen of these studies found that uncultivated margins support more invertebrates, including bees, and/or higher plant diversity or species richness compared to conventionally managed field margins [63]. One study also showed that uncultivated margins supported more species of small mammals than meadows and farmed grasslands [63]. Additionally, four studies reported positive associations between birds and field margins, including the provision of food [63]. A UK review also found that grass margins, including those that regenerated naturally, were beneficial for plants and some invertebrates [63]. However, fifteen studies found that the species richness or abundance of invertebrates and/or plants was lower in margins that regenerated naturally compared to conventionally managed fields or sown margins [63]. Five studies from Ireland and the UK also reported that the species richness of plants and the numbers of invertebrates in naturally regenerated margins declined over time [63]. Furthermore, seven studies noted an increased abundance or biomass of weed species in naturally regenerated margins [63]. In contrast, one study in the UK on retaining unmown field margins found that the activity of pipistrelle bats did not differ between these margins and those on conventional farms [1940].\n\nIn relation to field size, five studies have looked at the impact of reducing field size on butterflies and moths [3974]. Four of these studies found that farms and landscapes with smaller fields had a higher abundance of butterflies and burnet moths than areas with larger fields [3974]. Two of these studies also found a higher species richness of butterflies and burnet moths in areas with smaller fields, while two other studies found a similar species richness [3974]. One study in Germany observed an increase in the species richness of butterflies and burnet moths after field size was reduced by increasing the length of field edges on a farm, along with increasing the area of meadows and field margins [3974].",
