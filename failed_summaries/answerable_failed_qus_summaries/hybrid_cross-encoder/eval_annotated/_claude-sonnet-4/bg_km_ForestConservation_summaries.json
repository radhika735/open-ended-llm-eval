    "relevant_summary": "The evidence shows both fencing and individual tree guards/shelters can be effective for protecting newly planted trees from herbivores, but with varying results. For fencing to exclude large herbivores, five of ten studies found that using wire fencing increased the cover and size of understory plants, while six studies found no effect (Action 1230). Specifically for tree protection, two of three studies examining wire fencing effects on young trees found increased biomass in one case and decreased density in another, with one study showing mixed effects depending on species (Action 1230). Two replicated controlled studies found that wire fencing increased tree density (Action 1230). For fencing after tree planting, four of five studies found that using fences to exclude grazing increased survival, size and cover of planted trees, while two studies found no effect on survival rate and one found mixed effects depending on fence structure (Action 1254). For individual tree guards and shelters, one study found that light-colored but not dark-colored plastic tree shelters increased survival rates of planted tree seedlings, and tree guards increased tree height after 37 but not 44 months (Action 1268). In freshwater wetlands, fencing to exclude deer had no significant effect on total tree seedling density after three years but resulted in taller tree seedlings compared to unfenced plots (Action 3330). Plastic guards increased both height and diameter growth rates of planted baldcypress seedlings over one growing season (Action 3330). In coastal wetlands, full-length plastic shelters increased survival rates and growth of red mangrove propagules compared to no shelter, while bamboo shelters and below-ground plastic shelters had no clear effect (Action 3331).",

Five studies in Canada, USA, France, Panama and Sweden found no effect of controlling understory vegetation on emergence, survival, growth rate or frost damage in planted seedlings, though one found removing competing herbs increased seedling biomass (Action 1256). One controlled study in Canada found that removal of sheep laurel shrubs increased growth rate and height of planted black spruce seedlings (Action 1256). One study in Ghana found that removal of invasive weed species increased tree seedling height (Action 1228).\n\nRegarding forest biodiversity effects, vegetation removal combined with mechanical soil disturbance increased cover and diversity of understory plants in Portugal and France, while decreasing understory shrub cover (Action 1274). However, mechanical removal of invasive plants showed mixed biodiversity effects: one study in Hawaii found increased understory plant biomass following invasive grass removal, while one USA study found no effect of invasive shrub removal on understory plant diversity (Action 1228).\n\nTree thinning, which affects vegetation dynamics, generally promotes understory biodiversity: seventeen of 25 studies found that thinning trees increased density and cover of understory plants, and thirteen of 19 studies found increased species richness and diversity of understory plants (Action 1211). Similarly, logging trees in forests increased understory plant density and cover in five of ten studies, and increased species richness and diversity in four of seven studies (Action 1273).\n\nFor mammal biodiversity, one study in Chile found that areas retaining understorey vegetation had more species and visits from medium-sized mammals compared to areas cleared of understorey vegetation (Action 2645).",

    "relevant_summary": "Several interventions are available to improve soil conditions and enhance tree growth in degraded forest areas. Ground preparation before tree planting increases survival and growth rates of planted trees according to six of seven studies (Action ID: 1263). Soil scarification or ploughing enhances germination, with two of three studies finding increased density of young trees, though effects vary by species (Action ID: 1251). Soil disturbance techniques (excluding scarification) have been used to enhance germination (Action ID: 1252).\n\nFertilizer applications show mixed results for tree growth enhancement. Applying fertilizer after tree planting increased tree size in two studies, though three other studies found no effect on tree size, survival rate or health (Action ID: 1260). General fertilizer use increased total plant cover, understory plant biomass, and size of young trees in six of eight studies (Action ID: 1248). Adding fertilizer alongside planting/seeding increased cover of shrubs and trees and vegetation biomass (Action ID: 1704).\n\nOrganic matter amendments provide soil improvement options. Adding organic matter such as leaf litter increased species richness of young trees in one study and increased total plant cover (Action ID: 1250). Mixed organic and inorganic soil amendments showed positive results, with studies finding higher microbial biomass and activity, increased soil organic carbon content, and improved soil structure (Action ID: 902).\n\nBiological soil amendments offer additional benefits. Soil inoculation with bacteria or fungi resulted in higher microbial diversity, increased soil organic matter content, and higher crop yields (Action ID: 888). Mycorrhizal inoculation before seeding/planting can increase vegetation cover initially and enhance abundance of target conservation species (Action ID: 3429).\n\nCombined vegetation removal with mechanical soil disturbance increased cover and diversity of understory plants and increased density of young trees (Action ID: 1274). However, soil enhancers excluding fertilizer showed mixed effects on tree seedling survival and height with no effect on seedling health (Action ID: 1153).",

    "relevant_summary": "The evidence regarding the effectiveness of managing public access and tourism to mitigate human disturbance in forests is extremely limited. Most management interventions have no direct scientific evidence supporting their effectiveness. Action 2330 provides the only substantive evidence, showing that excluding or limiting visitor numbers to protected areas resulted in higher populations of medium-sized and large mammals compared to unrestricted access areas, fewer bears being killed to protect humans, and increased use of protected areas by grizzly bears and leopards. Action 312 found that fewer birds, but not fewer species, were observed as visitor numbers increased in Spanish forests, with effects largely due to decreases in collared dove and serin abundance. Action 311 showed that two wader species nested closer to or at higher densities near a path following resurfacing that resulted in fewer people leaving the path. Action 1619 found that closing paths in Australian alpine shrubland did not alter shrub cover but increased plant species numbers. For most other interventions including creating managed paths/signs to contain disturbance (Action 1170), re-routing paths or controlling access (Action 1171), restricting pedestrian access (Action 3022), installing boardwalks to prevent trampling (Action 3024), adopting ecotourism principles (Action 3025), providing paths to limit disturbance to mammals (Action 2337), voluntary agreements with locals (Action 2339), limiting recreational access (Action 2152), and restricting recreational activities to particular areas (Action 3850), no studies were found that evaluated their effectiveness.",

Studies on preventing livestock grazing were conducted in Brazil, UK, Costa Rica, and Israel, with two of three studies finding increased survival, species richness and diversity of understory plants in Brazil, UK and Costa Rica, while the Israeli study showed increased density of oak seedlings and saplings (Action 1206). For shortening grazing periods, effectiveness varied by location: a study in Spain found increased abundance and size of regenerating oak trees, while an Australian study found no effect on native plant species richness, and a UK study found higher tree seedling numbers following summer compared to winter grazing (Action 1208). Studies using wire fences to exclude livestock from specific forest sections spanned Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Israel, New Zealand, Spain, West Africa and the USA, with four of eight studies finding increased biomass, species richness, density and cover of understory plants, while four showed mixed or no effects. Tree regeneration studies in Mexico, Kenya, Israel and Panama showed three of four studies finding increased size and density of regenerating trees when livestock were excluded (Action 1205). Modified grazing regimes in forest, open woodland and savanna showed mixed results across six studies in Australia and one in the USA, with varying effects on reptile diversity and abundance (Action 3492). Livestock exclusion from semi-natural habitats including woodlands showed generally positive effects across six studies in the USA, two in Spain, and one in Australia, with most studies finding higher small mammal abundances when livestock were excluded (Action 2407).",

Shelterwood harvesting is an effective technique that resulted in higher plant diversity, lower grass cover and higher density of tree species compared with clearcutting (Action 1214), and six of seven studies found it increased abundance, species richness and diversity of understory plants, as well as the growth and survival rate of young trees (Action 1223). Group-selection harvesting showed mixed results, with four of eight studies finding it increased cover and diversity of understory plants and the density of young trees, while two studies found it decreased understory species richness and biomass (Action 1224). \n\nTree thinning is another effective technique where seventeen of 25 studies found that thinning trees in forests increased the density and cover of understory plants, and thirteen of 19 studies found it increased species richness and diversity of understory plants (Action 1211). Thinning by girdling (cutting rings around tree trunks) increased understory plant species richness, diversity and cover (Action 1226). General logging and tree removal within forests showed more variable effects, with five of ten studies finding it increased the density and cover of understory plants, and four of seven studies finding it increased species richness and diversity of understory plants (Action 1273).\n\nSelective or reduced impact logging had different effects on wildlife, with one review of 41 studies finding that reduced impact logging had a smaller effect on bat abundance than conventional logging (Action 989). Thinning within forests also benefited other wildlife, with five of six studies finding higher overall bat activity in thinned or thinned and burned forest than unthinned forest (Action 991), and four studies finding that coniferous woodland thinned with prescribed burning, mulching or nearby felling had greater species richness of butterflies than unmanaged woodland (Action 3940).",

Group-selection harvesting showed mixed results, with four of eight studies finding it increased cover and diversity of understory plants and the density of young trees, while two studies found it decreased understory species richness and biomass (Action 1224). \\n\\nTree thinning is another effective technique where seventeen of 25 studies found that thinning trees in forests increased the density and cover of understory plants, and thirteen of 19 studies found it increased species richness and diversity of understory plants (Action 1211). Thinning by girdling (cutting rings around tree trunks) increased understory plant species richness, diversity and cover (Action 1226). General logging and tree removal within forests showed more variable effects, with five of ten studies finding it increased the density and cover of understory plants, and four of seven studies finding it increased species richness and diversity of understory plants (Action 1273).\\n\\nSelective or reduced impact logging had different effects on wildlife, with one review of 41 studies finding that reduced impact logging had a smaller effect on bat abundance than conventional logging (Action 989). Thinning within forests also benefited other wildlife, with five of six studies finding higher overall bat activity in thinned or thinned and burned forest than unthinned forest (Action 991), and four studies finding that coniferous woodland thinned with prescribed burning, mulching or nearby felling had greater species richness of butterflies than unmanaged woodland (Action 3940).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"1214\",\n    \"1223\",\n    \"1224\",\n    \"1211\",\n    \"1226\",\n    \"1273\",\n    \"989\",\n    \"991\",\n    \"3940\"\n  ]\n}"
