    "question": "What are the effects on butterfly and moth communities of opening up forest canopies through clearing, coppicing, or thinning?",
    "answer": "Opening up forest canopies has shown varied effects. Clearing patches in forests was found to increase butterfly species richness and abundance, but could lower moth species richness (3938). Similarly, thinning trees (often combined with other management like prescribed burning) increased both species richness and abundance of butterflies in coniferous woodland (3940). Coppicing woodland also increased the species richness and abundance of some butterflies, like the heath fritillary, but studies found it could lower the richness and abundance of macro-moths when compared to mature forest (3939).",

    "question": "How does rotational burning compare to leaving unburned patches during prescribed fires for butterfly populations in US prairies?",
    "answer": "Evidence from US prairies suggests that leaving unburned patches during prescribed fires may be more consistently beneficial than rotational burning. Leaving unburned areas was found to increase the abundance of Karner blue butterflies and was beneficial for six out of nine specialist butterfly species (3879). In contrast, rotational burning had mixed effects; while some species like the regal fritillary could have higher abundance, the abundance of prairie specialists was often higher in areas that had not been burned for several years, and some grass-skipper populations showed stronger declines in rotationally burned sites compared to unmanaged areas (3883).",

    "answer": "Several modifications to artificial lighting can reduce its negative impact on moths. Studies found that using 'warmer' colored lights, such as red or yellow, attracted fewer moths than conventional, UV, or blue lights (3906). Reducing light intensity also proved effective, with low-intensity lights attracting fewer moths than high-intensity ones (3902). Additionally, using shielded \"full cut-off\" lights, which prevent light from scattering upwards and outwards, was shown to attract fewer individual moths and species compared to conventional unshielded lights (3904).",

While some re-establishment projects have been successful, with populations persisting for over 28 years after translocation outside the native range (3911) or release of captive-bred individuals (3914), failure is also common. Reviews across the UK and Ireland found that only 8% of translocated and captive-bred butterfly populations were known to have survived for more than 10 years, with 38% dying out within three years (3909, 3914). Some translocated populations died out within a year (3911), while others required repeated supplementation to survive (3909, 3914).",

Forests managed by shelterwood harvesting or thinning had higher or similar moth species richness to clearcut areas, and in one study moth richness recovered faster after shelterwood harvesting than clearcutting (3871, 3868). In contrast, forests harvested by single tree selection or group selection had a similar species richness of moths to clearcut forests, but all had lower richness than unharvested forest (3867, 3868).",

    "question": "How do different methods of creating field margins in European farmland, such as uncultivated strips versus sown wildflower strips, compare in their effectiveness for butterfly communities?",
    "answer": "Studies in Europe found that sown wildflower strips generally had a higher species richness and abundance of butterflies than uncultivated margins (3932). Specifically, six out of seven studies found that butterfly and moth abundance was lower in uncultivated margins than in margins sown with wildflowers or grasses and forbs. However, one study found uncultivated margins had higher butterfly and moth abundance than sown fallow plots (3981).",

    "question": "What are the observed effects of ceasing grassland management, either by stopping mowing or grazing, on butterfly abundance and diversity?",
    "answer": "Ceasing grazing on grassland has shown mixed effects. Six of nine studies found that abandoned grasslands had similar or lower butterfly species richness compared to grazed grasslands, while three found higher richness (3956). For abundance, results were also varied, with some studies showing increases, some decreases, and some no change after grazing ceased. Some studies noted that grassland species declined while woodland species increased (3956). Similarly, ceasing mowing showed mixed results. Five of seven studies found abandoned grasslands had similar or lower butterfly species richness than mown grasslands (3957). Abundance results were also inconsistent, with some studies reporting increases, some decreases, and some mixed effects depending on the butterfly species after mowing was stopped (3957).",

    "question": "What are the alternatives to using prescribed fire for maintaining disturbance in forest habitats for the benefit of butterflies and moths?",
    "answer": "Several mechanical alternatives to prescribed burning exist for creating open habitats within forests. Clearing or opening patches in forests has been shown to increase the abundance of several butterfly species, including the high brown fritillary and small pearl-bordered fritillary (3938). Coppicing woodland, a traditional management technique, also increases the abundance of butterflies like the heath fritillary compared to unmanaged woodland (3939). Thinning trees within forests, which reduces tree density, has been found in several US and Finnish studies to increase the species richness and abundance of butterflies compared to unmanaged woodland (3940). For comparison, prescribed burning in forests has also been shown to increase butterfly species richness and abundance (3877).",

    "question": "What is the state of the evidence regarding the success of restoring habitats after mining and quarrying activities for butterfly and moth conservation?",
    "answer": "Evidence on restoring former mining and quarrying sites is limited to four studies with mixed results. Two studies in the Czech Republic found that quarries left to restore naturally or unflattened spoil heaps had higher species richness of butterflies and moths than sites that underwent 'technical reclamation' with surface flattening (3862). For restoration actions, a study in New Zealand found a restored peat bog supported a similar density of Fred the thread moth caterpillars to undisturbed bogs, while a UK study found fertilizer application on slate waste tips did not affect caterpillar abundance on trees (3862). There is no evidence for the specific action of protecting or restoring brownfield sites (3835).",

For clearing patches, one study found the species richness of butterflies declined over the first three years after clearing, while another found heath fritillary abundance was greatest in patches cleared 2\u20134 years ago compared to more recent or older clearings (3938). For coppicing, butterfly abundance was found to be higher in woodland coppiced two years ago than in woodland coppiced over 15 years ago. Another study found higher butterfly and moth abundance in woodland coppiced 2-7 years ago compared to older coppice (3939).",

    "question": "What are the most effective methods for reducing grazing intensity on grasslands to benefit butterfly populations?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests that both reducing stocking density and the seasonal removal of livestock can benefit butterfly populations. Eight replicated studies found that grasslands grazed with lower stocking densities of sheep or cattle had a greater abundance of butterflies and moths than grasslands grazed at higher densities (3959). Similarly, three controlled studies in the UK found that removing cattle or sheep from grasslands during the summer or winter resulted in a higher abundance of butterflies and caterpillars than year-round grazing (3960). However, some studies for both methods found no significant difference in abundance compared to more intensive grazing, indicating that effectiveness can vary (3959, 3960).",
