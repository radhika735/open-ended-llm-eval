    "answer": "Both interventions are rated as a 'Trade off between benefit and harms'. At aquaculture systems, four of six studies found that acoustic devices reduced predation on caged salmon by seals and sea lions (2775). For wild fisheries, acoustic devices on fishing gear were found to reduce damage to fish catches and/or nets in five of six studies (2808). While effective for reducing conflict, both interventions carry the risk of causing hearing damage or excluding mammals from important habitats.",

    "answer": "Implementing regulations for mammal watching tours is rated as 'Likely to be beneficial'. Studies found that when whale-watching vessels followed approach regulations, sperm whales, humpback whale pods, and Guiana dolphins were less likely to change their behaviour or avoid vessels (2838). Similarly, training tourist guides is rated as 'Unknown effectiveness', with one study finding that fewer harbour seals were disturbed during kayak excursions after guides received training (2840). No studies were found that evaluated the effects of general regulations for operating vessels around mammals outside of a tour context (2758).",

    "question": "What are the demonstrated benefits of prohibiting the hunting of marine mammals?",
    "answer": "Prohibiting the hunting of marine and freshwater mammal species is rated as 'Beneficial'. Evidence shows positive impacts on population abundance. Four out of five studies found that after hunting was prohibited, populations of harbour seals and humpback whales increased over 7-30 years. Additionally, a review found significant population increase rates for 10 of 12 baleen whale populations following the introduction of legislation to prohibit hunting (2780).",

    "question": "For shark control programs in Australia and South Africa, what is the evidence for alternative methods to nets that reduce harm to marine mammals?",
    "answer": "Using baited lines instead of nets for shark control is rated as 'Likely to be beneficial' for reducing harm to marine mammals. Site comparison studies in the Indian Ocean (South Africa) and South Pacific Ocean (Australia) found that baited lines resulted in fewer entanglements of dolphins, whales, and dugongs compared to nets. One of these studies also found that the switch to baited lines increased the survival of entangled common and bottlenose dolphins (2856).",

    "question": "Based on the available evidence, what are the most beneficial actions for reducing human-wildlife conflict at wild fisheries?",
    "answer": "The most beneficial actions found to reduce human-wildlife conflict at wild fisheries are physical modifications to fishing gear. Using catch and hook protection devices (2821) and modifying fishing pots and traps to exclude mammals (2822) are both rated 'Likely to be beneficial'. Studies found these methods reduced damage to fish catches by whales and seals, and reduced the number of seals entering or getting trapped in pots. Other interventions have less certain outcomes. For example, using acoustic devices on fishing gear (2808) has a 'Trade off' rating, as five of six studies found they reduced damage to catches, but they can have wider negative impacts. Several other methods, such as using acoustically reflective objects (2806), predator calls (2817), or switching off lights (2825) were found to be ineffective or had unknown effectiveness.",
