    "question": "What methods are available to control disease and sea lice in Atlantic salmon farms?",
    "answer": "Several non-chemical methods to control disease and parasites have been studied. Fallowing farm sites was associated with lower sea lice numbers in a Scottish study (1026). Biological controls, such as using cleaner wrasse, were found to be as effective as chemical treatments for lice in one study, though another found them ineffective (738). Altering environmental conditions, such as using low-intensity lighting, also resulted in lower numbers of lice in a Norwegian study (741). Additionally, dietary changes, such as feeding salmon a probiotic, increased survival when exposed to disease-causing bacteria (732).",

Six studies found that including plant-based proteins in feed led to decreased salmon growth rates (924). In contrast, the evidence for bacterial protein is mixed; two studies found similar growth rates when replacing up to 25% of fish meal with bacterial protein, while another reported higher growth rates in salmon fed diets containing 18% and 36% bacterial protein compared to a fish meal control (918).",

    "answer": "Multiple interventions have been shown to increase survival rates against disease. Vaccinations resulted in higher survival in salmon exposed to various bacteria in studies across Iceland, Norway, Australia, and Canada (733). Selectively breeding salmon for high resistance to infectious pancreatic necrosis led to increased survival levels compared to a low-resistance family in a Norwegian study (735). In another study, salmon that underwent aerobic training also showed higher survival rates when exposed to the same disease (740). Furthermore, feeding salmon a probiotic before exposure to four different bacteria also increased survival (732).",

Several studies found negative impacts on growth, with decreased growth rates and reduced final body weights compared to fish meal diets (924). However, other studies found similar growth rates between the two diet types (924). Conversely, a study in Norway found a positive side effect where a diet with 28% plant-based protein reduced the number of salmon infected with lice (732). Other documented effects include altered morphology of the salmon's distal intestine, though survival rates were not affected (924).",
