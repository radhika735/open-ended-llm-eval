    "answer": "Several strategies are effective for reducing stereotypic behaviours. Providing bones was found to decrease these behaviours in lions and tigers (1902). Presenting food frozen in ice also decreased abnormal or stereotypic behaviours in bears and felids (1923). Similarly, hiding food reduced stereotypic pacing in leopard cats and black bears (1915), and presenting food inside objects decreased stereotypic behaviours in sloth and spectacled bears (1924).",

    "answer": "Several alternatives to standard commercial diets have been studied. For cheetahs, feeding whole rabbit resulted in lower blood protein urea compared to supplemented beef (1901). For maned wolves, a plant-derived protein diet showed increased digestible energy and dry matter digestibility compared to an animal-based protein diet (1903). Additionally, supplementing an animal-protein diet with taurine was found to increase plasma taurine levels in maned wolves (1908), addressing a potential deficiency.",

    "question": "What are the observed behavioural outcomes of providing live prey to captive primates and carnivores?",
    "answer": "Providing live prey generally encourages more natural behaviours. For primates, providing live insects reduced inactivity and increased foraging in captive loris to levels seen in the wild (1333). For carnivores, providing live fish increased hunting behaviour in fishing cats, although it did not change stereotypic behaviours in tigers (1925). Providing live invertebrate prey increased explorative behaviours in fennec foxes (1926).",
