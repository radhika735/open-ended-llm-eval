    "question": "What are some effective non-chemical alternatives for managing invasive water primrose in European wetlands?",
    "answer": "Effective non-chemical alternatives to herbicides (1139) include biological control and combination treatments. A controlled field study found that a flea beetle caused heavy destruction to water primrose seedlings and significantly reduced its abundance (1135). Additionally, combining physical removal with herbicide application was found to be effective, achieving a 75% kill rate in one study and an 85-90% reduction in another (1140). In contrast, physical removal by itself, such as hand pulling and raking, failed to reduce water primrose abundance in one study and is rated 'Unlikely to be beneficial' (1138).",

    "question": "What is the evidence for the effectiveness of altering water properties like salinity or temperature to control invasive Asian clams and Ponto-Caspian gammarids?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests that altering water salinity and temperature can be effective for controlling both groups. For Asian clams, a laboratory study found that exposure to high salinities of 18-34 parts per thousand resulted in 100% mortality, making this action 'Beneficial' (1115). Similarly, another lab study found that water temperatures of 36°C or higher killed Asian clams, and this action is rated 'Likely to be beneficial' (1116). For invasive Ponto-Caspian gammarids (shrimp), a study found that increasing salinity killed the majority of shrimp within five hours (1091), and another found that heating water to over 43°C killed all shrimp immediately (1092); both actions are considered 'Likely to be beneficial'.",

    "answer": "Instead of biocides, netting has been shown to be a likely beneficial alternative for controlling bullheads in shallow ponds. A study in Belgium found that using double fyke nets significantly reduced the population of brown bullhead measuring over 8cm (1051). Other methods like introducing native predators, draining the waterbody, or electrofishing have not been assessed, as no evidence was found for their effectiveness on bullhead populations (1053, 1078, 1079).",

    "question": "For controlling Crassula helmsii in the UK, what are the most and least effective non-physical control methods documented?",
    "answer": "Based on UK studies, the most effective non-physical methods appear to be chemical herbicides and salt water. Seven studies found glyphosate reduced C. helmsii, and diquat was also found to be effective on submerged plants (1279). Two container trials and two field trials found that seawater eradicated the plant (1288). Conversely, methods rated as unlikely to be beneficial include hydrogen peroxide, which did not control the plant in tank trials (1281), hot foam, which had no effect in one controlled study (1286), and aquatic dyes, which also did not reduce coverage (1293).",

A study in Spain showed that fat-coated particles called BioBullets could achieve 100% mortality within pipes (1118). Additionally, mechanical removal and regular cleaning of industrial pipes, or adding a sand filter, were found to be effective management methods in a Portuguese study (1119). Suction dredging is another mechanical removal option (1120).",

    "question": "What factors, such as herbicide type or the use of adjuvants, influence the success of chemical control for invasive aquatic plants like water primrose and parrot's feather?",
    "answer": "The success of herbicide treatments is influenced by both the type of chemical used and the addition of adjuvants. For water primrose, one study found glyphosate caused 100% mortality when combined with the adjuvant TopFilm, but only 97% with a non-oil-based sticker (1139). For parrot's feather, studies show varying effectiveness between different herbicides; for example, one study found 2,4-D was more effective than diquat, glyphosate, or imazapyr (1606), while another found triclopyr was more effective than glyphosate (1689). The specific chemical is a key factor, with studies finding that herbicides like 2,4-D (1606) and triclopyr (1689) reduce parrot's feather growth, while fluridone and copper chelate did not (1699).",
