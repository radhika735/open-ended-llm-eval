    "answer": "The evidence suggests creating new ponds is a beneficial action, with numerous studies showing amphibians readily colonize and establish breeding populations in them (869). Managing existing ditches can also be likely to be beneficial, as one study found that ditches under agri-environment schemes had significantly higher amphibian abundance and species numbers (749). Paying farmers to implement conservation measures, which can include creating breeding habitat, has also proven likely to be beneficial for increasing frog and toad populations (818). In contrast, excluding livestock with fencing is rated as likely to be ineffective or harmful, as some studies found higher amphibian abundance with grazing (746).",

Artificial hibernacula can be created, and have been found to maintain populations of great crested newts and be used by other newts and frogs (759). Refuges can also be created by adding coarse woody debris to forest floors, which had mixed effects on individual species abundance, or by creating other artificial refugia which were used by translocated frogs and hellbenders (772). In harvested forests, leaving piles of coarse woody debris provided shelter where juvenile amphibian survival was significantly higher than in open areas (843).",

For frogs, breeding is often successful, with many studies reporting egg production and successful rearing, though some species are difficult to maintain (835). Toads also generally breed successfully in captivity, with success influenced by environmental factors like humidity, though high mortality can occur after hatching (848, 836). Salamanders have been bred successfully, with outcomes dependent on tank habitat (838). While species like the Mallorcan midwife toad have been bred with high survival rates, long-term captive breeding can lead to negative genetic and developmental effects (837).",

Successful colonization and breeding are affected by a pond's physical characteristics, including its age, whether it is permanent or ephemeral, and the extent of its vegetation cover (869). The presence of predatory fish is a major negative factor (869). Success is also strongly linked to the surrounding landscape, particularly the distance to existing ponds that can act as source populations for colonization (869). Additionally, biotic factors within the new pond can play a role; one study on natterjack toads found that while created ponds reduced mortality from desiccation compared to natural ponds, they had higher tadpole mortality from invertebrate predation (866).",

    "question": "What are the documented benefits and negative impacts of using chemical treatments for amphibian conservation?",
    "answer": "Chemical treatments show a trade-off between benefits and harms. For habitat management, adding lime to reduce acidification established a toad population in one study but caused tadpole mortality in another (748). Using the piscicide rotenone to control fish increased amphibian abundance and recruitment but also caused frog deaths and negative effects in newts (828). For disease control, antifungal treatments like itraconazole can cure chytridiomycosis but some fungicides have caused death or other negative side effects (882). Using herbicides to control understory vegetation had no or negative effects on amphibian abundance (778).",

    "question": "As an alternative to treating infected individuals, what environmental management actions can help control chytridiomycosis in the wild?",
    "answer": "Several environmental interventions have been studied, though with unknown effectiveness. One study found that adding salt to a pond kept a frog population free of chytridiomycosis for at least six months (762). Another approach is to remove the fungus from ponds directly; one study found that pond drying combined with fungicidal treatment of toads reduced infection levels but did not eradicate the disease (766). Additionally, taking preventative measures such as sterilizing equipment between sites is recommended to reduce the risk of spreading the disease, although direct evidence of its effect on amphibian populations is lacking (768).",
