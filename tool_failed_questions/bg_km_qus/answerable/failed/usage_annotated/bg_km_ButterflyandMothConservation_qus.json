    "question": "What are the most effective management practices on farmland for increasing butterfly and moth abundance?",
    "answer": "Several practices on farmland have been shown to increase butterfly and moth abundance. Converting to organic farming generally resulted in greater abundance of butterflies and moths compared to conventional farms (3907). On a landscape scale, farms with a greater proportion of semi-natural habitat (3910) or with smaller fields (3974) had higher butterfly abundance. At the field level, planting nectar flower mixtures or wildflower strips (3932) and creating floristically enhanced grass margins (3982) were found to increase butterfly abundance more than unenhanced grass margins or cropped areas.",

    "question": "What are the alternative management strategies to prescribed burning for maintaining open grassland habitats for butterflies?",
    "answer": "Alternatives to prescribed burning for maintaining open grasslands include mowing and grazing, though their effects vary. Mowing regimes can be altered; for example, one study found mowing in November did not reduce moth caterpillar abundance, unlike August mowing (3945). Grazing is another key alternative. Employing rough grazing on semi-natural habitats like fens and dunes was found to increase the abundance of some butterfly species, such as the large copper (3944). However, completely ceasing management is also an option; abandoning grazing can benefit some species but may lead to a decline in grassland specialists as succession progresses (3956). Similarly, ceasing mowing can lead to higher abundance of some butterflies, but lower abundance of others (3957).",

    "answer": "Improving habitat connectivity provides several benefits for butterfly populations. Restoring connectivity between habitat patches has been found to increase the abundance of multiple species, including Karner blue, marsh fritillary, and regal fritillary (3934). It also encourages movement, with studies showing common buckeye and variegated fritillary butterflies were more likely to move between connected patches (3934). Retaining existing connectivity is also important, as it helped Alcon large blue populations persist in low-quality habitat patches and encouraged common buckeye butterflies to colonize more distant patches (3832).",

Studies found that less intensively managed grasslands had a higher abundance of butterflies and moths compared to conventionally managed ones (3958). Specifically, reducing grazing intensity by lowering stocking densities of sheep or cattle (3959), or by removing livestock seasonally (3960), has been shown to increase the abundance of butterflies and caterpillars. Creating grass margins, particularly those floristically enhanced with wildflowers, also increases butterfly abundance compared to cropped field edges or standard grass margins (3982).",

Converting to organic farming, which excludes synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, has been found in seven of eleven studies to result in greater species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths compared to conventional farms (3907). Even without full conversion, generally reducing the use of pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers leads to greater species richness and abundance (3897). More targeted actions are also effective; leaving field headlands unsprayed with herbicides and insecticides resulted in greater butterfly richness and abundance in four of five studies (3898), and restricting specific herbicides like glyphosate also led to higher butterfly richness and abundance in field margins (3896).",

Clearing or opening patches in forests has been found to increase the abundance and species richness of butterflies, though some studies note a decline in richness over the first few years after clearing (3938). Coppicing woodland, a traditional management technique, also had a higher abundance of butterflies in some studies compared to unmanaged woodland (3939). Thinning trees, which reduces canopy density, was found to increase butterfly species richness and abundance compared to unmanaged woodland, especially when combined with other actions like mulching (3940).

    "answer": "The evidence from across Europe, including the UK, Switzerland, Sweden, Finland, and Germany, indicates that agri-environment schemes (AES) are generally effective for butterfly and moth conservation, though results can be variable. A majority of studies found that farms and habitats managed under AES had higher species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths compared to conventionally managed land (3915). However, some studies found similar or even lower abundance and richness, particularly when comparing AES grasslands to unmanaged, abandoned grasslands. The effectiveness appears to depend on the specific prescriptions within the scheme and the surrounding landscape context (3915).",
