    "question": "To protect newly planted trees from herbivores, what is the evidence for the effectiveness of fencing compared to using individual tree guards or shelters?",
    "answer": "Studies have found that fencing to exclude grazing is likely to be beneficial, with four of five studies showing increased survival, size, and cover of planted trees (1254). In contrast, the effectiveness of tree guards or shelters is unknown. One study found that light-coloured plastic shelters increased survival, while another found that guards increased tree height at 37 months but not 44 months (1268).",

    "answer": "The evidence on removing understory vegetation shows mixed or limited benefits for planted trees. Mechanically removing understory vegetation after planting had no effect on seedling emergence, survival, or growth in five studies, although one study found it increased seedling biomass (1256). Using herbicides after restoration planting was found in one study to decrease plant species richness and diversity (1241). In another two of three studies, herbicides increased the size of planted trees, but a third study found no effect (1262). There was no evidence found for the effects of removing understory vegetation (either mechanically or with herbicides) specifically to reduce wildfires (1218, 1219).",

    "answer": "Several interventions to improve soil in degraded forests have been studied. Adding fertilizer increased plant cover and tree size in some studies, but had no effect in others (1248). Adding organic matter such as leaf litter was found to increase the species richness of young trees in one study but decrease their density in another (1250). Adding lime increased vegetation cover in one study (1249). Soil scarification or ploughing had mixed effects, sometimes increasing the density of young trees and sometimes decreasing it (1251). Using other soil enhancers had mixed effects on tree seedling survival and height in one study and no effect in another (1153).",

    "question": "How does the effectiveness of managing livestock grazing to protect forests vary across different geographical locations mentioned in the evidence?",
    "answer": "The evidence shows some variation in the effectiveness of managing livestock grazing across different regions. Excluding livestock with wire fences was generally beneficial, increasing understory biomass and tree regeneration in studies from Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Israel, Mexico, Kenya, and the USA (1205). Completely preventing livestock grazing increased understory plant diversity in Brazil, the UK, and Costa Rica, and increased oak seedling density in Israel (1206). Shortening the grazing period had mixed results: it increased regenerating oak abundance in Spain, but had no effect on native plant richness in Australia. A UK study found summer grazing was better for tree seedling numbers than winter grazing (1208).",

    "answer": "Several techniques are available. Shelterwood harvesting increased the abundance and diversity of understory plants and the growth of young trees in several studies (1223). Group-selection harvesting also showed positive effects, increasing understory plant cover and diversity and young tree density in some studies, although others found it decreased understory richness and biomass (1224). Thinning trees by girdling was found in one trial to increase understory plant richness, diversity, and cover (1226). Using herbicides to thin trees was found to have no effect on total plant species richness in one study (1225).",

    "answer": "Thinning has varied effects. For mature trees, it generally decreases density and cover but increases tree size, though one study found it decreased species richness (1209). For young trees, studies show mixed results, with some finding an increase in density, one finding a decrease, and others finding no effect (1210). Effects on understory plants are largely positive, with a majority of studies reporting increases in density, cover, species richness, and diversity (1211). However, for non-vascular plants, thinning was found to decrease abundance and species richness in some studies (1212).",
