    "relevant_summary": "Based on multiple replicated, before-and-after studies, several food-based enrichment strategies have been shown to effectively reduce stereotypic behaviors in large captive carnivores:\n\nFrozen food in ice (Action ID 1923): Two studies found that presenting food frozen in ice decreased abnormal or stereotypic behaviors and increased activity levels in bears and felids. However, effects on manipulation behaviors varied, with increases observed in lions but decreases in grizzly bears.\n\nHiding food around the enclosure (Action ID 1915): Four studies demonstrated that hiding food increased exploring and foraging behaviors across multiple species including black bears, leopard cats, bush dogs, maned wolves, and Malayan sun bears. Two studies specifically found decreased stereotypical pacing in leopard cats and black bears.\n\nProviding bones, hides or partial carcasses (Action ID 1902): Studies showed that providing bones decreased stereotypic behaviors in lions, tigers, and Arctic foxes while increasing activity and manipulation time in felids and red foxes.\n\nRandom temporal feeding schedule (Action ID 1904): Three studies found that unpredictable feeding schedules reduced stereotypic pacing behaviors in tigers and cheetahs, while increasing behavioral diversity in red foxes and alertness in a black-footed cat.\n\nFood presented inside objects (Action ID 1924): Two studies found that food inside objects increased exploratory and foraging behaviors while decreasing stereotypic behaviors in sloth bears and spectacled bears.\n\nDevices simulating live prey (Action ID 1927): Studies showed increased activity levels and behavioral diversity in felids when presented with lures or pulley systems, with pacing behavior decreasing in cougars provided with carcasses on bungees.\n\nScatter feeding (Action ID 1921): Studies demonstrated increased locomotion in maned wolves when food was scattered around their enclosure.\n\nFast days (Action ID 1906): One study found that large felids fed once every three days actually paced more frequently on non-feeding days, suggesting this strategy may be counterproductive for reducing stereotypic behaviors.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence, scattering food throughout enclosures and hiding food in containers both have positive effects on primate behavior, though they show somewhat different outcomes. Scattering food throughout the enclosure has been shown in multiple studies to increase feeding and exploratory behaviors in rhesus macaques, reduce abnormal behaviors in chimpanzees, decrease aggression in lemurs, increase foraging and activity levels in gorillas. Hiding food in containers (including boxes and bags) with browse added has been found to increase activity levels and foraging behaviors in lemurs and gibbons. Puzzle feeders, a related form of food presentation challenge, have been shown to decrease food sharing, increase foraging behavior and tool use, though they also increased aggression, while also increasing feeding time and reducing inactive time. Both methods appear effective for promoting natural foraging behaviors and increasing activity levels, with scattering showing broader benefits across multiple primate species and contexts.",

Formulating specific larval diets has shown significant benefits, with one study in Portugal finding that diets containing 46% protein resulted in higher growth rates, survival and body weights at metamorphosis compared to lower protein diets (ID: 1889). A study in the USA found that control diets containing rabbit chow and fish food or freshwater algae allowed tadpoles to reach higher body mass and more advanced developmental stages compared to pine or oak pollen diets, with tadpoles on pollen diets failing to undergo metamorphosis (ID: 1889). Carotenoid supplementation has been studied for breeding adults, with one US study finding that adding carotenoids to fruit flies fed to frogs reduced clutch numbers but increased the number of tadpoles and successful metamorphs (ID: 1887). Leaving infertile eggs at spawn sites as food for egg-eating larvae has been proposed as a dietary strategy, though no evidence was captured for its effectiveness (ID: 1890). Several other dietary approaches including vitamin and calcium supplementation through prey gut loading or food dusting, formulating adult diets to match wild food composition, and varying food provision seasonally have been proposed but currently lack evidence from studies (IDs: 1885, 1886, 1884, 1883).",

Whole carcasses feeding showed mixed effects on stereotypic behavior - two studies found it reduced pacing in lions, leopards, snow leopards and cougars, but increased pacing in tigers. For cheetahs, whole rabbit feeding resulted in lower blood protein urea, zinc and vitamin A levels compared to supplemented beef, and showed lower levels of inflammatory bowel indicators. Nutritionally, ocelots fed whole 1-3 day old chickens had lower digestible energy and fat compared to commercial diets, while African wildcats had lower organic matter digestibility compared to ground-chicken diets. In contrast, live vertebrate prey had more limited documented effects - one study found hunting behavior increased and sleeping decreased when a fishing cat was provided with live fish, while another study found no change in stereotypical behaviors in tigers when provided with live fish. The evidence suggests whole carcasses may have more measurable impacts on both behavioral and physiological parameters, though effects vary by species.",

Providing devices to simulate live prey, such as carcasses on bungees, can decrease pacing behaviour, though initial increases were noted in some species (1927).

Hiding food around the enclosure can reduce stereotypical pacing while increasing exploring and foraging behaviours (1915). Providing devices to simulate live prey, such as carcasses on bungees, can decrease pacing behaviour, though initial increases were noted in some species (1927). However, allocating fast days was found to increase pacing in large felids on non-feeding days (1906).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"1904\",\n    \"1918\",\n    \"1915\",\n    \"1927\",\n    \"1906\"\n  ]\n}"

Commercial diets also maintained plasma a-tocopherol, retinol and taurine concentrations within recommended ranges for domestic cats (action 1900).
