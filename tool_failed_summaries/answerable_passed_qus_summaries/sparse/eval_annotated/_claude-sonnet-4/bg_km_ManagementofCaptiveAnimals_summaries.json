    "relevant_summary": "Several food-based enrichment strategies have proven effective for reducing stereotypic behaviors in large captive carnivores. Presenting food frozen in ice decreased abnormal or stereotypic behaviors and increased activity levels in bears and felids (Action 1923). Hiding food around enclosures increased exploring and foraging behaviors and decreased stereotypical pacing in leopard cats and black bears (Action 1915). Providing food inside objects such as Boomer balls increased exploratory and foraging behaviors and decreased stereotypic behaviors in sloth bears and spectacled bears (Action 1924). Unpredictable feeding schedules reduced the frequency of stereotypic pacing behaviors in tigers and cheetahs (Action 1904). Providing bones, hides or partial carcasses decreased the frequency of stereotypic behaviors in lions and tigers, while also increasing activity and manipulation time (Action 1902). Feeding whole carcasses reduced pacing levels in lions, leopards, snow leopards and cougars, though it increased pacing in tigers (Action 1901). Devices to simulate live prey including lures and pulley systems increased activity levels and behavioral diversity in felids, and carcasses on bungees decreased pacing behavior in cougars (Action 1927). Changing the location of food around enclosures decreased pacing behaviors in cheetahs (Action 1918). However, allocating fast days led to increased pacing frequency in large felids on non-feeding days (Action 1906).",

Scattering food throughout the enclosure increased feeding and exploratory behaviors in rhesus macaques, reduced abnormal behaviors in chimpanzees, reduced aggression in lemurs, and increased foraging and activity levels in gorillas (Action 1315). Hiding food in containers such as boxes, baskets or tubes also increased activity levels and foraging behaviors in lemurs and gibbons (Action 1316). While both methods enhance foraging behavior and activity levels, the scattering method appears to have additional benefits of reducing abnormal behaviors and aggression, whereas hiding food in containers may require more specific implementation with browse materials to achieve optimal results.",
