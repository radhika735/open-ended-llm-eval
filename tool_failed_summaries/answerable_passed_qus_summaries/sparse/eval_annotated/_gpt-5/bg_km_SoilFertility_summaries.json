However, 26 studies in nine European countries reported negative, no effect or inconsistent effects on some invertebrates (including earthworms), seed/weed metrics, mammals and some birds, with one study noting decreasing bird preferences for conservation tillage over time; long\u2011term earthworm results were mixed (one study higher biomass after 10 years; one no difference) [126]. For birds specifically, replicated/controlled studies from Europe and the UK and reviews found higher species richness/diversity or higher densities for some species on reduced\u2011tillage fields, but other studies found similar or lower diversity/densities, and one study found no greater breeding success or chick size; some studies reported higher productivity, nesting success or earlier laying on reduced\u2011tillage fields [211]. Beyond wildlife, studies from Europe within broader evidence syntheses reported: more microbes or higher microbial activity and more soil animals/earthworms under reduced tillage in some trials, but some trials found no effect [906]; mixed soil compaction results, with several replicated trials (including in Europe) finding higher compaction under reduced tillage, while controlled traffic reduced compaction and runoff and one study reported increased yields under no\u2011till [906]; mixed drought\u2011related soil physical responses, with European trials finding conventional ploughing/sub\u2011soiling increased soil water infiltration and content compared to reduced tillage [906]; erosion outcomes generally favoured reduced tillage (several trials showed reduced soil loss/runoff), but trials also showed cases where no\u2011till increased soil loss without crop cover [906]; soil organic carbon typically higher under no/reduced tillage than conventional across multiple regions including Europe, though one randomized, replicated Spanish trial found greater SOC under conventional tillage and one Canadian trial found no effect [906]; soil organic matter and structure often maintained or increased and nutrient retention higher under reduced tillage, though one trial found less carbon and nitrate in no\u2011till than conventional while conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate [906]; yield effects were mixed, with a randomized, replicated Portuguese study finding no yield effect of tillage treatment, while a Canadian study found lower yields under minimum/no\u2011tillage and a USA study found higher yields with subsoiling [906].",

Thirty-four studies (of which 21 were replicated and controlled and seven also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found some positive effects on earthworms, some invertebrates (other than earthworms), weeds or farmland birds, of reducing tillage compared to conventional management. Positive effects included increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms, greater abundance of some invertebrates other than earthworms, increased numbers of some weeds and/or weed species, higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying date and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields, and greater abundance of some birds - including Eurasian skylark, seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in late winter on non-inversion or conservation tillage. A review found tillage had negative effects on invertebrate numbers and no-till systems had more invertebrate bird food resources.\\nTwenty-six studies (of which 13 replicated and controlled and three also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found reducing tillage had either negative, no effect or no consistent effects on abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates (other than earthworms), earthworm abundance, biomass, or species richness, number of different plant species found as seeds, number of some weed species, mammal abundance, some bird species, and one study found bird preferences for conservation tillage fields decreased over time. Two studies found that crop type affected the number of weeds under different tillage regimes.\\nOne small replicated trial in the UK compared bird numbers under two different forms of reduced tillage, and found more birds from species that make up the \\u2018Farmland Bird Index\\u2019 on broadcast than non-inversion tillage fields.\\nTwo studies looked at the long-term effects of reduced tillage on earthworms (after ten years).

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done.

Two controlled trials (one also randomized and replicated) found increased soil organic matter, while one trial found no effect (ID: 897). In orchards/vineyards with ground cover between rows, replicated, randomized, controlled studies reported grape yields sometimes lower or similar compared to bare soil; chestnut yields were higher with resident vegetation but not with seeded cover crops; avocado yields were lower with seeded grasses/legumes (ID: 1352). Grape quality metrics were often similar, with some differences in titratable acidity and cluster weights depending on ground cover type (ID: 1352). Across orchards/vineyards, studies and two meta-analyses found more soil organic matter with ground cover; nitrogen was often higher but sometimes lower or similar; microbial biomass and nematodes were more abundant in some comparisons; soil erosion was commonly lower and soil aggregates more water-stable; soil pH sometimes differed; greenhouse gases (CO2, N2O) were sometimes higher (ID: 1367). When fields are empty (off-season cover crops): One controlled, randomized, replicated experiment found more diverse nematode communities; one replicated trial found greater microbial biomass under ryegrass than a ryegrass/vetch mix (ID: 898). Randomized, replicated studies found improved soil structure and nutrient retention, including higher porosity and interconnectivity, lower resistance, and reduced nitrate leaching (ID: 898). Studies and a review found increased soil carbon, with further increases when legumes were included; multiple trials found increased nitrogen and carbon in soil organic matter, though some studies found no marked effect (ID: 898). One replicated trial reported higher tomato yield after ryegrass cover crop (ID: 898).
