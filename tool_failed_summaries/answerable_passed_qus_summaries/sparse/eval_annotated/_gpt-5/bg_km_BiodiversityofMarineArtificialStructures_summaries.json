Creating short flexible habitats (1\u201350 mm) also showed mixed effects on fish populations in Australia, with a randomized controlled study reporting seahorse abundance varied by survey week, and mixed effects on invertebrate abundance depending on survey week, species group, flexible habitat length, or site [3450].

Combined macroalgae and invertebrate abundance showed no increase in one Australian study and mixed effects in another, influenced by grooves/ledges (3472). Mobile invertebrate abundance responses were mixed across studies, with one study also reporting increased non\u2011mobile invertebrate and oyster recruit abundance and decreased barnacle abundance; another found increased oyster and mobile invertebrate abundance (3472). Two Australian studies found no increase in fish abundance; one reported similar fish abundance around transplanted oysters regardless of groove/ridge presence or size (3472). Survival of transplanted invertebrates, including oysters, varied by species, site, and surface features; oyster survival was higher in grooves than on ridges in one study, while survival in grooves versus ledges varied by site in another; some studies simply reported a proportion survived (3472). One Australian study found transplanting oysters and/or coralline algae did not increase the time fishes spent interacting with surfaces or the number of bites, though benthic fishes took more bites from surfaces with transplanted oysters than with algae plus oysters, regardless of grooves/ridges (3472).",

Creating pit habitats often increased richness/diversity: 8 of 12 replicated, controlled studies reported increases (with some mixed or no-effect results), and effects could vary with pit size/arrangement and site (3475). Creating groove habitats had mixed-to-positive outcomes: 3 of 6 replicated, controlled studies reported increased combined macroalgae/invertebrate richness or diversity, while two found no increase and one found mixed effects (3473). Combining grooves with small ridges/ledges or protrusions yielded increases in 6 of 11 replicated, controlled studies, though several studies found mixed effects depending on design and context (3474). Creating hole habitats increased combined macroalgae/invertebrate richness or diversity in three replicated, controlled studies when implemented alongside other features such as rock pools, grooves, small protrusions, and environmentally-sensitive materials (3467). In contrast, creating small ridges/ledges alone did not generally increase richness and sometimes supported lower richness than adjacent grooves, though some studies found increases when combined with grooves/protrusions/pits (3464). Large ledges/ridges showed mixed results\u2014one study with grooves and protrusions reported increased diversity, while another with large protrusions did not increase richness (3465).

Small \u2018swimthrough\u2019 cavities (\u2264100 mm) did not increase combined macroalgae/invertebrate richness in one replicated study (3468).

Eight studies were on open coastlines in Japan, Italy\\u00a0and Croatia, and one of each was in an inland bay in eastern USA, an estuary in southeast Australia, and on an island coastline in the Singapore Strait.\\n\\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\\n\\nOverall community composition (1 study): One replicated, paired sites, controlled study in the USA\\u00a0found that transplanting oysters onto subtidal artificial structures altered the combined invertebrate and fish community composition on and around structure surfaces.\\nOverall richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, paired sites, controlled study in the USA\\u00a0found that transplanting oysters onto subtidal artificial structures increased the combined invertebrate and fish species richness and diversity on and around structure surfaces.\\nInvertebrate richness/diversity (1 study): One randomized, before-and-after study in Singapore\\u00a0reported that transplanting corals onto a subtidal artificial structure increased the coral species richness on structure surfaces.\\n\\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (11 STUDIES)\\n\\nOverall abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired sites, controlled study in the USA\\u00a0found that transplanting oysters onto subtidal artificial structures did not increase the combined invertebrate and fish abundance on and around structure surfaces, but that the effects varied for different species.\\nAlgal abundance (3 studies): Two replicated, randomized, controlled studies in Italy\\u00a0and Croatia\\u00a0found that the cover of canopy algae transplanted onto subtidal artificial structures increased\\u00a0and/or was higher\\u00a0when transplanted under cages but decreased\\u00a0and/or was lower\\u00a0when left uncaged. One study in Japan\\u00a0reported that the abundance of kelp recruits on a subtidal artificial structure varied depending on the distance from transplanted kelp individuals and the surface orientation.\\nInvertebrate abundance (2 studies): One replicated, randomized, controlled and site comparison study in Australia\\u00a0found that transplanting sea urchins onto a subtidal artificial structure reduced the cover of non-native sea mat on kelps growing on the structure. One randomized, before-and-after study in Singapore\\u00a0reported that transplanting corals increased the coral cover on structure surfaces.\\n\\n\\nAlgal reproductive success (1 study): One study in Japan\\u00a0reported that kelp transplanted onto a subtidal artificial structure appeared to reproduce.\\nInvertebrate reproductive success (1 study): One replicated, paired sites, controlled study in the USA\\u00a0reported that oysters transplanted onto subtidal artificial structures appeared to reproduce.\\nAlgal survival (5 studies): Three of five replicated studies (including two randomized, controlled studies) in Italy\\u00a0found that the survival of canopy algae transplanted onto subtidal artificial structures varied depending on the wave-exposure and surrounding habitat\\u00a0or the presence\\u00a0and/or mesh size\\u00a0of cages around transplants, while in one\\u00a0the surface orientation had no effect. Two studies\\u00a0reported that no canopy algae transplants survived, and in one\\u00a0this was regardless of the presence of cages.\\nInvertebrate survival (3 studies): One randomized, before-and-after study in Singapore\\u00a0found that the survival of corals transplanted onto a subtidal artificial structure varied depending on the species. One replicated, paired sites, controlled study in the USA\\u00a0found that cleaning activities did not affect survival of transplanted oysters. One replicated, randomized, controlled and site comparison study in Australia\\u00a0simply reported that transplanted sea urchins survived.\\nAlgal condition (3 studies): Two replicated studies (including one randomized, controlled study) in Italy\\u00a0found that the growth of canopy algae transplanted onto subtidal artificial structures varied depending on the wave-exposure and surface orientation\\u00a0or the presence of cages around transplants, while in one\\u00a0the mesh size of cages had no effect. One study in Japan\\u00a0simply reported that transplanted kelp grew.\\nInvertebrate condition (2 studies): One randomized, before-and-after study in Singapore\\u00a0reported that the growth of corals transplanted onto a subtidal artificial structure varied depending on the species. One replicated, paired sites, controlled study in the USA\\u00a0reported that cleaning activities did not affect the growth of transplanted oysters.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\"\n}"
