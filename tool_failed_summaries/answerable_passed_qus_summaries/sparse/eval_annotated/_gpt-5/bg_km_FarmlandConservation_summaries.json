However, evidence is mixed: studies in Europe found reduced tillage sometimes had negative, no effect, or inconsistent effects on some invertebrates, earthworms (including long\u2011term results), plant seed species numbers, mammal abundance, and some bird species, with one study noting decreasing bird preference for conservation tillage fields over time; weed responses also varied with crop type [126]. Regarding weed pressure specifically, replicated randomized controlled experiments from Italy and Spain reported that reduced tillage tended to increase weed abundance compared to conventional tillage, while some comparisons found similar or fewer weeds; studies from Spain and Turkey found similar numbers of weed species under reduced and conventional tillage [1399].",

Thirty-four studies (of which 21 were replicated and controlled and seven also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found some positive effects on earthworms, some invertebrates (other than earthworms), weeds or farmland birds, of reducing tillage compared to conventional management. Positive effects included increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms, greater abundance of some invertebrates other than earthworms, increased numbers of some weeds and/or weed species, higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying date and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields, and greater abundance of some birds - including Eurasian skylark, seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in late winter on non-inversion or conservation tillage. A review found tillage had negative effects on invertebrate numbers and no-till systems had more invertebrate bird food resources.\\nTwenty-six studies (of which 13 replicated and controlled and three also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found reducing tillage had either negative, no effect or no consistent effects on abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates (other than earthworms), earthworm abundance, biomass, or species richness, number of different plant species found as seeds, number of some weed species, mammal abundance, some bird species, and one study found bird preferences for conservation tillage fields decreased over time. Two studies found that crop type affected the number of weeds under different tillage regimes.\\nOne small replicated trial in the UK compared bird numbers under two different forms of reduced tillage, and found more birds from species that make up the \\u2018Farmland Bird Index\\u2019 on broadcast than non-inversion tillage fields.\\nTwo studies looked at the long-term effects of reduced tillage on earthworms (after ten years).

For butterflies and moths, several replicated studies found greater species richness on sown or naturally regenerating set\u2011aside than on cereal fields or pasture, sometimes higher in second\u2011year set\u2011aside and when sown with less competitive grasses; abundance was higher than cereal fields in some cases but often similar to arable/pasture or uncultivated boundaries, and older set\u2011aside showed communities with less\u2011migratory, longer\u2011developing species; in the USA, abundance was similar to prairies in year one but lower thereafter [3980]. Two replicated trials found bee species richness (nesting or foraging) was higher on annually mown, naturally regenerating set\u2011aside left for \u22652 years than under other set\u2011aside regimes or in arable crops [7]. Conversion to grassland: For butterflies and moths, restored grasslands often had higher species richness than conventionally managed grasslands or cultivated farms, communities became more similar to high\u2011quality grasslands over ~10 years, and sowing diverse mixes (grasses, legumes, forbs or perennial mixes) increased butterfly richness and/or abundance compared to grass\u2011only or less\u2011competitive mixes; abundance of moths was higher than in conventional grasslands or unrestored crop fields and similar to semi\u2011natural grasslands, though abundance did not necessarily increase with time; some before\u2011after evidence showed increases in several moths and butterflies but decreases in two butterfly species [3929]. For birds and other wildlife, multiple studies found no clear benefits from reversion of arable to grassland, including replicated controlled trials, and one controlled before\u2011and\u2011after UK study reported significant declines in grey partridge after reversion; studies also included waders, brown hares and plants with no clear benefits detected [561, 210].",

Six studies were in the UK, two were in Finland, and one was in each of Switzerland\\u00a0and Taiwan.\\n\\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (9 STUDIES)\\n\\nCommunity composition (2 studies): One of two replicated, site comparison studies in the UK\\u00a0and Finland\\u00a0found that grasslands restored from bare soil by seeding developed butterfly communities that were increasingly similar to existing high-quality grasslands over the first 10 years after establishment. The other study found that older grasslands established by sowing with competitive seed mixes had a greater proportion of specialist butterflies than newer grasslands sown with less competitive species which required re-seeding every 4\\u20135 years.\\nRichness/diversity (8 studies): Three replicated, site comparison studies (including two paired studies) in Switzerland, the UK\\u00a0and Taiwan\\u00a0found that 4\\u20135-year-old created grasslands\\u00a0and abandoned cropland\\u00a0had a greater species richness of butterflies, burnet moths\\u00a0and all moths\\u00a0than conventionally managed grassland\\u00a0or cultivated farms. Two of three replicated studies (including one randomized, paired, controlled study and two site comparison studies) in the UK\\u00a0and Finland\\u00a0found that grasslands established by sowing grasses, legumes and other non-woody, broadleaved plants (forbs), or perennial grass mixes, had a higher species richness of butterflies (in one case including other pollinators) than grasslands established with grass-only mixes\\u00a0or less competitive species. The third study found that grasslands established by sowing complex or simple seed mixes, or by natural regeneration, all had a similar species richness of butterflies and day-flying moths, but species richness was higher on grasslands created &lt;10 years ago than on grasslands created &gt;20 years ago. One before-and-after study in the UK\\u00a0found that after the adoption of an Environmentally Sensitive Areas scheme, including reverting arable land to permanent grassland, the species richness of large moths on a farm increased. One replicated, site comparison study in the UK\\u00a0found that over 10 years after restoration, the number of species of butterfly on seeded grassland remained similar each year.\\n\\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (7 STUDIES)\\n\\nAbundance (7 studies): Two of three replicated, paired, site comparison studies in the UK\\u00a0and Taiwan\\u00a0found that restored grassland had a higher abundance of moths than conventional grassland\\u00a0or unrestored crop fields, and a similar abundance to semi-natural grasslands, but abundance did not increase with time since restoration. The third study found that abandoned cropland had a similar abundance of butterflies to cultivated farms. Two of three replicated studies (including one randomized, paired, controlled study and two site comparison studies) in the UK\\u00a0and Finland\\u00a0found that grasslands established by sowing grasses, legumes and other non-woody, broadleaved plants (forbs), or perennial grass mixes, had a higher abundance of butterflies (in one case including other pollinators) than grasslands established with grass-only mixes\\u00a0or less competitive species. The third study found that grasslands restored by sowing complex or simple seed mixes, or by natural regeneration, all had a similar abundance of caterpillars. One before-and-after study in the UK\\u00a0found that after the adoption of an Environmentally Sensitive Areas scheme on a farm, including reverting arable land to permanent grassland, the abundance of large moths and five species of butterfly increased, but the abundance of two species of butterfly decreased.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\"\n}"
