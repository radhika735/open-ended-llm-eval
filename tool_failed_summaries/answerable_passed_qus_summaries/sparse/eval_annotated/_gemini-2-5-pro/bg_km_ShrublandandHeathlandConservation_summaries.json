In terms of plant species, one UK study showed an increase in the number of plant species, but another found no effect on species richness or diversity (1652). Herbicide application was found to increase the cover of wavy hair-grass, sheep\u2019s fescue, and gorse in some UK studies (1652). While three UK studies found that herbicide reduced bracken biomass or cover, one study found no change in bracken abundance (1652).\n\nCutting bracken was found to increase heather cover or biomass in one Norwegian and one UK study, but two other UK studies found no increase in heather cover or seedling abundance (1653). One UK study found that cutting increased heathland plant species richness, while another found it increased species diversity but not richness (1653). Cutting was also found to increase the cover of wavy hair-grass and sheep\u2019s fescue in one UK study (1653). The effect of cutting on bracken itself was varied, with some studies in the UK and Norway showing a reduction in cover or biomass, while others in the UK found mixed effects or no decrease in abundance (1653).\n\nCombining cutting and herbicide application was found to reduce bracken biomass or cover in three studies in the UK and Norway (1654). However, the effect on heather was inconsistent, with one UK study finding no change in biomass and a Norwegian study finding increased cover (1654). One UK study found that cutting followed by herbicide application increased plant species richness more than applying herbicide before cutting (1654).",
