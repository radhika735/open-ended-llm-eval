However, six other studies found no clear effect on plant species richness, ground beetle communities, or the abundance of some insects and spiders from the same practice (131).\n\nCeasing mowing altogether to allow for early succession has shown varied effects on butterflies and moths. While some studies found that meadows left uncut all summer had a higher species richness and abundance of butterflies (3957), other studies found that grasslands abandoned for extended periods (1-20 years) had a lower abundance of all butterflies or certain species when compared to mown grasslands (3957). The community composition can also shift, with one study noting that abandoned areas became dominated by generalist butterfly species (3957).\n\nWhen comparing cutting/mowing to grazing, the outcomes are also mixed. One trial in Spain indicated that cutting to mimic grazing increased the number of plant species, but another trial found this was not always the case (1627). Different studies have found that mowing or cutting can increase, decrease, or have no effect on heather abundance compared to grass, depending on the location and specific conditions (1627). Mowing has been found to increase grass cover in some studies and reduce tree cover in another (1627).",
