    "relevant_summary": "The most effective management for uncropped field margins involves sowing perennial flowering plants. Evidence from five UK trials shows margins sown with wild flowers support higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees than cropped edges, grassy margins, or naturally regenerated strips [19]. Similarly, margins sown with agricultural nectar and pollen mixes (especially perennial legumes) attract significantly more bumblebees [18], though their value may decline and require re-sowing every few years. Leaving margins uncropped with natural regeneration provides inconsistent benefits and often relies on thistle species considered weeds [20]. Providing 6 m wide grass strips at field margins enhances bumblebee abundance and attracts nest-searching queen bumblebees [14, 12]. Agri-environment schemes can benefit wild bees, although results vary and effectiveness depends on the specific measures adopted [24].",

One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK\\u00a0found that farms with wildflower strips (along with other enhanced agri-environment scheme options) had a higher abundance of some butterflies, but a lower abundance of other butterflies, than farms with simpler agri-environment scheme management such as grass-only margins. One of two replicated, paired, controlled studies (including one randomized study) in the USA\\u00a0and the UK\\u00a0found that plots sown with one of three wildflower mixes had a higher abundance of moths than plots sown with two other mixes or a single flower species. The other study found that plots sown with either complex or simple flower mixes had a similar abundance of butterflies. One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK\\u00a0found that wildflower plots sown with lucerne\\u00a0had a higher abundance of butterflies than plots sown with borage, chicory or sainfoin.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)\\n\\nUse (2 studies): Two studies (including one replicated study) in the UK\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0reported that sown nectar flower plots\\u00a0and tropical milkweed plots\\u00a0were used by six species of butterflies and moths\\u00a0and monarch butterflies and caterpillars.\"\n}"
