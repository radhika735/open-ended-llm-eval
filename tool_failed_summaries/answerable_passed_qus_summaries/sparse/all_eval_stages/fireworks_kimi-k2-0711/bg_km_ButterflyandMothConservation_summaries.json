    "relevant_summary": "Studies show that opening forest canopies through clearing creates patches in forests that result in higher species richness of butterflies than unmanaged patches, closed canopy forest, or standard width rides. However, cleared patches have lower species richness of moths than unmanaged patches. Fourteen studies evaluated clearing patches in forests, and found that cleared patches (also managed with coppicing and grazing) had higher abundance of butterflies generally, and specific species like chequered blue, woodland brown, high brown fritillary and small pearl-bordered fritillary, than before management, or than unmanaged or coppiced areas. A review across Europe reported that clearing small patches in forests benefitted 19 out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern. For thinning trees within forests, six studies found that coniferous woodland which had been thinned (along with prescribed burning, mulching or nearby felling) had greater species richness of butterflies, or butterflies, diurnal moths and bumblebees combined, than unmanaged woodland or before management. However, one study found rarer species of fruit-feeding butterfly were less frequently caught in a forest managed by thinning than in an unmanaged, naturally regenerating forest. Regarding coppicing woodland, ten studies found that coppiced woodland had higher abundance of butterflies generally and heath fritillary specifically than unmanaged woodland. Two studies found coppiced woodland had greater species richness of butterflies than unmanaged woodland. Three studies found that woodland coppiced 2-4 years ago had greater species richness and abundance of butterflies than woodland coppiced 5-11 or >15 years ago. However, studies also found that coppiced woodland had lower species richness of macro-moths than mature forest and lower abundance of macro-moths than mature forest.",

Rotational burning resulted in higher total abundance on prairies burned more than one, two or four years ago versus recently burned areas. In contrast, leaving areas unburned during prescribed burning increased abundance of Karner blue butterflies over 2-3 years in oak savannas and prairies. Specialist butterfly species showed varying responses to unburned patches: six out of nine were more abundant, one was less abundant, and two had similar abundance compared to sites without unburned areas.

Another review found that translocated large copper populations survived for up to 38 years but ultimately died out or required supplementation. For captive-release programs (3914), 13 studies reported that captive-bred butterfly populations persisted for 2-28 years and increased in abundance, while other populations died out within 1-2 years or required continued releases to survive. One review found identical survival statistics: 25% of captive-bred populations survived for at least three years and only 8% survived for more than 10 years.",
