Additional findings show mixed or non-beneficial effects: devices simulating live prey decreased pacing in cougars but initially increased pacing in tigers (1927); providing live vertebrate prey did not change stereotypical behaviours in tigers (1925); and allocating fast days increased pacing on non-feeding days in large felids (1906).
