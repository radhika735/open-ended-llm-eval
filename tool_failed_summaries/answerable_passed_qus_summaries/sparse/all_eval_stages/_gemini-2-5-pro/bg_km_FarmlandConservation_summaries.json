    "relevant_summary": "Based on a review of 42 studies, reducing tillage on European farmland has been shown to have several positive effects (126). These include an increase in the biomass, species richness, or abundance of earthworms, a greater abundance of some invertebrates, and an increase in certain weed species. The practice has also been linked to benefits for several bird species, such as higher nest density for the Eurasian skylark and greater abundance of seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in late winter (126). Additionally, no-till systems have been found to contain more invertebrate bird food resources (126). For soil, some studies found that no-tillage systems had more organic matter, nitrogen, and phosphorus compared to reduced tillage plots (1370). It has also been found that no-tillage can lead to fewer denitrifying bacteria and less greenhouse gas emissions in some cases (1370).\n\nHowever, the effects of reduced tillage are not consistently positive. Twenty-six of the 42 studies found that reduced tillage had negative, no, or inconsistent effects on the abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates, earthworms, and plant species (126). The impact on birds was also not uniformly positive, with one study noting that bird preference for conservation tillage fields decreased over time (126). The long-term effects on earthworms were also inconsistent across studies (126). Evidence regarding the impact on ground-nesting bees is mixed, with one study showing no difference in bee abundance between tilled and untilled farms, while another found a higher number of squash bees on no-till farms (11). Furthermore, when comparing no-tillage to reduced tillage, some studies found less nitrogen, and mixed results for microbial biomass, soil aggregation and water-stability (1370). Finally, in some of the studies, it was not possible to distinguish between the effects of reduced tillage and the effects of reduced pesticide and/or fertilizer inputs (126).",
