    "relevant_summary": "When restoring grasslands, removing the topsoil or turf before seeding has been shown to have several benefits compared to just disturbing the soil. One UK-based study found that removing turf before sowing seeds led to a greater richness of both grass and forb species in most cases when compared to simply disturbing the soil (3415). Other studies have shown that topsoil removal can also increase the similarity of the plant community to that of intact steppe (3415), increase overall plant species richness (3415) and the richness of sown plants (3415), and lead to a higher cover of planted species (3415). Two studies in the USA also found that topsoil removal increased the survival of seedlings and plants (3415). In one study, disturbing the soil with a rotovator and spreading clippings increased the number of heathland plants (1711), while other studies have shown that removing topsoil and adding seed or clippings can increase the cover of heathland plants or heather and gorse (1711). Topsoil removal can also help to reduce the cover of undesirable species, with one study finding it led to a lower cover of common knapweed (3415) and another finding it reduced the cover of perennial rye-grass (1711).",
