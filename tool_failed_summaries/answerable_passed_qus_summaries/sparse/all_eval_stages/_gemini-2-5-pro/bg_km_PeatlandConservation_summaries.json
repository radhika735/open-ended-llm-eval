Seven studies in the UK, Finland, and Sweden reported an increased cover of herbs like cottongrasses and sedges (1732). Effects on plant species richness were varied, with two studies in rich fens in Sweden showing an increase, while two studies in Finnish fens found no effect (1732).

Fifteen studies were in bogs (two\\u00a0being restored as fens). Fifteen studies were in fens or fen meadows\\u00a0(two\\u00a0were naturally forested). Six studies were in general or unspecified peatlands. Some studies were based on the same experimental set-up or sites as each other: two studies in Germany, three studies in Sweden, two studies in west Finland\\u00a0and two studies in south Finland.\\nPlant community composition (13 studies):\\u00a0Six before-and-after studies (four also replicated) in peatlands in Finland, Hungary, Sweden, Poland\\u00a0and Germany\\u00a0reported changes in the overall plant community composition following rewetting. Typically, drier grassland communities were replaced by more wetland- or peatland-characteristic communities.\\u00a0One replicated, paired, controlled study in a bog in the Czech Republic\\u00a0found that rewetted plots developed a different plant community to drained plots. Three site comparison studies in Finland\\u00a0and Canada\\u00a0reported that rewetted peatlands contained a different plant community to natural peatlands. Three replicated studies in peatlands in the UK\\u00a0and fens in Germany\\u00a0reported that rewetting typically had no effect, or insignificant effects, on the plant community.\\nCharacteristic plants (11 studies): Five studies (including one replicated site comparison) in peatlands in Canada, the UK, China\\u00a0and Poland\\u00a0reported that rewetting (sometimes\\u00a0along with other interventions) increased the abundance of wetland- or peatland-characteristic plants. Two replicated site comparison studies in fens or fen meadows in central Europe\\u00a0found that rewetting reduced the number of fen-characteristic plant species. Two studies (one replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after) in fens in Sweden\\u00a0reported that rewetting had no effect on cover of fen-characteristic plants.\\u00a0Two before-and-after studies in fens in the USA\\u00a0and New Zealand\\u00a0reported that upland plant cover decreased following rewetting.\\u00a0\\nMoss cover (19 studies):\\u00a0Twelve studies (five replicated, two also paired and controlled) in the UK, Ireland, Germany,\\u00a0Sweden, Latvia, Canada\\u00a0and Spain\\u00a0reported that rewetting bogs, fens or other peatlands (sometimes\\u00a0along with other interventions) increased Sphagnum moss cover or abundance. Three of these studies\\u00a0reported mixed responses by species. Two additional replicated studies, in bogs in Latvia\\u00a0and forested fens in Finland, reported that rewetting had no effect on Sphagnum\\u00a0cover. Five studies (one paired, controlled, before-and-after) in Finland, Sweden\\u00a0and Canada\\u00a0reported that rewetting bogs or fens had no effect on cover of non-Sphagnum mosses (or mosses/lichens). However, two controlled studies in bogs in Ireland\\u00a0and the UK\\u00a0reported that rewetting reduced cover of non-Sphagnum mosses\\u00a0or bryophytes. One site comparison study in Finland\\u00a0reported that a rewetted peatland had similar moss cover (Sphagnum and total) to a natural peatland, but another site comparison study in Canada\\u00a0reported that a rewetted bog had lower moss cover (Sphagnum and other) than nearby target peatlands.\\nHerb cover (25 studies): Twenty-one studies (including four replicated, paired, controlled) reported that rewetting (sometimes\\u00a0along with other interventions) increased cover of at least one group of herbs. These studies were in bogs, fens or other peatlands in the UK, Finland, Ireland, the Czech Republic, the USA, the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, China, Latvia, Poland, Canada\\u00a0and Spain. Specifically, rewetting increased other/total sedge cover in 13 of 15 studies, increased cottongrass cover in eight of nine studies, and increased reed/rush cover in five of seven studies. Three\\u00a0of four before-and-after studies in peatlands in the UK and Sweden reported that rewetting reduced purple moor grass cover; the other study\\u00a0reported no effect. One replicated site comparison study in forested fens in Finland\\u00a0reported that rewetting had no effect on total herb cover. Two site comparison studies in Europe\\u00a0reported greater herb cover in rewetted than natural peatlands (overall\\u00a0and sedges/rushes, but not forbs).\\nTree/shrub cover (13 studies):\\u00a0Ten\\u00a0studies (including two paired and controlled) in peatlands in Finland, the UK,\\u00a0Germany, Latvia\\u00a0and Canada\\u00a0reported that rewetting typically reduced (seven studies)\\u00a0or had no effect (six studies)\\u00a0on tree and/or shrub cover. Two before-and-after studies in fens in Sweden\\u00a0and Germany\\u00a0reported that rewetting increased tree/shrub cover. One before-and-after study in a bog in the UK\\u00a0reported mixed effects of rewetting on different tree/shrub species.\\nOverall vegetation cover (4 studies): Of four before-and-after studies (three also controlled) that examined the effect of rewetting on overall vegetation cover, two in bogs in Ireland\\u00a0and Sweden\\u00a0reported that rewetting increased it.

However, five studies found no effect: in bogs in the Czech Republic\\u00a0and Latvia, fens in Sweden\\u00a0and Germany, and forested fens in Finland. One study in fen meadows in the Netherlands\\u00a0found scale-dependent effects. One paired, controlled, before-and-after study in a peatland in Finland\\u00a0reported that rewetting reduced plant diversity.
