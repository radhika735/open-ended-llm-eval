    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, several specific practices can increase soil organic matter in Mediterranean vineyards. Planting or maintaining ground cover in vineyards shows strong evidence for increasing organic matter, with ten studies from Chile, France, Spain, and the USA finding more organic matter in soils with ground cover compared to soils without ground cover (action 1367). Cover crops beneath main crops or between crop rows also increase soil organic matter, with two controlled trials from India and South Africa finding increased soil organic matter under cover crops (action 897). Adding compost to soil consistently increases organic matter, with twelve replicated, controlled studies from Italy, Spain, Syria, Turkey, and the USA finding more organic matter in soils with added compost compared to soils without compost (action 1362). Adding manure to soil increases organic matter, with five replicated, controlled studies from Italy, Tunisia, Turkey, and the USA finding more organic matter in soils with added manure compared to soils without it (action 1363). Using organic fertilizer instead of inorganic fertilizer increases organic matter, with eight replicated studies from France, Italy, Spain, Turkey, and Mediterranean countries finding more organic matter in soils with organic fertilizer compared to inorganic fertilizer (action 1366). Amending soil with manures and agricultural composts increases organic matter, with four studies from India, Japan and the UK finding higher carbon levels when manures were applied (action 911). Adding mulch to crops increases soil organic matter, with one trial showing that mulch improved soil structure and increased soil organic matter (action 887). Retaining crop residues increases soil organic matter, with two randomized, replicated trials from Australia and China finding higher soil organic carbon when residues were retained (action 907). Amending soil with bacteria or fungi can increase organic matter, with one controlled, randomized, replicated trial from Turkey finding increased soil organic matter content under mycorrhizal-inoculated compost applications (action 888).",

    "relevant_summary": "Growing cover crops in arable fields on Mediterranean farmland shows predominantly positive effects on soil health, with mixed results for crop production. For soil health, multiple studies from Mediterranean-type climates found that cover crops increased soil organic matter compared to soils without them (Action 1345). Cover crops enhanced soil nutrients, with ten studies from Italy, Spain, and the USA finding more nitrogen in soils with winter cover crops in some comparisons, though ten other studies found inconsistent differences (Action 1345). Microbial biomass increased under cover crops in five studies from the USA, and studies found more bacteria and fungi in soils with winter cover crops in Spain and Italy (Action 1345). Soil erosion was reduced, with two controlled studies from Israel and the USA finding less erosion in soils with cover crops compared to bare soils, while soil aggregation improved with more water-stable soil aggregates in plots with winter cover crops in Spain and the USA (Action 1345). Water management showed that cover crops reduced water loss through drainage, runoff, or evaporation in five controlled studies from France, Israel, Spain, and the USA, and reduced nitrate leaching in four studies from Spain and the USA (Action 1357). For crop production, results were variable: six studies from Spain and the USA found lower cash crop yields with winter cover crops, three studies from Italy and the USA found higher yields, eight studies found inconsistent differences, and seven studies found no differences (Action 1351). However, studies consistently showed that legume cover crops provided better results, with eight studies from Italy, Spain, and the USA finding higher cash crop yields in plots with legumes as winter cover crops compared to non-legumes (Action 1351). In orchards and vineyards, which are common in Mediterranean agriculture, ten studies from Chile, France, Spain, and the USA found more organic matter in soils with ground cover, and meta-analyses from Mediterranean climates confirmed increased organic matter with ground cover (Action 1367).",

Two meta-analyses of studies from Mediterranean climates\\u00a0also found more organic matter in plots with ground cover.\\n\\nImplementation options (4 studies): One study from France\\u00a0found more organic matter in soils with permanent ground cover, compared to temporary ground cover, in one of three comparisons. Two studies from the USA\\u00a0found similar amounts of organic matter in soils with resident vegetation or seeded cover crops. One study from Spain\\u00a0found more organic matter where cover crops were incorporated into the soil.\\n\\nNutrients (12 studies)\\n\\nNitrogen (9 studies): Five studies (four replicated, randomized, and controlled, and one site comparison) from Chile and Spain\\u00a0found more nitrogen in soils with ground cover, compared to soils without ground cover, in some or all comparisons. One replicated, randomized, controlled study from the USA\\u00a0found less nitrogen in soils with ground cover, in some comparisons. Two replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Spain\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0found inconsistent differences in nitrogen between soils with or without ground cover.

Two studies from vineyards in the USA\\u00a0found similar amounts of nitrogen in soils with resident vegetation or seeded cover crops. One of these studies\\u00a0also found similar amounts of nitrogen in soils with different types of seeded cover crops, and in soils with or without tillage (both with ground cover).

One study from Spain\\u00a0found different amounts of phosphorus in soils with different types of seeded cover crops. \\n\\n\\nPotassium (3 studies): One replicated, randomized, controlled study from Chile found more potassium in soils with seeded cover crops, compared to bare soils. Two site comparisons (one replicated) from France\\u00a0and Spain\\u00a0found similar amounts of potassium in soils with ground cover, compared to tilled or bare soil.  \\n\\nImplementation options (1 study): One study from the USA\\u00a0found similar amounts of potassium in soils with resident vegetation or seeded cover crops. \\n\\n\\npH (4 studies): Two studies (one replicated, randomized, and controlled, and one site comparison) from Spain\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0found lower pH levels in soils with ground cover, compared to soils without ground cover.

One replicated, randomized, controlled study from the USA\\u00a0found inconsistent differences in mycorrhizae in soils with seeded cover crops or tilled soils. \\nBacteria (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study from Spain\\u00a0found more bacteria, but similar levels of bacterial diversity, in soils with ground cover, compared to bare soils. \\nNematodes (1 study): One replicated site comparison from France\\u00a0found more nematodes in soils with ground cover, compared to bare soils.  \\n\\nImplementation options (1 study): One study from France\\u00a0found more nematodes in soils with permanent ground cover, compared to temporary ground cover, in one of three comparisons.\\n\\n\\n\\nSoil erosion and aggregation (10 studies)\\n\\nSoil erosion (7 studies): Six replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Chile, Italy, Spain, and the USA\\u00a0found less erosion of soils with ground cover, compared to bare or tilled soils, in some comparisons\\u00a0or all comparisons.
