For aquaculture systems, six studies found that acoustic devices reduced predation on caged salmon by grey seals, harbour seals and South American sea lions, and reduced harbour seal approaches to fish cages in four of six studies (action ID: 2775). However, two studies found no reduction in harbour seal predation or bottlenose dolphin presence around fin-fish farms. For fishing applications, five studies on fishing vessels showed varied results, with one study finding that bottlenose dolphins avoided boats more frequently with acoustic devices, while others showed reduced dolphin foraging and socializing behavior, but no effect on predation of squid catches by Risso's dolphins (action ID: 2815). Two studies on attaching acoustically reflective objects to fishing gear found no reduction in dolphin entanglements or sperm whale predation on fish catches (action ID: 2806). One study using acoustic decoys on fishing lines found fewer sperm whales approached when decoys were placed further away, but no difference in whale presence or arrival times (action ID: 2820).",
