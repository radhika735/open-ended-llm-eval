Using grazing instead of cutting also produced mixed results for natural pest control. Two studies found grazing had mixed effects on natural enemies, with some species affected on certain dates but not others, while one study found no effect on natural enemies. For pest control specifically, five studies found varied results: one study found more pests when grazing instead of cutting was used, two found effects varied between pest groups and sampling dates, and two studies found no effect on pests. Additionally, leaving part of the pasture unharvested or uncut showed more promising results for pest control, with three studies finding increased abundance of predatory insects or spiders in partially cut fields, and two studies finding decreased pest numbers in partially cut plots.",

Using pesticides only when pests or crop damage reach threshold levels (action 750) increased natural enemy numbers in two of three years, though effects lasted as little as three weeks, and required fewer pesticide applications with lower production costs while maintaining satisfactory pest control in most cases. Delaying herbicide use (action 774) resulted in more natural enemies in two randomized controlled trials, though benefits varied between different natural enemy groups and were sometimes short-term. Reducing general pesticide, herbicide or fertilizer use (action 3897) led to greater species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths in eight studies across various agricultural systems, while reduced pesticide use (action 2013) increased bat activity and diversity on farms with fewer chemical inputs. Using genetically modified crops that produce pesticide instead of conventional applications (action 3895) showed no additional harm to caterpillar survival or growth compared to non-GM crops.",
