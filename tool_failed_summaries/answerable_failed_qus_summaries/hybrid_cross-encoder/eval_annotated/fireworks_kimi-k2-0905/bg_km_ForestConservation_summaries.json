Four of five studies found that fencing to exclude grazing increased survival, size and cover of planted trees, while only one study found no effect on tree survival and another found mixed effects depending on fence structure. Fencing was particularly effective against large native herbivores, with five of ten studies showing increased cover and size of understory plants, though results varied by species and some studies found no effect. Two replicated, controlled studies found that wire fencing increased tree density. In contrast, evidence for individual tree guards is more limited. Only one replicated, randomized, controlled study found that light-colored plastic tree shelters increased survival rates of planted tree seedlings, while another replicated, controlled study found tree guards increased tree height after 37 months but not after 44 months, suggesting the protective effect may be temporary.",

    "relevant_summary": "Several interventions are available to improve soil conditions and enhance tree growth in degraded forest areas. For soil improvement, adding organic matter such as leaf litter can increase species richness of young trees (Action ID: 1250), though effects may vary depending on forest canopy conditions. Compost amendments show positive effects, with municipal compost greatly reducing soil loss and water runoff in semi-arid conditions (Action ID: 890), while organic processing wastes can improve soil structure and reduce soil loss (Action ID: 891). Mixed organic and inorganic amendments increase soil microbial biomass and activity, soil organic carbon, and nutrient levels (Action ID: 902). Ground preparation before planting increases survival and growth rates of planted trees (Action ID: 1263). For enhancing tree growth, fertilizer application has mixed results, with some studies showing increased plant cover, biomass, and tree size, while others find no significant effects (Action ID: 1248). Adding root-associated fungi before planting shows limited benefits, with most studies finding no effect on tree survival or growth, though some specific fungal treatments may increase survival for certain species (Action ID: 1841). Soil disturbance techniques decrease understory vegetation cover (Action ID: 1252), while different soil enhancers show mixed effects on tree seedling survival and height (Action ID: 1153).",

In Brazil, UK, and Costa Rica, preventing livestock grazing showed positive effects with increased survival, species richness and diversity of understory plants. In Israel specifically, preventing cattle grazing increased the density of oak seedlings and saplings. Studies using wire fences to exclude livestock showed effectiveness across multiple continents including Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Israel, New Zealand, Spain, West Africa and the USA, with most finding increased biomass, species richness, density and cover of understory plants. In Mexico, Kenya, Israel and Panama, wire fence exclusion increased regenerating tree size and density. Spain was specifically studied for seasonal grazing control, where shortening the livestock grazing period increased the abundance and size of regenerating oak trees, while in Australia, shortening grazing periods showed no effect on native plant species richness, and in the UK, tree seedlings were more abundant following summer compared to winter grazing. Reptile conservation studies in Argentina, Australia and Mexico found that ungrazed areas generally had higher reptile abundance than grazed areas. Greece showed positive responses with increased understory biomass when grazing intensity was reduced, while the UK demonstrated increased tree sapling numbers with reduced grazing intensity.",

Effects vary by technique:\n\nGroup-selection harvesting: Four studies found it increased cover and diversity of understory plants and density of young trees, while two studies found decreased understory species richness and biomass, and two studies found no effect on understory species richness/diversity or tree density/growth-rate.\n\nThinning by girdling: One study found it increased understory plant species richness, diversity and cover.\n\nThinning followed by prescribed fire: Three studies found it increased cover and abundance of understory plants and density of deciduous trees, while one study found decreased tree density and species richness, and three studies found no effect or mixed effects on tree growth rate and density of young trees.\n\nThinning within forests: Seventeen studies found it increased density and cover of understory plants, while seven found no effect or mixed effects and one found decreased herbaceous species abundance. Thirteen studies found it increased species richness and diversity of understory plants, while seven found no effect.\n\nShelterwood harvesting: Found to have similar species richness to unharvested forest and higher richness than patch-cutting or clearcutting, with faster recovery of moth species richness compared to group selection harvesting or clearcutting.\n\nSelective/reduced impact logging and harvesting groups of trees: Found to have similar species richness to unharvested forest and higher richness than clearcutting.\n\nClearing/opening patches: One study found higher reptile species richness in areas where trees were removed to create clearings, while other studies found mixed effects on species abundance.",
