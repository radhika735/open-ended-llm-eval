However, one study in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire found that a thinned forest had a similar species richness and diversity of fruit-feeding butterflies to an unmanaged, naturally regenerating forest, though rarer species were less frequently caught in the thinned forest [3940]. In the Czech Republic, one study found that partially-cleared forest plots had higher butterfly but lower moth species richness than closed-canopy plots [3940].\n\nSelective or reduced impact logging is another potential alternative. In Brazil, one study found that a forest managed by reduced impact logging had a similar species richness and diversity of butterflies to a primary forest but a higher abundance of butterflies [3867]. Another study in Brazil noted that fruit-feeding butterfly abundance was highest in forests with intermediate intensity reduced impact logging [3867]. Conversely, a study in the USA found that forests harvested by single tree selection had a lower moth species richness than unharvested forests [3867].\n\nEncouraging natural regeneration in former plantations or logged forests can also be beneficial. A study in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire found that rarer species of fruit-feeding butterflies were more frequently caught in a naturally regenerating forest than in a thinned one [3876]. In Japan, a study found that naturally regenerating forests had greater moth species richness and abundance than plantations [3876]. Similarly, a study in Uganda reported that naturally regenerating forests had butterfly species richness and abundance similar to pristine forests, with the highest levels observed 12\u201325 years after felling [3876].",

Twelve of 15 studies found that agri-environment schemes led to higher species richness or diversity of butterflies and moths on various habitats compared to conventional farming (3915). However, three studies showed no difference in species richness, and one found lower richness on managed grassland compared to abandoned grassland (3915). In terms of population, 17 of 19 studies reported higher abundance of butterflies and moths in areas managed under these schemes (3915). Conversely, three studies in Finland and the Czech Republic observed lower butterfly and moth abundance on grasslands under agri-environment schemes compared to unmanaged grasslands (3915). One study in the UK found that providing advice to landowners about agri-environment schemes resulted in a high number of applications and a large area of farmland being managed for the marsh fritillary butterfly (3846). Additionally, a study on undersowing spring cereals with legumes and grasses in the UK revealed a higher species richness and abundance of butterflies compared to grassland (3926). However, a similar study in Switzerland found that a larger area of in-field agri-environment scheme options, including undersown cereals, did not result in a higher species richness or abundance of butterflies (3926).",
