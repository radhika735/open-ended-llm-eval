    "relevant_summary": "Several factors influence the success of chemical control for invasive aquatic plants like water primrose and parrot's feather, including the type of herbicide used and the addition of adjuvants.\n\nFor water primrose, the herbicide triclopyr TEA was found to kill 100% of young plants (1139). Glyphosate has also been shown to be effective, with its success being influenced by the use of adjuvants. When mixed with a non-oil based sticking agent, glyphosate resulted in 97% mortality, which increased to 100% when combined with the adjuvant TopFilm (1139). The use of glyphosate with the surfactant Cygnet-Plus, followed by mechanical removal, resulted in a 75% kill rate (1140). Another herbicide, halosulfuron-methyl, has been shown to significantly reduce water primrose coverage (1139). Combining herbicide application with physical removal and other management actions has also been shown to be effective, reducing Peruvian primrose-willow coverage by 85-90% in one study (1140).\n\nFor parrot's feather, the choice of herbicide also plays a significant role in control efforts. The herbicide 2,4-D has been shown to reduce the growth of parrot's feather and was more effective than diquat, glyphosate, or imazapyr in one study (1606). The combination of 2,4-D with other herbicides has also proven effective, with a combined application of 2,4-D and MCPA leading to the complete elimination of the plant in one study (1606). Similarly, combining 2,4-D and carfentrazone-ethyl was more effective than dichlobenil alone in the short term (1606). Other herbicides that have been shown to reduce the growth or biomass of parrot's feather include dichlobenil, imazamox, imazapyr, glyphosate, gluphosinate-ammonium, flumioxazin and florpyrauxifen-benzyl (1699).

The herbicide 2,4-D has been shown to reduce the growth of parrot's feather and was more effective than diquat, glyphosate, or imazapyr in one study (1606). The combination of 2,4-D with other herbicides has also proven effective, with a combined application of 2,4-D and MCPA leading to the complete elimination of the plant in one study (1606). Similarly, combining 2,4-D and carfentrazone-ethyl was more effective than dichlobenil alone in the short term (1606). Other herbicides that have been shown to reduce the growth or biomass of parrot's feather include dichlobenil, imazamox, imazapyr, glyphosate, gluphosinate-ammonium, flumioxazin and florpyrauxifen-benzyl (1699). However, not all herbicides are effective, with fluridone, clopyralid, and copper chelate failing to reduce growth in some studies (1699).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"1139\",\n    \"1140\",\n    \"1606\",\n    \"1699\"\n  ]\n}"
