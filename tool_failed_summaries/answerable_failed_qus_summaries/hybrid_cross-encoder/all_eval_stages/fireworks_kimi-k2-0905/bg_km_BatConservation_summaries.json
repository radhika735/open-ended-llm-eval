Hedge management showed benefits, with one study finding more bat species along hedges trimmed 3+ years prior compared to those trimmed the previous winter, and higher activity of some species. Field size reduction showed positive effects, with one study finding higher activity of six of seven bat species in landscapes with smaller fields compared to larger fields. Tree plantation creation showed mixed results with two of three studies finding no difference in bat activity compared to grazing land, though one study found higher activity in plantations next to remnant vegetation, but all studies found lower activity in plantations compared to original forest. Riparian buffer retention showed no difference in pipistrelle activity compared to conventional waterways. Engaging farmers to manage land for bats resulted in 77 management agreements covering 6,536 ha of land, with greater horseshoe bat populations increasing at four maternity roosts during the five-year project.

    "relevant_summary": "The documented evidence shows mixed results from modifying subterranean bat roosts. For cave gates, three of four before-and-after studies found more or similar numbers of bats in caves after gates were installed to restrict public access, while one study found fewer bats. However, a replicated, site comparison study in Spain found no difference in population growth rates between caves with and without gates. One study found that bats hibernating in a cave with a gate lost more body mass than those in unmodified caves. Behaviorally, multiple studies show negative impacts: bats circled more and entered mines/caves less after gates were installed, with some evidence suggesting funnel-design gates are more bat-friendly than other designs.\n\nFor mine gates, the evidence is more predominantly negative. Two studies found fewer bats in mines after gates were installed, and bats circled more and entered mines less frequently. One study found up to 7% of bats collided with mine gates, though some bat activity remained stable or increased at five of seven gated mines in another study.\n\nCreating artificial caves or hibernacula shows promise, with studies documenting uptake by up to four bat species and increasing numbers of bats using artificial hibernacula over time. However, no evaluations were found for restoring microclimate in modified caves, providing artificial roosts in reclaimed mines, or reopening closed mine entrances.",

    "relevant_summary": "Urban bat conservation involves creating both roosting and foraging habitat. For roosting habitat, providing bat boxes has been extensively studied with 44 studies showing bats use boxes in urban areas among other habitats, with 72 bat species worldwide using bat boxes (Action 1024). Artificial hollows created in trees have also shown success, with long-eared bats using 8 of 16 artificial hollows in one Australian study (Action 2047). Managing the microclimate of artificial roosts by reducing internal temperatures can increase bat occupancy in building-based roosts (Action 2052). Protecting existing habitat is also important - protecting brownfield or ex-industrial sites as urban wildlife refuges has been shown to support bat communities, with one study recording five bat species in such a protected site (Action 953). While retaining veteran and standing dead trees as roosting sites has been recommended, no studies have directly evaluated this action (Action 993).\n\nFor foraging habitat, creating or restoring bat foraging habitat in urban areas has shown mixed results. Studies of green roofs found greater bat activity over biodiverse green roofs compared to conventional unvegetated roofs in the UK, and greater activity for some species over green roofs in the USA (Action 954).

A review of 44 studies found that 72 bat species used bat boxes, with 18 species using them commonly and 31 species using them as maternity roosts. Studies show bats used bat boxes in various habitats including forests, farmland, wetlands, and urban areas. Bat box effectiveness varies by design, with black boxes preferred over lighter colors, and multi-chamber designs showing higher occupancy. Larger boxes tend to have higher occupancy rates. Position affects success, with boxes on buildings showing higher occupancy than those on trees in some studies.\n\nArtificial caves or hibernacula are also effective, with four studies finding that these structures were used by up to four bat species, and one study reporting increasing bat numbers over nine years after construction.\n\nLimited evidence exists for other types of artificial roosts. Creating alternative roosts within developments showed mixed results, with bats using purpose-built roosts at 13-74% of development sites, though bats used new roosts in lower numbers than original roosts in some cases. Artificial tree hollows had some success, with eight of 16 hollows being used by long-eared bats in one study.",

    "relevant_summary": "Studies have identified several key design and placement factors that influence artificial bat roost occupancy rates. Color is an important factor, with bats preferring black bat boxes over grey, white, or wooden ones. Box orientation and sunlight exposure significantly affect occupancy, with orientation being a critical factor in three studies. Height placement also matters, with two studies finding that box height affected occupancy rates. Location type is crucial - bat boxes on buildings show higher occupancy than those on trees, and installation in areas where bats previously roosted increases occupancy rates. Design specifications matter as larger bat boxes show higher occupancy in some studies, and boxes with multiple compartments attract more bats during breeding season. Material choice affects occupancy, with concrete boxes outperforming wooden ones, and heated boxes showing mixed results. The number of boxes installed at a site is positively correlated with occupancy likelihood. Habitat context influences success, with higher occupancy in farm forestry sites versus native forest, pine stands versus mixed deciduous forest, and forest fragments versus pasture. Temperature management within roosts can increase occupancy, with modifications that reduce internal temperatures resulting in more bats in two studies.",

    "relevant_summary": "Several habitat creation and restoration actions have been shown to increase bat abundance. Creating or restoring bat foraging habitat in urban areas resulted in higher bat activity in restored forest fragments and 'biodiverse' green roofs in the USA and UK (Action ID: 954). Restoring bat foraging habitat at ex-quarry sites in France showed higher overall bat activity 10 years after restoration compared to during quarrying (Action ID: 2286). Creating and maintaining small dams as foraging and drinking habitat in Portugal resulted in greater activity of four bat species compared to streams (Action ID: 1997). Avoiding illumination of bat foraging, drinking and swarming sites led to greater activity of multiple bat species at unlit water troughs and ponds in Italy and Israel (Action ID: 2018). Artificial roost structures were also effective, with studies showing bats used 54-100% of provided bat boxes across various habitats in Europe, North America, South America and Australia, and black colored boxes were preferred over grey, white or wooden alternatives (Action ID: 1024). Artificial hollows cut into trees had 50% occupancy by roosting long-eared bats in Australia (Action ID: 2047).",

Installing and maintaining cave gates to restrict public access has shown mixed results, with some studies finding more or similar numbers of bats after gate installation, while others found fewer bats (Action ID: 999). Similarly, installing gates at mine entrances has shown varied effects, with some mines continuing to be used while others were abandoned depending on gate design (Action ID: 1963). Other potential actions include restoring and maintaining microclimate in modified caves, though no studies have evaluated this yet (Action ID: 1001), and retaining bat access points to caves (Action ID: 1990).
