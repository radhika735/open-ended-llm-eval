Seven studies found that applying glyphosate reduced Crassula helmsii, with one before-and-after study showing a 98% reduction when glyphosate was combined with diquat (action 1279). Three out of four studies found that applying diquat or diquat alginate reduced cover or eradicated submerged C. helmsii (action 1279). Two replicated, controlled container trials and two before-and-after field trials found that seawater eradicated Crassula helmsii (action 1288). When used in combination, covering C. helmsii with carpet followed by glyphosate treatment killed 80% of the plant (action 1313).\n\nThe least effective non-physical control methods documented include hydrogen peroxide, hot foam, and aquatic dyes. One controlled study using tank trials found that hydrogen peroxide did not control Crassula helmsii (action 1281). One replicated, controlled study found that treatment with hot foam, along with other treatments, did not reduce cover of Crassula helmsii, though one before-and-after study found hot foam partially destroyed the plant (action 1286). One replicated, controlled study found that applying aquatic dye, along with other treatments, did not reduce coverage of Crassula helmsii (action 1293). Results for grazing were mixed, with one study finding that excluding grazing reduced abundance and coverage while another found no difference between grazed and ungrazed plots (action 1301).

Lightproof barriers using black sheeting or carpet strips eradicated or severely reduced Crassula helmsii cover in five before-and-after studies in the UK, though the plant progressively recolonized two sites where it had initially been reported as eradicated (Action 1294). A combination approach using carpet covering followed by glyphosate herbicide treatment killed 80% of Crassula helmsii plants in one UK pond study (Action 1313). For skunk cabbage, chemical control using herbicides shows mixed results - one UK study found that glyphosate and 2,4-D Amine both killed all skunk cabbage plants in test areas, while another UK study found that 2,4-D amine at 9 litres/ha successfully eradicated skunk cabbage but glyphosate was unsuccessful with only limited growth reduction (Action 1102). Physical removal can be effective for skunk cabbage - a Swiss study found that annual physical removal of recently established plants over five years removed the entire stock, and a Netherlands study found manual removal effective for small outbreaks of small-growing plants, though a German study reported that after four years of twice yearly full removal, a large number of plants still needed removal each year (Action 1101).",

Chemical treatment methods include dosing with biocides such as chlorine, potassium and copper, which killed Asian clams in laboratory studies (Action 1118). Higher concentrations of chlorine and bromine, delivered at higher temperatures, shortened the time required to kill Asian clams (Action 1118). Fat-coated particles called BioBullets killed 100% of Asian clams within pipes in Spanish irrigation systems (Action 1118). Physical cleaning methods include mechanical removal and regular cleaning of industrial pipes, which were effective methods of permanently removing Asian clams in Portugal (Action 1119). Addition of sand filters was effective at reducing numbers of Asian clams (Action 1119). Temperature manipulation is another option, as temperatures of 36\u00b0C or higher killed Asian clams within or after four days in laboratory studies (Action 1116). For water body management, suction dredging reduced Asian clam densities by 96% over two weeks with effects persisting for a year (Action 1120), and three types of dredges resulted in biomass reduction ranging from 74% to >95% (Action 1120). However, reducing oxygen in water was found to be ineffective, as Asian clams were resistant to extremely low oxygen levels regardless of water temperature or length of immersion (Action 1113).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, several factors influence the success of chemical control for invasive aquatic plants like water primrose and parrot's feather:\n\nHerbicide Type: Different herbicides show varying effectiveness against these plants. For water primrose, triclopyr TEA at 0.25% concentration killed 100% of young plants within two months (action 1139). Glyphosate showed varying effectiveness, achieving 97% mortality when mixed with a non-oil based sticking agent and 100% mortality when combined with TopFilm (action 1139). For parrot's feather, multiple herbicide types were tested with different results: carfentrazone-ethyl reduced growth (action 1676); endothall reduced growth in laboratory studies but showed temporary effects in field studies (action 1681); diquat reduced growth in laboratory studies but not in field studies (action 1680); 2,4-D reduced growth and showed greater effectiveness than diquat, glyphosate or imazapyr (action 1606); triclopyr reduced growth and was more effective than glyphosate (action 1689).\n\nUse of Adjuvants: The use of adjuvants significantly affects herbicide success. For water primrose, glyphosate mixed with a non-oil based sticking agent achieved 97% mortality, while glyphosate combined with TopFilm achieved 100% mortality (action 1139). For floating pennywort, glyphosate applied without an adjuvant achieved negligible mortality compared to other treatments (action 1127).\n\nHerbicide Combinations: Combined herbicide applications can be more effective than single herbicides. For parrot's feather, the combined application of 2,4-D and MCPA completely eliminated the plant, while 2,4-D combined with carfentrazone-ethyl led to higher reduction in cover than dichlobenil at eight days after treatment (action 1606).\n\nPlant Age/Size: Plant developmental stage affects control success, as triclopyr TEA was specifically effective against young cultivated water primrose (action 1139).\n\nApplication Environment: Laboratory versus field conditions showed different results, with several herbicides showing effectiveness in controlled laboratory studies but reduced effectiveness in field conditions for parrot's feather (actions 1680, 1681).",

For water primrose, triclopyr TEA at 0.25% concentration killed 100% of young plants within two months (action 1139). Glyphosate showed varying effectiveness, achieving 97% mortality when mixed with a non-oil based sticking agent and 100% mortality when combined with TopFilm (action 1139). For parrot's feather, multiple herbicide types were tested with different results: carfentrazone-ethyl reduced growth (action 1676); endothall reduced growth in laboratory studies but showed temporary effects in field studies (action 1681); diquat reduced growth in laboratory studies but not in field studies (action 1680); 2,4-D reduced growth and showed greater effectiveness than diquat, glyphosate or imazapyr (action 1606); triclopyr reduced growth and was more effective than glyphosate (action 1689).\\n\\nUse of Adjuvants: The use of adjuvants significantly affects herbicide success. For water primrose, glyphosate mixed with a non-oil based sticking agent achieved 97% mortality, while glyphosate combined with TopFilm achieved 100% mortality (action 1139). For floating pennywort, glyphosate applied without an adjuvant achieved negligible mortality compared to other treatments (action 1127).\\n\\nHerbicide Combinations: Combined herbicide applications can be more effective than single herbicides. For parrot's feather, the combined application of 2,4-D and MCPA completely eliminated the plant, while 2,4-D combined with carfentrazone-ethyl led to higher reduction in cover than dichlobenil at eight days after treatment (action 1606).\\n\\nPlant Age/Size: Plant developmental stage affects control success, as triclopyr TEA was specifically effective against young cultivated water primrose (action 1139).\\n\\nApplication Environment: Laboratory versus field conditions showed different results, with several herbicides showing effectiveness in controlled laboratory studies but reduced effectiveness in field conditions for parrot's feather (actions 1680, 1681).\", \"action_ids\": [\"1139\",\"1676\",\"1681\",\"1680\",\"1606\",\"1689\",\"1699\",\"1127\"]}",
