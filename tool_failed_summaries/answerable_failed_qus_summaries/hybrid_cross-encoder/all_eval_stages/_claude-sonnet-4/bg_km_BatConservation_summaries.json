    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence from studies evaluating agricultural management practices, several farming and habitat management approaches show varying effects on bat populations. Organic farming practices show mixed results compared to conventional farming: five of nine studies found no differences in overall bat activity between organic and non-organic farms, while four studies found higher overall bat activity, bat feeding activity, Brazilian free-tailed bat activity, and activity of four of seven bat species on organic farms (Action 961). Similarly, five of seven studies found no difference in the number of bat species between organic and non-organic farms, while two studies found more bat species on organic farms (Action 961). \n\nHedge management practices demonstrate positive effects on bat populations: hedges trimmed three or more years prior had more bat species recorded along them and higher activity of two of eight bat species compared to hedges trimmed during the previous winter (Action 1943). However, pipistrelle activity did not differ between hedges managed for wildlife on agri-environment scheme farms and hedges on conventional farms (Action 1943).\n\nField size affects bat activity, with agricultural landscapes containing smaller fields showing higher activity of six of seven bat species compared to landscapes with larger fields (Action 1939). Farmer and landowner engagement for bat management resulted in increased greater horseshoe bat populations at four maternity roosts and led to 77 bat-related management agreements covering approximately 6,536 hectares (Action 1936).\n\nTree plantations on agricultural land showed limited benefits: three studies found no difference in the number of bat species in agricultural areas with and without native tree plantations, and two of three studies found no difference in bat activity, though bat activity was consistently lower in plantations compared to original forest and woodland remnants (Action 958).\n\nAgri-environment schemes produced inconsistent results: two of three studies found that overall bat activity or occurrence of six bat species did not differ significantly between farms under agri-environment schemes and conventional farms, while one study found lower overall bat activity and pipistrelle species activity on agri-environment scheme farms (Action 962).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, providing artificial roosts for bats shows several documented benefits and some limitations. Benefits include successful bat usage, with 41 of 43 studies finding that bats used bat boxes installed in various habitats including forests, farmland, urban areas, and buildings (Action 1024). A worldwide review found that 72 bat species used bat boxes, with 18 species commonly using them and 31 species using them as maternity roosts (Action 1024). Nine studies showed increased bat usage by 2-10 times up to 10 years after installation (Action 1024). Artificial caves and hibernacula were successfully used by up to four bat species in studies from Germany and the UK (Action 2049), with one UK study showing increasing bat numbers over nine years (Action 2049). Artificial hollows cut into trees were used by long-eared bats in Australia (Action 2047). Modified artificial roosts in buildings showed increased bat numbers after temperature modifications in Spain (Action 2052). Road bridge spaces created for bats were recolonized by bats in similar or greater numbers at four of eight sites in the USA (Action 1967). However, limitations were also documented. Studies found bats occupying less than half of provided bat boxes in 22 studies (Action 1024). Two studies showed bats displaced from buildings did not use 43 bat houses of four different designs or 12 heated bat boxes (Action 1024). Purpose-built roosts in developments were found to be four times less likely to be used by returning bats compared to retained roosts (Action 949). Two studies found lower bat usage in new purpose-built roosts compared to original destroyed roosts (Action 949). Additionally, heated bat boxes were used at only one of seven sites and none were used by maternity colonies in one UK study (Action 2052).",

    "relevant_summary": "Documented benefits of modifying subterranean bat roosts include: maintaining microclimate in abandoned mines resulted in a greater number of bats hibernating within the mine (action 1964); installing cave gates led to population increases or decreased rates of decline for 13 of 20 colonies of Indiana bat, with three of four studies finding more or similar numbers of bats in caves after gates were installed (action 999); creating artificial caves or hibernacula showed that bats used these structures, with the number of bats using an artificial hibernaculum increasing in each of nine years after it was built (action 2049); and 43 of 47 mines continued to be used 12 years after gates were installed (action 1963). Documented harms include: installing mine gates resulted in fewer bat species entering mines, fewer bats in mines or at mine entrances, and up to 7% of bats at mine entrances collided with mine gates (action 1963); cave gates caused bats to circle more and enter caves less, with bats hibernating in a cave with a wall and gate losing more body mass than bats in an unmodified cave (action 999); and bats abandoned four mines with 'ladder' design gates (action 1963). Many specific modification approaches lack documented studies, including restoring microclimate in modified caves, providing artificial subterranean roosts to replace disturbed cave or mine roosts, relocating bats from reclaimed mines, and reopening closed mine entrances (actions 1001, 1005, 974, 975, 1965).",

Changing the timing of building work to avoid sensitive periods showed that carrying out roofing work outside of the bat maternity season, along with retaining bat access points, resulted in a similar number of brown long-eared bats continuing to use a roost within an attic (Action 950). Creating alternative bat roosts within developments has been evaluated in eleven studies, with evidence showing that bat boxes or bat lofts were used by bats at 13-74% of development sites, though new bat boxes/lofts built to replace destroyed roosts were four times less likely to be used by returning bats than roosts retained during development (Action 949). Relocating access points to bat roosts within developments showed mixed results, with one study finding fewer brown long-eared bats used a roost after access points were relocated, while another found that lesser horseshoe bats used alternative access points with different designs (Action 946). Legal protection during development through licensing showed that 68% of roosts were destroyed despite licensing, though 31-67% of compensation roosts provided under licence were used by bats (Action 1935). Conserving roosting sites in old structures showed increased bat numbers in some cases, with greater numbers hibernating in a railway tunnel after access grilles were installed and wood attached to tunnel walls (Action 2046). Training for the building and development sector on bat ecology and conservation to reduce roost disturbance is mentioned as an action, though no studies have evaluated its effectiveness (Action 997). Installing sound-proofing insulation between bat roosts and human-occupied areas is another potential measure, though also lacks evaluation studies (Action 1929).",

Installing sound-proofing insulation between bat roosts and human-occupied areas is another potential measure, though also lacks evaluation studies (Action 1929).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"950\",\n    \"949\",\n    \"946\",\n    \"1935\",\n    \"2046\",\n    \"997\",\n    \"1929\"\n  ]\n}"

One replicated, paired sites study in South Africa found a similar number of bat species over farm ponds and in grassland/crops, trees, vineyards or orchards (Action 959). For livestock water troughs, one replicated, paired sites study in the USA found that removing livestock modifications from water troughs resulted in bats drinking from them more frequently, and bats approached troughs fewer times before successfully drinking from them (Action 1951). One paired sites study in the USA found that livestock water tanks that were larger, full of water or surrounded by sparse vegetation had more bats drinking from them than smaller, half full tanks surrounded by no or dense vegetation (Action 1951). One replicated, site comparison study in Portugal found that reservoirs created using small dams had greater activity (relative abundance) of four bat species than the streams feeding into them (Action 1997).

Regarding chemical pollution from timber treatments, one study evaluated restricting the timing of timber treatment application and found that treating timber with lindane and pentachlorophenol 14 months prior to exposure by bats increased survival but did not prevent death (Action 1023). However, no studies were found that evaluated the effects of using mammal-safe timber treatments in roof spaces (Action 1022). For noise mitigation measures, no studies were found evaluating the effects of installing sound barriers in proximity to bat roosts and habitats (Action 2023), installing sound-proofing insulation between bat roosts and areas occupied by humans within developments (Action 1929), or imposing noise limits in proximity to bat roosts and habitats (Action 1021). One study in caves found that experimental cave tours with groups that did not talk resulted in fewer bat flights than when groups did talk, but talking did not affect the number of bat movements (Action 1995). Regarding chemical pollution more broadly, studies have shown that reducing pesticide, herbicide and fertiliser use benefits bat populations, with farms using few or no chemicals showing different bat species compositions, higher diversity, higher activity levels, and better body condition compared to those with high chemical inputs (Action 2013).",

One UK study found that pipistrelle activity did not differ between unmown field margins managed for wildlife on agri-environment scheme farms and field margins on conventional farms (Action 1940). However, one UK study found that the activity of soprano pipistrelles and barbastelle bats increased with a greater diversity of plant species within field margins, though there was no effect on common pipistrelle activity nor on the occurrence of any of the six bat species studied (Action 1941). Additionally, one Canadian study found that agricultural landscapes with smaller fields had higher activity of six of seven bat species than landscapes with larger fields (Action 1939), suggesting that maintaining smaller field sizes may indirectly benefit bats by creating more field boundary habitat. No studies were found that evaluated the effects of planting new hedges or managing ditches specifically for bat conservation in agricultural settings (Actions 1942, 1944).",

    "relevant_summary": "Several actions can be taken in urban environments to create or protect foraging and roosting habitat for bats. For foraging habitat, creating or restoring bat foraging habitat in urban areas has shown positive results, with studies finding greater bat activity over biodiverse green roofs than conventional unvegetated roofs, and greater bat activity for three of five bat species over green roofs than over conventional roofs (action 954). Protecting brownfield or ex-industrial sites can also provide foraging habitat, with one study finding five bat species recorded within a protected urban wildlife refuge on an abandoned manufacturing site (action 953).\n\nFor roosting habitat, providing bat boxes is widely documented as effective, with 41 of 43 studies finding that bats used bat boxes installed in various habitats including urban areas and buildings (action 1024). Studies found that the number of bats using bat boxes increased by 2-10 times up to 10 years after installation, and that 72 bat species have been found to use bat boxes, with 18 species commonly using them (action 1024). Creating alternative bat roosts within developments shows mixed success, with studies finding that bat boxes or bat lofts were used by bats at 13-74% of development sites (action 949).\n\nCreating artificial hollows and cracks in trees can provide roosting sites, with one study finding that eight of 16 artificial hollows cut into trees were used by roosting long-eared bats (action 2047). Creating artificial caves or hibernacula is another option, with studies finding that artificial hibernacula were used by up to four bat species, and the number of bats using an artificial hibernaculum increased in each of nine years after construction (action 2049). Managing the microclimate of artificial bat roosts can improve their effectiveness, with one study finding more bats in artificial roosts after they were modified to reduce internal temperatures (action 2052).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from 44 studies, bat boxes are the most widely documented type of artificial roost for bats (action 1024). The studies found that 41 of 43 studies demonstrated bats using bat boxes across various habitats including forests, farmland, wetlands, and urban areas, with 72 bat species documented using them globally, though only 18 species commonly use them and 31 species use them as maternity roosts. Black bat boxes were more effective than grey, white, or wooden boxes (action 1024). Larger bat boxes showed higher occupancy rates, and rocket boxes were preferred by Indiana bats over wooden boxes or bark-mimic roosts (action 1024). Multi-compartment boxes (two chambers) had higher occupancy than single-compartment designs during breeding season (action 1024). Concrete boxes showed higher occupancy rates than wooden ones (action 1024). Artificial caves and hibernacula represent another effective type, with four studies showing these structures were used by up to four bat species, and one study found increasing bat usage over nine years in an artificial hibernaculum (action 2049). Tree hollows created artificially showed promise, with eight of 16 artificial hollows cut into trees being used by roosting long-eared bats (action 2047). However, heated bat boxes showed limited effectiveness, with studies finding minimal use by common pipistrelle bats and no use by displaced Natterer's bats (action 2052). The positioning of artificial roosts affects effectiveness, with studies showing that box orientation, sunlight exposure, height, and location (buildings vs trees) all influence occupancy rates (action 1024). Alternative roosts within developments showed mixed success, with bat boxes or bat lofts being used at 13-74% of development sites, though purpose-built roosts were four times less likely to be used by returning bats compared to retained original roosts (action 949).",

Bats use both resin and wood cylindrical bat boxes, but resin bat boxes become occupied more quickly than wood boxes (Action 1024).

Bat boxes with two compartments are occupied by more bats than one compartment boxes during breeding season (Action 1024). For box placement factors, bat box orientation and the amount of exposure to sunlight affect bat occupancy (Action 1024). Bat box height affects occupancy (Action 1024). Higher occupancy occurs for bat boxes on buildings than on trees (Action 1024). Higher occupancy rates occur in areas where bats were known to roost prior to installing bat boxes (Action 1024). Bat boxes are more likely to be occupied when a greater number of bat boxes are installed across a site (Action 1024). For habitat context, bat boxes have higher occupancy in farm forestry sites than in native forest (Action 1024), higher occupancy in pine relative to mixed deciduous stands (Action 1024), and higher occupancy in forest fragments than in pasture (Action 1024).

Bats use both resin and wood cylindrical bat boxes, but resin bat boxes become occupied more quickly than wood boxes (Action 1024). Concrete bat boxes have higher occupancy rates than wooden bat boxes (Action 1024). Bat boxes with two compartments are occupied by more bats than one compartment boxes during breeding season (Action 1024). For box placement factors, bat box orientation and the amount of exposure to sunlight affect bat occupancy (Action 1024). Bat box height affects occupancy (Action 1024). Higher occupancy occurs for bat boxes on buildings than on trees (Action 1024). Higher occupancy rates occur in areas where bats were known to roost prior to installing bat boxes (Action 1024). Bat boxes are more likely to be occupied when a greater number of bat boxes are installed across a site (Action 1024). For habitat context, bat boxes have higher occupancy in farm forestry sites than in native forest (Action 1024), higher occupancy in pine relative to mixed deciduous stands (Action 1024), and higher occupancy in forest fragments than in pasture (Action 1024).

Restoring bat foraging habitat at ex-quarry sites showed positive results, with one study in France finding that gravel-sand pits had higher overall bat activity 10 years after restoration than before or during quarrying (Action 2286). For roosting habitat, creating artificial hollows and cracks in trees showed some use by bats, with eight of 16 artificial hollows being used by roosting long-eared bats in Australia (Action 2047). However, many other potentially beneficial actions such as providing suitable foraging and roosting habitat at expanding range fronts, restoring abandoned orchards, retaining veteran and standing dead trees, creating linear habitat features/green corridors, and creating unlit commuting routes using planting had no studies available to evaluate their effectiveness for bat populations.",

Ultraviolet filters on lights showed species-specific responses, with one UK study finding that hedges lit with ultraviolet filtered lights had higher soprano pipistrelle activity compared to hedges lit with unfiltered light, but no difference for common pipistrelle activity (Action 1020). Red lighting compared to other colors showed mixed effects across three studies in the Netherlands and UK: one study found red lighting resulted in higher activity for one of three bat species groups than white or green lighting, while another found similar activity of commuting Daubenton's bats in culverts illuminated with red, white, or green light. Additionally, more soprano pipistrelles emerged from a roost when lit with red light than when lit with white light, but no difference was found between red and blue lights (Action 2021). The avoidance of illumination on bat commuting routes showed clear species-specific responses, with two UK studies finding greater activity of lesser horseshoe bats and myotis bats along unlit hedges than along illuminated hedges, while activity was similar for common and soprano pipistrelles and Nyctalus/Eptesicus species. One Netherlands study found that 28-96% of pond bats changed their flight paths to avoid light spill from lamps, and lesser horseshoe bats were active earlier along unlit hedges than along illuminated ones (Action 2017). No studies were found evaluating the effects of using warm white versus cool LED lights on bat populations (Action 2020).",

    "relevant_summary": "Several alternatives to bat boxes can improve subterranean roosting sites for bats in mines and caves. One approach is maintaining microclimate in closed or abandoned mines. One study in the USA found that modifying the microclimate of an abandoned mine by closing a man-made entrance resulted in a greater number of bats hibernating within the mine (Action 1964). Creating artificial caves or hibernacula provides another alternative. Four studies in the UK and Germany found that artificial hibernacula were used by up to four bat species, with one UK study finding that the number of bats using an artificial hibernaculum increased in each of nine years after it was built (Action 2049). Installing and maintaining gates at mine and cave entrances to restrict public access represents another improvement option. Studies show mixed results: one replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that bat activity remained stable or increased at five of seven gated mines (Action 1963). For caves, three of four before-and-after studies in the Netherlands, USA, Spain and Turkey found more or similar numbers of bats in caves after gates were installed to restrict public access, and one replicated, before-and-after study in the USA found that installing cave gates resulted in population increases or decreased rates of decline for 13 of 20 colonies of Indiana bat (Action 999). Additional alternatives include providing artificial subterranean bat roosts to replace roosts in reclaimed mines (Action 974) or disturbed caves (Action 1005), relocating bats from reclaimed mines to alternative subterranean roost sites (Action 975), restoring and maintaining microclimate in modified caves (Action 1001), and retaining bat access points to caves (Action 1990), though no studies were found evaluating the effectiveness of these latter actions.",

Maintaining microclimate in closed/abandoned mines resulted in a greater number of bats hibernating within the mine after modifying the microclimate by closing a man-made entrance (Action 1964). Installing and maintaining gates at mine entrances to restrict public access has mixed effects - while gates can reduce the number of bats entering mines and cause some behavioral changes such as increased circling and reduced entry, they also continued to allow use of 43 of 47 mines 12 years after installation, though some gate designs caused bats to abandon mines (Action 1963). Up to 7% of bats at mine entrances collided with mine gates, but gate design and installation time had varied effects on different bat species (Action 1963). Restoring bat foraging habitat at ex-quarry sites showed positive results, with gravel-sand pits having higher overall bat activity 10 years after restoration than before or during quarrying (Action 2286). Other identified conservation actions include excluding bats from roosts prior to mine reclamation (Action 1961), retaining access points for bats following mine closures (Action 1962), and providing artificial subterranean bat roosts to replace roosts in reclaimed mines (Action 974), though these actions lack direct study evaluation. Additionally, reducing the size of surface features when prospecting for or extracting underground products (Action 3845) and restoring or creating new habitats after mining and quarrying (Action 3862) are potential conservation measures, though specific bat-related research is limited for these approaches.",
