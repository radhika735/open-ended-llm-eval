Research shows that bats successfully use bat boxes installed in farmland and related habitats, with 44 studies demonstrating that bats occupied bat boxes in these environments. Installation of bat boxes in farm forestry sites showed higher occupancy rates compared to native forest locations, indicating their effectiveness in agricultural settings. The number of bats using bat boxes increased by 2–10 times within 10 years after installation, providing measurable population benefits. While agri-environment schemes involving farmer engagement have shown mixed results, bat boxes offer a more direct and proven approach, with studies indicating that 72 bat species have used bat boxes worldwide, and different designs can be selected based on local bat species requirements.",

Studies found bats occupied 0-100% of provided bat boxes, with optimal design factors including black coloration, larger size, concrete construction over wood, and proper placement on buildings rather than trees. Action ID 95 covers bat boxes, bat grilles, and roost improvements, though no specific cost data was captured. For more complex installations, action ID 2049 shows artificial caves/hibernacula were used by up to four bat species in UK and German studies, while action ID 949 indicates alternative roosts within developments had variable success rates (13-74% occupancy at development sites).
