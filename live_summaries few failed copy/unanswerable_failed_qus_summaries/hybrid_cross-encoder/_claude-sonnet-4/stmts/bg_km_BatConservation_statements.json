      "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence, the most cost-effective methods to increase bat populations in agricultural landscapes with proven effectiveness include reducing pesticide, herbicide and fertilizer use and implementing organic farming practices. Action 2013 found that farms using few or no chemicals had higher overall bat activity than those using high chemical inputs, with one study in Germany recording more bat species over grassland with moderate or no fertilizer applications than grassland with high fertilizer applications. Additionally, farms or grasslands with few or no chemical inputs had higher overall bat activity than those using high chemical inputs. Action 961 showed that organic farming can be beneficial, with four of nine studies finding higher overall bat activity, bat feeding activity, and activity of various bat species on organic farms compared to non-organic farms. Two studies found higher activity of Myotis species over water and rivers on organic farms, and one study found higher activity for two of three bat species over organic fields compared to conventionally managed fields.\n\nProviding bat boxes (Action 1024) shows promise as a cost-effective intervention, with 41 of 43 studies finding that bats used bat boxes in various habitats including farmland and pasture, and nine studies showing that bat box use increased by 2-10 times up to 10 years after installation. However, occupancy rates varied widely, with 22 studies finding less than half of boxes occupied and nine studies finding more than half occupied.\n\nAgri-environment schemes (Action 962) showed mixed results, with two of three studies in the UK finding no significant difference in bat activity between farms under agri-environment schemes and conventional farms, while one study found lower overall bat activity on scheme farms. Many other potential interventions such as planting hedges, increasing semi-natural habitat, managing ditches, retaining forest fragments, and providing set-aside areas currently lack direct scientific evidence for their effectiveness on bat populations.",

According to action 1024, forty-four studies evaluated providing bat boxes for roosting bats, with forty-one of 43 studies finding that bats used bat boxes installed in various habitats including forest, woodland, farmland, urban areas, and buildings. A review of 109 studies found that 72 bat species used bat boxes, with 18 species commonly using them and 31 species using them as maternity roosts. \n\nRegarding cost-effectiveness factors, action 1024 indicates that different materials affect usage patterns: bats used black bat boxes more than grey, white or wooden boxes (studies in Germany, Portugal and Australia), bats used both resin and wood cylindrical bat boxes but resin boxes became occupied more quickly than wood boxes (USA studies), and concrete bat boxes had higher occupancy rates than wooden ones (UK study). One study found that larger bat boxes had higher occupancy rates. \n\nFor artificial tree hollows, action 2047 found that eight of 16 artificial hollows cut into trees were used by roosting long-eared bats in Australia. For artificial caves or hibernacula, action 2049 showed that these structures were used by up to four bat species, with one study finding increasing bat usage over nine years after construction.\n\nHowever, studies on managing microclimate in artificial roosts (action 2052) found mixed results with heated bat boxes, suggesting that simple, non-heated designs may be more cost-effective. The evidence indicates that while various artificial roost types can be successful, standard bat boxes appear to offer the best combination of proven effectiveness and likely cost-efficiency based on the extensive research showing their widespread use across multiple species and habitats.",
