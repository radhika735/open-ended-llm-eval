    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from action documents, several interventions have shown effectiveness for restoring peatland vegetation in degraded peatlands, which may be relevant to agricultural landscapes. Multiple intervention techniques have demonstrated positive results, including moss layer transfer technique, which showed that restored areas developed communities of bog-characteristic plant species within 11 years and had greater moss/bryophyte cover (including Sphagnum) compared to unrestored areas after 4-8 years. Multiple intervention approaches (excluding moss layer transfer) were found to increase total moss/bryophyte cover, Sphagnum moss cover, herbaceous plant cover, and overall vegetation cover across multiple studies in bogs and other peatlands. Surface covering with straw mulch showed mixed results, increasing the number of fen-characteristic plants present but not affecting their cover. Seed introduction of peatland trees/shrubs demonstrated variable outcomes, with some studies showing greater shrub cover and total vegetation cover in sown plots compared to unsown plots, while other studies found no difference in shrub cover or species richness. However, survival rates were variable, with some studies reporting seedling death within short timeframes.",

For moss fragments on peatland surfaces (1821), 11 of 13 studies found Sphagnum moss present after 1-4 growing seasons, with cover ranging from negligible to >90%. Sphagnum cover was higher in sown than unsown plots in controlled studies. Other moss species showed cover ranging from negligible to 76%, though cover remained low (<1%) unless plots were mulched, shaded, or limed. When mixed vegetation was spread on peatland surfaces (1822), 17 studies found Sphagnum moss present after 1-6 growing seasons with cover ranging from <1 to 73%, with Sphagnum cover higher in sown than unsown plots in controlled studies. Other mosses showed <1 to 65% cover, and vascular plants appeared in 10 studies, with two controlled studies showing mixed results on vascular plant cover. Direct planting of peatland trees/shrubs (1820) found that eight studies reported majority survival of planted trees/shrubs over periods between 10 weeks and 13 years, though some species showed <50% survival. Four studies reported planted trees grew successfully. Introduction of tree/shrub fragments to freshwater wetlands (3262) showed only 12% overall survival of planted unrooted cuttings over two years in one study, with no seedlings surviving for two of four species. The moss layer transfer technique (1804), which includes spreading moss fragments, resulted in restoration areas developing bog-characteristic plant communities and greater moss/bryophyte cover than unrestored areas after 4-8 years.",

    "relevant_summary": "The evidence base for peatland vegetation restoration after mining or peat extraction shows several promising interventions with varying levels of support. The most direct evidence for post-mining restoration comes from studies of vegetation block replacement, with two studies showing that transplanted peatland vegetation blocks can retain their characteristic plant communities. In one UK bog study, transplanted blocks maintained their community composition over time, while a Canadian fen study found replaced vegetation blocks remained similar to undisturbed fen communities, though Sphagnum moss cover did decline in transplanted blocks.\n\nMultiple intervention approaches have shown positive results in nine studies, including increased moss cover (particularly Sphagnum), enhanced herbaceous plant coverage, and improved overall vegetation cover across bogs, fens, and mixed peatlands. The moss layer transfer technique, tested in four Canadian bog studies, demonstrated successful restoration outcomes with development of bog-characteristic plant communities within 11 years, greater moss and herb cover compared to unrestored areas, and increased plant species richness.\n\nRewetting interventions, while not specific to post-mining sites, provide relevant evidence from 36 studies showing that raising water tables typically increases Sphagnum moss cover, enhances herbaceous vegetation including sedges and cottongrass, and often reduces tree/shrub encroachment. However, rewetting effects on plant community composition varied, with some studies showing development of wetland-characteristic communities while others found no significant changes.\n\nReprofiling/relandscaping without planting showed limited success in one study, with restored bogs developing different plant communities and lower vegetation cover than natural fens after five years. This suggests that physical habitat restoration alone may be insufficient for vegetation recovery without additional interventions.",

Three replicated studies in peatlands in the UK\\u00a0and fens in Germany\\u00a0reported that rewetting typically had no effect, or insignificant effects, on the plant community.\\nCharacteristic plants (11 studies): Five studies (including one replicated site comparison) in peatlands in Canada, the UK, China\\u00a0and Poland\\u00a0reported that rewetting (sometimes\\u00a0along with other interventions) increased the abundance of wetland- or peatland-characteristic plants. Two replicated site comparison studies in fens or fen meadows in central Europe\\u00a0found that rewetting reduced the number of fen-characteristic plant species. Two studies (one replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after) in fens in Sweden\\u00a0reported that rewetting had no effect on cover of fen-characteristic plants.\\u00a0Two before-and-after studies in fens in the USA\\u00a0and New Zealand\\u00a0reported that upland plant cover decreased following rewetting.\\u00a0\\nMoss cover (19 studies):\\u00a0Twelve studies (five replicated, two also paired and controlled) in the UK, Ireland, Germany,\\u00a0Sweden, Latvia, Canada\\u00a0and Spain\\u00a0reported that rewetting bogs, fens or other peatlands (sometimes\\u00a0along with other interventions) increased Sphagnum moss cover or abundance. Three of these studies\\u00a0reported mixed responses by species. Two additional replicated studies, in bogs in Latvia\\u00a0and forested fens in Finland, reported that rewetting had no effect on Sphagnum\\u00a0cover. Five studies (one paired, controlled, before-and-after) in Finland, Sweden\\u00a0and Canada\\u00a0reported that rewetting bogs or fens had no effect on cover of non-Sphagnum mosses (or mosses/lichens). However, two controlled studies in bogs in Ireland\\u00a0and the UK\\u00a0reported that rewetting reduced cover of non-Sphagnum mosses\\u00a0or bryophytes. One site comparison study in Finland\\u00a0reported that a rewetted peatland had similar moss cover (Sphagnum and total) to a natural peatland, but another site comparison study in Canada\\u00a0reported that a rewetted bog had lower moss cover (Sphagnum and other) than nearby target peatlands.\\nHerb cover (25 studies): Twenty-one studies (including four replicated, paired, controlled) reported that rewetting (sometimes\\u00a0along with other interventions) increased cover of at least one group of herbs. These studies were in bogs, fens or other peatlands in the UK, Finland, Ireland, the Czech Republic, the USA, the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, China, Latvia, Poland, Canada\\u00a0and Spain. Specifically, rewetting increased other/total sedge cover in 13 of 15 studies, increased cottongrass cover in eight of nine studies, and increased reed/rush cover in five of seven studies. Three\\u00a0of four before-and-after studies in peatlands in the UK and Sweden reported that rewetting reduced purple moor grass cover; the other study\\u00a0reported no effect. One replicated site comparison study in forested fens in Finland\\u00a0reported that rewetting had no effect on total herb cover. Two site comparison studies in Europe\\u00a0reported greater herb cover in rewetted than natural peatlands (overall\\u00a0and sedges/rushes, but not forbs).\\nTree/shrub cover (13 studies):\\u00a0Ten\\u00a0studies (including two paired and controlled) in peatlands in Finland, the UK,\\u00a0Germany, Latvia\\u00a0and Canada\\u00a0reported that rewetting typically reduced (seven studies)\\u00a0or had no effect (six studies)\\u00a0on tree and/or shrub cover. Two before-and-after studies in fens in Sweden\\u00a0and Germany\\u00a0reported that rewetting increased tree/shrub cover. One before-and-after study in a bog in the UK\\u00a0reported mixed effects of rewetting on different tree/shrub species.\\nOverall vegetation cover (4 studies): Of four before-and-after studies (three also controlled) that examined the effect of rewetting on overall vegetation cover, two in bogs in Ireland\\u00a0and Sweden\\u00a0reported that rewetting increased it. One study in a fen in New Zealand\\u00a0reported that rewetting reduced vegetation cover. One study in a peatland in Finland\\u00a0reported no effect.\\nOverall plant richness/diversity (14 studies): Six studies (including one replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after) in Sweden, Germany\\u00a0and the UK\\u00a0reported that rewetting increased total plant species richness or diversity in bogs, fens or other peatlands. However, five studies found no effect: in bogs in the Czech Republic\\u00a0and Latvia, fens in Sweden\\u00a0and Germany, and forested fens in Finland. One study in fen meadows in the Netherlands\\u00a0found scale-dependent effects. One paired, controlled, before-and-after study in a peatland in Finland\\u00a0reported that rewetting reduced plant diversity. Of four studies that compared rewetted and natural peatlands, two in Finland\\u00a0and Germany\\u00a0reported lower species richness in rewetted peatlands, one in Sweden\\u00a0found higher species richness in rewetted fens, and one in Europe\\u00a0found similar richness in rewetted and natural fens.\\nGrowth (1 study):\\u00a0One replicated site comparison study in forested fens in Finland\\u00a0found that rewetting increased Sphagnum moss growth to natural levels.\"\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "Physical modifications that can encourage natural vegetation recovery in peatlands include filling or blocking drainage ditches to raise the water table (action 1805), which allowed natural colonization by herbs and bryophytes within 2-3 years in one study and restored vegetation cover to natural levels. Rewetting peatlands by raising the water table through drainage management (action 1756) was evaluated in 36 studies and typically increased cover of wetland-characteristic plants, sedges, cottongrasses, and Sphagnum mosses while reducing tree and shrub cover. Surface disturbance techniques (action 1811) showed that soil disturbance affected plant community development over 2-3 years, with wetland-characteristic species colonizing disturbed plots. Reprofiling or relandscaping the peat surface (action 1807) was shown to change plant community composition, though vegetation cover remained lower than natural reference sites after five years. Other interventions include stabilizing the peat surface using materials like coconut fiber rolls (action 1815), though this specific technique showed no effect on vegetation cover development. Combining tree removal with rewetting (action 1732) increased Sphagnum moss cover and herb cover while reducing tree density. Roughening the peat surface to create microclimates (action 1808) represents a potential technique for which no evaluation studies were found, but creating topographic variation through reprofiling remains a viable approach to encourage natural colonization through environmental heterogeneity.",

One site comparison study in Finland\\u00a0reported that a rewetted peatland had similar moss cover (Sphagnum and total) to a natural peatland, but another site comparison study in Canada\\u00a0reported that a rewetted bog had lower moss cover (Sphagnum and other) than nearby target peatlands.\\nHerb cover (25 studies): Twenty-one studies (including four replicated, paired, controlled) reported that rewetting (sometimes\\u00a0along with other interventions) increased cover of at least one group of herbs. These studies were in bogs, fens or other peatlands in the UK, Finland, Ireland, the Czech Republic, the USA, the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, China, Latvia, Poland, Canada\\u00a0and Spain. Specifically, rewetting increased other/total sedge cover in 13 of 15 studies, increased cottongrass cover in eight of nine studies, and increased reed/rush cover in five of seven studies. Three\\u00a0of four before-and-after studies in peatlands in the UK and Sweden reported that rewetting reduced purple moor grass cover; the other study\\u00a0reported no effect. One replicated site comparison study in forested fens in Finland\\u00a0reported that rewetting had no effect on total herb cover. Two site comparison studies in Europe\\u00a0reported greater herb cover in rewetted than natural peatlands (overall\\u00a0and sedges/rushes, but not forbs).\\nTree/shrub cover (13 studies):\\u00a0Ten\\u00a0studies (including two paired and controlled) in peatlands in Finland, the UK,\\u00a0Germany, Latvia\\u00a0and Canada\\u00a0reported that rewetting typically reduced (seven studies)\\u00a0or had no effect (six studies)\\u00a0on tree and/or shrub cover. Two before-and-after studies in fens in Sweden\\u00a0and Germany\\u00a0reported that rewetting increased tree/shrub cover. One before-and-after study in a bog in the UK\\u00a0reported mixed effects of rewetting on different tree/shrub species.\\nOverall vegetation cover (4 studies): Of four before-and-after studies (three also controlled) that examined the effect of rewetting on overall vegetation cover, two in bogs in Ireland\\u00a0and Sweden\\u00a0reported that rewetting increased it. One study in a fen in New Zealand\\u00a0reported that rewetting reduced vegetation cover. One study in a peatland in Finland\\u00a0reported no effect.\\nOverall plant richness/diversity (14 studies): Six studies (including one replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after) in Sweden, Germany\\u00a0and the UK\\u00a0reported that rewetting increased total plant species richness or diversity in bogs, fens or other peatlands. However, five studies found no effect: in bogs in the Czech Republic\\u00a0and Latvia, fens in Sweden\\u00a0and Germany, and forested fens in Finland. One study in fen meadows in the Netherlands\\u00a0found scale-dependent effects. One paired, controlled, before-and-after study in a peatland in Finland\\u00a0reported that rewetting reduced plant diversity. Of four studies that compared rewetted and natural peatlands, two in Finland\\u00a0and Germany\\u00a0reported lower species richness in rewetted peatlands, one in Sweden\\u00a0found higher species richness in rewetted fens, and one in Europe\\u00a0found similar richness in rewetted and natural fens.\\nGrowth (1 study):\\u00a0One replicated site comparison study in forested fens in Finland\\u00a0found that rewetting increased Sphagnum moss growth to natural levels.\"\n}"

Two studies reported that the area of protected peatland increased following pressure from campaign groups. Additionally, major retailers stopped buying compost containing peat from important peatland areas, and horticultural companies began marketing peat-free compost following campaign pressure. Garden centres and local governments also signed peatland conservation agreements.\n\nGeneral public awareness campaigns (Action ID 1844) demonstrated behavioural change in one UK study. Following awareness-raising activities, the percentage of the public buying peat-free compost increased.\n\nLegal protection of peatlands (Action ID 1796) showed mixed results across five studies. While two Indonesian studies reported that peat swamp forest was still lost from within national park boundaries, one study found forest loss was greater outside the protected areas. A Chinese study reported that peatland area initially decreased but then increased following legal protection. A Chilean study found that protected areas had greater vegetation cover than adjacent grazed and harvested areas, though plant richness and diversity were lower.\n\nMitigation requirements for wetland impacts (Action ID 3386) showed concerning results across nine US studies. Four studies reported that requiring mitigation did not prevent loss of wetland area, with restored/created areas being less than destroyed areas. Compliance issues were prevalent, with five studies reporting that the total area of wetlands conserved was less than required in permits, and three studies finding that most mitigation projects failed to meet permit targets.\n\nNo studies were found evaluating the effectiveness of voluntary agreements to protect peatlands, zero burning policies near peatlands, or legislation for 'no net loss' of wetlands, indicating research gaps in these policy approaches.",

For peatland trees/shrubs (action 1824), studies show that seeds can germinate successfully in some plots, with some heather seedlings surviving over two years in bogs. Sown plots typically develop greater cover of certain shrubs like manuka and naturally colonizing heather compared to unsown plots, and can increase total vegetation cover after two years. However, all germinated willow seedlings may die within one month in some fen environments. For herbaceous peatland plants (action 1823), seed germination varies by species, with some studies reporting successful germination of three out of four species in bogs, while only one of seven species germinated in a fen. Plots typically develop cover of the sown herbs and can support wetland-characteristic plants, though effects on total vegetation cover and plant species richness are inconsistent - some studies find increased cover while others report no effect or even reduced species richness compared to unsown plots.",

In both forested and open fens, cutting and removing trees increased herb cover and biomass while helping restore plant community composition toward target fen meadow conditions. Studies showed that areas where shrubs were removed became more similar to undegraded, open fens with increased abundance of fen-characteristic plant species (Action IDs 1761, 1772). Grazing management can contribute to vegetation control with some studies finding reduced shrub cover and increased desirable herb groups like sedges and cottongrasses, though effects varied between sites (Action ID 1762). Soil disturbance techniques combined with other interventions helped create conditions suitable for wetland-characteristic plant colonization, though outcomes varied (Action ID 1811).",

When introducing seeds, studies show mixed results: some planted herb seeds successfully germinated, with wetland-characteristic plants colonizing sown plots, while other studies found no increase in plant species richness or herb cover compared to unsown plots. For shrub/tree seeds, germination occurred but survival was often poor, with all germinated willow seedlings dying within one month in one study.\n\nUsing whole plants or fragments appears more successful than seeds. Adding moss fragments (especially Sphagnum) to peatland surfaces resulted in moss cover ranging from negligible to over 90% in multiple studies, with sown plots typically having higher cover than unsown plots. Adding mixed vegetation containing Sphagnum also proved effective, with Sphagnum cover ranging from less than 1% to 73% in sown plots. The moss layer transfer technique, which spreads whole moss layers, was particularly successful with restored areas developing bog-characteristic plant communities within 11 years and achieving greater vegetation cover than unrestored areas.\n\nHowever, success rates vary significantly depending on environmental conditions and additional interventions, with some studies reporting very low survival or cover unless plots were mulched, shaded, or received other treatments.",

Two studies in fens demonstrate that cutting large trees/shrubs can shift plant community composition to more closely resemble target open fen communities and increase the abundance of characteristic fen plants. A controlled study in a forested fen found tree removal increased herb cover and biomass while maintaining similar shrub cover levels, indicating selective removal benefits herbaceous species without promoting further shrub encroachment.\n\nAdditionally, studies show that combining tree removal with peatland rewetting (raising the water table) provides enhanced restoration outcomes. When implemented together, tree removal and rewetting increased wetland-characteristic plant abundance and improved Sphagnum moss cover in bogs and fens. Multiple studies reported that rewetting alone typically reduces tree and shrub cover over time while promoting herbaceous species including sedges, cottongrasses, and reeds.\n\nFor areas where trees have naturally colonized, cutting/removing forest plantations followed by rewetting has been shown to increase herb cover and reduce forest-characteristic mosses, with some studies reporting restoration of Sphagnum cover to natural levels. The evidence suggests a combined approach of mechanical vegetation removal and hydrological restoration is most effective for returning overgrown peatlands to open conditions.",

    "provider": "fireworks/fp8",
    "relevant_summary": "As alternatives to prescribed burning for managing vegetation on fens, both mowing and grazing show distinct effects on vegetation compared to prescribed fire. \n\n**Mowing effects:** Multiple studies demonstrate that mowing can alter plant community composition, increase cover of fen-characteristic plants, increase moss/bryophyte cover, and reduce cover of problematic herbaceous species including purple moor grass and reeds. Mowing typically increases plant species richness and can reduce shrub/tree cover. The effects on vegetation structure show mixed results, with some studies finding reduced vegetation height and biomass. Seasonal timing matters, with summer mowing showing greater increases in plant species richness compared to spring or autumn mowing.\n\n**Grazing effects:** Grazing can increase cover of some herb groups like sedges and cottongrasses while reducing purple moor grass cover. However, grazing effects on plant community composition are more variable, with some studies finding different communities compared to mown areas, and others finding reduced fen-characteristic plant species compared to mowing. Grazing can reduce Sphagnum moss cover and has mixed effects on shrub cover and plant species richness.\n\n**Comparison with prescribed burning:** While prescribed burning typically reduces tree/shrub cover and can increase plant species richness (though results are mixed), mowing appears to offer more consistent benefits for fen-characteristic vegetation and moss cover. Both mowing and grazing avoid the potential negative effects of fire on Sphagnum moss cover that has been observed with prescribed burning. Mowing provides more predictable outcomes for maintaining fen-characteristic plant communities compared to grazing, which shows more variable responses.",

However, two controlled studies in bogs in Ireland\\u00a0and the UK\\u00a0reported that rewetting reduced cover of non-Sphagnum mosses\\u00a0or bryophytes. One site comparison study in Finland\\u00a0reported that a rewetted peatland had similar moss cover (Sphagnum and total) to a natural peatland, but another site comparison study in Canada\\u00a0reported that a rewetted bog had lower moss cover (Sphagnum and other) than nearby target peatlands.\\nHerb cover (25 studies): Twenty-one studies (including four replicated, paired, controlled) reported that rewetting (sometimes\\u00a0along with other interventions) increased cover of at least one group of herbs. These studies were in bogs, fens or other peatlands in the UK, Finland, Ireland, the Czech Republic, the USA, the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, China, Latvia, Poland, Canada\\u00a0and Spain. Specifically, rewetting increased other/total sedge cover in 13 of 15 studies, increased cottongrass cover in eight of nine studies, and increased reed/rush cover in five of seven studies. Three\\u00a0of four before-and-after studies in peatlands in the UK and Sweden reported that rewetting reduced purple moor grass cover; the other study\\u00a0reported no effect. One replicated site comparison study in forested fens in Finland\\u00a0reported that rewetting had no effect on total herb cover. Two site comparison studies in Europe\\u00a0reported greater herb cover in rewetted than natural peatlands (overall\\u00a0and sedges/rushes, but not forbs).\\nTree/shrub cover (13 studies):\\u00a0Ten\\u00a0studies (including two paired and controlled) in peatlands in Finland, the UK,\\u00a0Germany, Latvia\\u00a0and Canada\\u00a0reported that rewetting typically reduced (seven studies)\\u00a0or had no effect (six studies)\\u00a0on tree and/or shrub cover. Two before-and-after studies in fens in Sweden\\u00a0and Germany\\u00a0reported that rewetting increased tree/shrub cover. One before-and-after study in a bog in the UK\\u00a0reported mixed effects of rewetting on different tree/shrub species.\\nOverall vegetation cover (4 studies): Of four before-and-after studies (three also controlled) that examined the effect of rewetting on overall vegetation cover, two in bogs in Ireland\\u00a0and Sweden\\u00a0reported that rewetting increased it. One study in a fen in New Zealand\\u00a0reported that rewetting reduced vegetation cover. One study in a peatland in Finland\\u00a0reported no effect.\\nOverall plant richness/diversity (14 studies): Six studies (including one replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after) in Sweden, Germany\\u00a0and the UK\\u00a0reported that rewetting increased total plant species richness or diversity in bogs, fens or other peatlands. However, five studies found no effect: in bogs in the Czech Republic\\u00a0and Latvia, fens in Sweden\\u00a0and Germany, and forested fens in Finland. One study in fen meadows in the Netherlands\\u00a0found scale-dependent effects. One paired, controlled, before-and-after study in a peatland in Finland\\u00a0reported that rewetting reduced plant diversity. Of four studies that compared rewetted and natural peatlands, two in Finland\\u00a0and Germany\\u00a0reported lower species richness in rewetted peatlands, one in Sweden\\u00a0found higher species richness in rewetted fens, and one in Europe\\u00a0found similar richness in rewetted and natural fens.\\nGrowth (1 study):\\u00a0One replicated site comparison study in forested fens in Finland\\u00a0found that rewetting increased Sphagnum moss growth to natural levels.\"\n}"
