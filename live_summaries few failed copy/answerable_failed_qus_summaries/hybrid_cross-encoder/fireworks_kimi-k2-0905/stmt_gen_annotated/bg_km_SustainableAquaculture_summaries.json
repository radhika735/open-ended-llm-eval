    "relevant_summary": "Several husbandry practices beyond feed and chemical treatments can improve Atlantic salmon health on farms. Fallowing systems help reduce parasites and disease - a study in Scotland found lower lice numbers on salmon in cages using fallowing (1026). Cage size management shows benefits, with larger cages resulting in lower levels of amoebic gill disease compared to smaller cages (742). Aerobic training programs improve survival rates, with interval training being more effective than continuous training when salmon are exposed to infectious pancreatic necrosis (740). Selective breeding for disease resistance traits increases survival levels, as demonstrated in a Norwegian study where salmon bred for high resistance to infectious pancreatic necrosis showed better survival than those bred for low resistance (735). Freshwater bathing can help manage amoebic gill disease, with one study showing reduction in gill amoebae persisting up to 10 days post-treatment (739). Probiotics and immunostimulants also improve health outcomes - Scottish studies found increased survival in salmon fed probiotics before bacterial exposure, while Norwegian research showed that beta-glucans reduced lice infection by 28% and mannan oligosaccharides improved gut function (732). Fallowing also provides environmental benefits, with Tasmanian trials showing sediment communities recovering to become more similar to non-impacted sites over two fallowing cycles (1027).",

Integrated aquaculture systems involve co-cultivation of species like blue mussels, scallops, and algae alongside salmon farms to absorb waste nutrients - studies have shown blue mussels can absorb salmon farm waste and scallops demonstrate greater growth when placed adjacent to fish farms, though one study found no evidence that oysters and mussels were feeding on fish farm waste. Fallowing strategies involve leaving salmon cages empty for periods, which research shows can help sediment communities recover from aquaculture impacts - with studies demonstrating that sediment community structure under salmon cages becomes more similar to non-impacted sites after fallowing cycles. Additional management approaches include replacing or repairing damaged anti-predator nets to reduce environmental impacts, and locating aquaculture systems in already impacted areas to minimize additional stress on pristine environments, though evidence for these latter strategies is limited.",
