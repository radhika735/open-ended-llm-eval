Multiple intervention approaches (excluding moss layer transfer) were found to increase total moss/bryophyte cover, Sphagnum moss cover, herbaceous plant cover, and overall vegetation cover across multiple studies in bogs and other peatlands.

A controlled study in a forested fen found tree removal increased herb cover and biomass while maintaining similar shrub cover levels, indicating selective removal benefits herbaceous species without promoting further shrub encroachment.\n\nAdditionally, studies show that combining tree removal with peatland rewetting (raising the water table) provides enhanced restoration outcomes. When implemented together, tree removal and rewetting increased wetland-characteristic plant abundance and improved Sphagnum moss cover in bogs and fens. Multiple studies reported that rewetting alone typically reduces tree and shrub cover over time while promoting herbaceous species including sedges, cottongrasses, and reeds.\n\nFor areas where trees have naturally colonized, cutting/removing forest plantations followed by rewetting has been shown to increase herb cover and reduce forest-characteristic mosses, with some studies reporting restoration of Sphagnum cover to natural levels. The evidence suggests a combined approach of mechanical vegetation removal and hydrological restoration is most effective for returning overgrown peatlands to open conditions.",

Mowing typically increases plant species richness and can reduce shrub/tree cover. The effects on vegetation structure show mixed results, with some studies finding reduced vegetation height and biomass. Seasonal timing matters, with summer mowing showing greater increases in plant species richness compared to spring or autumn mowing.\n\n**Grazing effects:** Grazing can increase cover of some herb groups like sedges and cottongrasses while reducing purple moor grass cover. However, grazing effects on plant community composition are more variable, with some studies finding different communities compared to mown areas, and others finding reduced fen-characteristic plant species compared to mowing. Grazing can reduce Sphagnum moss cover and has mixed effects on shrub cover and plant species richness.\n\n**Comparison with prescribed burning:** While prescribed burning typically reduces tree/shrub cover and can increase plant species richness (though results are mixed), mowing appears to offer more consistent benefits for fen-characteristic vegetation and moss cover. Both mowing and grazing avoid the potential negative effects of fire on Sphagnum moss cover that has been observed with prescribed burning. Mowing provides more predictable outcomes for maintaining fen-characteristic plant communities compared to grazing, which shows more variable responses.",
