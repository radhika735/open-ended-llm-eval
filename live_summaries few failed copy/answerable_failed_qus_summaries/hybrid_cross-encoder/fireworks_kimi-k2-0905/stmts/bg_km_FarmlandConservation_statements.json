Sowing field margins with agricultural nectar and pollen seed mixes containing perennial leguminous flowering plants attracts significantly more foraging bumblebees than other margin types, though these mixes may need re-sowing every few years (Action 18). Creating uncultivated margins around intensive fields has shown benefits for invertebrates including bees, with 19 studies finding higher plant diversity and species richness compared to conventionally managed margins, though 6 studies found no difference (Action 63). Leaving uncropped, cultivated margins or plots provides benefits to farmland birds, plants, invertebrates and mammals including increased species richness of plants and bumblebees, abundance of spiders and ground beetles, and improved breeding success for birds like northern lapwing and Eurasian skylark (Action 562). Planting field margins with diverse plant species has been shown to increase activity of certain bat species like soprano pipistrelles and barbastelle bats (Action 1941).",

A UK replicated controlled study found it increased productivity of Eurasian skylark and reduced damage to amphibians and invertebrates, but other studies found no effects on foraging birds or invertebrates, and shorter grass actually improved foraging success of northern lapwing and common starling chicks.\n\nDifferent mowing techniques significantly affect wildlife mortality. Studies from Germany, Ireland, Switzerland and the UK found that specific techniques can reduce bird, mammal, amphibian and invertebrate mortality. Corncrake Friendly Mowing schemes increased the UK corncrake population, with 68% of chicks escaping when fields were mown from center outwards versus 45% with conventional edge-in mowing.

Wider mowing machinery increased skylark chick survival fourfold, while mower-conditioners resulted in higher skylark nest survival than tedders.\n\nRotational mowing strategies benefit many butterfly and moth species. Ten studies found rotational mowing (mowing strips in alternate years, leaving some areas uncut) increased butterfly species richness and abundance compared to complete annual mowing. This benefited 27 out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern in Europe, with some heath fritillary populations surviving on rotationally mown grasslands while others went extinct on unmanaged sites.\n\nTiming of cutting significantly impacts butterfly and moth populations. Studies from seven countries found delayed cutting (July-September vs May-June) generally increased abundance and richness of butterflies, burnet moths and caterpillars, though results varied between years. Some species like short-tailed blue preferred late-mown meadows, while others such as marbled white and meadow brown preferred early-mown areas.\n\nSpecific wildlife protection techniques during mowing include marking nests and caterpillar locations.

Planting wild bird seed or cover mixtures is the most widely supported option, with 21 out of 33 studies showing positive effects on bird abundance, density, species diversity and richness compared to other farmland habitats (Action IDs 187, 594, 3930). These mixtures can include kale or combinations of kale with other species which attract the highest bird abundance. Undersowing spring cereals with clover or other species provides benefits to barnacle geese, Eurasian skylark, arthropods, bumblebees, butterflies and earthworms (Action IDs 136, 3926). Planting cereals for whole crop silage, particularly barley, provides food resources for seed-eating birds in both summer and winter (Action ID 225). Creating skylark plots through undrilled patches within cereal fields increases Eurasian skylark breeding density, duration and success (Action ID 540). Leaving cultivated uncropped margins or plots (including lapwing plots) benefits plants, bumblebees, spiders, ground-dwelling invertebrates and ground beetles, with northern lapwing, Eurasian skylark, grey partridge and yellow wagtail breeding in lapwing plots (Action ID 562).",

Planting nectar flower mixtures or wildflower strips has been found to increase butterfly and moth species richness and diversity compared to conventional field margins, unsown margins, cropped fields, or conventional grassland. These habitats also support higher abundance of butterflies, including generalist and specialist species. Field margins sown with wildflowers attract significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated, grassy, or cropped field margins. Planting nettle strips in field margins has been shown to increase the number of aphid predator species, with some insect families like green lacewings found exclusively on nettles. The evidence comes from multiple replicated studies across Europe, with 23 studies evaluating wildflower strips and 5 replicated trials examining nectar and pollen mixes.",
