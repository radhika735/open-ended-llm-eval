Reed stems and wooden grooved-board designs were found to be particularly productive, while plastic-lined holes and paper or plastic tubes had lower success due to parasitism and mold issues. For bumblebees, underground nest boxes proved most effective, with seven replicated trials showing 6-58% occupancy for boxes buried 5-10 cm underground with 30-80 cm entrance pipes, compared to very low uptake (0-2.5%) for surface wooden boxes commonly marketed for wildlife gardening. However, nest boxes for stingless bees showed no uptake in one Brazilian trial. Protecting existing nesting sites is also important - excluding ants from solitary bee nests increased offspring production, and using sticky barriers to exclude introduced European earwigs significantly increased native bee use of nest boxes.

      "relevant_summary": "Several actions are available to provide nesting resources for bees on agricultural land:\n\n**Artificial nest sites for solitary bees (Action 47)**: Multiple replicated trials across 10 countries have shown that nest boxes made from cut hollow stems, tubes, or drilled wooden blocks are readily occupied by solitary bees. Nest boxes should be placed 150-600 m from foraging resources as solitary bees have limited foraging ranges. Reed stem and wooden grooved-board designs proved most productive, while plastic-lined holes and paper tubes showed lower success due to parasitism and mold.\n\n**Nest boxes for bees (Action 80)**: This action encompasses providing nest boxes for both solitary bees and bumblebees. Solitary bee nest boxes were readily used with occupancy rates of 1-26% of available cavities, attracting between 4.6-33 species. Studies showed local populations could increase when nest boxes were provided, with the number of occupied nests almost doubling over three years at sites with repeated provision.\n\n**Artificial nest sites for bumblebees (Action 48)**: Underground nest boxes with a 30-80 cm entrance pipe proved most effective, achieving 6-58% occupancy rates. Multiple designs have been tested including wooden or brick boxes at ground surface, underground tin or terracotta boxes, and boxes attached to trees. However, several recent UK trials showed very low uptake rates of 0-2.5% for various designs.\n\n**Nest boxes for stingless bees (Action 49)**: One trial tested nest boxes placed in trees for stingless bees in Brazil but found no uptake.\n\n**Conservation of existing structures (Action 4)**: While no quantitative evidence was found, conserving old buildings or structures as potential nesting sites for bees is suggested as a possible action.\n\n**Nest protection measures (Action 46)**: Excluding ants from solitary bee nesting sites has been shown to increase offspring production.\n\nThese actions provide farmers with multiple options for supporting bee populations on agricultural land through targeted nesting resource provision.",

In gardens, two replicated trials in the USA and Canada found more wild bee species and individuals in gardens planted with bee forage or native plants compared to conventionally managed gardens, and a UK site comparison study found more bumblebee species in domestic city gardens with lower management intensity. For road verges, a replicated paired site comparison study in the USA found that restored roadside prairies where herbicide application was restricted had greater species richness and abundance of butterflies compared to verges dominated by non-native vegetation with no herbicide restrictions. Areas under power lines showed similar results, with a replicated site comparison study in Canada finding that transmission lines (including power lines) which were neither sprayed with herbicide nor mown had greater abundance of northern pearl crescent and pearl crescent butterflies compared to sprayed and mown areas. Altering mowing regimes by reducing mowing frequency or timing also proved effective, with replicated studies in the UK and Canada finding higher abundance of adult butterflies in unmown public parks and road verges compared to regularly mown areas, and a replicated site comparison study in Poland finding fewer dead butterflies on less frequently mown road verges.",

At the local patch scale, multiple replicated trials demonstrate that planted flower patches consistently attract substantial numbers of foraging wild bees, with studies documenting 8-35 bee species on such patches. Field margins sown with wild flowers or agricultural nectar and pollen mixes support significantly higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees compared to cropped edges, grassy margins, or naturally regenerated strips. However, at the wider landscape scale, the evidence is more mixed. One large replicated trial found positive correlation between long-tongued bumblebee abundance and the number of pollen/nectar agreements in 10 km grid squares, but other trials show that bee numbers and species richness are not significantly higher in farmland 50-1,500 m away from planted flower patches. Additionally, two replicated trials found that bumblebee populations were not enhanced on farmland managed under agri-environment schemes at the landscape scale. While local patches can significantly enhance bee reproductive success - such as blue orchard mason bees showing enhanced reproductive success with planted lupine patches in commercial orchards - the wider landscape effects appear more limited.",
