One replicated, controlled study in the USA reported greater growth of scallops grown next to fish farms, and a replicated, controlled study in Scotland reported enhanced algal growth when placed adjacent to fish farms (Action 932).

Cage size management shows benefits, with larger cages resulting in lower levels of amoebic gill disease compared to smaller cages (742). Aerobic training programs improve survival rates, with interval training being more effective than continuous training when salmon are exposed to infectious pancreatic necrosis (740). Selective breeding for disease resistance traits increases survival levels, as demonstrated in a Norwegian study where salmon bred for high resistance to infectious pancreatic necrosis showed better survival than those bred for low resistance (735). Freshwater bathing can help manage amoebic gill disease, with one study showing reduction in gill amoebae persisting up to 10 days post-treatment (739). Probiotics and immunostimulants also improve health outcomes - Scottish studies found increased survival in salmon fed probiotics before bacterial exposure, while Norwegian research showed that beta-glucans reduced lice infection by 28% and mannan oligosaccharides improved gut function (732). Fallowing also provides environmental benefits, with Tasmanian trials showing sediment communities recovering to become more similar to non-impacted sites over two fallowing cycles (1027).",
