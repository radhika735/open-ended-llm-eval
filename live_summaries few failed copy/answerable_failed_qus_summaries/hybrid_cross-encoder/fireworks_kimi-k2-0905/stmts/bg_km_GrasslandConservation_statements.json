When sowing grass seeds specifically, studies have documented reduced abundance of native forb species and reduced abundance of shrub species. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in Hungary found that sowing grass seeds reduced the abundance of grassland species. Additionally, three of four replicated studies found that sowing grass seeds either reduced native grass cover or did not alter native grass density, and two studies found it reduced the abundance of native forb species. Research on sowing native grass and forb seeds showed that while some studies found increased species richness initially, after 3-13 years, species richness did not differ between sown and unsown areas or was lower in sown areas compared to unsown areas. Furthermore, three studies found that species richness was lower in sown areas than in nearby intact grasslands when using native seed mixes. These findings suggest that various seeding approaches, whether using native or non-native species, can potentially suppress existing native vegetation through competition and may not maintain long-term species richness comparable to intact grassland communities.",

Key findings show that sowing native grass and forb seeds led to long-term improvements in plant community composition, with five of eleven studies finding increased similarity to target communities over time (Action ID: 3432). However, temporal patterns varied: three studies found that species richness was higher during the first year but after 3-13 years, richness did not differ between sown and unsown areas or was lower in sown areas (Action ID: 3432). Similarly, one study found increased forb cover one year after sowing, but after 10 years there was no difference (Action ID: 3432). \n\nFor basic grass seeding, one study found that grass cover was higher two years after sowing compared to unsown areas, but after seven years there was no difference (Action ID: 3397). Regarding vegetation cover, evidence was mixed - some studies found increased vegetation cover while others found no change or variable effects over time (Action ID: 3397). The restoration of species-rich grasslands typically took between 5-10 years to show positive results, with six studies seeing positive signs in less than five years, eleven studies within 10 years, and two studies finding restoration took more than 10 years (Action ID: 133). Two studies found differences in vegetation between restored and existing species-rich grasslands even after 9 or 60 years (Action ID: 133).\n\nSowing local seed sources showed potential for maintaining higher vegetation cover over time compared to non-native seeds, though individual plant density declined (Action ID: 3400).

Similarly, more intensive soil preparation through ploughing increased understory plant cover and diversity in multiple studies (Action 1251). Topsoil removal, another intensive technique, increased plant species richness and improved community similarity to intact reference grasslands (Action 3415), while also enhancing survival of planted species.

Studies found that local seed sources increased plant species richness compared to commercial seed mixes (Action ID: 3400), and when combined with increased species diversity in seed mixes, led to increased species richness and cover of target plant species (Action ID: 3400, 3406). Local seed sources were also found to maintain or increase vegetation cover over time compared to areas sown with non-native seeds (Action ID: 3400). The evidence indicates that grasslands established with local seed sources developed communities more similar to those of intact grasslands over time (Action ID: 3397). While specific drawbacks of non-native seeds are not extensively detailed in the available evidence, the data suggests that commercial seed mixes and non-native sources generally resulted in lower plant species richness and did not achieve the same restoration outcomes as local seed sources (Action ID: 3400).",
