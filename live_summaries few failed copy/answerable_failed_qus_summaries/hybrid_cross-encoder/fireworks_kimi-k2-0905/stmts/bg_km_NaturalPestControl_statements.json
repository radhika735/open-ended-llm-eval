Planting flowers (action ID 2313) demonstrated higher natural enemy numbers in fields with flower strips compared to fields without them.

Ground cover management can also reduce pest numbers, with two studies finding fewer leafhoppers in plots with cover crops, and fewer pests found in plots with mown ground cover compared to unmown ground cover.

Planting flowers to enhance beneficial insect populations has shown promising results, with three studies finding greater pest reduction or higher proportions of parasitized pests in fields and farms with planted flower strips.

        "Evidence from multiple studies shows that natural pest control interventions can increase parasitism of pests by natural enemies.",
        "Excluding ants that protect pests resulted in greater parasitism in one of two replicated, controlled studies from Japan and the USA.",
        "Using chemicals to attract natural enemies increased parasitism in one review and in two of five studies from Asia, Europe and North America.",
        "Planting flowers led to greater pest reduction or higher proportions of parasitized pests in three replicated studies from Italy and the USA.",
        "Planting hedgerows resulted in a higher proportion of pest eggs being parasitized in tomato fields compared to fields with weedy edges.",
        "The effect of planting hedgerows on parasitism in tomato fields was only observed up to 100 meters into the crop.",
        "Using mass-emergence devices to increase natural enemy populations led to higher parasitism at one site in a randomized, replicated, controlled study in Switzerland.",
        "No effect on parasitism from using mass-emergence devices was found at another site in the same Swiss study.",
        "Alley cropping showed mixed effects on pest parasitism.",
        "Two of four studies from Kenya and the USA found that the effects of alley cropping on parasitism varied between study sites, sampling dates, pest life stages, or the width of crop alleys.",
        "Two studies found no effect on parasitism as a result of alley cropping."
