A replicated, controlled study in Hong Kong found that tree guards increased tree height after 37 months, but not after 44 months (1268). One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the USA found that plastic guards increased the height and diameter growth rates of planted baldcypress seedlings over one growing season (3330).\n\nWhen it comes to fencing, one replicated, paired, controlled study in Australia reported that planted swamp gum seedlings had a much higher survival rate over one year in plots fenced to exclude mammals than in open plots (3330). However, two replicated, paired, controlled studies in freshwater wetlands in the USA reported that exclusion fencing sometimes increased the survival of planted tree seedlings, but sometimes had no clear or significant effect, depending on factors such as the season of planting, seedling elevation, and site (3330). One replicated, paired, controlled study in a floodplain swamp clearing in the USA found that fencing to exclude deer had no significant effect on total tree seedling density after three years (3330). The same study did find that the fenced plots contained taller tree seedlings after three years (3330). In contrast, a different replicated, paired, controlled study in the USA found that the average height of white cedar saplings increased by a similar amount between two and five years after planting in plots that were fenced to exclude deer and plots that were left unfenced (3330). Two replicated, paired, controlled studies in freshwater wetlands in Canada and Israel reported that protecting emergent herbs with silt screens or herbivore fencing increased survival rates over 12–18 months after planting (3328). There were no studies found that evaluated the effects of using fences or barriers to protect planted peatland vegetation (1839).",

However, one study found a decrease in plant species richness and abundance, and another found no effect on tree abundance [1223]. In terms of wildlife, two studies in the USA on reptile populations found that shelterwood harvesting had mixed effects on reptile species richness and abundance compared to areas with no management [3636]. One study in the USA found that areas with shelterwood harvesting had a lower abundance of juvenile eastern box turtles than clearcut areas [3636]. When compared to clearcutting, three studies in the USA found that shelterwood harvesting resulted in higher, similar, or initially higher and then similar salamander abundance [851]. A meta-analysis of 24 studies in North America indicated that partial harvest, including shelterwood harvesting, led to smaller reductions in salamander populations than clearcutting [851].\n\nPartial retention harvesting has also been studied as an alternative to clearcutting.

    "relevant_summary": "Mechanically removing understory vegetation after tree planting has been studied as an alternative to herbicides [1256]. Five studies in multiple countries found no effect of this practice on seedling emergence, survival, growth rate, or frost damage, though one study did find that removing competing herbs increased seedling biomass [1256]. Another study showed that removing sheep laurel shrubs specifically, increased the growth rate and height of black spruce seedlings [1256].\n\nOther methods include clearing vegetation before planting, which had no significant effect on seedling height or diameter in some studies [3334]. However, one study found that baldcypress seedlings were taller when planted amongst cut woody vegetation [3334]. The removal of reed canarygrass before planting was found to often increase the survival rate of tree and shrub seedlings [3334]. In one study, there were more seedlings in plots that had been cleared of vegetation before sowing seeds [3334].\n\nDisturbing the soil before seeding or planting is another alternative. Four out of five studies found that this action increased plant emergence [3413]. One study found that disturbing the soil before planting forb seedlings had no effect on their growth, but another found that it increased the cover of forb species [3413]. One study also found that disturbing soil before sowing seeds increased seedling survival [3413].\n\nPlanting or seeding under established vegetation has also been considered, with one study showing mixed effects on blackbrush seedling emergence [1714].\n\nFinally, the addition of mulch has been studied. One study in Canada found that adding mulch before sowing seeds increased the number of seedlings in most cases [3425]. However, its effects on growth and cover are varied, with one study finding it increased the cover of target plant species, while another found it reduced the cover of planted species [3425]. A different study found that adding mulch did not alter the growth of seven different plant species [3425].",
