This study also found that this method increased the number of native plant species [3399]. Another replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the UK found that planting increased the species richness of forbs in 83% of cases and grasses in 50% of cases [3399]. Twenty studies found that restoring species-rich, semi-natural grassland resulted in increased plant species richness [133]. However, seven other studies found no clear effect on plant species richness from such restoration efforts, and three studies found that restored grasslands had a lower diversity and frequency of certain plant species [133].

The other study found that semi-natural grasslands restored by cattle grazing had a lower species richness of butterflies and day-flying moths than unrestored and continuously managed grasslands. One replicated, site comparison study in the UK\\u00a0found that the species richness of butterflies on semi-natural grasslands restored by scrub clearance and the reintroduction of grazing or mowing remained similar over time since restoration.\\n\\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (5 STUDIES)\\n\\nAbundance (5 studies): Two of five replicated, site comparison studies (including one paired study) in Switzerland, Finland, Sweden\\u00a0and Germany\\u00a0found that semi-natural grasslands restored by cattle grazing had a lower total abundance of butterflies and day-flying moths, and of 13 out of 32 individual species, than unmanaged, abandoned grasslands, but that three species had higher abundance, and three had lower abundance, on restored grasslands than on continuously grazed grasslands. Two studies found that grasslands restored by scrub clearing and grazing\\u00a0or mowing\\u00a0had a similar abundance of butterflies and burnet moths\\u00a0and heath fritillaries\\u00a0to unmanaged grasslands\\u00a0and continuously managed grasslands, although the abundance of heath fritillary adults and caterpillars was lower on restored grasslands than on continuously managed grasslands. The fifth study found that the density of blue-spot hairstreak eggs, and egg batches, was higher in grasslands restored by scrub cutting than in unrestored or continuously managed grasslands.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\\n\\nUse (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Germany found that in grasslands restored by scrub cutting, a greater proportion of small buckthorn bushes contained blue-spot hairstreak eggs than in unrestored or continuously managed grasslands.\"\n}"
