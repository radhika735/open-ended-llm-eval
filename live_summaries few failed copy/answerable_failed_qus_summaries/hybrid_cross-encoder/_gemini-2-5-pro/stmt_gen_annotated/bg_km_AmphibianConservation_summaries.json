Studies have found that translocating natterjack toad eggs, tadpoles, juveniles, or adults has established breeding populations, with re-establishment on dune or saltmarsh habitat being more successful than on heathland [859]. Populations at translocation sites increased, particularly with replicated translocations of wild rather than captive-bred toads [859]. Pond creation, along with other interventions, has been found to significantly increase natterjack toad populations, or in some cases, maintain or increase them at 75% of sites [866]. A study in the UK found that created ponds had lower tadpole mortality from desiccation but higher mortality from predation by invertebrates compared to natural ponds [866]. The practice of adding lime to water bodies to reduce acidification has shown varied outcomes. In some UK studies, adding limestone to ponds led to the establishment of a translocated natterjack toad population, increased populations as part of species-specific habitat management, and temporarily increased breeding [748]. However, other studies in the UK reported that adding limestone to ponds resulted in high tadpole mortality, pond abandonment by natterjack toads, and a higher number of abnormal common frog eggs [748].",

In contrast, seven studies yielded mixed results, as some frog species were challenging to maintain or raise to adulthood (835). One study found that frogs did not breed successfully in captivity, and another reported the death of all breeding frogs (835). Low froglet survival and the failure to raise three species to adulthood were noted in two other studies (835). The success of frog breeding in captivity is influenced by temperature, simulated wet and dry seasons, parental care, and density (835). Survival rates for captive-bred frogs have been reported as 30-88% for eggs hatching, 75% for survival to metamorphosis, 17-51% for froglets, and 50-90% for adults (835).

However, the number of mitigation licenses for great crested newts in England and Wales increased to over 600 over a ten-year period (779).\n\nFour UK-based studies showed that translocated great crested newts could maintain or establish breeding populations. However, one review indicated that populations were present in only 37% of cases one year after release, and another study noted that breeding failed in 48% of ponds within three years, even if the translocation initially seemed successful. Furthermore, a systematic review of 31 studies concluded there was no conclusive evidence that mitigation involving translocations led to self-sustaining populations. In 56% of translocations, great crested newts reproduced, sometimes aided by the release of head-started larvae and habitat management (858). Other studies in the UK and the USA also found that translocated eggs or adults of salamanders and smooth newts established breeding populations (860).\n\nIn Germany and the UK, three before-and-after studies showed that great crested newts (naturally colonizing, captive-bred, and translocated) established breeding populations in 57–75% of created ponds (863). A UK-based systematic review, however, found no conclusive evidence that mitigation with pond creation resulted in self-sustaining populations (863). Up to 88% of created ponds were colonized by translocated or naturally colonizing great crested newts, and another UK study found that head-started newts reproduced in 38% of created ponds (863). Additionally, providing artificial hibernacula along with other terrestrial habitat management was found to maintain great crested newt populations in a UK study (759). However, another UK study found that while common frogs and smooth newts used created hibernacula, great crested newts did not (759). In Germany, a study showed that captive-bred great crested newts and smooth newts released as larvae, juveniles, and adults established stable breeding populations (874).\n\nDraining ponds to remove fish was found to increase the number of amphibian species in a US study (826). In Estonia, pond restoration, including drying to eliminate fish, and pond creation led to an increase in the numbers of great crested newts compared to no management (826).
