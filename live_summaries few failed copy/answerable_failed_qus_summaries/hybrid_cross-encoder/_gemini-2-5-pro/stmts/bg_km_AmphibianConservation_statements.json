Multiple studies found that created ponds had similar or higher numbers of amphibian species compared to natural ponds, and that amphibians established stable populations in 50-100% of created ponds (869). The success of created ponds is influenced by factors such as age, permanence, vegetation, surrounding landscape, distance to other ponds, and the presence of fish (869). Creating wetlands has shown mixed results; some studies found that created wetlands had similar amphibian species numbers and abundance to natural wetlands, while others reported lower numbers (880). The design of the wetland, vegetation, water levels, surrounding habitat, presence of fish, and distance to source wetlands are factors that affect the colonization of created wetlands (880). Pond restoration has also yielded mixed but generally positive results, with several studies indicating that it increased amphibian species numbers, maintained or increased populations, and improved pond occupancy and breeding success (878). However, one study reported that pond restoration did not lead to an increase in great crested newt populations, and another noted varied effects on salamander hatching success depending on the restoration method (878).

For frogs, 23 out of 33 studies indicated that they produced eggs in captivity, with four of these studies reporting egg production from captive-bred females (835).

One study found that frogs did not breed successfully in captivity, and another reported the death of all breeding frogs (835). Low froglet survival and the failure to raise three species to adulthood were noted in two other studies (835). The success of frog breeding in captivity is influenced by temperature, simulated wet and dry seasons, parental care, and density (835). Survival rates for captive-bred frogs have been reported as 30-88% for eggs hatching, 75% for survival to metamorphosis, 17-51% for froglets, and 50-90% for adults (835). Additionally, a study on black-footed ferrets in the USA found that artificial insemination using preserved genetic material increased genetic diversity and reduced inbreeding in the captive population (2475).
