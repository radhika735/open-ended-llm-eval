Another study reported that herbicide application, along with other interventions, changed the plant community but could not prevent increases in shrub cover and prevented increases in plant species richness (1776). Prescribed fire has been shown to increase moss/lichen/bare ground cover in the short term, and lower heather cover, but it can also reduce or limit plant species richness (1774). The effects of cutting or mowing on plant communities were mixed, with some studies showing no significant effect and others reporting changes in community composition and increased cover of some desirable species like Sphagnum moss (1770, 1772).

      "relevant_summary": "Studies have looked into the effects of mowing and grazing on fens, offering alternatives to prescribed burning for vegetation management. In terms of vegetation, mowing has been shown to alter the overall plant community composition (1759, 1771). Multiple studies found that mowing increased plant species richness (1759), with one study noting a greater increase in summer-mown plots compared to those mown in spring or autumn (1771). Mowing also increased the cover of plants characteristic of fens or wet meadows (1759) and, in some cases, increased total moss or bryophyte cover (1759). It was found to reduce the cover of certain herbs and shrubs (1759). The impact on vegetation structure, such as height and biomass, was mixed (1759), and one study reported that mown fen meadows had a similar vegetation structure to grazed meadows (1759). Regarding wildlife, one study found that fens managed by mowing had a higher species richness of butterflies than fens managed by cattle grazing (3950). However, recently cut fens, or fens cut in autumn or winter, had fewer large copper butterfly eggs and lower caterpillar survival compared to uncut fens (3950). The timing of mowing can be significant, as one study reported that summer and winter mowing resulted in different plant community types, while another noted similar changes in composition regardless of the season (1771).",
