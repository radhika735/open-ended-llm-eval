      "relevant_summary": "Several alternative management strategies to prescribed burning for maintaining open grassland habitats for butterflies have been studied. One study found that the species richness of butterflies was similar on semi-natural grassland managed by light grazing or by annual mowing (3908). Another study found that grassland managed by sheep and cattle grazing had a higher species richness of butterflies than grassland mown annually (3908). Butterfly species richness was highest in grasslands where mowing was staggered throughout the year, with some areas left uncut (3908). In terms of abundance, five studies found that semi-natural grasslands had a similar abundance of butterflies when managed by extensive grazing compared to annual or occasional mowing (3908). However, some studies also found that grasslands managed by grazing had a higher abundance of butterflies than those managed by annual mowing (3908), while others found that haying resulted in a higher abundance of individual butterfly species than grazing (3908). Rotational grazing has also been explored as an alternative. Some studies found that rotational cattle and sheep-grazed grasslands had a greater species richness of butterflies and burnet moths than continuously grazed or patch-burned grassland (3965) and that rotational grazing, at high stocking densities, could also increase butterfly abundance (3965). Ceasing mowing to allow for early succession is another potential strategy. Some studies found that grasslands that had been abandoned for 3-13 years had a similar species richness of butterflies to managed grasslands, while meadows not cut all summer had a higher species richness of butterflies than those cut multiple times (3957). However, long-term abandonment of over 50 years could lead to lower species richness (3957). The impact of ceasing mowing on butterfly abundance is mixed, with some studies reporting lower abundance and others reporting higher abundance compared to mown grasslands (3957). Additionally, the management of surrounding habitats like hedgerows can benefit butterflies. Hedgerows with a more complex structure, with trees, or those cut less frequently (every 2-3 years) or laid/coppiced, were found to have a higher species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths (3975).",

A study in Brazil discovered that a forest that was managed with reduced-impact logging had a greater abundance of butterflies than a primary forest, as well as a similar diversity and species richness (3867). Another study in Brazil found that fruit-feeding butterflies were most abundant in forests with an intermediate intensity of reduced-impact logging (3867).

However, two of these studies only observed this difference in one of two years or regions [3958]. The remaining four studies found similar species richness between less intensively and conventionally managed grasslands, though one of these noted a higher number of specialist moth species and species of conservation concern in the less intensively managed areas [3958]. One study reported an increase in the species richness of large moths after the cessation of chemical applications and a reduction in grazing [3958]. In terms of population, three out of four studies found that low-input or unfertilized, ungrazed grasslands supported a higher abundance of butterflies, micro-moths, and declining macro-moths than intensively managed grasslands [3958]. In contrast, the abundance of caterpillars and all macro-moths was found to be similar in two of these studies [3958]. Another study found that moth abundance was similar in less intensively and more intensively managed grasslands [3958]. A study on margins near water bodies with restrictions on fertiliser and pesticide use found a similar species richness of moths to conventionally managed margins but a greater abundance of moths [3894]. Additionally, butterfly communities on low-input grasslands were found to have more specialist species [3958].",
