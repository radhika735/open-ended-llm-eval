Five studies found no effect of controlling understory vegetation on the emergence, survival, growth rate or frost damage in planted seedlings, though one found removing competing herbs increased seedling biomass (Action 1256). One study found that removal of sheep laurel shrubs increased the growth rate and height of planted black spruce seedlings (Action 1256). In freshwater wetlands, clearing vegetation before planting tree/shrub seedlings typically had no clear or significant effect on their height after 1-4 growing seasons, though one study found planted baldcypress seedlings were taller when planted amongst cut woody vegetation than below an uncleared canopy (Action 3334). For tree survival, clearing vegetation typically had no clear effect, though removing reed canarygrass before planting tree/shrub seedlings often increased survival rates (Action 3334).\n\nRegarding forest biodiversity effects, vegetation removal combined with mechanical soil disturbance increased the cover and diversity of understory plants while decreasing understory shrub cover (Action 1274). This combination also increased the density of young trees (Action 1274). Removal of invasive grass species increased understory plant biomass, and removal of invasive weed species increased tree seedling height (Action 1228). Tree thinning, which reduces competition, showed that 17 of 25 studies found increased density and cover of understory plants, while 13 of 19 studies found increased species richness and diversity of understory plants (Action 1211).

      "relevant_summary": "Several management techniques involving tree removal can be used to increase forest structural diversity. Shelterwood harvesting is a technique where trees are removed gradually in multiple stages rather than all at once, and studies show this method results in higher plant diversity and higher density of tree species compared with clearcutting (action 1214). Additionally, shelterwood harvesting increases abundance, species richness and diversity of understory plants, as well as the growth and survival rate of young trees (action 1223). Selective logging is another technique where specific trees are removed rather than clearing large areas, and studies indicate this method can maintain similar reptile species richness compared to high intensity selective logging (action 3637). Reduced impact logging has smaller effects on wildlife abundance than conventional logging (action 989) and can maintain similar species richness and diversity to primary forest (action 3867). Tree thinning is a technique where the density of trees is reduced, and thinning by girdling increases understory plant species richness, diversity and cover (action 1226). Regular forest thinning can result in areas having similar reptile species richness compared to areas with no thinning, with some studies showing higher abundance of reptiles than areas with no thinning (action 3627). Patch retention harvesting retains small patches of trees during harvest operations and areas under this method contain more birds of more species than clearcut areas while retaining similar numbers to unharvested areas (action 330). Variable retention management, which leaves trees distributed across the harvest area rather than concentrated in patches, resulted in nine bird species occurring at higher densities compared to control stands (action 332). Post-wildfire thinning increases plant species richness and increases the cover of aspen saplings (action 1234).",

Species richness of macro-moths was higher after shelterwood harvesting than after patch-cutting or clearcutting, with richness similar to thinned and unharvested forests (Action 3871).

Forests managed by group selection harvesting had similar moth species richness to those managed by single tree harvesting or clearcutting, but lower species richness than unharvested forest (Action 3868).\n\nThinning instead of clearcutting resulted in higher macro-moth species richness compared to patch-cutting or clearcutting, with richness similar to unharvested forests (Action 3868).\n\nWoody debris removal produced variable effects: one study found it increased understory vegetation cover, while three studies found no effect or mixed effects on cover (Action 1213). Four studies found no effect or mixed effects on understory vegetation species richness and diversity, and two found no effect on cover and species diversity of trees (Action 1213).

One study in Canada found that removal of woody debris increased survival rate of planted trees (Action 1257), while one study in the USA found mixed effects of removing, chopping and burning woody debris on the size of planted trees (Action 1257).\n\nLogging trees within forests increased density and cover of understory plants in five studies, while five studies found no effect or mixed effects (Action 1273).

Forest thinned up to 20 years previously had higher bat diversity than unthinned forest, though sites thinned more than 20 years previously did not differ. Forest thinned up to eight years previously or more than 20 years previously had higher bat activity than unthinned forest, but sites thinned 8-20 years previously did not differ. One study found the same bat species in thinned and unthinned forest, except for the chocolate wattled bat, which was not recorded in forests with unthinned regrowth.\n\n**Prescribed Fire Management:** Studies in Australia documented several effects of prescribed burning. In eucalyptus forest, selective burning resulted in fewer Eltham copper caterpillars in the spring following burning compared to before burning (Action 3877). Three studies in Australia found that prescribed burning in forest, open woodland and savanna had mixed effects on reptile populations (Action 3646). One study found that reptile abundance increased with time since burning, while others found similar reptile species richness in burned versus unburned areas. One study found that areas of woodland managed by burning and vegetation thinning had higher reptile species richness than unmanaged areas (Action 3655).\n\n**Burning Timing Effects:** One study in Australia found that in forest burned early in the dry season, northern brown bandicoot survival rate declined less than in forests burned late in the dry season (Action 2416).\n\n**Woody Debris Addition:** A randomised, replicated, controlled study from Australia found that brown treecreeper numbers were higher in plots with large amounts of dead wood added, compared to control plots or those with less debris added (Action 344).\n\n**Grazing Cessation:** Two studies in Australia examining the cessation of livestock grazing in forest, open woodland and savanna found mixed results for reptiles (Action 3511). Studies found that ungrazed and grazed areas had similar reptile species richness and diversity, though grazing had mixed effects on reptile abundance.\n\n**Combined Management Approaches:** Studies in Australia found that areas managed by burning in combination with vegetation cutting had mixed effects on reptile populations, with some showing similar abundance compared to burning only or unmanaged areas (Action 3655).",
