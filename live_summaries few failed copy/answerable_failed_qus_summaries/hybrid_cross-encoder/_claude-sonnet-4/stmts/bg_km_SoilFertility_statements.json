Growing cover crops when fields are empty improves soil structure and nutrient retention, with studies finding reduced nitrate leaching (Action 898). Four replicated, randomized, controlled studies found that less nitrate was leached from soils with winter cover crops compared to soils without them (Action 1357). Growing cover crops beneath main crops or between crop rows also helps retain nutrients (Action 897).\n\nChemical amendments can reduce nitrate losses. Three of five trials testing nitrification inhibitors found reduced nitrate losses and nitrous oxide emissions when applied to soil, although the method of application influenced effectiveness (Action 909).\n\nTiming management strategies are important. Delaying ploughing until spring reduces nitrate leaching compared to autumn ploughing (Action 712).\n\nOrganic amendments help with nutrient retention. Three randomized, replicated studies found reduced nutrient loss and higher nitrogen levels when farmyard or poultry manure was applied, with one study finding lower nutrient loss when farmyard manure was applied in winter rather than autumn (Action 911). Using organic rather than mineral fertilizers supports better nutrient management (Action 134).\n\nBuffer strips provide protection against nutrient runoff. Studies found less nitrate in runoff from irrigated pastures with buffer strips compared to those without (Action 1387). Buffer strips also increase nitrogen retention in soils (Action 1372) and reduce pesticide and nutrient runoff into waterways (Action 3894).\n\nReducing chemical inputs in grassland management helps prevent excess nutrient loss while maintaining soil health (Action 694).",

Soil amendments offer various options: manures and agricultural composts increase soil organic matter, improve soil physical properties, and reduce soil loss and water runoff, with effectiveness shown on sandy loam and sandy clay loam soils (Action 911). Organic processing wastes and their composts improve soil structure and reduce soil loss on sandy-clay and sandy loam soils (Action 891). Non-chemical minerals and mineral wastes reduce nutrient loss and erosion on sandy clay soils (Action 892). Bacterial and fungal amendments increase soil organic matter content and work on sandy-loam soils (Action 888). Changing tillage practices to no-tillage or reduced tillage systems increases soil organic carbon and organic matter content, with studies showing higher soil water content and improved water absorption on various soil types including sandy and sandy loam soils (Action 906). Chemical soil amendments with fertilizers increase soil organic matter and carbon, particularly effective on loamy sand and sandy loam soils (Action 909).",

Manure applications also demonstrate reduced soil loss and water runoff when combined with other treatments (action 911), higher crop yields (action 911), and improved soil stability in some comparisons (action 1363).

Adding organic processing wastes or their composts (Action 891) also improves soil structure, with one trial finding that applying high rates of cotton gin compost and poultry manure improved soil structure. Using a mix of organic and inorganic amendments (Action 902) was found to be more effective at reducing the size of cracks in dry soil than inorganic fertilizers alone.\n\n**Cover Crops and Crop Management**: Growing cover crops when the field is empty (Action 898) improves soil structure, with three randomized, replicated studies finding that growing cover crops improved soil structure, including higher soil porosity and interconnectivity and lower resistance. Using crop rotation (Action 857) that includes legumes increases water infiltration and improves soil structure. Retaining crop residues (Action 907) provides mixed effects on soil physical properties including penetration resistance and the size of soil aggregates.\n\n**Tillage Practices**: Changing tillage practices (Action 906) can improve soil structure, with two studies finding reduced compaction under controlled traffic, and one finding that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Using reduced tillage (Action 1371) results in soil aggregates having higher water-stability and more large aggregates in some comparisons. Using no tillage instead of reduced tillage (Action 1370) creates more large aggregates and higher water-stability in some comparisons.\n\n**Traffic Management**: Controlling traffic and traffic timing (Action 899) improves soil structure by creating a higher number of pores in the soil, less compaction, reduced runoff and increased water filtration into the soil.\n\nThese actions have been tested on various soil types including clay and clay-loam soils specifically.",
