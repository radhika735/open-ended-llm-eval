Fallowing periods demonstrate effectiveness - a trial in Tasmania found sediment community structure under Atlantic salmon cages became more similar to non-impacted sites over two fallowing cycles (Action 1027). Three studies on leaving fallow periods during fish farming found that after fallowing, invertebrate community composition became similar to that before fish were added, and abundances of pollution-indicator polychaete worms decreased, though communities remained different from sites without fish farms (Action 2191). Integrated aquaculture systems show promise for waste management - a study in Canada found that blue mussels absorbed waste from a salmon farm, while studies in the USA and Scotland reported enhanced growth of scallops and algal growth when placed adjacent to fish farms (Action 932). Natural control methods for reducing chemical treatments include using cleaner wrasse for sea lice control - one controlled study in Ireland found corkwing and goldskinny cleaner wrasse were as effective at controlling lice infestation as chemical treatments (Action 738). Lighting modifications also show potential - a study in Norway reported lower numbers of lice on salmon kept in low intensity artificial light or natural lighting (Action 741). Non-chemical treatments like freshwater bathing provide mixed results for disease control - studies in Australia showed mixed evidence for reducing amoebic gill disease (Action 739). However, no studies were found evaluating the effects of improving fish food to reduce waste production, locating aquaculture systems in vegetated areas, or cleaning waste water before environmental release (Actions 2192, 2189, 3142).",
