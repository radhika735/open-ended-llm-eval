      "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from multiple studies, several interventions have proven effective for restoring peatland vegetation. The moss layer transfer technique shows promising results, with studies in Canadian bogs demonstrating that restored areas developed bog-characteristic plant species within 11 years and achieved greater moss/bryophyte cover including Sphagnum compared to unrestored areas (Action 1804). Direct planting of peatland mosses is effective, with studies showing that planted Sphagnum had high survival rates (47 out of 50 planted sods survived for one year in Lithuania) and increased moss coverage in multiple locations including the Netherlands, Germany, Ireland, Estonia and Australia (Action 1818). Adding mixed vegetation to peatland surfaces shows consistent results across 18 studies in bogs, with Sphagnum moss present after 1-6 growing seasons in plots sown with vegetation containing Sphagnum, though cover was very low unless plots were mulched after spreading fragments (Action 1822). Direct planting of trees and shrubs demonstrates good survival rates, with eight studies reporting that the majority of planted trees/shrubs survived over periods between 10 weeks and 13 years in peat swamp forests and bogs, though species-specific survival varied (Action 1820). Multiple intervention approaches combining various techniques proved effective, with five studies showing increased total moss or bryophyte cover, and restoration interventions also increased cover of herbaceous plants and overall vegetation cover (Action 1803). Introducing seeds of peatland trees/shrubs showed mixed results, with some studies reporting successful germination and increased shrub cover, while others found limited survival of seedlings (Action 1824). Additional supportive interventions include removing competing vegetation, which aided Sphagnum moss survival when sown into areas where purple moor grass had been cut (Action 1840), and irrigation, which increased Sphagnum moss shoots and promoted colonization by wetland-characteristic herbs (Action 1859).",

Chemical control using herbicides is another option - one study in fens in the USA found that applying herbicide to shrubs changed the overall plant community composition, though it could not prevent increases in shrub cover over time and prevented increases in plant species richness (Action 1776). Cutting and mowing represents a mechanical alternative - studies in fens and fen meadows found that mowing altered plant community composition, increased cover of fen-characteristic plants and moss cover, reduced cover of herbs including reeds and sedges, and increased plant species richness (Action 1759). The timing of cutting can also be varied as a control strategy - studies found that summer-mown plots had greater increases in plant species richness compared to spring- or autumn-mown plots (Action 1771).

Lobbying, campaigning, and demonstrating for peatland protection resulted in increased area of protected peatland in the UK, behavior change among major retailers who stopped buying compost containing peat from important peatland areas, and horticultural companies began marketing peat-free compost (Action 1849). Additionally, garden centres and local governments signed peatland conservation agreements following campaign pressure (Action 1849). Legal protection of peatlands showed mixed results, with some studies reporting that protected areas maintained greater vegetation cover than unprotected adjacent areas, though peatland area initially decreased before then increasing following legal protection (Action 1796). Payment schemes for landowners to protect peatlands demonstrated mixed effectiveness, with agri-environment schemes in the UK protecting bog habitat in three of six cases (Action 1799). On-the-ground protection measures such as anti-logging patrols resulted in decreased numbers of illegal sawmills in Indonesian peat swamp forests (Action 1800). However, some policy approaches lacked sufficient research evidence, with no studies found evaluating the effects of zero burning policies near peatlands or creating 'no net loss' wetland legislation specifically for peatlands (Actions 1856, 1797).",

Five studies reported that after planting mosses, the area covered by moss increased in at least some cases (Action 1818).\n\n**Seeds:**\nFor herbs, two replicated studies reported that some planted herb seeds germinated, with three of four species germinating in a bog in Germany, but only one of seven species germinating in a fen in the USA (Action 1823).

      "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, several water level manipulation interventions have been studied on drained peatlands without planting. Rewetting peatlands by raising the water table (action ID 1756) was evaluated in 36 studies across bogs, fens, and other peatlands. This intervention typically caused drier grassland communities to be replaced by more wetland- or peatland-characteristic communities, with rewetted plots developing different plant communities compared to drained plots. Rewetting increased Sphagnum moss cover or abundance in 12 studies across multiple countries, though three studies reported mixed responses by species and two studies found no effect. The intervention increased cover of various herb groups, with particularly strong effects on sedges (increased in 13 of 15 studies), cottongrass (increased in 8 of 9 studies), and reeds/rushes (increased in 5 of 7 studies), while purple moor grass cover was typically reduced. Tree and shrub cover was generally reduced or unaffected by rewetting. Effects on overall plant species richness were mixed, with six studies reporting increases, five finding no effect, and one study reporting reduced diversity.\n\nIrrigation of peatlands without planting (action ID 1859) was studied in only two investigations. In a Canadian bog, irrigation increased Sphagnum moss shoots after one growing season but had no effect after two seasons. In a German fen, irrigation led to colonization by wetland- and fen-characteristic herbs while cover of dryland grasses decreased.\n\nDraining or replacing acidic water (action ID 1791) was evaluated in two fen studies in the Netherlands, showing mixed effects on Sphagnum moss and herb cover after 4-5 years depending on species and whether moss was also removed, though one study reported increased plant species richness.",
