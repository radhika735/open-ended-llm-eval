For solitary bees, 29 out of 30 replicated trials showed occupancy by bees across 10 countries including Europe, North and South America and Asia (Action 47). Occupancy rates for solitary bee nest boxes, where reported, were between 1 and 26% of available cavities (Action 80). The number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site, as demonstrated in three trials on agricultural land (Action 47). One study estimated that the number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes compared to fields without nest boxes (Action 47). In contrast, bumblebee nest box success is much lower. Three replicated trials since 1989 in the UK showed very low uptake rates of 0-2.5% for various nest box designs, while seven earlier trials in the UK, USA or Canada showed overall uptake rates between 10% and 48% (Action 48). Two replicated trials tested bumblebee nest boxes and both found very low uptake of 2% or less (Action 80). Underground nest boxes buried 5-10 cm underground with entrance pipes are generally the most effective for bumblebees, with seven replicated trials finding between 6% and 58% occupancy, but even these rates are often lower than solitary bee success rates (Action 48). However, there is no evidence captured for the effects of providing nest boxes on bumblebee populations (Action 48).",

Nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes were occupied in 23 trials, while blocks of wood drilled with holes were occupied in 11 trials (Action 47). Reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees per nest than other types, while plastic-lined holes or plastic/paper tubes were much less productive due to parasitism or mould (Action 47). Ten studies from Germany, Poland and the UK showed solitary bee nest boxes were readily used, with local population sizes increasing when boxes were provided (Action 80). Occupancy rates ranged from 1-26% of available cavities, supporting 4.6-33 bee species (Action 80). The number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision (Actions 47, 80).\n\nFor ground-nesting bees: Creating patches of bare ground is effective, with one replicated controlled trial in Germany and four small trials showing artificially exposed bare soil areas can be successfully colonized by ground-nesting solitary bees and wasps in the first or second year (Action 13).\n\nFor commercial species: Several megachilid solitary bee species are successfully reared and managed commercially using drilled wooden blocks or stacked grooved boards of wood or polystyrene, with local populations increasing up to six-fold in one year under good management conditions with plentiful floral resources (Action 54).\n\nImportant considerations include: nest boxes must be placed within 150-600 m of foraging resources (Actions 47, 80), mortality rates from parasites and predators range from 2-56% depending on species and location (Action 47), and bumblebee nest boxes show very low uptake of 2% or less (Action 80).

Reducing the intensity of farmland meadow management through delayed first cutting and reduced agrochemical use can enhance numbers and diversity of wild bees (Action 22).

Field margin management is particularly effective, with uncropped arable field margins sown with native wildflower seed mixes supporting higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees than cropped field edges, grassy margins, or naturally regenerated margins, especially when perennial leguminous herbs are included (Action 19). Naturally regenerated uncropped field margins also support more bumblebees and bee species than cropped margins (Action 20).\n\nArtificial nest site provision shows consistent success, with 29 out of 30 replicated trials across 10 countries demonstrating occupancy by solitary bees, including endangered species, with nest boxes effective within 150-600m of foraging resources (Action 47). Active management of solitary bee populations can increase local populations up to six-fold in one year under good conditions with plentiful floral resources (Action 54).

Along road and railway verges, restored roadside prairies and verges sown with native wildflowers had higher species richness and diversity of pollinators than verges dominated by non-native vegetation (Action 3854). Altering mowing regimes on greenspaces and road verges also showed benefits, with less frequently mown or unmown urban greenspaces having higher species richness and diversity of butterflies and moths than more frequently mown areas (Action 3841). \n\nUrban environments offer additional opportunities through planting parks, gardens and road verges with appropriate native species, which showed greater species richness of butterfly and moth adults and caterpillars compared to areas with mixed or exclusively non-native plant species (Action 3842). Green infrastructure in urban areas such as green roofs had lower abundance of butterflies than urban parks, but abundance was higher on older green roofs with more nectar plant species in larger areas (Action 3837). Wildlife gardening practices in urban settings showed mixed results, with gardens where insecticides and herbicides were not used having higher abundance of butterflies (Action 3834, 3900).\n\nHedgerow planting provided benefits with more bee species found in fields with hedgerows or in hedgerows themselves compared to fields or field edges without hedgerows, and higher crop visitation rates by native bees in fields next to planted hedgerows (Action 1407). Habitat restoration along watercourses showed similar numbers of bees and bee species in restored versus remnant sites, though with different bee communities (Action 1408). Additionally, stopping herbicide use on pavements and road verges resulted in greater species richness and abundance of butterflies in restored roadside prairies compared to areas with unrestricted herbicide application (Action 3899).

At the local patch scale, fourteen trials in Europe and North America recorded substantial numbers of wild bees foraging on perennial or annual sown flowering plants in agricultural environments (Action 17). Ten trials monitoring bees foraging on patches sown with phacelia found substantial numbers of foraging wild bees, particularly bumblebees, with species richness ranging from eight to 35 species in six trials (Action 17). Field margins sown with wild flowers consistently supported higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees compared to cropped field edges, grassy margins, or naturally regenerated margins across five replicated trials (Action 19). However, when examining wider landscape effects, one trial in the Netherlands showed that bee numbers and species richness were not higher in farmland 50-1,500 meters away from planted flower patches (Action 17). In contrast, at the landscape scale, one large replicated controlled trial showed that the average abundance of long-tongued bumblebees on field margins was positively correlated with the number of pollen and nectar agri-environment agreements in a 10 km grid square (Actions 21, 362). Studies of artificial nest sites found that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 meters, indicating local-scale constraints on bee movement (Action 47). Additionally, landscape-scale evaluations found that two replicated trials in the UK showed bumblebee populations were not enhanced on farmland managed under agri-environment schemes when compared at broad spatial scales (Action 24).",
