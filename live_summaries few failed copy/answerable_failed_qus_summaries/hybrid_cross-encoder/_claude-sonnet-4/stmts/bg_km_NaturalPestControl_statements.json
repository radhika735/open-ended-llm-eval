      "relevant_summary": "The most effective actions for increasing natural enemy populations on farmland include several habitat management and chemical control strategies. Creating beetle banks provides habitat for natural enemies, with studies finding higher numbers of invertebrate predators on beetle banks compared to surrounding crops, though effects varied with time and location (Action 729, 651). Natural regeneration of ground cover beneath perennial crops shows mixed results, with some studies finding more natural enemies in natural ground cover, particularly short-term effects for most natural enemy groups (Action 720). \n\nPlanting specific vegetation can attract and support natural enemies. Growing non-crop plants that produce chemicals attractive to natural enemies resulted in higher numbers of natural enemies in three of four studies, with one replicated, randomised, controlled trial showing increased natural enemy populations (Action 724). Planting flowers in strips led to more natural enemies in fields with planted flower strips compared to fields without them, with two replicated studies from the USA showing positive effects (Action 1400). Planting hedgerows resulted in more natural enemies in fields with hedgerows compared to fields with weedy edges in some comparisons (Action 1401). Planting nettle strips in field margins resulted in higher numbers of aphid predator species (Action 118).\n\nChemical attraction methods can also be effective. Using chemicals to attract natural enemies increased natural enemy populations in five of 13 studies from multiple continents, though eight studies found positive effects that varied between enemy groups, sites or study dates (Action 754). Two of four studies found higher chemical doses attracted more enemies (Action 754).\n\nManagement practices that reduce pesticide impacts support natural enemy populations. Delaying herbicide use resulted in more natural enemies in two randomised, replicated, controlled trials from Australia and Denmark, though some but not all natural enemy groups benefited (Action 774). Incorporating parasitism rates when setting thresholds for insecticide use resulted in acceptable levels of crop damage while considering natural enemy activity, though effects on natural enemy populations were not directly monitored (Action 726).\n\nMass-emergence devices showed limited effectiveness, with one study in Switzerland finding higher parasitism at one site but no effect at another site (Action 775). Adding compost to soil showed mixed results, with one study finding similar ratios of natural enemies to pests and similar percentages of pests consumed by natural enemies in plots with or without added compost (Action 1392).",
