Creating hole habitats (>50 mm) showed mixed effects on invertebrate abundances, with one study finding increased abundance of brown crabs but not other mobile invertebrates, while another reported mixed effects depending on species group (action 3434). Creating short flexible habitats (1-50 mm) had mixed effects on mobile and non-mobile invertebrate abundance, varying by survey week, species group, flexible habitat length, or site (action 3450). Creating textured surfaces (≤1 mm) produced mixed effects on non-mobile invertebrate abundance depending on the site (action 3449). Creating long flexible habitats (>50 mm) resulted in mixed effects on mobile and non-mobile invertebrate abundance depending on species group and survey week, or flexible habitat length and density, with one study finding decreased mussel abundance on structure surfaces but that the flexible habitats themselves supported higher biomass, mostly mussels (action 3451). Transplanting or seeding organisms showed positive results, with one study finding transplanting sea urchins reduced non-native sea mat cover on kelps, and another reporting that transplanting corals increased coral cover on structure surfaces (action 3471). Creating groove habitats (1-50 mm) had mixed effects on invertebrate abundances depending on species group (action 3448). Creating pit habitats (1-50 mm) also had mixed effects on invertebrate abundances depending on species group (action 3455). Different artificial reef structures and materials showed varying results, with some studies finding no differences in invertebrate abundances between different reef structures and materials, while others found specific materials like oyster shell bags recruited more oysters and ribbed mussels compared to \"ReefBall\" breakwaters (action 2259). Ceasing or altering maintenance activities showed limited effects on overall abundance but one study found reducing the cleaning area increased seahorse abundance on structure surfaces (action 3447).

Community composition studies show that creating groove habitats and small ridges/ledges can alter combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition, with effects depending on site-specific factors, the presence of water-retaining and light-shading covers, and the size and arrangement of features (Action 3474). Multiple studies found that these linear features support species that were absent from structure surfaces without grooves and ridges/ledges (Action 3474).\n\nFor species richness and diversity, six of 11 studies found that creating groove habitats and small ridges/ledges increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species diversity and/or richness on structure surfaces (Action 3474). However, effects varied depending on depth/height of grooves and ridges, shore level, species group and site (Action 3474). Comparative studies found that grooves supported higher species richness than small ridges or ledges created in between them, though species diversity in grooves versus ridges varied depending on groove depth (Action 3473).\n\nPopulation abundance responses were mixed across studies. Two of six studies found that creating groove habitats and small ridges/ledges did not increase combined macroalgae and invertebrate abundance, while two found increases when features were partially-covered with water-retaining and light-shading covers or combined with large ledges (Action 3474). For invertebrates specifically, five of seven studies found mixed effects on mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate, limpet, mussel, juvenile oyster and barnacle abundances, depending on feature depth/height, presence of large ledges or covers, shore level, and site (Action 3474).\n\nFish responses showed that creating groove habitats and small ridges/ledges generally did not increase fish species richness or abundance, with two of three studies finding no increase in fish species richness (Action 3474). However, behavioral effects included increased feeding activity for juvenile salmon and increased time benthic fishes spent interacting with structure surfaces (Action 3474). Large ridges or ledges (>50 mm) showed different patterns, with studies finding increased abundance of mussels or limpets but not barnacles, and increased rockweed abundance (Action 3465).\n\nGroove habitats specifically were found to be colonized by microalgal species and were used by mussels and periwinkles (Actions 3474, 3473).

Creating pit habitats showed variable effectiveness, with studies finding that pit creation did not alter community composition in some cases, did not increase species richness in some studies, and decreased combined macroalgae and invertebrate abundance in one study (Action 3475). The effects of pit habitats were frequently site-dependent and varied based on pit size and arrangement. Creating textured surfaces had mixed effects on species richness depending on the type of texture created and the site, and some studies found no increase in macroalgal or invertebrate abundance on structure surfaces (Action 3466). Reducing slope showed limited benefits, with one study finding no increase in macroalgal abundance or oyster and mobile invertebrate abundance on structure surfaces (Action 3461). Creating hole habitats showed some limitations, with studies reporting no increase in macroalgal abundance and mixed effects on limpet abundance depending on shore level and site (Action 3467).
