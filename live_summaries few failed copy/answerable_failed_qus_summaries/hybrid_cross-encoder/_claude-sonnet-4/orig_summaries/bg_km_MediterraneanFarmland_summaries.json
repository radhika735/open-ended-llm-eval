For organic matter content, twelve studies found more organic matter in soils with added compost compared to soils without (Action 1362), while five studies found more organic matter in soils with added manure compared to soils without it, though three studies found similar amounts (Action 1363). Regarding nutrients, six studies found more nutrients in soils with added compost in some or all comparisons, though three studies found inconsistent nitrogen differences and one found no phosphorus differences (Action 1362). For manure, three studies found more nitrogen and two found more potassium in soils with added manure, while one found more phosphorus, though results were mixed for nitrogen in two studies and inconsistent for phosphorus in one study (Action 1363). For soil organisms, six studies found more microbial biomass in soils with added compost in some or all comparisons (Action 1362), while two studies found similar amounts of microbial biomass in soils with or without added manure (Action 1363). Both amendments reduce soil erosion and improve stability, with two studies showing less erosion and four showing greater stability with compost (Action 1362), and one study showing less erosion and three showing higher soil stability with manure (Action 1363). However, greenhouse gas emissions differ, with six studies finding more greenhouse gas emissions in soils with added compost (Action 1362), while one study found higher carbon dioxide emissions and one found higher nitrous oxide emissions with manure (Action 1363). Studies combining manures and agricultural composts found higher microbial biomass, reduced nutrient loss, higher nitrogen levels, increased organic carbon, and higher crop yields (Action 911).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on studies from Mediterranean countries including Spain, Italy, and Portugal, several potential negative impacts of no-tillage systems in arable fields have been documented. Crop yield reductions are a significant concern, with multiple replicated, controlled studies from Spain showing lower cereal yields in no-tillage plots compared to reduced tillage in some comparisons (action 1358). Seven replicated, controlled studies from Italy, Lebanon, Spain, and the USA found lower crop yields in plots with no tillage compared to conventional tillage in some or all comparisons (action 1355). Specifically for fruits and vegetables, three replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Italy found lower fruit or vegetable yields in plots with no tillage compared to reduced tillage in some comparisons (action 1358). One replicated, randomized, controlled study from Spain found lower sunflower seed yields in plots with no tillage compared to reduced tillage in some comparisons (action 1358). Regarding crop quality, one replicated, controlled study from Italy found less protein in wheat grains from plots with no tillage compared to conventional tillage (action 1355). Soil compaction issues are another concern, as three replicated trials found higher compaction under reduced tillage (action 906). Weed management challenges may occur, with one replicated, controlled study from Australia finding more weeds in plots with no tillage compared to reduced tillage (action 1398). Regarding soil nutrients, six replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Spain found less nitrogen in soils without tillage in some or all comparisons (action 1369), and one replicated, randomized, controlled study from Portugal found less phosphorus in soils without tillage compared to soils with tillage in some comparisons (action 1369). Additionally, one replicated, randomized, controlled study from Portugal found lower pH levels in soils without tillage compared to soils with tillage in some comparisons (action 1369). Soil erosion may also be problematic, as two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover (action 906).",

Thirty-four studies (of which 21 were replicated and controlled and seven also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found some positive effects on earthworms, some invertebrates (other than earthworms), weeds or farmland birds, of reducing tillage compared to conventional management. Positive effects included increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms, greater abundance of some invertebrates other than earthworms, increased numbers of some weeds and/or weed species, higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying date and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields, and greater abundance of some birds - including Eurasian skylark, seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in late winter on non-inversion or conservation tillage. A review found tillage had negative effects on invertebrate numbers and no-till systems had more invertebrate bird food resources.\\nTwenty-six studies (of which 13 replicated and controlled and three also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found reducing tillage had either negative, no effect or no consistent effects on abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates (other than earthworms), earthworm abundance, biomass, or species richness, number of different plant species found as seeds, number of some weed species, mammal abundance, some bird species, and one study found bird preferences for conservation tillage fields decreased over time. Two studies found that crop type affected the number of weeds under different tillage regimes.\\nOne small replicated trial in the UK compared bird numbers under two different forms of reduced tillage, and found more birds from species that make up the \\u2018Farmland Bird Index\\u2019 on broadcast than non-inversion tillage fields.\\nTwo studies looked at the long-term effects of reduced tillage on earthworms (after ten years). One study found higher earthworm biomass under reduced tillage, the other study found earthworm abundance was the same between conventional and reduced tillage plots.\\nThree of the studies mentioned above did not distinguish between the effects of reducing tillage and reduced pesticide and/or fertilizer inputs.\"\n}"

One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done.

For reduced tillage, one meta-analysis from Mediterranean countries and eleven replicated studies from Italy, Spain, Syria, and the USA found more organic matter compared to conventional tillage (Action 1371). When directly comparing the two systems, three replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Spain found more organic matter in no-tillage compared to reduced tillage, while three other studies found similar amounts (Action 1370).\n\n**Soil Structure and Aggregation**: No-tillage systems showed that seven replicated studies from Spain and the USA found soils were more stable than tilled soils (Action 1369). For reduced tillage, three replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Spain found soil aggregates had higher water-stability compared to conventional tillage (Action 1371). Direct comparison showed one study from Spain found more large aggregates and higher water-stability in no-tillage compared to reduced tillage in some comparisons (Action 1370).\n\n**Soil Organisms**: Both systems support microbial biomass, with eleven replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Italy, Spain, and the USA finding more microbial biomass in reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage (Action 1371), and five replicated, controlled studies from Italy and Spain finding more microbial biomass in no-tillage compared to conventional tillage (Action 1369). When comparing the two systems directly, five studies from Spain found similar amounts of microbial biomass between no-tillage and reduced tillage (Action 1370).\n\n**Nutrients**: For nitrogen, six replicated studies from Italy, Spain, and the USA found more nitrogen in no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, while seven studies found more nitrogen in reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage (Actions 1369, 1371). Direct comparison showed three studies from Italy and Spain found more nitrogen in no-tillage compared to reduced tillage in some comparisons (Action 1370).\n\n**Water Management**: Nine controlled studies from Spain and the USA found more water in soils without tillage compared to conventional tillage (Action 1384), while six controlled studies from Egypt and Spain found more water in soils with reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage (Action 1386).",

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done.

Carbon dioxide emissions from slurry showed mixed results, with two studies finding higher emissions while one found no difference (Action 1365). Methane effects were generally minimal, with three studies finding similar methane fluxes and one study finding reduced methane absorption (Action 1365). \n\nCompost additions to Mediterranean soils showed increased greenhouse gas emissions in most cases. Six studies from Italy, Spain, and the USA found more greenhouse gas emissions in soils with added compost compared to soils without compost, though four studies from Spain found no differences (Action 1362).\n\nWhen comparing organic versus inorganic fertilizers in Mediterranean contexts, the effects varied by gas type. For carbon dioxide, four studies from Italy and Spain found higher emissions from organic fertilizer plots compared to inorganic fertilizer, though one study found similar emissions (Action 1366). Nitrous oxide showed mixed results, with three studies finding lower emissions from organic fertilizer while five studies found similar emissions compared to inorganic fertilizer (Action 1366). For methane, two studies found that organic fertilizer soils absorbed more methane than inorganic fertilizer soils, while two studies found similar absorption rates (Action 1366).\n\nManure additions showed limited greenhouse gas data from Mediterranean studies, with one study from Spain finding higher nitrous oxide emissions and one from the USA finding higher carbon dioxide emissions compared to plots without manure (Action 1363).

Adding bacteria or fungi to soil resulted in higher microbial diversity (Action 888), and mycorrhizal-inoculated compost applications increased soil organic matter content (Action 888). A study from Italy found that reducing fertilizer, pesticide or herbicide use generally resulted in higher diversity of soil invertebrates and microorganisms in low-input systems (Action 904). Cover crops or ground cover in perennial crops increased microbial biomass, symbiotic fungi (mycorrhizae), bacteria, and nematodes in soils (Action 2304). Organic farming showed higher numbers, diversity, functional diversity or activity of soil organisms (Action 895). Sewage sludge amendments showed similar amounts of microbial biomass in soils with or without added sewage sludge (Action 2303).

Tillage practices play a crucial role: reduced tillage was found to increase water content in soils in some or all comparisons compared to conventional tillage, while crops used water more efficiently in plots with reduced tillage in some comparisons (Action 1386). No tillage was found to be even more effective, with more water found in soils with no tillage compared to reduced tillage in some or all comparisons, and crops using water more efficiently in one of four comparisons (Action 1385). Reduced tillage also increased water infiltration rates and reduced water loss through runoff in some comparisons (Action 1386), while no-tillage in the absence of crop cover increased soil loss (Action 906). \n\nMulching practices significantly improve water retention: adding mulch to crops increased soil moisture according to two replicated trials from India (Action 887). Cover crops beneath the main crop or between crop rows reduced erosion and improved soil stability (Action 897), while retaining crop residues reduced water runoff and increased water storage according to one review (Action 907). \n\nCrop rotation, particularly including legumes, increased water infiltration in replicated trials from Syria (Action 857). Buffer strips can also help retain soil moisture, with one study finding more soil moisture in plots with buffers compared to plots without buffers in some comparisons (Action 1387).",

One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage.

For hedgerow management, ten studies from Switzerland and the UK found that managing hedges for wildlife resulted in increased berry yields, species diversity or richness of plants and invertebrates and diversity or abundance of farmland birds (Action 116).\n\nFor watercourse restoration, one study from Spain found similar numbers of bird species in restored and remnant riparian sites, while another from Spain found similar numbers of birds and bird species in restored contaminated sites and uncontaminated sites (Action 1416). Three studies from the Netherlands and the UK reported that riparian buffer strips had a positive influence on plant, invertebrate and bird diversity or abundance (Action 120).\n\nLimited evidence from Mediterranean regions includes one study from Spain that found more birds and higher bird diversity in a vineyard with resident vegetation compared to bare soil between vine rows, and another Spanish study found more birds and higher bird diversity in a vineyard with mown resident vegetation compared to herbicide-treated vegetation (Action 1413). However, comprehensive evidence specifically examining habitat creation impacts on Mediterranean farmland biodiversity remains scarce in the available studies.",

Seven studies from the UK, Ireland and Canada found that established hedgerows had higher species richness of butterflies and macro-moths compared to in-field beetle banks, crops or pasture, and higher abundance of butterflies, moths and macro-moths along hedgerows (Action 3976). For hedgerow management, ten studies from Switzerland and the UK found that managing hedges for wildlife resulted in increased berry yields, species diversity or richness of plants and invertebrates and diversity or abundance of farmland birds (Action 116).\\n\\nFor watercourse restoration, one study from Spain found similar numbers of bird species in restored and remnant riparian sites, while another from Spain found similar numbers of birds and bird species in restored contaminated sites and uncontaminated sites (Action 1416). Three studies from the Netherlands and the UK reported that riparian buffer strips had a positive influence on plant, invertebrate and bird diversity or abundance (Action 120).\\n\\nLimited evidence from Mediterranean regions includes one study from Spain that found more birds and higher bird diversity in a vineyard with resident vegetation compared to bare soil between vine rows, and another Spanish study found more birds and higher bird diversity in a vineyard with mown resident vegetation compared to herbicide-treated vegetation (Action 1413).

However, some studies also found lower biomass, cover, or abundance of certain plant groups in areas with grazers excluded compared to grazed areas (Action 2292, Action 1417).\n\nRegarding plant diversity, the effects vary considerably. Some studies in Israel and Spain found more species, or fewer non-native species, in areas with cattle or sheep excluded compared to grazed areas (Action 2292, Action 1417). Conversely, other studies in these regions found fewer species or native species, larger decreases in the number of species, or smaller increases in the number of species, in areas with cattle, sheep, or alpacas excluded compared to grazed areas (Action 2292, Action 1417). Additionally, some studies found higher plant diversity or different community composition in plots with cattle excluded compared to grazed plots, while others found no difference in plant diversity between excluded and grazed plots (Action 2292, Action 1417).\n\nStudies also examined different grazing intensities rather than complete exclusion. In Chile and Israel, lower grazing intensities resulted in higher cover of some plant species, herbaceous plants, or native plants compared to higher intensities, though some plant groups showed lower cover or biomass with reduced grazing (Action 2294). Plant diversity responses to grazing intensity varied, with some studies finding no differences between different cattle-grazing intensities, while one study in Chile found fewer native species and more non-native species in paddocks with lower sheep-grazing intensities (Action 2294).",

Three replicated studies (including one randomized, controlled study and two site comparison studies) in Switzerland, Germany\\u00a0and the UK\\u00a0found that grasslands which had been abandoned for 4, 5\\u201310\\u00a0or &gt;10 years\\u00a0had a higher species richness of butterflies and day-flying moths\\u00a0and nocturnal moths\\u00a0than extensively grazed, recently abandoned\\u00a0or commercially grazed grasslands. Two of these studies also found that grassland abandoned for 4\\u00a0or 5\\u201310\\u00a0years had a similar species richness of butterflies and day-flying moths\\u00a0and all moths\\u00a0to grassland lightly grazed by cattle\\u00a0or sheep/sheep and cattle.\\n\\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (24 STUDIES)\\n\\nAbundance (24 studies): Six of 20 replicated studies (including one paired, controlled, before-and-after study, three randomized controlled studies, and 15 site comparison studies) in Germany, the USA, the UK, Switzerland, Finland, Sweden, Spain, the Czech Republic\\u00a0and Israel\\u00a0found that grasslands which had been abandoned for 1-25 years had a higher abundance of Scotch argus, butterflies and day-flying moths, nocturnal moths, caterpillars, and of small insects including caterpillars, than grasslands grazed by goats, sheep\\u00a0and/or cattle. Two of these studies only found a difference compared to grazing at commercial/intensive, not low, densities. Four of the studies found that grasslands which had been abandoned for two weeks, 5\\u201320 years\\u00a0or an undetermined time\\u00a0had a lower abundance of butterflies\\u00a0and spring webworm caterpillars\\u00a0than grasslands grazed by cattle\\u00a0or a mix of livestock\\u00a0(in two studies grazing and mowing were not distinguished). A further four of the studies found that grasslands which had been abandoned for 5-15 years had a similar abundance of butterflies, burnet moths, day-flying moths\\u00a0and meadow neb moth caterpillars\\u00a0to grasslands grazed by sheep, horses and cattle\\u00a0or a mix of livestock. A further four of the studies found that in grasslands which had been abandoned for &gt;10 years, many years\\u00a0or an unspecified number of years, and in one case with burning, abundance or density was mixed depending on butterfly\\u00a0and moth\\u00a0species compared to grasslands grazed by cattle\\u00a0or unspecified grazers\\u00a0or grazed with cattle and burned. The other study found that butterfly density was higher in grasslands where grazing ceased 2\\u20139 years ago than those abandoned &gt;10 years ago or those currently grazed. Two replicated studies (including one controlled, before-and-after study and one site comparison study) in Spain\\u00a0and Germany\\u00a0found that grasslands which had been abandoned for 1\\u20136 years\\u00a0or an unspecified time period\\u00a0had a higher abundance of woodland and hedgerow butterflies\\u00a0and burnet moths, but a lower abundance of grassland\\u00a0or farmland\\u00a0species, than grasslands managed by grazing and/or mowing (results not distinguished). Two studies also found that the large blue\\u00a0and silver-studded blue\\u00a0went extinct in some abandoned meadows. One replicated, site comparison study in Sweden\\u00a0found that grasslands which were ungrazed for the year had a lower abundance of clouded Apollo butterflies than lightly grazed grasslands, but a higher abundance than heavily grazed grasslands. One review in Europe\\u00a0reported that ceasing grazing on grassland benefitted six out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (3 STUDIES)\\n\\nUse (3 studies): One replicated, paired, site comparison study in Germany\\u00a0found that grassland which had been abandoned for &gt;5 years had a similar occurrence of hoary bell moth caterpillars to grassland grazed by sheep. One replicated, site comparison study in the UK\\u00a0found that a similar proportion of grasslands which had been abandoned for one year, and grazed grasslands, contained &gt;20 marsh fritillary caterpillar webs. One replicated, site comparison study in Spain\\u00a0found that grizzled skipper and painted lady occurred less frequently, but small pearl-bordered fritillary occurred more frequently, in meadows which had been abandoned for at least 1\\u20132 years than in meadows managed by grazing or mowing (results not distinguished).\"\n}"
