Adjusting lighting intensity can influence lice levels, with lower-intensity artificial light or natural lighting associated with fewer lice, and higher-intensity artificial light associated with more lice [741]. Selective breeding for disease resistance improved survival when fish were exposed to infectious pancreatic necrosis, with families bred for high resistance showing higher survival than low-resistance families [735]. Replacing anti-predator nets more frequently at salmon farms reduced salmon losses to harbour seal predation [2774].
