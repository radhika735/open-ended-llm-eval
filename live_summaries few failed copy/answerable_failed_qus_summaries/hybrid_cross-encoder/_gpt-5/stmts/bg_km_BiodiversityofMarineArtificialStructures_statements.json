Transplanting or seeding biota onto intertidal structures (including oysters and coralline algae) supported species otherwise absent and had mixed effects on combined richness/diversity and invertebrate abundance, while generally not increasing fish richness or abundance; mobile invertebrate richness increased in one Australian study [3472]. Creating short flexible habitats (1–50 mm) on intertidal structures altered combined macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate community composition, decreased combined species richness at low tide, and showed mixed effects on macroalgal and invertebrate abundances; fish richness and abundance at high tide did not increase [3459].

Creating hole habitats (>50 mm) on intertidal structures, often alongside other features, increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate richness/diversity, supported species absent from flat surfaces, and did not consistently increase macroalgal or invertebrate abundance; added holes and pools were used by sea slugs, urchins and octopuses in Australia [3467].

Transplanting or seeding onto subtidal structures included an Australian study where transplanted sea urchins reduced the cover of a non‑native sea mat on kelps; transplanted urchins survived [3471].
