No studies were found on modifying anti-predator nets (2743), or on introducing/enforcing regulations to prevent harmful deterrents or intentional killing at aquaculture systems (2746; 2745). Wild fisheries: One randomized, controlled study found that switching off artificial lights on a bridge did not deter harbour seals feeding on hatchery-released salmon (2825). One randomized, controlled study found that a ‘cork line’ barrier did not deter harbour seals feeding on hatchery-released salmon (2824). Six studies reported that modifying fishing pots and traps, including adding grids, bars, frames or strengthened netting, reduced seal entry/trapping and damage to salmon catches, and increased catches of undamaged salmon in some cases (2822). Eight studies reported mixed behavioural responses to acoustic devices on moorings, including one randomized, controlled study that reduced harbour seal feeding on migrating juvenile salmon and other studies that reduced local seal numbers upstream of the device (2816).
