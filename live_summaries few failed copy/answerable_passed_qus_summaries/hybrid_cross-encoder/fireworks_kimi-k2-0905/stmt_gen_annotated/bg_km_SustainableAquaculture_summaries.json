For sea lice control, two studies in Ireland found mixed effects of using cleaner wrasse - corkwing and goldskinny wrasse were as effective as chemical treatments, while rockcook wrasse were ineffective at preventing lice outbreaks. Altering lighting intensity was found to reduce lice numbers, with lower intensity artificial light or natural lighting resulting in fewer lice. Fallowing systems showed mixed results, with one study in Scotland recording lower lice numbers but another in Australia finding no difference in mortality from Amoebic Gill Disease. For disease prevention and control, vaccinations were found to increase survival rates against various pathogens including Aeromonas salmonicida spp. achromogenes, Yersinia ruckeri, marine flexibacteriosis, bacterial kidney disease, and infectious salmon anaemia in studies from Iceland, Norway, Australia and Canada. Using probiotics and immunostimulants showed benefits including increased survival when salmon were exposed to disease-causing bacteria, with one study finding a 28% reduction in lice infection when fish were fed a diet with 28% plant-based protein, and a further 28% reduction when beta-glucans were added. Freshwater bathing to reduce amoebic gill disease showed mixed results, with one study finding reduced amoebae on gills for up to 10 days, while another found no difference between treated and untreated salmon.",

Six studies found reduced growth rates with plant-based diets, while three studies found similar growth rates compared to fish meal controls. Plant-based diets also showed reduced final body weights in four studies, with mixed effects on feeding efficiency - some studies showed lowered efficiency while others showed increased efficiency. Fish meal reduction studies found no significant differences in final weights.\n\nBacterial protein alternatives showed more favorable results. Two replicated controlled studies in Norway found similar growth rates when bacterial protein replaced up to 25% of fish meal, though 50% replacement resulted in lower growth rates. Another study actually reported higher growth rates with diets containing 18% and 36% bacterial protein compared to fish meal controls, suggesting bacterial protein may be superior to plant-based alternatives in maintaining salmon growth performance.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on studies in Australia, several salmon farming disease management practices have shown mixed or limited success. Studies on freshwater bathing to reduce amoebic gill disease found mixed results - while one study reported a reduction in gill amoebae persisting up to 10 days after bathing, controlled studies found similar levels of amoebae in treated and untreated salmon (Action ID: 739). Fallowing practices also showed mixed results, with one study finding no difference in mortality from Amoebic Gill Disease in cages using fallowing systems, though fallowing did improve sediment community conditions (Action ID: 1026, 1027). Vaccination studies showed positive results internationally, but the evidence base for Australia's salmon farming was not specifically detailed as showing different outcomes from other regions (Action ID: 733).",
