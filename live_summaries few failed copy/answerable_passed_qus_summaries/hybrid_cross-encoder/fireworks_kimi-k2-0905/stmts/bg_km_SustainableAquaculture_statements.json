For sea lice control, two studies in Ireland found mixed effects of using cleaner wrasse - corkwing and goldskinny wrasse were as effective as chemical treatments, while rockcook wrasse were ineffective at preventing lice outbreaks. Altering lighting intensity was found to reduce lice numbers, with lower intensity artificial light or natural lighting resulting in fewer lice. Fallowing systems showed mixed results, with one study in Scotland recording lower lice numbers but another in Australia finding no difference in mortality from Amoebic Gill Disease. For disease prevention and control, vaccinations were found to increase survival rates against various pathogens including Aeromonas salmonicida spp. achromogenes, Yersinia ruckeri, marine flexibacteriosis, bacterial kidney disease, and infectious salmon anaemia in studies from Iceland, Norway, Australia and Canada. Using probiotics and immunostimulants showed benefits including increased survival when salmon were exposed to disease-causing bacteria, with one study finding a 28% reduction in lice infection when fish were fed a diet with 28% plant-based protein, and a further 28% reduction when beta-glucans were added. Freshwater bathing to reduce amoebic gill disease showed mixed results, with one study finding reduced amoebae on gills for up to 10 days, while another found no difference between treated and untreated salmon.",
