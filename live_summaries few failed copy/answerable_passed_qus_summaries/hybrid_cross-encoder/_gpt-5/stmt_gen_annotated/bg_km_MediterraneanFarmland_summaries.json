Thirty-four studies (of which 21 were replicated and controlled and seven also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found some positive effects on earthworms, some invertebrates (other than earthworms), weeds or farmland birds, of reducing tillage compared to conventional management. Positive effects included increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms, greater abundance of some invertebrates other than earthworms, increased numbers of some weeds and/or weed species, higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying date and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields, and greater abundance of some birds - including Eurasian skylark, seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in late winter on non-inversion or conservation tillage. A review found tillage had negative effects on invertebrate numbers and no-till systems had more invertebrate bird food resources.\\nTwenty-six studies (of which 13 replicated and controlled and three also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found reducing tillage had either negative, no effect or no consistent effects on abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates (other than earthworms), earthworm abundance, biomass, or species richness, number of different plant species found as seeds, number of some weed species, mammal abundance, some bird species, and one study found bird preferences for conservation tillage fields decreased over time. Two studies found that crop type affected the number of weeds under different tillage regimes.\\nOne small replicated trial in the UK compared bird numbers under two different forms of reduced tillage, and found more birds from species that make up the \\u2018Farmland Bird Index\\u2019 on broadcast than non-inversion tillage fields.\\nTwo studies looked at the long-term effects of reduced tillage on earthworms (after ten years). One study found higher earthworm biomass under reduced tillage, the other study found earthworm abundance was the same between conventional and reduced tillage plots.\\nThree of the studies mentioned above did not distinguish between the effects of reducing tillage and reduced pesticide and/or fertilizer inputs.\"\n}"

Thirty-four studies (of which 21 were replicated and controlled and seven also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found some positive effects on earthworms, some invertebrates (other than earthworms), weeds or farmland birds, of reducing tillage compared to conventional management. Positive effects included increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms, greater abundance of some invertebrates other than earthworms, increased numbers of some weeds and/or weed species, higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying date and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields, and greater abundance of some birds - including Eurasian skylark, seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in late winter on non-inversion or conservation tillage. A review found tillage had negative effects on invertebrate numbers and no-till systems had more invertebrate bird food resources.\\nTwenty-six studies (of which 13 replicated and controlled and three also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found reducing tillage had either negative, no effect or no consistent effects on abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates (other than earthworms), earthworm abundance, biomass, or species richness, number of different plant species found as seeds, number of some weed species, mammal abundance, some bird species, and one study found bird preferences for conservation tillage fields decreased over time.

Growing cover crops in arable fields increased microbial biomass in several replicated, randomized, controlled studies (mostly USA), with one Italian before-and-after study reporting inconsistent effects; studies also found more bacteria and fungi in Spain and more mycorrhizal spores/species in Italy under cover crops [1345]. A replicated, randomized, controlled trial in Italy reported that applying a high rate of compost increased microbial biomass [889]. A replicated, randomized, controlled study in Italy found plots with grass buffer strips had higher microbial biomass [2308]. Two replicated, controlled studies in Spain found similar microbial biomass with or without added sewage sludge [2303]. Additional non-Mediterranean evidence related to microbial biomass includes: higher microbial biomass and activity with mixed organic–inorganic amendments in trials from China and India, and greater microbial biomass under a ryegrass cover crop versus a ryegrass/vetch mix in the USA; traffic control studies reported conflicting microbial biomass outcomes in Poland and Denmark [902, 898, 899].",

For soil nutrients, some experiments reported higher soil nitrogen, ammonium, phosphorus and potassium under organic fertilization, though several studies found similar levels, and one study observed lower nitrate with organic inputs; soil pH responses were mixed (higher, lower, or similar depending on study) [1366]. Soil biological responses included higher microbial biomass in some comparisons, but some studies found fewer bacteria, nematodes or mites under organic fertilization [1366]. Soil structure sometimes improved, with greater aggregation in some trials, though others found no difference [1366]. Greenhouse gas outcomes were mixed: some studies recorded higher CO2 emissions with organic fertilizers, similar or greater soil CH4 uptake in some cases, and similar or lower N2O emissions in others; effects varied with organic input type (e.g., solid organic fertilizers associated with lower N2O than inorganic, liquid/slurry sometimes increasing CH4 emissions compared with manure) [1366]. For crop production, replicated trials in Mediterranean countries found yields that were sometimes higher with organic fertilizers, sometimes lower, and sometimes similar to inorganic fertilizers; in one Spanish study, alfalfa yield was higher with organic fertilizer in one of two comparisons [1350]. Regarding pests, one replicated, randomized, controlled study found more aphids with organic fertilizer in some comparisons, while another in the same system found similar aphid numbers [1393].",

Compared with reduced tillage, no-tillage produced mixed results by crop group: cereals were sometimes higher or similar and sometimes lower; fruits/vegetables were often lower (with some higher); legumes were often higher or similar; sunflower was lower in some comparisons (15 studies from Spain, Italy, Lebanon, Australia) [1358]. Soil health: Compared with reduced tillage, soils under no-tillage in Spain and Italy sometimes had more organic matter (and sometimes similar), nitrogen was sometimes higher, sometimes lower, or similar; phosphorus was higher or similar; potassium was similar; microbial biomass was mostly similar (sometimes higher or lower in parts), denitrifying bacteria were fewer in one study; soil aggregation and water stability were sometimes higher, sometimes lower, or similar; greenhouse gases were sometimes lower or similar (multiple replicated studies, largely Spain and Italy) [1370]. Water availability: In Spain and the USA, soils without tillage often had more water than with tillage in some or all comparisons; Lebanon reported less water in some comparisons; some studies were mixed; barley water-use efficiency was higher without tillage in Spain in some comparisons; one Spanish study found lower porosity without tillage (14–15 studies) [1384]. Pests and crop damage: Versus conventional tillage, no-tillage had more weeds in some comparisons, inconsistent differences in others, and similar weed numbers in one study; weed species were sometimes more or similar; one study found fewer broomrapes; one Syrian study reported higher Ascochyta blight under no-tillage (9 studies plus 1 on disease) [1397].

Six studies (including three replicated controlled trials of which two randomized) found that excluding or delaying summer grazing increased plant species diversity, invertebrate abundance and benefited breeding Eurasian skylark. A review found a study that showed that removing autumn grazing after a silage cut increased the winter abundance of seed-eating birds. A review and a replicated controlled study from the UK\\u00a0found that reduced grazing intensity or seasonal removal of livestock increased the number of invertebrates, plant seed heads and foraging skylark, and that some bird species preferred plots with seasonal removal of livestock.\\nThree studies (including one randomized, replicated, controlled trial) from the Netherlands and the UK found no benefit to plants or invertebrates from reduced grazing intensity. One randomized, replicated controlled trial excluded grazing in autumn/winter and another study excluded grazing in the summer. A further study found that reducing grazing intensity throughout the year did not increase plant diversity.\\nNine studies from France, Germany and the UK reported mixed results for some or all species or wildlife groups considered (including one randomized, replicated, controlled trial and two reviews and a systematic review). Of these, eight studies found that reduced grazing intensity throughout the year benefited some species but not others, one found that the impact depended on the type of vegetation grazed, and one found benefits to bee and wasp abundance but not species richness. One study found that the response of birds to removal of summer grazing varied between functional groups and depended on time of year. A UK review found that reduced grazing benefited invertebrates, plants, rodents and some but not all birds. \\nA systematic review of the effects of grazing intensity on meadow pasture concluded that intermediate levels of grazing are usually optimal for plants, invertebrates and birds but that trade-offs are likely to exist between the requirements of different taxa.\"\n}"

These findings indicate that, in Mediterranean arable fields, both reduced tillage and no-tillage can increase weed abundance relative to conventional tillage in some contexts, with species richness typically similar but occasionally higher under no-tillage, and a potential benefit of fewer parasitic weeds under no-tillage [1399, 1397].",

Thirty-four studies (of which 21 were replicated and controlled and seven also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found some positive effects on earthworms, some invertebrates (other than earthworms), weeds or farmland birds, of reducing tillage compared to conventional management. Positive effects included increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms, greater abundance of some invertebrates other than earthworms, increased numbers of some weeds and/or weed species, higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying date and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields, and greater abundance of some birds - including Eurasian skylark, seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in late winter on non-inversion or conservation tillage. A review found tillage had negative effects on invertebrate numbers and no-till systems had more invertebrate bird food resources.\\nTwenty-six studies (of which 13 replicated and controlled and three also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found reducing tillage had either negative, no effect or no consistent effects on abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates (other than earthworms), earthworm abundance, biomass, or species richness, number of different plant species found as seeds, number of some weed species, mammal abundance, some bird species, and one study found bird preferences for conservation tillage fields decreased over time. Two studies found that crop type affected the number of weeds under different tillage regimes.\\nOne small replicated trial in the UK compared bird numbers under two different forms of reduced tillage, and found more birds from species that make up the \\u2018Farmland Bird Index\\u2019 on broadcast than non-inversion tillage fields.\\nTwo studies looked at the long-term effects of reduced tillage on earthworms (after ten years).

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done.

Using grazers to manage vegetation: some studies found more invertebrates in grazed plots than ungrazed in some comparisons; simulated grazing reduced invertebrate numbers but not species counts; an endemic threatened butterfly did not recolonize after grazing was reintroduced; and invertebrate community composition differed between grazed and ungrazed plots. For mammals, abundances of some rodents were higher or increased more on grazed plots, while some species were less abundant or had lower monthly survival on grazed plots (1419). Under seasonal grazing, wet grasslands had more aquatic invertebrate species in continuously grazed plots than seasonally grazed plots in some comparisons (1421). Excluding grazers: in US wetlands and grasslands, some studies found more species or families of invertebrates in livestock exclosures, while others found fewer aquatic invertebrate species or no difference in abundance; a threatened endemic butterfly declined in both exclosed and grazed sites. In a wooded grassland, ground squirrel abundance did not differ between ungrazed and cattle-grazed plots (1417). Reducing grazing intensity: in wet grasslands, streams in areas grazed at lower intensity had more families of insects than those at higher intensity (1418).",

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done.

Thirty-four studies (of which 21 were replicated and controlled and seven also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found some positive effects on earthworms, some invertebrates (other than earthworms), weeds or farmland birds, of reducing tillage compared to conventional management. Positive effects included increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms, greater abundance of some invertebrates other than earthworms, increased numbers of some weeds and/or weed species, higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying date and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields, and greater abundance of some birds - including Eurasian skylark, seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in late winter on non-inversion or conservation tillage. A review found tillage had negative effects on invertebrate numbers and no-till systems had more invertebrate bird food resources.\\nTwenty-six studies (of which 13 replicated and controlled and three also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found reducing tillage had either negative, no effect or no consistent effects on abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates (other than earthworms), earthworm abundance, biomass, or species richness, number of different plant species found as seeds, number of some weed species, mammal abundance, some bird species, and one study found bird preferences for conservation tillage fields decreased over time.

Planting hedgerows: Replicated, paired site comparisons from the USA found higher crop visitation rates by native bees, but not by honey bees or syrphid flies, next to planted hedgerows compared to unplanted edges; another study found no difference in bee visitation next to planted edges [1407, 2515]. Multiple replicated studies from the USA found more bee species (and in some cases more syrphid fly species or individuals) in fields with hedgerows or within hedgerows than in fields or edges without hedgerows; one study found fewer ground-nesting bees in planted hedgerows than in unplanted edges [1407, 2515]. Implementation findings for hedgerows indicated more bee (and sometimes syrphid fly) species in older than younger hedgerows, and in old hedgerows more bee species on native than non-native plants [1407, 2515].",
