Creating small adjoining cavities (‘swimthroughs’ ≤100 mm) had mixed effects on juvenile fish community composition, richness and abundance depending on site, month and development stage, but supported six species absent from structures without swimthroughs and were used by adult and juvenile fishes [3436]. Creating hole habitats (>50 mm), often combined with grooves, pits and environmentally-sensitive material, altered mobile invertebrate and fish community composition and supported fish species absent from plain surfaces; fish abundances showed mixed or no increases depending on study [3434]. Creating groove habitats (1–50 mm), often with other features, altered community composition and supported fish species absent from plain surfaces; fish abundances showed mixed effects [3448]. Creating pit habitats (1–50 mm), with other features, altered community composition and supported fish species absent from plain surfaces; fish abundances showed mixed effects [3455]. Creating long flexible habitats (>50 mm) had mixed effects on fish species richness and fish/seahorse abundance and were used by seahorses [3451]. Creating short flexible habitats (1–50 mm) had mixed effects on seahorse abundance [3450]. Using environmentally-sensitive material (e.g., ECOncrete or rock), often alongside added habitat features, supported fish species absent from standard surfaces and had mixed effects on fish abundance depending on species [3470]. Transplanting or seeding organisms (e.g., oysters) onto structures increased combined invertebrate and fish species richness and diversity and altered community composition; overall combined abundance did not increase, with effects varying among species [3471]. Managing or restricting harvesting around structures was associated with higher fish species richness, different fish community composition including species absent from unrestricted sites, and higher seabream abundance; total fish abundance responses varied and access restrictions did not fully prevent harvesting [3457]. Creating artificial reefs of different 3‑D structure/material often showed no differences in combined mobile invertebrate and fish richness or abundance between designs/materials [2259]. For several actions on subtidal structures—creating large/small ridges or ledges, crevice habitats, large protrusions, and reducing slope—no studies were found evaluating effects on biodiversity [3445; 3444; 3454; 3443; 3442].",

Other interventions showed mixed effects on algal abundance depending on context: fine texturing (≤1 mm) on subtidal structures (3449), creating short flexible habitats on intertidal structures (3459), using environmentally-sensitive materials on intertidal structures (3469), and combining grooves with small protrusions/ridges/ledges on intertidal structures (3474).",

(2) Creating grooves (sometimes with pits) increased combined macroalgae–invertebrate species richness and, in some cases, overall abundance; fish richness, abundance, and feeding bites increased when grooves were paired with pits; other studies found no increase in richness or abundance, and responses varied by site and configuration (3473). (3) Creating small protrusions increased combined macroalgae–invertebrate species richness, but did not alter community composition in one study; effects on overall abundance were mixed and sometimes non-significant (3462). (4) Creating small ridges/ledges showed mixed outcomes: one Singapore study found no change in community composition or richness with ridges alone, while another study that combined ridges with grooves, protrusions, and pits reported increased richness but site- and configuration-dependent composition and abundance; studies elsewhere reported grooves between ledges often outperform ledges themselves (3464). (5) Combining grooves with small ridges/ledges (and sometimes holes or pits) altered community composition in some Singapore studies, supported species absent from plain concrete, increased species richness in several cases, and yielded mixed effects on overall and group-specific abundances depending on groove/ridge size, shore level, covers, and site; some studies detected no increase in overall abundance (3474). (6) Using environmentally-sensitive materials (e.g., ECOncrete with added grooves/ledges/holes; reduced-pH or alternative concretes) in Singapore and the UK altered community composition and supported species absent from standard concrete and increased richness/diversity in one ECOncrete study, but other material trials showed no increase in richness and mixed or non-significant effects on algal and invertebrate abundances (3469). (7) Transplanting or seeding organisms on structures in Singapore found macroalgae had higher survival at mid- and high-shore than low-shore, coral and sponge growth varied by species, and broader studies reported mixed effects of transplanted oysters/algae on fish and invertebrate richness and abundance depending on grooves/ledges and site (3472).",
