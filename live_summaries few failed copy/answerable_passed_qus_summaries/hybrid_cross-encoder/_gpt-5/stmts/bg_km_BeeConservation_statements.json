Uncropped margins sown with native wildflower seed mixes (with mowing) increased bumblebee abundance—and in several trials species richness—over cropped, grassy, or naturally regenerated margins; inclusion of perennial leguminous herbs was an important forage resource, particularly for long‑tongued species, and some long‑tongued bumblebees preferred perennial wildflower mixes over annual forage mixes [19]. Leaving margins to naturally regenerate sometimes supported more bumblebees than cropped margins, but outcomes were inconsistent between years and often depended on thistles, which may require control; in some trials naturally regenerated margins did not exceed cropped margins for bumblebee abundance or diversity [20]. Sown grassy field margins showed mixed results, with some trials finding higher bumblebee abundance (and sometimes diversity) and others finding no improvement over cropped margins [14]. At a broader scale, farms implementing agri‑environment scheme options (including field margin measures) sometimes showed enhanced foraging wild bee abundance or diversity compared to conventional management, but other trials found no enhancement, and population‑level benefits for bumblebees were not consistently detected [24]. Evidence from wider wildlife studies also indicates that leaving cultivated, uncropped margins or plots can benefit bumblebees among other taxa [562].",

In longer-term artificial rearing, B. terrestris queens decreased in weight over four years [50]. Husbandry factors influenced success: fresher, higher‑protein pollen improved reproductive output and queen quality; an 8L:16D light regime reduced time to first egg laying; hibernation at 4–5°C for ~45 days enhanced egg‑laying and colony formation but yielded smaller colonies than non‑hibernated queens; survival after hibernation was better for queens >0.6 g and with ≤4 months hibernation [50]. Field reintroductions of lab‑reared colonies showed variable queen production: some trials produced few or no new queens, while others produced good numbers [52]. Social parasitism by cuckoo bumblebees was sometimes high (25–66% and 79%), and was reduced when colonies were placed in intermediate‑resource landscapes and later in the season; other trials reported no parasitism [52]. Supplementary feeding in the field improved reproductive success in one trial but not productivity in another and did not reduce parasite load; released B. terrestris colonies foraged mostly >100 m from nests [52].

There is no evidence for effects of providing bumblebee nest boxes on bumblebee populations (48).\n- Solitary bee nest boxes can experience high rates of parasitism and mortality: examples include 56% overall brood mortality for Xylocopa fenestrata in India (36% parasitism, 20% other mortality), 13% mortality (with 2% parasitized) in Germany, and 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao in Indonesia (47). Certain materials perform poorly: plastic-lined holes and plastic or paper tubes were less productive due to parasitism or mould (47).\n- Non-target and introduced species, including European earwigs and introduced European leafcutter bees, frequently occupy solitary bee boxes; in one trial, introduced species used boxes more commonly than native bees (47). Earwig presence in boxes reduced use by native bees, necessitating exclusion measures (44).\n- Some nest box deployments fail to attract target bees: one trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using solitary bee boxes, soil-filled boxes for Andrena flavipes were not occupied, and a trial with stingless bee boxes in Brazil found no uptake (47; 49). Reported solitary bee occupancy can also be low, with 1–26% of available cavities used in some studies (80).\n- Placement and design constraints limit effectiveness: solitary bee boxes need to be within approximately 150–600 m of forage resources, and material choice (e.g., reed stems or certain wooden designs) affects productivity (80; 47).\n- Introducing nest boxes stocked with solitary bees has no evidence of effects on farmland wildlife, representing an evidence gap (81).",

Supplementary feeding had mixed effects: it improved reproductive success in one Canadian trial but did not reduce parasite load, and a USA trial found no increase in colony productivity with feeding [52].
