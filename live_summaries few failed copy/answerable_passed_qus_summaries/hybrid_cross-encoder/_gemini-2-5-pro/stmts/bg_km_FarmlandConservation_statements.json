While seed-eating birds were found to prefer rye grass cut only once, insect-eating birds showed more variable results, with some preferring plots cut two or more times (132). In the first two years of one study, there was no difference in ground beetle abundance and diversity between cut and uncut silage field headlands, but the uncut plots had a higher species diversity in the third year (132). There were no studies found that looked at the effects on mammals of leaving uncut areas of ryegrass in silage fields (2400).\n\nRaising the mowing height on grasslands in the UK has been found to provide benefits to Eurasian skylarks, including increased productivity (138). One review also found that raised cutting heights were less damaging to amphibians and invertebrates (138). However, another study in the UK found that raising the mowing height on grasslands had no effect on the numbers of foraging birds or invertebrates, and a separate study found no difference in invertebrate abundance (138). Foraging success of northern lapwing and common starling chicks was found to be greater in shorter grass (138). For butterflies and moths, one UK study on intensively managed grassland found that plots cut to 10 cm had a similar species richness and abundance of butterflies and caterpillars to plots cut to 5 cm (3968). A UK review noted that while raising the mowing height may have increased the productivity of Eurasian skylarks, it was not enough to maintain the local population (222).",

Additionally, a greater abundance of some birds, including Eurasian skylark, seed-eating songbirds, and gamebirds, was observed in late winter on non-inversion or conservation tillage (126). A review also found that tillage had negative effects on invertebrate numbers and no-till systems had more invertebrate bird food resources (126).\n\nHowever, twenty-six studies from nine European countries found that reducing tillage had either negative, no effect, or no consistent effects on the abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates, earthworms, and some bird species (126). There were also no consistent effects on the number of different plant species found as seeds, the number of some weed species, and mammal abundance (126).

      "relevant_summary": "Leaving uncropped, cultivated margins or plots in arable fields has several documented benefits for wildlife. These areas can provide benefits to farmland birds, plants, invertebrates, and mammals, including increased species richness of plants, bumblebees, and spiders, and an increased abundance of ground-dwelling invertebrates and ground beetles (562). Specifically for birds, benefits include increased stone curlew breeding population size, northern lapwing hatching success, and Eurasian skylark nesting success (562). Uncropped margins, whether naturally regenerated or sown with wildflowers, have been shown to support a higher abundance and, in some cases, higher species richness of foraging bumblebees compared to cropped edges (19, 20, 562). Sown wildflower margins with perennial leguminous herbs are particularly beneficial for long-tongued bumblebees (19).\n\nHowever, there are also limitations. The value of naturally regenerated margins for bees can be inconsistent from year to year and may rely on the presence of thistle species, which are often considered pernicious weeds (20). Some studies found no effect on 11 out of 12 farmland bird species or ground beetles, and one study found fewer seed-eating birds on fallow plots in two out of three regions (562). Pernicious weeds can also be more common on uncropped cultivated margins (562). Additionally, a UK study found a lower proportion of young grey partridges in populations in areas with a high proportion of uncropped cultivated margins and plots (562). There is no captured evidence on the effects of these management practices on solitary bees (19, 20).",
