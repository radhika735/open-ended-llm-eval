Specifically, studies have found that hedgerows can lead to reduced soil erosion and higher levels of soil organic matter [744]. The diversity of soil animals has also been observed to be higher near hedgerows [744]. Furthermore, incorporating woody species into these hedgerows can enhance various factors that contribute to soil fertility [744].\n\nAnother alternative is the use of compost. One study conducted in Italy indicated that plots fertilized with compost had more organic matter, nutrients, and microbial biomass when compared to plots where manure was used [1366].\n\nThe practice of excluding grazers has shown varied results on soil fertility. For instance, a study in Spain revealed that ungrazed sites had less soil carbon compared to sites grazed by cows and sheep [1375]. Similarly, other studies have reported less nitrogen in the soil of ungrazed areas [1375]. On the other hand, one study found that excluding goats and sheep led to a higher number of nematodes and more diverse nematode communities [1375].
