One of these studies also found that the number of unwanted species, including fish and invertebrates, was lower in modified traps [2702]. However, three other studies found that trap modifications had no effect on the unwanted catches of white croaker, non-commercial fish, or undersized Atlantic cod, and in one case, non-target haddock catches were increased [2702]. \n\nIn terms of size-selectivity, three of four studies found that traps modified with a square mesh escape window or larger mesh sizes improved the size-selectivity of Atlantic cod, black sea bass, and most fish species. Another study found that increasing the mesh size of a trap escape panel had no effect on the size-selectivity of panga [2702]. \n\nOne study on survival rates found that the survival of small herring that escaped from a pontoon fish trap through a size-sorting grid was similar to that of trap-caught herring that did not pass through a grid [2702].\n\nAdditionally, modifications to fishing nets to prevent seal access, such as installing wire grids or steel bars, have been found to reduce damage to salmon catches by seals and result in higher catches of undamaged salmon [2822].",

    "relevant_summary": "Evidence from European waters on the effectiveness of using a square mesh codend instead of a diamond mesh codend for reducing unwanted catch shows varied results. A review of 26 studies, many of which were conducted in European waters, found that 10 of 16 studies reported that square mesh codends reduced unwanted or non-marketable catches of various fish species when compared to diamond mesh codends (2714). However, four of these studies found no reduction in unwanted catches for certain species, and another study found that unwanted catch was dependent on mesh size as well as shape (2714). In terms of size selectivity, 6 of 14 studies found that square mesh codends improved size selectivity for several fish species, while 5 studies found no difference (2714). The effect of the mesh shape on size selectivity could also vary depending on the fish's body shape (2714). Additionally, there is evidence that the short-term survival of some fish species is higher after escaping through a square mesh codend (2714). One study in the English Channel discovered that a trawl net with a square mesh codend and square mesh escape panels was effective in reducing the amount of discarded finfish in comparison to a diamond mesh codend without panels (2724). Another study in the English Channel found that a trawl with a square mesh codend caught fewer non-commercial unwanted invertebrates in one of two areas studied when compared to a diamond mesh codend (2136).",

Two studies in the Gulf of Maine and Bismark Sea noted a higher abundance of only one of seven fish species and lower abundance of monkfish in areas closed for six to eight years [2655]. A study in the Bismark Sea observed that six of seven fish species in a closed area had a lower flight response distance, making them more vulnerable to capture [2655]. Additionally, a combination of long-term closures and gear restrictions reduced unwanted cod catch [2655].\n\nFive studies investigated temporary fishery closures. One study in the Atlantic Ocean found no increase in spawning cod biomass, no change in survival, and no change in length composition compared to fished areas over nine years [2664]. However, tagged adult cod were found to spend nearly a third of their time inside a seasonally closed spawning area, affording them increased protection [2664]. One study in the North Sea reported that temporary closures had little effect on fishing effort for cod, but real-time closures reduced the annual amount of cod caught [2664]. In terms of commercial catch, one study in the Philippine Sea and Mediterranean Sea found that during a temporary closure of a grouper fishery, spear fishers' catch of other fish groups increased [2664]. Another study found that catch rates of red mullet and total catch increased after temporary closures, but not for European hake [2664].

Another study found that a temporary closure for grouper led to increased fishing pressure on other species (2938). Similarly, establishing temporary fishery closures (2664) showed no change in cod stock biomass, survival, or length composition in one study, though tagged cod did use the seasonally closed spawning area (2664). Real-time closures were found to be more effective at reducing cod catch than fixed temporary closures (2664).\n\nRestricting fishing in a marine protected area (2680) was found in a global review to result in higher fish abundance in 10 of 11 studies and larger fish in 5 of 11 studies (2680). For example, a study on blackspot snapper found higher survival and larger sizes within a marine park (2680). Prohibiting all fishing in a marine protected area (2681) led to increased cod survival in one study, and sharks were observed to use the protected areas, reducing their mortality risk (2681). However, another study found lower fish species richness in a protected area, and two other studies found similar fish abundance for some species when comparing protected and unprotected areas (2681). Designating a Marine Protected Area with some fishing restrictions (2239) was found to increase the number of lobsters and scallops in a global review (2239). Other studies noted increased numbers of sea cucumbers, hydrozoans, and sponges in a protected area (2239).\n\nNo studies were found that evaluated the effects of releasing fish that are carrying eggs or live young (2733).",

Six studies\\u00a0found similar fish species/richness between one and 20 years after all fishing was banned in protected areas, compared to fished areas. One systematic review in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans\\u00a0found no difference in species richness between unfished protected areas and fished areas. One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that the effects of prohibiting all fishing on fish species richness/diversity after 15 years varied with the sampling method used.\\n\\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (66 STUDIES)\\n\\nAbundance (64 studies): Thirty of 54 site comparison studies (18 replicated, eight replicated and paired, two before-and-after, one paired and before-and-after, and one replicated and before-and-after) in the Indian Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, Pacific Ocean, Tasman Sea, Coral Sea, Philippine Sea, Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and the Sulu Sea, found that marine protected areas that had been prohibiting all fishing for up to 25 years or more, had higher abundances (density and/or biomass) of all fish (total fish biomass, total fish density), fishery targeted fish species, non-fishery targeted fish species\\u00a0and all or most of the individual fish species/groups monitored, except fish densities (all or most)\\u00a0and non-fishery targeted species, compared to unprotected fished areas and/or partly-fished protected areas. The studies also found that in some cases where the total fish biomass or densities were higher in no-fished areas, the effect varied between individual groups of fish based on species family\\u00a0and/or position in the food chain, commercial target and non-target species, fish sizes, depth\\u00a0and habitat types. Eight studies found that inside protected areas prohibiting all fishing there were similar abundances of all fish, and all or most of the individual fish species/groups monitored, compared to fished areas between one and 20 years after implementation. The other sixteen studies\\u00a0found that the effect of prohibiting fishing in protected areas for three to 20 years on fish abundance varied between fish species or groups and on their fished status (fishery target or non-target)\\u00a0and/or position in the food chain. One also found that the effect varied with size or age of the protected areas. Five of six reviews (three systematic) across the world, in the Pacific and/or Atlantic Oceans\\u00a0and in unreported regions\\u00a0found that non-fished marine reserves with one to 27 years of protection had higher abundances of all fish, all fish and invertebrates combined\\u00a0and blue cod\\u00a0compared to fished areas, but there were differences between species/groups and fishing intensity outside reserves. The other review\\u00a0found that fish abundance varied between species in no-take marine reserves between one and 25 years old, and was affected by food chain position, level of exploitation and duration of protection. One replicated study in the Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found a long-term decline in the abundance/presence of eight of 12 shark and ray species inside an established (&gt;15 years) no-fishing protected area, however enforcement was poor. One before-and after, site comparison study in the Pacific Ocean, found no differences in overall fish abundance between a marine reserve closed permanently to fishing for five years and a closed area that was harvested for two years during the same period. One site comparison study in the Coral Sea\\u00a0found that in a no-take zone of an area protected for at least 10 years, fish abundance of four of six fish groups were similar to no-entry and fished zones, but two had lower abundance than the no-entry zone. One replicated, paired, site comparison study in the Tasman Sea\\u00a0found that in a non-fished marine park zone abundance of commercially targeted fish was higher than partly fished zones but lower than unprotected areas after four to eight years.\\nReproductive success (1 study): One site comparison study in the Mediterranean Sea\\u00a0found more eggs of four commercially targeted fish species inside a non-fished marine reserve enforced for three years than in fished areas outside the reserve.\\nSurvival (1 study): One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that prohibiting all fishing in a marine protected area for three years resulted in similar survival of red hind grouper, compared to fished areas.\\nCondition (20 studies): Two global review studies\\u00a0(one systematic) and two systematic reviews in the Pacific Ocean\\u00a0and the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans\\u00a0found that prohibiting all fishing in marine protected areas for one to 27 years resulted in larger fish overall\\u00a0and larger blue cod\\u00a0compared to fished areas, but there were differences between individual fish families or species. Eight of 11 site comparison studies (four replicated, one before-and-after, one paired, and one replicated and paired) in the Tasman Sea, Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, Atlantic Ocean, Java Sea\\u00a0and the Philippine Sea, found that non-fished protected areas had larger fish overall\\u00a0and larger individuals of all or most of the fish species/groups monitored, compared to fished areas, after one to 22 years. The other three studies\\u00a0found similar fish sizes of all or all but one species, compared to fished areas one to 16 years after all fishing was prohibited. Three site comparison studies (one replicated) in the Coral Sea, Caribbean Sea\\u00a0and the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that fish size in protected areas that had not been fished for six to more than 20 years, varied between fish species or food chain groups. One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that red hind grouper were larger, but had similar growth, in an area protected from fishing for three years compared to fished areas. One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that young lemon sharks in areas protected from fishing for 20 years had similar growth rates, but lower condition, than sharks in unprotected fished areas.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)\\u00a0\\n\\nBehaviour change (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in the Pacific and Indian Oceans\\u00a0found that surgeonfish and parrotfish inside established protected areas where fishing was prohibited, showed a similar avoidance response to fishing gears as in fished areas, and this increased with increasing fishing intensity outside the protected areas. One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that in non-fished areas protected for one and 24 years, fish grazing rates were higher compared to fished areas.\\n\\n\\u00a0OTHER (15 STUDIES)\\n\\nUse (7 studies): Four of six site comparison studies in the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0and the Tasman Sea\\u00a0found that marine protected areas where all fishing had been prohibited for at least five to 15 years, were used for a large proportion of time by shark and ray species\\u00a0and commercially important reef fish species, compared to fished areas, thus were provided protection from fishing. Two other studies\\u00a0found that time spent inside areas closed to all fishing for 20 years\\u00a0and over 30 years, varied between species and with size for three shark species\\u00a0and with size for giant trevally. One replicated study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that most individuals of five fish species remained inside a marine reserve zone closed to fishing over a nine-year period.\\n\\n\\nCatch abundance (2 studies): One of two site comparison studies in the Mediterranean Sea\\u00a0and Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found that commercial fish catch rates in small-scale traditional fisheries were highest closest to a marine reserve closed to all fishing for 22 years, and decreased with increasing distance from the reserve. The other study\\u00a0found that there was no increase in fish catch rates in commercially landed catch in the five years after a no-fishing zone was implemented in a co-managed protected area.\\nStock biomass (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that the stock biomass (the harvested portion of the population) of reef fish species was highest in enforced protected areas closed to all fishing, compared to various other area management regimes.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\nFishing mortality (2 studies): Two site comparison studies in the North Sea\\u00a0and Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found that prohibiting fishing in protected areas resulted in reduced commercial fishing mortality of corkwing wrasse tagged inside non-fished marine reserves compared to fished areas, and that the overall fishing mortality of grey reef sharks tagged inside protected areas was low.\"\n}"
