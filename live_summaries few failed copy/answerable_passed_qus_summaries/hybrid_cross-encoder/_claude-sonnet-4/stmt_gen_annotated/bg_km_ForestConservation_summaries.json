    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, prescribed fire as a forest management tool in North America shows mixed effects across different forest components. For tree populations, studies found that prescribed fire had variable effects on young trees - five of 15 studies found it increased density and biomass of young trees while two found it decreased new tree density, with eight showing no effect or mixed effects depending on tree species, location and fire frequency (Action 1220). For mature trees, four of eight studies found prescribed fire decreased tree cover, density and diversity, while one found it increased tree cover and three found no effect or mixed effects (Action 1217). Seven studies found that prescribed fire increased tree mortality (Action 1217). \n\nRegarding understory vegetation, eight of 22 studies found prescribed fire increased cover, density and biomass of understory plants, while six found it decreased plant cover, and eight found no effect or mixed effects (Action 1221). For plant diversity, 14 of 24 studies found prescribed fire increased species richness and diversity of understory plants, while one study found it decreased species richness and nine found no effect or mixed effects (Action 1221).\n\nFor wildlife impacts, eight of 14 studies found no effect of prescribed forest fires on amphibian abundance or numbers of species, while four found mixed effects depending on species, season or year of burn, three found fires increased amphibian abundance, and one found abundance decreased (Action 877). For butterflies and moths, three of four studies found that coniferous forest burned within the last 20 years had higher species richness than unburned forest, while one study found similar species richness between burned and unburned sites (Action 3877). Two studies found pine forest restored by burning had higher butterfly abundance than unburned forest (Action 3877).\n\nAfter tree planting, two of four studies found prescribed fire increased survival and sprouting rate of planted trees, while one found fire decreased planted tree size and one found no effect (Action 1255). Bird studies in deciduous forests showed one study found similar bird species richness in burned and unburned aspen forests, though with changes in relative abundances of some species (Action 317).",

Six of seven studies (including five replicated, controlled studies) in Australia, Iran, Nepal and the USA found that shelterwood harvesting increased abundance, species richness and diversity of understory plants, as well as the growth and survival rate of young trees, with only one study finding decreased plant species richness and abundance (Action 1223). For tree regeneration specifically, three of six studies found that clearcutting increased the density and species richness of young trees, while one found it decreased new tree density and two found no effect or mixed effects depending on the tree species (Action 1222). In contrast, shelterwood harvesting generally showed positive effects on tree regeneration alongside its benefits for plant diversity.

Managing vegetation by hand through selective weeding has been evaluated, with studies showing mixed effects on species abundance (Action 3714). Managing vegetation by cutting or mowing has been tested, with studies finding that areas where vegetation was managed by cutting had similar reptile species richness and abundance compared to areas with no cutting (Action 3713). Physical removal of mid-storey vegetation in forest resulted in increased mammal species richness and abundance (Action 2480). Surface mulch applications showed that mulched and unmulched plots had similar plant species richness over two years, though mulched plots were more likely to contain certain species after 20 months (Action 3248). In contrast, controlling vegetation using herbicides after restoration planting decreased plant species richness and diversity (Action 1241).",

For herbicide control, one replicated, randomized, controlled study in the USA found no effect of invasive plant control using herbicide on the total native plant species richness (Actions 1229, 1314). For mechanical/manual removal, studies show varied outcomes: one replicated, controlled study in Hawaii found that removal of invasive grass species increased understory plant biomass, while another replicated, controlled study in the USA found no effect of invasive shrub removal on understory plant diversity (Action 1228). Additionally, one replicated, controlled study in Ghana found that removal of invasive weed species increased tree seedling height, but one replicated, controlled study in Hawaii found no effect of invasive plant removal on growth rate of native species (Action 1228). For prescribed fire methods, there is no evidence found for the effects of using prescribed fire to remove invasive plant species on forests (Action 1196). Similarly, no evidence was found for the effects of using grazing to remove invasive plant species on forests (Action 1195). For biological control using herbivores, no evidence was found for its effectiveness (Action 1277). One controlled study from Australia found that prescribed burning for lantana control resulted in smaller and less abundant lantana plants compared to unburned areas, and one replicated site comparison from Australia found lantana in a forest burned every three years produced fewer fruits and seeds with higher seedling mortality and slower growth rates compared to other management methods (Action 912). The evidence base remains limited with many methods lacking systematic study in forest contexts.",

For forest-specific interventions, we found no evidence for the effect of raising awareness amongst the general public through campaigns and public information on forests (Action 1157), and no evidence for the effect of providing education programmes about forests on forests (Action 1158). \n\nHowever, evidence from other conservation contexts provides some insights. A review of programmes in the USA and Canada argues that education was not sufficient to change behaviour, although it was necessary as a catalytic factor for economic incentives and law enforcement (Action 162). \n\nFor species conservation more broadly, five out of six studies found increases in bird populations or decreases in mortality following education programmes, though in all but one case, education was one of several interventions employed. A replicated before-and-after study from Canada also found a significant shift in local peoples' attitudes to conservation and exploited species following educational programmes (Action 274).\n\nFor forest management specifically, one before-and-after study in the Republic of Congo found that 70% of central chimpanzees reintroduced to an area where local people were provided non-monetary benefits (including better education), alongside other interventions, survived over seven years. One before-and-after study in India found that numbers of hoolock gibbons increased by 66% over five years after providing local communities with alternative income, alongside other interventions (Action 1510).",

One paired-site study in Canada found that logging after wildfire decreased species richness and diversity of mosses.\n\n**Removing trees and shrubs to recreate open areas** (Action 2483): Studies in the USA found that removing Ashe juniper trees resulted in higher abundances of three rodent species, and removing trees increased use of areas by Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep.\n\n**Mid-storey vegetation removal** (Action 2480): A randomized, replicated, controlled study in the USA found that removing mid-storey vegetation increased both mammal species richness and abundance.\n\n**Natural regeneration approaches** (Action 2634): A study in Canada found that natural forest regeneration increased moose numbers relative to more intensive management in the short- to medium-term but not in the longer term. Natural regeneration in former plantations or logged forest (Action 3876) showed varying results for different species groups, with some studies finding greater species richness and abundance of certain groups compared to managed plantations.\n\n**Leaving woody debris after logging** (Action 3632): Studies in the USA generally found that leaving or removing woody debris did not significantly affect reptile species richness, diversity, or abundance, though one study found areas where debris was left had higher reptile species richness and abundance than areas where debris was cleared and burned.\n\n**Prescribed burning on pine forests** (Action 318): Studies found mixed results, with some showing higher bird species richness in burned areas and benefits for open habitat species, while closed-forest species and ground nesters were generally adversely affected by burning.",

Two studies from Ethiopia and Nepal (including one replicated, before-and-after, site comparison) found that forest cover increased more in community-managed forests than in forests not managed by local communities (action 1152). However, one replicated, site comparison study in Colombia found that deforestation rates in community-managed forests did not differ from deforestation rates in forests that were not managed by local communities, or in uninhabited national parks (action 1152). Additional evidence shows monetary benefits provided to local communities for forest management had mixed results: one before-and-after study in Belize found that numbers of black howler monkeys increased by 138% over 13 years after local communities received monetary benefits alongside other interventions (action 1509), and one before-and-after study in the Republic of Congo found that most central chimpanzees reintroduced to an area where local communities received monetary benefits alongside other interventions survived over five years (action 1509). However, one before-and-after study in Rwanda, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo found that numbers of mountain gorillas declined by 28% over 41 years despite the implementation of development projects in nearby communities alongside other interventions (action 1509). Community engagement in conservation activities has shown some effectiveness, with one site comparison study in Brazil finding that areas where community-based management of fishing practices was implemented had a higher abundance of river turtles than areas with no community-based management (action 3681).",

The evidence shows one controlled study in South Africa found that using electric fencing to exclude elephants and nyalas increased tree density (Action 1231). For wire fencing, two replicated, controlled studies in the USA found that using wire fencing to exclude large herbivores increased tree density (Action 1230). Additionally, five of ten studies in Australia, Bhutan, Canada, France, Portugal and the USA found that using wire fencing to exclude large herbivores increased the cover and size of understory plants, while six studies found no effect on cover, seed density, species richness or diversity of understory plants (Action 1230). One study found wire fencing increased young tree biomass, one found it decreased young tree density, and one found mixed effects depending on species (Action 1230). For livestock exclusion using wire fences, studies in Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Israel, New Zealand, Spain, West Africa and the USA showed that four of eight studies found increased biomass, species richness, density and cover of understory plants, while four studies found mixed effects or no effect (Action 1205). Three of four studies in Mexico, Kenya, Israel and Panama found that excluding livestock using wire fences increased the size and density of regenerating trees (Action 1205).",

Five of ten studies found that logging increased the density and cover of understory plants, while four of seven studies found it increased species richness and diversity of understory plants (Action 1273).\n\n**Mature Trees:** Logging has mixed effects on mature trees. Three of seven studies found logging decreased tree density and cover, while two found it increased tree density and two found no effect. For tree size, three of six studies found logging increased tree size, while two found it decreased size. Tree species diversity was negatively impacted, with two of four studies finding decreased species richness and diversity (Action 1271).\n\n**Young Trees:** Limited evidence shows logging can increase young tree density, with one study finding increased density and another showing mixed effects (Action 1272).\n\n**Non-vascular Plants:** Logging negatively impacts non-vascular plants, with two of three studies finding decreased epiphytic plant abundance and fern fertility (Action 1270).\n\n**Wildlife:** Selective logging practices show some benefits for wildlife. Studies found that primate densities were higher in low-intensity logged forests compared to high-intensity logged areas, and lemur numbers increased following selective logging (Action 1485). For insects, selective logging forests showed similar or higher butterfly species richness and abundance compared to primary forests, and higher moth caterpillar abundance than clearcut areas (Action 3867). Wildlife corridors retained in logged areas supported seven species of arboreal marsupials (Action 2651).\n\n**Regeneration:** Re-planting native trees after logging resulted in similar species richness but lower diversity compared to naturally regenerating secondary forest (Action 3874).",

However, several individual studies from both regions provide insights into different approaches and their effectiveness.\n\nEuropean studies show varied results for soil improvement techniques. In Finland, soil disturbance decreased understory vegetation cover (Action ID: 1252). In Sweden, tilling showed mixed effects on different tree species (Action ID: 1251). French studies found that vegetation removal combined with mechanical soil disturbance increased understory plant cover, diversity, and young tree density (Action ID: 1274). A Portugal study found that ploughing increased understory plant cover and diversity (Action ID: 1251). In Portugal, applying fertilizer after planting increased planted tree size (Action ID: 1260), while French studies found no effect of fertilizer on tree size, survival rate, or health (Action ID: 1260). Swedish studies showed that ground preparation treatments increased planted tree survival and growth rates (Action ID: 1263).\n\nUSA studies present different findings. Ploughing increased understory plant cover and diversity (Action ID: 1251), but did not decrease invasive grass seedling spreading distance and density (Action ID: 1251). Canadian studies (included with North American context) found that ploughing had mixed effects on young tree density, with some studies showing increases and others showing decreases (Action ID: 1251). Canadian studies also found that applying fertilizer after planting increased planted tree size (Action ID: 1260) and that ground preparation treatments increased planted tree survival and growth rates (Action ID: 1263).\n\nThe documents do not provide systematic comparisons between European and USA approaches, and most studies focus on individual techniques rather than comprehensive effectiveness assessments across regions.",

For fire prevention signs, no evidence was found (action 1172). For prescribed burning, which is the most studied intervention, eight of 14 studies found no effect on amphibian abundance or species numbers, while four found mixed effects and three found increased abundance or species numbers (action 877). Prescribed fire effects on understory plants showed mixed results: eight of 22 studies found increased cover/density/biomass while six found decreases, and fourteen of 24 studies found increased species richness/diversity while nine found no effect or mixed effects (action 1221). Prescribed burning on deciduous forests showed minimal evidence with one study finding similar bird species richness in burned versus unburned areas and mixed results for specific species (action 317). For mechanical vegetation removal interventions, three studies found that mechanically removing understorey vegetation did not increase mammal abundances compared to prescribed burning (action 2482), while removing mid-storey vegetation increased mammal species richness and abundance in one study (action 2480). Creating fire breaks mechanically showed that areas with more recent/regular clearance had greater butterfly species richness and abundance (action 3881), and fire suppression combined with predator exclusion increased reptile abundance over time (action 3658). Many specific interventions completely lack evidence, including prescribed burning to reduce wildfire potential (action 1623), vegetation thinning to prevent wildfires (action 1764), zero burning policies near peatlands (action 1856), building fire breaks (actions 1766, 3080), raising water levels to prevent fires (action 3079), and prescribed burning to mimic natural fire cycles (action 1622).",

However, one replicated, paired site study in Mexico found no effect of forest protection on seed density and diversity of trees and shrubs.\n\nProviding legal protection of forests from development (Action ID 1169): No evidence was found for the effects of providing legal protection of forests from development.\n\nLegally protecting habitats (Action ID 158): Four studies from Europe found population increases following habitat protection, more positive population trends in protected habitats compared with outside, or with increased amounts of protected habitats. A literature review reported that a large number of cranes of seven species used nature reserves in China, whilst a replicated, randomised and controlled study from Argentina found that some guilds of birds were found at higher species richnesses in protected forests.\n\nAdopting protected species legislation (Action ID 1201): No evidence was found of the effects of adopting protected species legislation on forests.\n\nDesignating protected areas (Action ID 3384): Four studies evaluated the overall effects of designating protected areas involving marshes or swamps. Two studies in China reported that the area of marsh, swamp or unspecified wetland in protected areas declined over 6-12 years. One study in Puerto Rico reported that protection had no clear effect on mangrove forest area. One study of a mangrove forest in Malaysia reported that it retained at least 97% of its forest area over 98 years of protection as a forest reserve.\n\nEnforcing existing legislation for habitat protection (Action ID 2916): No specific evidence was found regarding enforcement of existing legislation for habitat protection.",

    "relevant_summary": "Evidence regarding legal frameworks for forest conservation shows mixed results. Legal protection of habitat has demonstrated some positive outcomes, with studies finding population increases following habitat protection and more positive population trends in protected areas compared to unprotected areas (Action 158). Specifically for primate habitats, legal protection resulted in increased primate numbers in China for rhesus monkeys and grey snub-monkeys, a 34% increase in Hainan gibbon numbers over nine years, and lower stress levels in black howler monkeys in protected areas compared to unprotected forest fragments in Mexico (Action 1578). However, legal protection was not always effective, as evidenced by decreased numbers of Tana River red colobus monkeys and crested mangabeys in Kenya despite legal protection (Action 1578). For marine and freshwater mammal habitat protection, no studies were found that evaluated the effects of enforcing existing legislation (Action 2916).\n\nEvidence regarding public engagement initiatives shows promising results for forest conservation. Community-based forest management demonstrated effectiveness in two studies from Ethiopia and Nepal, where forest cover increased more in community-managed forests than in forests not managed by local communities (Action 1152). However, one study in Colombia found no difference in deforestation rates between community-managed forests and other management approaches (Action 1152). Community-based participation in land management showed positive outcomes, with an increasing population of Himalayan brown bears in Pakistan associated with local community involvement in park management, and fewer farmers removing large carnivores in Namibia when engaged in community-based management through conservancy membership (Action 2395). Providing monetary benefits to local communities for forest management showed mixed results, with black howler monkey numbers increasing by 138% in Belize over 13 years, but mountain gorilla numbers declining by 28% over 41 years in Rwanda, Uganda and Democratic Republic of Congo despite development projects in nearby communities (Action 1509). Increasing resources for managing protected areas resulted in higher mammal species richness and greater occupancy rates in a well-resourced national park compared to a less well-resourced forest reserve in Tanzania (Action 2564).",

    "relevant_summary": "Several management actions are available for forest recovery after wildfire, with varying effectiveness documented in scientific studies. Thinning trees after wildfire has been studied in five replicated, controlled studies across multiple countries. Two studies in Spain found that thinning increased plant species richness, one in Canada found it increased aspen sapling cover, while one study in the USA found thinning decreased plant biomass and one in Israel found it decreased mortality of pine seedlings (Action 1234). Post-fire salvage logging shows mixed results, with one study in Canada finding that logging after wildfire decreased species richness and diversity of mosses (Action 1234).\n\nSeeding interventions have shown limited effectiveness for forest recovery. Three studies in the USA examining herbaceous plant seeding in burnt forest areas found it decreased the number and cover of native species and decreased tree seedling density, with no effect on total plant cover or species richness (Action 1236). However, sowing tree seeds specifically showed more promise, with one study in Brazil finding that sowing tree seeds increased the density and species richness of new trees (Action 1244).\n\nPrescribed fire as a post-planting management tool showed mixed results. Four studies in Finland, France and the USA found that two studies showed prescribed fire after replanting increased survival and sprouting rate of planted trees, while one study found fire decreased planted tree size and one found no effect on size and survival rate (Action 1255).\n\nDebris management is another post-fire action, with one study in Spain finding that removing burned trees and branches after wildfire did not increase European wild rabbit numbers compared to removing burned trees but leaving branches in place (Action 2478). Natural regeneration following disturbance showed time-dependent effects, with one study in Canada finding that natural forest regeneration increased moose numbers relative to more intensive management in the short- to medium-term but not in the longer term (Action 2634).\n\nFor logged forest areas, reseeding showed limited benefits. One study in the USA found that reseeded areas had similar reptile species richness, diversity, and abundance compared to areas left to regenerate naturally, and reptile communities in reseeded areas were not more similar to mature forest stands than those left to regenerate naturally (Action 3638).",

    "relevant_summary": "The effectiveness of community-based forest management varies significantly across different countries according to the available evidence. In Ethiopia and Nepal, two studies including one replicated, before-and-after, site comparison found that forest cover increased more in community-managed forests than in forests not managed by local communities (Action 1152). However, in Colombia, one replicated, site comparison study found that deforestation rates in community-managed forests did not differ from deforestation rates in forests that were not managed by local communities, or in uninhabited national parks (Action 1152). \n\nAdditional evidence from other countries shows mixed results for community-based conservation approaches. In Pakistan, involving local communities with park management was associated with an increasing population of Himalayan brown bears (Action 2395). In Brazil, areas where community-based management of fishing practices was implemented had a higher abundance of river turtles than areas with no community-based management (Action 3681). In the Philippines, after rural community members were paid a small incentive to protect Philippine crocodile sanctuaries combined with an education and awareness campaign, fewer crocodiles were killed than before community engagement (Action 3681). In Mozambique, during a community-based turtle monitoring project no killing of adults was recorded and fewer sea turtle eggs were lost to poaching than before projects began (Action 3681).\n\nRegarding monetary incentives for forest management, results also vary by country. In Belize, numbers of black howler monkeys increased by 138% over 13 years after local communities received monetary benefits, alongside other interventions (Action 1509). In the Republic of Congo, most central chimpanzees reintroduced to an area where local communities received monetary benefits, alongside other interventions, survived over five years (Action 1509). However, in Rwanda, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, numbers of mountain gorillas declined by 28% over 41 years despite the implementation of development projects in nearby communities, alongside other interventions (Action 1509).",
