At aquaculture systems (action 2775), six studies were evaluated, with four of six studies finding that acoustic devices reduced predation on caged salmon by grey seals, harbour seals and South American sea lions, or reduced the number of harbour seals approaching fish cages. However, two studies found that acoustic devices did not reduce harbour seal predation at salmon farms or reduce the presence, approach distances, group sizes or time spent around fin-fish farms by common bottlenose dolphins.\n\nFor fishing gear (action 2808), thirty-three studies were evaluated, showing much more extensive evidence. In terms of human-wildlife conflict specifically, five of six controlled studies found that acoustic devices reduced damage to fish catches and/or fishing nets caused by common bottlenose dolphins and seals, while one study found acoustic devices did not reduce damage to swordfish catches by California sea lions. Additionally, fishing gear studies demonstrated significant evidence for reducing entanglements, with nine studies finding that acoustic devices resulted in fewer collisions of humpback whales or entanglements of harbour porpoises, Franciscana dolphins, beaked whales and small cetaceans.\n\nThe fishing gear evidence base is substantially larger (33 vs 6 studies) and shows broader applications across more marine mammal species and geographical locations. Acoustic devices on fishing gear also demonstrated effectiveness for both reducing unwanted catch/entanglements (14 studies) and human-wildlife conflict (6 studies), while aquaculture studies focused primarily on predation reduction at fish farms.",

Captive breeding and release programs demonstrate mixed results: studies from 31 locations found that captive-bred mammals had lower post-release survival rates than wild-born translocated animals, though populations of mountain gazelles, Corsican red deer, PÃ¨re David's deer, Eurasian otters and swift foxes increased following releases (Action 2476). Review evidence indicates over half of mammal release programmes were considered successful, with release programmes for macropods resulting in successful establishment in 61% of cases and 40% surviving over five years (Action 2476).\n\nTranslocation shows promise for marine mammals: 50-83% of translocated Hawaiian monk seal pups survived for at least one year, with similar survival rates to non-translocated pups born at release sites (Action 2930). More than a quarter of translocated Hawaiian monk seals reproduced when combined with other interventions (Action 2930). For captive-bred marine mammals, two of three Antillean manatees and two of 14 Florida manatees born in captivity and released survived for at least one year (Action 2933).\n\nPre-release captive management improves outcomes: holding translocated mammals in captivity before release increased survival rates, with longer captivity periods improving survival of European hedgehogs and Canada lynx (Action 2458). Translocated animals held in captivity prior to release had higher post-release survival rates than captive-bred animals released directly (Action 2458).\n\nProvision of artificial refuges and breeding sites enhances success: release sites with artificial burrows had higher abundances of European rabbits and California ground squirrels compared to sites without (Action 2453). Translocated European ground squirrels released into plugged artificial burrows had higher recapture rates than those in unplugged burrows (Action 2453).\n\nSupplementary feeding provides population support: studies found supplementary feeding increased abundance of bank voles, red squirrels, striped mice, brown hyena and black-backed jackals (Action 2367). It increased reproductive rates in ungulates in five of eight studies and survival in four out of seven studies (Action 2367). Supplementary feeding increased the proportion of striped mice breeding, arctic fox litters, and prairie vole litter sizes (Action 2367).\n\nGenetic management techniques show limited evidence: artificial insemination resulted in fewer than half of female black-footed ferrets giving birth and lower pregnancy rates in giant pandas compared to natural mating (Action 2473). However, artificial insemination using preserved genetic material increased genetic diversity and lowered inbreeding in captive black-footed ferret populations (Action 2475).\n\nPrimate reintroduction success varies by rearing method: most reintroduced golden lion tamarins born and reared in cages had higher mortality than wild-born tamarins and did not survive over seven years (Action 1594). Only two out of three black lion tamarins raised in free-ranging environments survived over four months despite this more natural rearing approach (Action 1596).",

      "relevant_summary": "Acoustic devices used for marine mammal conservation present several trade-offs between effectiveness and behavioral impacts. While these devices can be effective for reducing unwanted interactions, they also cause significant behavioral changes in marine mammals. According to action 2896, acoustic devices successfully deter mammals from areas to reduce noise exposure, with studies finding reduced activity and sightings of harbour porpoises at distances of 1-18 km from devices, and minke whales increasing swimming speed and swimming more directly when devices were deployed. Action 2816 shows that acoustic devices on moorings reduced numbers of grey and harbour seals and activity of harbour porpoises, short-beaked common dolphins and common bottlenose dolphins, though effectiveness varied by species as they had no significant effect on humpback whale behavior. Action 2815 demonstrates that acoustic devices on fishing vessels caused common bottlenose dolphins to avoid boats more frequently and reduced surfacing, echolocation rates, and time spent foraging or socializing in Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins and Australian snubfin dolphins. Action 2808 reveals that while acoustic devices on fishing gear successfully reduced entanglements of various species including harbour porpoises, Franciscana dolphins, and beaked whales, they also caused behavioral changes including reduced approaches to nets and decreased activity in surrounding areas. Action 2775 shows acoustic devices at aquaculture systems reduced predation by seals and sea lions but had inconsistent effects across species and locations. A key trade-off identified in action 2816 is that while acoustic devices can reduce immediate mammal presence, the probability of porpoises approaching within 125 m actually increased over 10-11 days, suggesting potential habituation effects that could reduce long-term effectiveness.",

Use of acoustic devices on moorings was found to reduce the number of harbour seals feeding on migrating juvenile salmon in the Puntledge River (Action 2816). Use of acoustic devices on fishing gear showed mixed but generally positive results, with nine studies finding that acoustic devices on cod traps or fishing nets resulted in fewer collisions of humpback whales or entanglements of harbour porpoises, Franciscana dolphins, beaked whales and small cetaceans, and five of six studies finding that acoustic devices reduced damage to fish catches and/or fishing nets caused by common bottlenose dolphins and seals (Action 2808). Use of catch and hook protection devices on fishing gear showed variable results, with two of four studies finding that net sleeves or cage and chain devices on fishing hooks reduced damage to fish catches by sperm whales, killer whales and toothed whales, though two other studies found that umbrella or spider devices did not reduce predation (Action 2821). For aquaculture systems, replacing anti-predator nets more frequently at salmon farms resulted in fewer salmon losses to harbour seal predation (Action 2774).
