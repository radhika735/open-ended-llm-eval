Studies on topsoil removal show multiple benefits: one replicated, randomized, controlled study in France found that removing topsoil before sowing seeds increased plant community similarity to that of intact steppe and increased plant species richness, while a replicated, controlled study in the UK found that removing topsoil before sowing seeds increased the species richness of sown plants (Action 3415). Two replicated, controlled studies in the USA found that removing topsoil before planting or sowing increased the survival of native grass seedlings and plants (Action 3415). In contrast, studies on soil disturbance alone show more limited benefits: one randomized, replicated, controlled study in the UK found that soil disturbance increased the abundance or species richness of specialist and generalist plant species, but a controlled study in South Africa found that digging soil did not alter vegetation cover or the density of native plants (Action 1728). Additionally, studies combining soil disturbance with seeding show that soil disturbance using a rotovator and spreading clippings of heathland plants increased the number of heathland plants, while stripping surface soil layers and adding seed reduced the cover of perennial rye-grass more effectively (Action 1711).",

More frequent mowing also proved beneficial, with a German study showing that mowing more frequently after sowing seeds increased the abundance of five of seven sown forb species (3419). For livestock grazing after seeding, an Italian study found that grazing with livestock after sowing seeds increased plant species richness compared to sowing without grazing (3423). However, a UK study found that grazing with cattle after sowing seeds reduced sown species cover compared to grazing with sheep, and grazing with cattle reduced the cover of sown species compared to cutting vegetation (3423). The evidence suggests differential effects between cattle and sheep grazing, with a UK study showing that grazing with cattle after sowing seeds increased sown species richness compared to grazing with sheep (3423). Direct comparisons indicate mixed results: one UK study found cutting vegetation yearly after sowing increased plant species richness compared to grazing with livestock, while another found winter grazing after sowing resulted in higher survival of cut-leaved cranesbill seedlings (3423, 3419).

One study found mycorrhiza addition increased abundance of target conservation priority species, while another found it increased cover of three of 38 native prairie species. Mycorrhiza inoculation increased plant height but did not affect plant biomass or emergence rates. However, mycorrhiza did not alter plant species richness in one study. For topsoil addition, documented effects include increased plant species richness and increased biomass of sown species in most cases when topsoil was added before seeding (action 3420). When topsoil was added alongside seeding, it increased grass biomass but reduced forb biomass compared to topsoil addition alone (action 1857). More generally, topsoil addition increased cover or abundance of plant species, increased plant cover and number of species, though these remained lower than undisturbed sites, and increased number of seedlings for majority of plants tested (action 1686). Additional soil amendments showed varied effects: adding carbon to soil after seeding either reduced or did not alter density of sown forb species (action 3433), while adding charcoal before seeding did not alter overall plant biomass or grass cover but increased legume cover (action 3422). Soil amendment with bacteria and fungi resulted in higher microbial diversity, increased soil organic matter content, and higher crop yields (action 888).",

Regarding species diversity in seed mixes, four studies examined increasing the number of species in seed mixes in the USA (Action 3406). Two replicated, controlled studies found that increasing the number of species in a seed mix increased the species richness of sown plants, while one of these studies also found increased cover of sown plant species. However, one replicated, site comparison study found that increasing the number of species in a seed mix did not change overall plant species richness. For seed density effects, four studies were conducted in the USA examining sowing seeds at higher density (Action 3405). One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study found that sowing seeds at a higher density increased both forb species richness and forb cover, as well as increased grass cover and increased the number of purple needlegrass seedlings. However, one site comparison study found that sowing grass seeds at a higher density reduced the cover of native grassland shrubs, and one replicated, controlled study found that higher density seeding did not alter the cover of sown plant species. Studies on broader grassland restoration approaches in the USA show mixed results. Twelve studies in North America examined sowing native grass and forbs (Action 3432), with some studies finding increased overall plant species richness, increased species richness of native plants, and increased cover of native plant species and sown species. However, effectiveness varied, with some studies showing no change in vegetation abundance. Six studies in North America examined sowing grass seeds only (Action 3397), with three of four studies finding that this approach did not change or reduced overall plant species richness, and some studies finding reduced abundance of native forb species and shrub species. Overall grassland restoration studies from the USA, Canada and Iceland found that species richness on restored grassland sites was similar to remnant habitats or higher than unrestored sites, with some target species using restored grasslands and higher abundances or densities of some species compared to unrestored sites (Action 361).",

Sowing seeds at the start of the growing season increased the cover of sown grass and forb species compared to autumn sowing and increased the number of sown species (Action 3407). Increasing the number of species in seed mix showed mixed effects, with one study finding increased cover of sown plant species while another found no change (Action 3406).\n\n**Site preparation methods:** Applying herbicide before seeding increased the cover of sown grass species and increased sown species richness (Action 3418). Disturbing soil before sowing seeds increased plant emergence in most cases and improved seedling survival in some studies (Action 3413). Removing leaf litter before seeding showed mixed effects on seedling emergence of sown species (Action 3414).\n\n**Soil amendments and treatments:** Adding fertilizer to soil before or after seeding showed mixed results, with some studies finding increased cover and density of sown species while others found no change (Action 3427). Inoculating soil with mycorrhiza before seeding increased the abundance of target species considered a local conservation priority and increased cover of some native prairie species (Action 3429).\n\n**Post-establishment management:** Mowing after seeding increased the abundance of sown forb species and increased sown species richness, with more frequent mowing increasing abundance of five of seven sown forb species (Action 3419).

Sowing grassland seeds from a local source increased the abundance of some characteristic plant species and increased cover of target plant species when combined with increased species diversity (Action 3400).\n\n**Water management:** Irrigating after seeding showed limited evidence, with one study finding no change in vegetation cover (Action 3430).",

Mowing after seeding/planting increased plant species richness compared to grazing with livestock in UK studies (Action 3419). Specifically, cutting vegetation yearly after sowing seeds resulted in higher plant species richness than livestock grazing (Action 3419). Mowing also increased the richness of sown species after seeding, with one UK study showing that mowing after sowing seeds increased sown species richness (Action 3419). Additionally, cutting sown plots each year and removing cut vegetation increased sown grass and forb species richness compared to cutting without removing vegetation (Action 3419). \n\nFor grazing effects, one UK study found that grazing with cattle after sowing seeds increased sown species richness compared to grazing with sheep (Action 3423). However, the same study also found that grazing with cattle reduced the cover of sown species compared to sheep grazing (Action 3423). Grazing with livestock after sowing seeds generally reduced plant species richness compared to cutting vegetation after sowing (Action 3423).\n\nRegarding mowing frequency, cutting vegetation three times per year after sowing seeds increased the richness of characteristic grassland species compared to cutting once per year in German studies (Action 3419). More frequent mowing also increased the abundance of five of seven sown forb species (Action 3419).\n\nThe timing of management also matters, as studies showed that delaying mowing dates resulted in higher plant species richness in some cases (Action 131).",
