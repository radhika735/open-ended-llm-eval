Seed-eating birds preferred rye grass cut once only, while insect-eating birds showed more variable results with some preferring plots cut two or more times (Action 132). Two reviews and replicated controlled studies found that seed-eating birds were more abundant on uncut plots than on cut plots (Action 224). One study found higher ground beetle species diversity in uncut plots by the third year of the experiment (Action 132). For raising mowing height: A review from the UK found that raising mowing height may have increased productivity of Eurasian skylarks, but not sufficiently to maintain the local population (Action 222). A randomized, replicated and controlled study from the UK found that no more foraging birds were attracted to plots with raised mowing heights, compared to plots with shorter grass (Action 222). Studies found raised cutting heights were less damaging to amphibians and invertebrates, but had no effect on numbers of foraging birds or invertebrates in another trial (Action 138). One study found that northern lapwing and common starling chicks had greater foraging success in shorter grass (Action 138). The evidence suggests uncut strips provide clearer benefits for seed-eating birds, while raising mowing height shows mixed and less consistent results for wildlife benefits in UK grasslands.",

From studies across France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Switzerland and the UK, successful restoration techniques include topsoil removal, introduction of target plant species, raising water levels, grazing, mowing, or combinations of topsoil removal with target plant species introduction plus livestock exclusion (Action 119). Water level management is particularly important, with raising water levels in ditches or grassland showing positive effects on bird numbers, plant species that favour wet conditions, and invertebrate numbers in agricultural landscapes, though some studies found net loss of plant species (Action 121). Active water level management, including controlled flooding and water fluctuation, can generate plant communities characteristic of wetter conditions and increase wetland-characteristic species abundance (Action 3038).\n\nTraditional water meadow maintenance involves specific management regimes including grazing and mowing. Mowing once per year in autumn or light grazing with cattle or horses produces similar butterfly species richness (Action 3971). Grazing management shows mixed impacts, with some studies finding benefits for certain species but reduced productivity for others. Studies indicate that cutting in June maintained relatively stable vegetation, while mowing effects on plant species richness were variable (Action 696). For general grassland restoration, effective techniques include grazing, introducing plant species, hay spreading and mowing, with positive restoration signs typically visible within 5-10 years (Action 133).\n\nManagement intensity reduction through several interventions shows benefits, with 22 studies finding positive effects on wildlife groups including plants, invertebrates and birds, though results can be variable depending on the specific interventions applied (Action 69). The timing and type of management is crucial, with species-rich grasslands showing different responses to mowing versus grazing regimes depending on the target species and local conditions (Action 3908).",

For spring sowing, a replicated controlled study from Sweden found more bird species on areas with spring sown cereals compared with winter cereals, and a UK study found several species bred in the study site for the first time after spring sowing began (Action 207). Three studies found population increases after spring sowing began or higher populations on sites with spring-sown cereals compared to sites with winter cereals (Action 207). Five studies found that planting crops in spring rather than autumn resulted in higher numbers of farmland birds (Action 137).

For birds, studies from the Netherlands and UK found increases in Eurasian kestrel clutches and breeding tree sparrows following nest box provision (Action 155). Eight studies from Finland, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and UK found nest boxes in agricultural habitats were occupied by various species including Eurasian kestrel, long-eared owl, starlings, tits, tree sparrow, stock dove, jackdaw, Eurasian wryneck and Eurasian hoopoe (Action 155). Swedish studies showed nest success was related to pasture availability and higher positioning (Action 155). For bumblebees, three UK trials since 1989 showed very low uptake rates of 0-2.5% for various designs, though earlier trials in USA/Canada showed 10-48% uptake (Action 48).

Nest box design affects use, productivity and usurpation rates, with thirteen studies finding that these varied with different designs (action 498). The position and orientation of nest boxes is also important, with fourteen studies finding different occupation or success rates depending on positioning (action 498). Specifically, nest boxes positioned higher above the ground had higher occupancy, numbers of eggs and numbers of hatched young (action 155). The surrounding habitat influences success, with nest success in boxes being related to the amount of pasture available (action 155). Tree sparrows showed a preference for nest boxes in wetland habitat compared to those in farmland sites (action 155). Nest box maintenance affects occupancy, as five studies found that various songbirds preferentially nested in cleaned nest boxes compared to used ones, though some studies found birds showed preference for uncleaned boxes and there were no differences in success or parasitism levels between cleaned and uncleaned boxes (action 499). Predation is a significant factor, with predation rates being lower for relocated nest boxes compared to controls (action 420), and nest boxes or nesting 'tubs' showing lower predation or higher nesting success than natural nests (action 402). Predator deterrents such as metal cones with 7.6 cm overhang and increased distance between entrance hole and roof from 30 to 60 cm can prevent raccoons from entering nest boxes (action 402). Nest box density may also play a role, with one study finding more nesting attempts in areas with more nest boxes, though another study found no differences in behaviour or productivity between areas with high or low densities of nest boxes (action 498).",

For butterflies and moths, evidence suggests landscape benefits may occur, with studies showing that species richness of butterflies was higher in landscapes with a greater proportion of land managed under agri-environment schemes, and that abundance of butterflies was higher on farms or in landscapes with a higher proportion of land managed under agri-environment schemes (Action 3915). However, a UK study found that agri-environment scheme prescriptions had a local but not a landscape-scale effect on bee numbers (Action 700).

Creating or restoring traditional water meadows through techniques including topsoil removal, introduction of target plant species, raising water levels, grazing, and mowing were successful in restoring wet meadow plant communities (Action 119).\n\nAdditional effective strategies include delaying mowing or first grazing dates, which resulted in increased breeding wading bird densities (Action 131). Creating scrapes and pools in wetlands and wet grasslands showed that northern lapwing chicks foraged in newly created wet features and chick condition was higher in sites with a large number of footdrains (Action 359). Providing short grass for waders was beneficial, as northern lapwings spent more time foraging on short swards compared to longer grass (Action 221). Direct payments per clutch for farmland birds showed slightly higher breeding densities of wading birds and higher hatching success of northern lapwing and black-tailed godwit on farms with payment schemes (Action 146).
