Planting nectar flower mixtures/wildflower strips is also highly effective, with 23 studies demonstrating increased butterfly species richness and abundance compared to conventional field margins or cropped fields (Action ID: 3932). Planting grass buffer strips/margins around fields shows mixed results but can be beneficial, with 26 studies indicating they can enhance butterfly species richness and abundance, especially when floristically enhanced or made wider (up to 6m) rather than standard grass-only margins (Action ID: 3982). Payment schemes covering conservation costs are widely used and can be effective for implementing these measures (Action ID: 3915).",

The evidence demonstrates that monarchs readily use planted milkweed in gardens more than in meadows, and that planting native milkweed species is critical for monarch caterpillar growth. Action ID 3933 supports this by showing that replanting native vegetation including host plants is used by wild monarch butterflies and other species. While captive rearing (Action ID 3916) has been successfully used for monarchs for over 25 years, habitat restoration through native plant establishment remains the primary conservation approach with direct field evidence showing increased monarch abundance.",
