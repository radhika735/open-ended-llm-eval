Double fyke nets have been found effective for catching bullfrog tadpoles in small shallow ponds (Action 1046). For adult removal, one study found that bullfrog adults can be captured overnight in a single trap floating on the water surface (Action 1045), though another study noted that catchability of adult bullfrogs using one double fyke net for 24 hours was very low (Action 1045). A before-and-after study in France showed significant reduction in recorded adults and juveniles following the removal of juveniles by trapping when carried out as part of a combination treatment (Action 1046). However, it's important to note that one replicated, controlled study found that bullfrog populations rapidly rebounded following intensive removal of adults (Action 1045), indicating that removal efforts need to be sustained. No evidence was found for the effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of pond draining or pond destruction methods (Actions 1042 and 1043).",

A field-based trial in Spanish irrigation systems using fat-coated particles called BioBullets achieved 100% mortality of Asian clams within pipes.
