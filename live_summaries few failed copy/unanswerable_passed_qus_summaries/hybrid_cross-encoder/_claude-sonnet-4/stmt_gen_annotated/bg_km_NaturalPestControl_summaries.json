Push-pull systems (action 753) demonstrate strong economic benefits, with two studies in Kenya and a review finding greater economic benefits, and one study showing higher production costs only in the first year but equal or lower costs in the following five years. This system also increased parasitism of stem borer larvae and had more natural predators in overall totals and abundance of different predator groups. Threshold-based pesticide use (action 750) showed cost-effectiveness across multiple studies, with nine studies finding fewer pesticide applications were needed and three studies finding or predicting lower production costs, while maintaining similar yields and crop damage compared to conventional spraying regimes. Growing plants that produce chemicals to attract natural enemies (action 724) showed effectiveness in attracting natural enemies and reducing pest populations or damage across crops including lettuce, orange, safflower and sorghum, with one study finding increased crop yield. Beetle banks (action 729) demonstrated economic potential, with one study and review showing they could make economic savings if they prevented pests from reaching spray thresholds or causing 5% yield loss. However, none of the documented studies specifically evaluated these methods in arid or desert environments, limiting direct application of cost-effectiveness data to those specific conditions.",

One randomised, replicated, controlled study found pest numbers were similar under threshold-based and conventional spraying regimes and one study reported that pest control was inadequate. A randomised, replicated, controlled study found mixed effects on disease severity. Crop damage: Four of five randomised, replicated, controlled studies from New Zealand, the Philippines and the USA found similar crop damage under threshold-based and conventional, preventative spraying regimes, but one study found damage increased. Another study found slightly less crop damage compared to unsprayed controls. Yield: Two of four randomised, replicated, controlled studies found similar yields under threshold-based and conventional spraying regimes. Two studies found mixed effects depending on site, year, pest stage/type or control treatment.

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available action documents, there is limited direct evidence specifically addressing how large-scale climate change impacts the effectiveness of natural pest control strategies. The documents primarily focus on individual pest management techniques rather than climate change effects on these strategies.\n\nThe evidence shows that natural pest control strategies include various approaches with varying effectiveness: planting flowers can increase pest reduction and higher proportions of parasitized pests in fields (Action 1400), though effects on pest numbers can be inconsistent. Ground cover in orchards and vineyards shows mixed results for pest regulation, with some studies finding increased parasitism of leafhopper eggs but others showing inconsistent differences (Action 1395). Creating beetle banks can increase invertebrate predators and reduce pests in surrounding crops, with the largest pest reductions occurring in areas closest to beetle banks (Action 729).\n\nSome strategies show temporal sensitivity that could be relevant to climate impacts: delayed mowing or grazing affects natural enemy populations, with studies finding mixed effects on predator groups and some finding more pest insects in late-cut plots (Action 727). Alley cropping shows variable effects on parasitism that depend on study sites, sampling dates, and pest life stages (Action 718). Ant exclusion from pest protection shows effects that vary between natural enemy species, sampling dates, and sites (Action 886).\n\nHowever, the action documents do not contain specific information about how climate change factors such as temperature increases, altered precipitation patterns, or shifting seasonal timing directly affect the effectiveness of these natural pest control strategies.",
