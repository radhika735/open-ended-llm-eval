Additionally, one replicated study in the Ionian Sea found that despite established minimum sizes, most fish landed in commercial catches were immature and had never spawned (Action 2735). This suggests that minimum landing sizes may have limited effectiveness in improving reproductive success. In contrast, no studies were found that evaluated the effects of setting a maximum landing size for commercially fished species on marine fish populations (Action 2736). Similarly, no studies were found that evaluated the effects of specifying a size range of capture for commercially fished species (Action 2737).

    "relevant_summary": "The action documents provide very limited evidence specifically addressing the social and economic impacts on fishing communities from establishing long-term fishery closures. The available evidence focuses primarily on biological and ecological effects rather than socioeconomic impacts.\n\nRegarding long-term fishery closures specifically, action 2655 examined the effects of establishing long-term fishery closures across five studies in various marine areas including the Norwegian Sea, North Sea, Gulf of Maine, Bismark Sea, and Kattegat. However, this action document explicitly states that there were \"0 STUDIES\" examining community responses to long-term fishery closures, indicating no evidence was found regarding social or economic impacts on fishing communities.\n\nOne related finding from action 2675 involved areas closed to customary fishing (indigenous fishing for cultural and community needs) in the Bismark Sea, where closure for eight years affected fish abundance and behavior, but this document does not address the social or economic impacts on the indigenous fishing communities affected by the prohibition.\n\nThe search identified several management approaches that could relate to community impacts, including community-based fisheries management (action 2242), territorial user rights for fisheries (action 2104), and allowing only small-scale traditional fishing (action 2678), but these actions do not provide evidence about the socioeconomic effects of fishery closures on communities.\n\nThe action documents indicate that studies examining stakeholder engagement when designing Marine Protected Areas (action 2243), purchasing fishing vessels from fishers (action 3819), introducing economic incentives for sustainable fishing (action 2811), and including fishers in management groups (action 2809) found no studies that evaluated these interventions, suggesting a significant research gap in understanding community impacts of fishery management measures.",
