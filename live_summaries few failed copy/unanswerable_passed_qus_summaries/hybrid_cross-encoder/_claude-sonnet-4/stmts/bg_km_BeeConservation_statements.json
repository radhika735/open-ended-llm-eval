Sowing uncropped arable field margins with native wild flower seed mixes supports higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees compared to cropped field edges, grassy margins, or naturally regenerated uncropped margins (Action 19). Perennial leguminous herbs in seed mixtures are particularly important forage sources for bumblebees, especially long-tongued species (Action 19). Agricultural nectar and pollen mixes sown on field margins also attract significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated, grassy, or cropped field margins (Action 18). However, margins sown with agricultural legume plants degrade in value to bumblebees and would need re-sowing every few years (Action 18). Leaving arable field margins uncropped with natural regeneration provides benefits, though the value is not consistent year to year and is often based on thistle species considered weeds (Action 20). Planting dedicated floral resources on farmland, particularly phacelia, supports substantial numbers of wild bees with 8 to 35 species recorded foraging (Action 17). Reducing the intensity of farmland meadow management through delayed first cuts and reduced agrochemical use enhances numbers and diversity of wild bees (Action 22). At a landscape scale, the abundance of long-tongued bumblebees on field margins is positively correlated with the number of pollen and nectar agri-environment agreements in the area (Action 362).",

High rates of social parasitism by cuckoo bees were observed in released colonies, with rates of 25-66% in Canada and 79% in the UK, though parasitism was reduced by placing colonies in landscapes with intermediate nectar and pollen availability and releasing them late in the season rather than early (Action 52).
