In the North Atlantic Ocean, setting vessel speed limits during specific periods in key habitats resulted in fewer North Atlantic right whale deaths caused by collisions. Additionally, in the Indian River estuarine system, fewer manatee deaths were recorded after speed limits were set and enforced in all areas. \n\nOther potential interventions identified include diverting shipping routes (action 2754), using observers on board vessels to detect mammals and allow vessel course or speed to be altered (action 2755), using remote tools to detect mammals in an area and allow vessel course or speed to be altered (action 2757), reducing shipping along inland waterways (action 2763), and designating Particularly Sensitive Sea Areas to regulate impactful maritime activities (action 2223). However, no studies were found that evaluated the effects of these alternative approaches on marine mammal populations.\n\nFor additional context, action 3531 found that limiting vessel speeds was effective for reptiles, with vessels travelling at lower speeds causing fewer catastrophic injuries to artificial loggerhead turtle shells and fewer boat-related injuries to spectacled caiman in waterways with enforced speed limits.",

Similarly, action 2222 shows that creating marine protected areas or setting legal protection levels where natural climate refugia occur to promote species persistence and recovery facing climate change has not been evaluated in any studies. Action 2913 indicates that establishing networks of legally protected areas also lacks direct evaluation studies for marine and freshwater mammal populations. However, action 2915 provides some evidence on the effectiveness of legally protecting habitat for marine and freshwater mammals, showing that four studies found varied results: one study in the North Atlantic Ocean found Mediterranean monk seal populations increased during eight years after legal protection, while a North Sea study found bottlenose dolphin populations remained similar in size before and after protection. Additionally, a South Pacific Ocean study found higher survival rates for Hector's dolphins after coastal legal protection, and a Port River estuary study showed reduced human-caused strandings of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins after legal protection was established.",
