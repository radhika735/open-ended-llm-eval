      "relevant_summary": "Evidence on dietary enrichment for captive primates reports that scattering food throughout the enclosure increased feeding and exploratory behaviours in rhesus macaques, reduced abnormal behaviours in chimpanzees, reduced aggression in lemurs, and increased foraging and overall activity in gorillas (1315). Hiding food in containers such as boxes, baskets or tubes—often with browse—raised activity levels and foraging behaviours in lemurs and gibbons (1316). Presenting food in puzzle feeders decreased food sharing and increased foraging, tool use, and time spent feeding, but also increased aggression in some cases and reduced inactivity (1318). Providing live vegetation in planters (e.g., planted rye grass with scattered sunflower seeds) led chimpanzees to spend more time foraging than when given browse and grass added with the normal diet (1327). Offering fresh produce instead of pellet feed increased time spent feeding and reduced inactivity in rhesus macaques (1335). Feeding individuals in social groups led to enrichment tasks being completed faster than when feeding alone, and the presence of groupmates increased consumption of unfamiliar foods during first encounters (1343). When provided with stinging nettles as browse, captive gorillas used processing skills seen in wild gorillas to forage (1332). No studies were found that directly tested providing nectar (including artificial nectar), providing access to food at all times (day and night), or feeding individuals in subgroups (1331; 1340; 1344).",

Varying enclosure temperature to simulate seasonal changes saw one of six females breed after a temperature drop and pond filling in Italy, and a before-and-after study in Australia reported increased breeding success when a pre-breeding cooling period was provided alongside several other measures including playing recorded mating calls [1864].",
