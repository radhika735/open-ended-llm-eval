One replicated, site comparison study in the USA\\u00a0found that the species richness of butterflies on grassland sown under a conservation incentive program was similar to that on native prairie.

The other two studies found that the abundance of butterflies\\u00a0and macro-moths\\u00a0on field margins managed under agri-environment schemes was similar to conventional margins. Three of four replicated studies (including one controlled and three site comparison studies) in the UK\\u00a0and Switzerland\\u00a0found that the abundance of butterflies was higher on farms\\u00a0or in landscapes\\u00a0with a higher proportion of land managed under agri-environment schemes\\u00a0than in areas with less land in agri-environment schemes. The other study found that the abundance of some species was higher, but others were lower, on farms with enhanced agri-environment management compared to simple management. Three studies (including one before-and-after and two replicated, site comparison studies) in Finland\\u00a0and the Czech Republic\\u00a0found that grassland grazed or restored under agri-environment scheme prescriptions had a lower abundance of all but three butterfly and day-flying moth species compared to unmanaged grassland, and that Danube clouded yellow abundance declined after agri-environment scheme mowing was initiated on abandoned grasslands.
