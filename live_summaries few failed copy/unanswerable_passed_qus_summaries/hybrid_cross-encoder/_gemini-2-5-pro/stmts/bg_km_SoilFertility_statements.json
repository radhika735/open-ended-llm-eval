The available information primarily focuses on the effects of crop rotation.\n\nNine studies from Canada and the USA, along with one review, looked at how crop rotation affects pest or pathogen populations in potato farming. The results were mixed: some studies found that crop rotation reduced pest populations and crop diseases (719), while another found that pest populations increased (719). Four other studies found both increases and decreases in pest populations, depending on the rotation crops used and other treatments (719). One study found no effect at all (719).\n\nIn terms of yield, three out of five studies from Canada and the USA found that crop rotation increased crop yield in some years or with certain rotation crops (719). The other two studies found that yield both increased and decreased depending on the rotation crops used (719). One study also found that crop rotation increased profit and that fewer insecticide treatments were needed on rotated plots (719).\n\nWhen it comes to the environment, several studies in Canada and other countries found that including legumes in crop rotations increased the number of microbes and the diversity of different soil animals (857). Including forage crops in rotations was found to reduce rainwater runoff and soil loss in one Canadian trial (857). Crop rotation, especially with legumes, was also found to increase soil organic carbon and soil organic matter in several studies (857). However, one study found that longer crop rotations led to lower soil organic matter levels (857). Additionally, some studies in Europe found less organic matter in soils with crop rotations compared to continuous crops (1368), while a study in Syria found more (1368).\n\nThe effects of crop rotation on soil nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus were inconsistent across various studies (1368). Similarly, the impact on microbial biomass, and greenhouse gas emissions also varied, with some studies showing positive effects, some negative, and some no difference at all (1368). There were also mixed results regarding soil erosion and aggregation (1368). The pH levels in soils with or without crop rotations were found to be similar in two studies (1368).",
