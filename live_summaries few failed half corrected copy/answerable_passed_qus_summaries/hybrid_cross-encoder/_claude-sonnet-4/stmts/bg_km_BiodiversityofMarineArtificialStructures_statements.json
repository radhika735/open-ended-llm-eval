Creating structural habitat features shows promise, with long flexible habitats (>50 mm) supporting fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without flexible habitats and having mixed effects on fish abundance depending on species and fish presence when created (3451). Small adjoining cavities or 'swimthrough' habitats (≤100 mm) supported six fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without swimthroughs and had mixed effects on juvenile fish community composition and abundance depending on site and survey conditions (3436). Large adjoining cavities or 'swimthrough' habitats (>100 mm) supported fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without swimthroughs, increased overall fish species richness and abundance, though individual species responses varied (3456). \n\nCreating hole habitats (>50 mm) combined with other features like grooves and pits supported fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without added habitat features, though effects on fish abundance were mixed depending on species group (3434). Similarly, groove habitats (1-50 mm) when combined with holes, pits and environmentally-sensitive material supported fish species that were absent from similar structures without added habitat features, but had mixed effects on fish abundances depending on species group (3448).\n\nManagement approaches also show benefits, with harvesting restrictions supporting fish species that were absent from unrestricted structures and higher fish species richness, though effects on total fish abundance were mixed (3457). Reducing maintenance activities can increase seahorse abundance on structure surfaces (3447). Using environmentally-sensitive materials such as ECOncrete™ combined with habitat features supported fish species that were absent from standard-concrete or fibreglass structure surfaces, though effects on fish abundances were mixed depending on species group (3470).

Surface texture features significantly affect outcomes - transplanting oysters onto surfaces with grooves and small ridges (1-50 mm) shows mixed effects on species richness and diversity depending on the presence and size of these features and the site (action 3472). Studies in southeast Australia found that oyster survival was higher when transplanted into grooves compared with on ridges, while survival in grooves and on ledges varied depending on the site (action 3472). The presence of hole habitats (>50 mm) on structures, along with grooves and small ridges, supported macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate species that were absent from structure surfaces without added habitat features, and increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species diversity and richness on structure surfaces (action 3467). Material composition affects colonization success - environmentally-sensitive materials like hemp-concrete or reduced-pH-concrete can alter community composition and support species absent from standard-concrete surfaces (action 3469). Shore level positioning influences transplant success, with studies showing that survival and abundance effects vary depending on the intertidal zone where oysters are placed (action 3472). Site-specific conditions create variable outcomes, as multiple studies found that transplantation effects depend on the particular location within Australian estuaries (actions 3472, 3474). The effectiveness for enhancing wider biodiversity shows mixed results - while transplanted oysters supported additional macroalgae, mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate and fish species that were absent from surfaces without oysters, the actual increases in species richness and diversity varied depending on site and structural features (action 3472).",

Long flexible habitats (>50 mm) supported macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate or fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without flexible habitats, and altered non-mobile invertebrate community composition (Action 3451). Hole habitats (>50 mm) altered combined macroalgae and invertebrate or mobile invertebrate and fish community composition when combined with other features like grooves and pits, and supported species that were absent from surfaces without added habitat features (Action 3434). Groove habitats (1-50 mm) altered combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition and supported macroalgae, non-mobile invertebrate and fish species that were absent from structures without added habitat features (Action 3448). Pit habitats (1-50 mm) altered combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition and supported mobile and non-mobile invertebrate and fish species that were absent from structures without the added habitat features (Action 3455). Grooves and small protrusions/ridges/ledges (1-50 mm) altered combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition and supported non-mobile invertebrate species that were absent from structure surfaces without added habitat features (Action 3452). Short flexible habitats (1-50 mm) had mixed effects on mobile and/or non-mobile invertebrate community composition but did alter non-mobile invertebrate community composition in one study (Action 3450). Small adjoining cavities or 'swimthrough' habitats (≤100 mm) had mixed effects on juvenile fish community composition but supported six species that were absent from structure surfaces without swimthroughs (Action 3436). Textured surfaces (≤1 mm) showed mixed results, with two of three studies finding altered combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition (Action 3449).",
