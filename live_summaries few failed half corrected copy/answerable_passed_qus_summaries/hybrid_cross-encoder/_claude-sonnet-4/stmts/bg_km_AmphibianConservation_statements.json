Closing roads during seasonal amphibian migration has been found effective, with two studies in Germany showing that large numbers of amphibians were protected from death during breeding migrations at road closure sites and at road closure sites with assisted crossings and barrier fences (Action 842). Installing barrier fencing along roads is another effective measure, with seven of eight studies in Germany, Canada and the USA finding that barrier fencing with culverts decreased amphibian road deaths, provided that the fence length and material were effective. However, barriers must be at least 0.6 m high to prevent some species from climbing over (Action 756). Installing culverts or tunnels as road crossings has shown significant success, with six of seven studies in Canada, Germany, Italy, Hungary and the USA finding that installing culverts or tunnels significantly decreased amphibian road deaths, though this was most effective when barrier fencing was also installed. Fifteen of 24 studies found that culverts/tunnels were used by amphibians, with usage rates of 15-85% of amphibians or 3-15 species (Action 884). Restoring habitat connectivity can also be effective, as demonstrated by one study in Italy where raising a road on a viaduct to restore connectivity between two wetlands significantly decreased deaths of migrating amphibians (Action 840). Warning signage for motorists has been tested but showed limited effectiveness, with one study in the UK finding that despite warning signs and human assistance, over 500 toads were still killed on some roads (Action 841).",

Fish removal by catching has moderate evidence of effectiveness: four studies in the USA found that removing fish by catching significantly increased abundance of salamanders or frogs and increased recruitment, survival and population growth rate of cascades frog (Action 827). However, one before-and-after study in the UK found that fish control had no significant effect on great crested newt populations and fish remained or returned within a few years, while one replicated study in Sweden found fish control did not increase green toad breeding success and fish were soon reintroduced (Action 827). Fish removal using rotenone shows stronger evidence: three studies in Sweden, the UK and USA found that eliminating fish using rotenone increased numbers of amphibian species, abundance and recruitment or newt populations, and one review found that fish control including rotenone increased breeding success for four amphibian species (Action 828). However, two studies found that when rotenone was applied, many frogs died and some newts showed negative effects (Action 828). Invasive amphibian removal shows positive evidence: one study in the USA found that removing American bullfrogs significantly increased California red-legged frog populations and increased their range with leopard frogs (Action 825), and one study found that removing invasive Cuban tree frogs increased abundance of squirrel tree frogs and green tree frogs (Action 822). Mammalian predator control has limited evidence: one study in New Zealand found that controlling rats had no significant effect on Hochstetter's frog numbers, though predator-proof enclosures showed higher survival rates for other frog species (Action 839). There is no evidence found for the effectiveness of removing non-native crayfish (Action 797), and excluding fish with barriers has only one study in Mexico showing increased axolotl weight gain (Action 829).",

Five studies in the USA found mixed effects on amphibian abundance depending on species and time since harvest. Two found mixed effects of thinning on abundance, one found that amphibian abundance increased except for ensatina salamanders, one found a negative overall response, and one found that thinning did not affect abundance. A meta-analysis of 24 studies in North America found that partial harvest including thinning decreased salamander populations. When compared to clearcutting, four studies found that two showed higher amphibian abundance in thinned forest, and two found mixed effects on abundance depending on species, life stage and time since harvest. The meta-analysis found that partial harvest resulted in smaller reductions in salamander populations than clearcutting (Action 852).\n\nShelterwood harvesting represents a third alternative. Three studies in the USA found that compared to clearcutting, shelterwood harvesting resulted in higher, similar or initially higher and then similar salamander abundance. The same meta-analysis found that partial harvest including shelterwood harvesting resulted in smaller reductions in salamander populations than clearcutting. However, two of three studies found that compared to no harvesting, shelterwood harvesting decreased salamander abundance and changed species composition (Action 851).\n\nOne study found that high volumes of pre-existing downed wood prevented declines in amphibian populations following thinning (Action 852).",

Length is important, with long culverts avoided according to one of two studies (Action 884). Lighting affects tunnel use in all three studies that examined it, though with mixed effects (Action 884). Substrate choice is crucial, with natural substrates used more than artificial ones according to three of six studies (Action 884). The presence of water in tunnels shows mixed effects, with two of three studies finding varied results (Action 884). Entrance location affects use according to one study, and tunnel climate affects use according to one study (Action 884). The majority of successful culverts/tunnels had barrier fencing to guide amphibians to entrances, and this fencing needs to be at least 0.6 m high to prevent frogs from climbing over, though some species like treefrogs and 10% of common toads can still climb over barrier fencing during breeding migrations (Actions 884, 756). Certain designs should be avoided - one-way tunnels with vertical entry chutes resulted in high mortality of common toads, and condensation deposits from steel culverts had very high metal concentrations (Action 884). Culverts with flowing water can be used by amphibians, though results vary by species, with some salamanders rarely using them while others use them the same amount as dry culverts (Action 884). Installing ledges in culverts can increase use - under-road culverts with ledges were used more than culverts without ledges by mammal species, and ledges with access ramps were used more often than those without (Action 2523).",
