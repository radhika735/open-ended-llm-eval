Natural control agents include using cleaner wrasse, with studies showing that corkwing and goldskinny cleaner wrasse were as effective at controlling lice infestation as chemical treatments, though rockcook cleaner wrasse were ineffective at preventing lice outbreaks (Action ID: 738). Environmental modifications include altering lighting, with studies showing lower numbers of lice on salmon kept in low intensity artificial light or natural lighting compared to intense artificial light (Action ID: 741), and altering cage size, with larger cages recording lower levels of amoebic gill disease compared to smaller cages (Action ID: 742). Nutritional and biological interventions include using probiotics and immunostimulants, which reduced the number of salmon infected with lice by 28% when fed a diet composed of fish meal and 28% plant-based protein, with beta-glucans decreasing lice infection levels by a further 28% (Action ID: 732). Vaccination provides higher survival rates post exposure to disease-causing bacteria including Aeromonas salmonicida, Yersinia ruckeri, marine flexibacteriosis, bacterial kidney disease, and infectious salmon anaemia (Action ID: 733). Breeding for resistance traits shows increased survival levels in salmon exposed to infectious pancreatic necrosis when families are bred for high disease resistance (Action ID: 735). Management practices include establishing fallowing systems, which recorded lower lice numbers on Atlantic salmon in cages, though showed no difference in mortality from Amoebic Gill Disease (Action ID: 1026). Freshwater bathing provides mixed results for reducing amoebic gill disease, with one study showing reduction in amoebae numbers for up to 10 days, while another found similar levels in treated and untreated salmon (Action ID: 739).

Action 924 reports that Norwegian studies found both decreased growth rates and similar growth rates in salmon fed plant-based protein diets, with some studies showing reduced final body weights while others found similar final body weights compared to fish meal diets. Feeding efficiency results were variable, with Norwegian studies finding both lowered and increased levels of feeding efficiency in salmon fed plant-based protein diets. Digestibility of plant proteins was found to be lower in some Norwegian studies, though similar levels of digestibility were identified in other Norwegian randomised, replicated, controlled studies. Plant-based protein diets altered the morphology of the distal intestine in salmon.\n\nIn contrast, vegetable oils show more consistent results. Action 926 indicates that Norwegian studies found growth rates were generally similar between salmon fed diets containing fish oil versus vegetable oil, with one Norwegian study actually finding higher growth rates in fish fed vegetable oil diets. Two Norwegian studies found similar average final body weights between salmon fed both fish oil and vegetable oil diets. However, the fatty acid profile of salmon flesh reflected the oil source within diets according to Norwegian and Scottish studies. One Norwegian study found that salmon fed vegetable oil diets had high liver lipid and low plasma lipoprotein compared to fish oil diets. Norwegian studies also found that fresh, frozen and smoked salmon flesh from fish fed vegetable oil- and fish oil-based diets had similar levels of gaping, texture and liquid holding capacity, though pigment concentration was lower in vegetable oil diets. Oil source did not affect salmon broodstock fecundity levels, egg weights, fertility rates, or the weights and development of resultant fry in Norwegian studies.",
