A study in France found a significant reduction in the number of recorded adults and juveniles following the removal of juveniles by trapping when carried out as part of a combination treatment (action 1046). For adult removal, one study found that bullfrog adults can be captured overnight in a single trap floating on the water surface (action 1045), though catchability of adult bullfrogs in small shallow ponds using one double fyke net for 24 hours was found to be very low (action 1045). However, bullfrog populations rapidly rebounded following intensive removal of adults (action 1045). A study in France found a significant reduction in the number of recorded adults and juveniles following the shooting of metamorphosed individuals before reproduction when carried out as part of a combination treatment (action 1045). Biological control using native predators showed promise, with the introduction of northern pike leading to a strong decline in bullfrog tadpole numbers (action 1039). Chemical methods have also been tested, with caffeine (10% solution), chloroxylenol (5% solution), and a combined treatment of Permethrin (4.6% solution) and Rotenone (1% solution) found to kill American bullfrogs (action 1048). Studies show that removing bullfrogs can benefit native species, with removal significantly increasing California red-legged frog populations and increasing leopard frog range (action 825).

Manual removal was effective for small outbreaks of small-growing skunk cabbage plants (Action 1101). However, for larger, more established populations, after four years of twice yearly full removal, a large number of plants still needed to be removed each year (Action 1101).\n\n**Location and habitat**: For water primrose, hand-pulling from pond margins successfully eradicated a smaller population, while hand pulling and raking in other locations failed to reduce abundance (Action 1138).\n\n**Growth rate versus removal rate**: Physical removal success is limited when plant growth rate exceeds removal rate, as demonstrated with floating pennywort where the rate of growth exceeded the rate of removal following a two-week removal program (Action 1126).\n\n**Combination approaches**: Enhanced success was achieved when physical removal was combined with other methods. For water primrose, combining glyphosate and surface active agent application with mechanical removal achieved a 75% kill rate (Action 1140). A combination of herbicide application, physical removal, and promotion of native plants with mulching reduced Peruvian primrose-willow coverage by 85-90% (Action 1140).\n\n**Persistence and frequency of removal**: Long-term, repeated removal efforts are necessary, as shown by the requirement for monthly hand picking combined with mechanical removal for floating pennywort (Action 1126), and twice yearly removal programs for skunk cabbage spanning multiple years (Action 1101).",

For Procambarus crayfish control, no evidence was captured on the effect of draining the waterway as a control tool (action 1034). Similarly, no evidence was captured for the use of dewatering as a management tool for Asian clams (action 1110). The lack of evidence extends to other invasive aquatic species as well, with no evidence found for use of draining invaded waterbodies to reduce population sizes of invasive bullheads (action 1078), invasive gobies (action 1065), or red-eared terrapins (action 1057). No evidence was found for the effects of draining waterbodies on Crassula helmsii plants (action 1303). The only documented evidence for dewatering effects was found for Ponto-Caspian gammarids, where a replicated, controlled laboratory study from Poland found that lowering water levels in sand killed three species of invasive freshwater shrimp, although one species required water content levels of 4% and below before it was killed (action 1094).",

Removal of juveniles by trapping, when carried out as part of a combination treatment, resulted in a significant reduction in the number of recorded adults and juveniles (Action 1046). Direct removal of adults can be accomplished through several methods: double fyke nets have very low catchability in small shallow ponds for 24 hours, while floating traps on the water surface can capture adults overnight (Action 1045). However, bullfrog populations rapidly rebound following intensive removal of adults alone (Action 1045). Shooting of metamorphosed individuals before reproduction, when carried out as part of a combination treatment, resulted in a significant reduction in recorded adults and juveniles (Action 1045). General removal or control of invasive bullfrogs has been shown to significantly increase California red-legged frog populations, increase leopard frog range, and cause California red-legged frogs to be found out in the open twice as frequently (Action 825). Collection of egg clutches using bilge pumps or nets has been referenced in studies, though no direct evidence of effectiveness was captured (Action 1047).

Direct removal methods include removal of adults and juveniles, with different approaches and success rates. For adult removal, double fyke nets used for 24 hours in small shallow ponds showed very low catchability (action 1045). However, adult bullfrogs can be captured overnight using single traps floating on the water surface (action 1045). Shooting of metamorphosed individuals before reproduction has been used as part of combination treatments and resulted in significant reductions in recorded adults and juveniles (action 1045). Adult bullfrog populations rapidly rebounded following intensive removal, indicating limited long-term effectiveness of adult-only removal (action 1045). For juvenile removal, double fyke nets were effective in catching bullfrog tadpoles in small shallow ponds (action 1046). Removal of juveniles by trapping, when carried out as part of a combination treatment, resulted in significant reduction in the number of recorded adults and juveniles (action 1046). Chemical control using biocides has been tested, with studies finding that several chemicals killed American bullfrogs, including caffeine (10% solution), chloroxylenol (5% solution), and a combined treatment of Permethrin (4.6% solution) and Rotenone (1% solution) (action 1048). Removal or control of invasive bullfrogs has been shown to benefit native amphibian populations, with studies finding significant increases in California red-legged frog populations and increased range of leopard frogs following bullfrog eradication (action 825). No evidence was found for the effectiveness of habitat modification or draining ponds and altering water timing as control methods (actions 1041, 1042).",

For water primrose, a controlled field study in China found that a flea beetle was specific to prostrate water primrose and Indian toothcup and caused heavy feeding destruction when added to field cages (Action 1135).

In contrast to the floating pennywort weevil study, a field study in the USA found that introduction of flea beetles to a pond significantly reduced the abundance of large-flower primrose-willow (Action 1135). For parrot's feather (another aquatic invasive), effectiveness varied by location and study type - laboratory studies in Portugal found grass carp did not reduce biomass or cover, while field studies in Argentina and the USA found that stocking with grass carp reduced biomass or abundance (Action 1599). The type of biological control agent also matters, as demonstrated by a field study in South Africa that reported reduced growth of parrot's feather following release of a South American leaf-feeding Lysathia (Action 1599).
