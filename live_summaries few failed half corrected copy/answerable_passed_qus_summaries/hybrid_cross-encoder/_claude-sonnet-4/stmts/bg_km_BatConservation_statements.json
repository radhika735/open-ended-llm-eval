Regarding disease symptoms, the Canadian study found that little brown bats treated with a probiotic bacterium at the time of infection had reduced symptoms of the disease, but bats treated 21 days prior to infection had worse symptoms, while the USA study found that little brown bats kept within cages in a mine and treated with a probiotic bacterium had a similar severity of white-nose syndrome to untreated bats (Action 2008). For all other potential strategies, no studies were found that evaluated their effectiveness, including: culling infected bats (Action 1012), vaccination against the pathogen (Action 1011), captive breeding to supplement affected populations (Action 2009), treating hibernacula environments to reduce pathogen reservoir (Action 2007), decontaminating clothing and equipment (Action 2006), and restricting human access to caves (Action 1010).",

Microclimate management is a key factor - one before-and-after study in Spain found more bats in two artificial roosts within buildings after they had been modified to reduce internal roost temperatures (Action 2052). However, temperature management shows mixed results, as one replicated, before-and-after study in the UK found that heated bat boxes were used by common pipistrelle bats at only one of seven sites, but none were used by maternity colonies (Action 2052). Site location appears important - one review in the USA found that spaces created in road bridges for roosting bats to replace those lost during bridge works were recolonized by bats in similar or greater numbers to the original roosts at four of eight sites (Action 1967). Artificial hibernacula show promise, with one study in the UK finding that the number of bats using an artificial hibernaculum increased in each of nine years after it was built, and multiple studies in Germany and the UK found that artificial hibernacula were used by up to four bat species (Action 2049). Success rates for bat boxes and alternative roosts vary significantly - three studies found that bat boxes or bat lofts/barns were used by bats at 13-74% of development sites, and three of five before-and-after studies found that bat colonies used purpose-built roosts in higher or similar numbers after the original roosts were destroyed, while two other studies found that bats used purpose-built roosts in lower numbers than the original roost (Action 949). One review in the UK found that new bat boxes/lofts built to replace destroyed roosts were four times less likely to be used by returning bats than roosts retained during development (Action 949).",

Regarding design factors, bat box color significantly affects usage, with bats using black bat boxes more than grey, white or wooden boxes (action 1024). Box size matters, as one of two studies found higher occupancy rates in larger bat boxes (action 1024). Material choice influences occupancy timing, with resin bat boxes becoming occupied more quickly than wood boxes, though both materials are used by bats (action 1024). Concrete bat boxes showed higher occupancy rates than wooden ones (action 1024). Design complexity also affects usage, with bat boxes having two compartments being occupied by more bats than single compartment boxes during breeding season, and standard and four/five chamber bat boxes being occupied by breeding colonies while flat bat boxes were used by individuals (action 1024). For placement factors, orientation and sunlight exposure affect bat occupancy according to three studies, though one study found orientation had no significant effect (action 1024). Height influences occupancy according to two studies, while two other studies found no effect of height (action 1024). Location type is important, with higher occupancy rates found for bat boxes placed on buildings compared to trees (action 1024). Habitat context affects success, with higher occupancy in farm forestry sites than native forest, higher occupancy in pine relative to mixed deciduous stands, and higher occupancy in forest fragments than in pasture (action 1024). Prior bat presence increases success rates, with higher occupancy in areas where bats were known to roost before box installation (action 1024). Installation strategy matters, as bat boxes are more likely to be occupied when a greater number are installed across a site (action 1024). Occupancy rates vary considerably, with 22 studies finding bats occupying less than half of provided bat boxes (0-49%) while nine studies found bats occupying more than half (54-100%) (action 1024).",

Five studies evaluated the effects of creating artificial water sources for bats, conducted in the USA, Germany, South Africa, Israel and Mexico (Action 959). These studies found that bat activity (relative abundance) was similar or higher over reservoirs and waste water treatment pools, heliponds and drainage ditches, retention ponds and farm/cattle ponds compared to over natural wetlands, nearby vineyards, surrounding forest or grassland/crops, trees and orchards (Action 959). One study in South Africa found a similar number of bat species over farm ponds and in grassland/crops, trees, vineyards or orchards (Action 959). Additionally, managing livestock water troughs as drinking resources shows promise, with two studies in the USA demonstrating that removing livestock modifications from water troughs resulted in bats drinking from them more frequently, and that larger, full water tanks surrounded by sparse vegetation had more bats drinking from them than smaller, half full tanks surrounded by no or dense vegetation (Action 1951). Small dams can also provide effective habitat, with one study in Portugal finding that reservoirs created using small dams had greater activity of four bat species than the streams feeding into them (Action 1997). Wetland restoration showed positive results in one USA study, where restoring wetlands increased overall bat activity and restored wetlands had similar bat activity to undisturbed wetlands (Action 2036). However, no studies were found that specifically evaluated managing natural water bodies in arid areas to prevent desiccation for bat populations (Action 2027).",

Agricultural landscapes with smaller fields had higher activity of six of seven bat species compared to landscapes with larger fields (Action 1939). \n\nHedge management also shows benefits, with hedges trimmed three or more years prior having more bat species and higher activity of two of eight bat species compared to recently trimmed hedges (Action 1943).
