Incorporating allelopathic plant residues sometimes reduced weeds but effects varied by timing, species and residue type; weed suppression often lasted only days to weeks; crop growth could be inhibited depending on timing; and yield responses ranged from positive to negative or mixed across studies (ID 728).",

Applying herbicide to trees increased plant diversity and the abundance of common heather seedlings but did not increase shrub cover (1629). No studies were found evaluating prescribed burning to mimic the natural fire cycle, cutting strips of vegetation to reduce the spread of fire, or using prescribed burning to reduce the potential for large wildfires in shrublands (1622; 1624; 1623).",
