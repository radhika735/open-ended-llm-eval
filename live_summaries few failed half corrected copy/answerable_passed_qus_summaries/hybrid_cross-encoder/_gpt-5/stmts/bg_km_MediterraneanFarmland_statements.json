Growing cover crops in arable fields increased microbial biomass in several replicated, randomized, controlled studies (mostly USA), with one Italian before-and-after study reporting inconsistent effects; studies also found more bacteria and fungi in Spain and more mycorrhizal spores/species in Italy under cover crops [1345]. A replicated, randomized, controlled trial in Italy reported that applying a high rate of compost increased microbial biomass [889].
