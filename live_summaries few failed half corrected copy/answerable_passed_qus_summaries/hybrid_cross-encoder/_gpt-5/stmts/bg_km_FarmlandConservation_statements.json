Seed-eating birds were more abundant on uncut and ungrazed plots than on uncut and grazed plots (224). A replicated, controlled, randomized UK study found no difference in ground beetle abundance and diversity between cut and uncut headlands in the first two years, but higher species diversity in uncut plots in the third year; no studies were found assessing effects on mammals (132, 2400). Raising mowing/cutting height: A replicated, controlled study and a review from the UK found raised mowing heights benefited Eurasian skylark, including increased productivity, and a review reported raised cutting heights were less damaging to amphibians and invertebrates (138). However, a randomized, replicated, controlled UK trial found no effect of raised mowing height on numbers of foraging birds or invertebrates, and one replicated controlled study found no difference in invertebrate abundance (138). A UK review found raised mowing height may have increased skylark productivity but not enough to maintain the local population (222). On intensively managed UK grassland, plots cut to 10 cm had similar butterfly species richness and abundance to plots cut to 5 cm (3968).",

Additional syntheses report that some species occur at higher densities or use set‑aside more than other habitats while some occur at lower densities; species richness was often higher on set‑aside than crops; waders and skylarks had higher productivity in three of four studies, though one found lower skylark productivity on set‑aside; naturally regenerated set‑aside tended to hold more birds and species than sown set‑aside; evidence on rotational vs non‑rotational set‑aside was mixed (175). For mammals, set‑aside did not increase small mammal or brown hare numbers relative to cropland or other non‑crop habitats, though wood mice used uncut set‑aside more after harvest (2377). For butterflies and moths, several studies found higher species richness and, in some cases, higher abundance on sown or naturally regenerating set‑aside versus cereal fields—especially with less competitive grasses—though other studies found similar richness or abundance to arable, pasture, or uncultivated habitats (3980). Conversion/reversion of arable to permanent grassland: Syntheses of multiple replicated studies found no clear benefits to birds, with one controlled before‑and‑after UK study reporting significant declines in grey partridge after reversion (561; 210). For butterflies and moths, 10 studies show restored grasslands can develop communities increasingly similar to high‑quality grasslands over the first decade; species richness was often higher than on conventional grassland or cultivated farms; abundance was sometimes higher than on conventional grassland or crop fields, though not always increasing with time since restoration; sowing with diverse mixes or with forbs/perennial mixes often increased richness or abundance compared with grass‑only mixes; some taxa increased while others decreased following schemes including grassland reversion (3929).",

For mammals specifically, no studies were found evaluating the effects of managing hedgerows on farmland [2382]. For butterflies and moths under hedgerow management, 17 studies (mostly UK) showed that more structurally complex or tree-containing hedgerows and certain cutting regimes were associated with higher species richness/diversity and, in multiple cases, higher abundance of butterflies, moths, caterpillars, pupae, and brown hairstreak eggs, though several studies found similar richness or abundance under agri-environment or conventional management and some reported lower caterpillar abundance in managed versus remnant hedgerows [3975]. For planting new hedges, seven studies (UK, Ireland, Canada) on butterflies and moths found that established hedgerows often had higher species richness and abundance than beetle banks, crops, pasture, grass margins or field interiors, with one study reporting similar richness to grass banks and one behavior study showing moths tended to fly parallel to hedgerows [3976]. For bats, two UK studies on hedgerow management found more bat species and higher activity for some species along hedges trimmed ≥3 years prior compared to those trimmed the previous winter, while pipistrelle activity did not differ between hedges managed for wildlife on agri-environment scheme farms and conventional farms; no studies were found on planting new hedges for bats [1943, 1942]. For mammals under planting or maintaining hedgerows, three studies (UK, Switzerland) reported that retaining/enhancing hedgerows with other boundary features was associated with higher brown hare density in arable but not grassland sites, Irish hare numbers did not increase, and establishing hedgerows alongside arable land increased small mammal abundance [2383].",

For bees, one UK study reported AES prescriptions had local but not landscape-scale effects on bee numbers, and two UK landscape-scale trials found bumblebee populations were not enhanced on farmland with AES compared to without [700, 24]. For butterflies and moths, farms managed under AES (including options such as uncropped cultivated margins and wild bird seed plots) sometimes had higher abundance of butterflies and micro-moths than conventionally managed farms, yet comparisons of farms with larger versus smaller areas of in-field AES options often showed similar butterfly richness or abundance; wider field margins increased butterfly richness or abundance in some years [3923, 3930, 3926]. For bats, replicated paired-site studies in the UK found overall bat activity or occurrence often did not differ between AES and conventional farms, and in some cases was lower on AES farms; hedges trimmed ≥3 years prior had more bat species recorded and higher activity for some species than hedges trimmed the previous winter [962, 1943].

Reducing management intensity on permanent grasslands: Across studies including three in the UK, several comparisons found higher species richness or abundance of butterflies and moths on less intensively managed grasslands than on conventionally managed sites; specifically in the UK, a before-and-after study reported that after reducing grazing and stopping chemical applications, large moth species richness and total abundance increased, with increases in five of 23 butterfly species and decreases in two species [3958]. Broader multi-taxa evidence (including UK studies) reported that reduced management intensity benefited invertebrates in many studies, but other studies found mixed or no effects, and some found more invertebrates under intensive management; invertebrate communities on less intensively managed grasslands were distinct from those on intensively managed grasslands [69].",

Delaying mowing or first grazing dates increased breeding wading bird densities in studies that included the Netherlands, alongside other taxa benefits (ID: 131). Direct per‑clutch payments on Dutch farms showed limited evidence for population increases (no population effect in one study; slightly higher breeding densities but not higher overall numbers in another), yet were associated with higher hatching success of lapwing and black‑tailed godwit; combined with postponed agricultural activities, more birds bred on 12.5 ha plots compared to controls (ID: 146).
