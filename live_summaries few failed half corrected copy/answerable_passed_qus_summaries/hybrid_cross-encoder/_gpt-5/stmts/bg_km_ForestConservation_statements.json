In freshwater swamps dominated by invasive canarygrass, adding prescribed fire after herbicide increased overall diversity relative to herbicide alone, though species richness and native richness did not increase, and tree seedling density was unaffected (ID: 3118). In the same system, mowing before herbicide did not change overall richness or diversity compared to herbicide alone, but multi-action management (cutting/disking/herbicide) increased non-planted tree seedlings versus no management and maintained non-canarygrass herb cover (ID: 3106). Physical disturbance after herbicide (ploughing/disking) increased overall richness and diversity relative to herbicide alone, with mixed effects on tree seedlings and at least maintained non-target herb cover, while affecting abundances of some non-target species (ID: 3097). Cutting invading mangrove trees in salt marshes increased total cover of marsh vegetation when more than half of trees were removed, with greater shifts in plant community composition after two years of continual removal (ID: 3109). Herbicide use against bracken showed mixed vegetation responses across UK heathland studies: increases in heather seedlings or biomass in some trials, no increase in heather cover in others; species richness responses were inconsistent; bracken biomass/cover was often reduced, though one study found no change, and some non-target species (e.g., wavy hair‑grass, sheep’s fescue) increased (ID: 1652). Combined herbicide application and weeding to control non-native grasses reduced non-native grass cover and increased native grass and forb cover, without increasing native species richness, in a replicated field trial (ID: 1645).",
