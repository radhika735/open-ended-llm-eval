Sowing grass seeds increased the abundance of sown species in one replicated, controlled study in South Africa [3397]. Sowing seeds in spring (start of the growing season) increased cover of sown grass and forb species compared to autumn sowing in a replicated, randomized, paired, controlled UK study [3407]. Applying herbicide before sowing increased cover of sown grass species in a replicated, randomized, controlled USA study [3418]. Grazing management after sowing increased the cover of four of eight sown species under continuous sheep grazing compared to rotational grazing in New Zealand [3423]. Using locally sourced seed increased the abundance of one of four sown characteristic species in a replicated, randomized, paired, controlled German study, and increasing the number of species in the local seed mix increased cover of target plant species in Germany [3400]. Sowing seeds in part of a site led to the appearance of new patches of two of three sown species in previously unsown areas in a USA study [3408]. Sowing at higher seed density increased the cover of a sown species (thickspike wheatgrass) in Canada, though one replicated study in the USA reported no change in overall sown-species cover [3405].",

Sowing grass seeds increased the abundance of sown species in one replicated, controlled study in South Africa [3397]. Sowing seeds in spring (start of the growing season) increased cover of sown grass and forb species compared to autumn sowing in a replicated, randomized, paired, controlled UK study [3407]. Applying herbicide before sowing increased cover of sown grass species in a replicated, randomized, controlled USA study [3418]. Grazing management after sowing increased the cover of four of eight sown species under continuous sheep grazing compared to rotational grazing in New Zealand [3423]. Using locally sourced seed increased the abundance of one of four sown characteristic species in a replicated, randomized, paired, controlled German study, and increasing the number of species in the local seed mix increased cover of target plant species in Germany [3400].
