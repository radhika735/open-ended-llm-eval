      "relevant_summary": "Uncropped field margins can be managed in several ways to support bumblebees on European farmland. Sowing margins with an agricultural nectar and pollen mix has been shown to attract more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated, grassy, or cropped margins [18]. In the first year, a mix of agricultural forage plants, including legumes, can attract a higher number of bumblebees than a perennial wildflower mix [18]. However, these margins may need to be re-sown every few years as their value to bumblebees degrades over time [18]. Sowing margins with a native wildflower seed mix also supports a higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees compared to cropped, grassy, or naturally regenerated margins [19]. Perennial leguminous herbs within these seed mixes are particularly important for long-tongued bumblebee species [19]. Leaving field margins to regenerate naturally can result in more bumblebees than cropped margins, but the value of this approach is not consistent from year to year and is dependent on thistle species, which are often considered weeds [20]. There is no evidence on the effects of these management practices on solitary bees [18, 19, 20].",

Eleven replicated trials of bumblebee nest boxes have shown that several different types of nest box are acceptable to bumblebees, including wooden or brick and tile boxes at the ground surface, underground tin, wooden or terracotta boxes and boxes attached to trees (48).

The location of nest boxes is important, and they should be placed within the foraging range of the bees, which for some European species is between 150 to 600 meters from resources (47, 80). The design and material of the nest site also play a significant role. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in cut hollow stems, tubes, or blocks of wood with drilled holes (47). In terms of productivity, one trial found that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees than other designs, while plastic-lined holes or tubes were less productive due to issues with parasitism and mould (47). Another small trial noted that cardboard straws within drilled wooden holes were more productive for a specific bee species than grooved wooden boards (47). A study in Poland also found that reed stems or wood resulted in the highest production for red mason bees (80).\n\nThe presence of parasites, predators, and mould can negatively impact productivity, with studies recording mortality rates ranging from 13% to 56% (47). One trial specifically showed that excluding ants from nesting sites increased the production of offspring (46). Additionally, introduced species, such as European earwigs and certain leafcutter bees, may occupy the nest boxes, in some cases more commonly than native bees (47).\n\nDespite these challenges, repeated provision of nest boxes at a site can lead to an increase in the number of occupied nests over time, with some studies showing numbers doubling over three years (47, 80). One trial found that the estimated number of foraging bees increased in fields with nest boxes compared to those without (47). While many trials have shown successful occupation, one trial in a temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using the provided nest boxes (47), and another small trial in the UK found that soil-filled nest boxes were not occupied by the target mining bee species (47). Occupancy rates, when reported, have been noted to be between 1% and 26% of the available cavities (80).",
