Two studies in Germany found that closing roads during seasonal amphibian migration protected large numbers of amphibians from death [842]. Six out of seven studies in several countries, including Canada, Germany, and the USA, showed that installing culverts or tunnels significantly reduced amphibian road deaths [884]. However, one study found that this was only effective when barrier fencing was also installed [884]. The use of these crossings by amphibians is supported by 15 of 24 studies, which found that 23-100% of culverts or tunnels were used by amphibians [884]. The effectiveness and use of these crossings can be influenced by their design, including diameter, length, lighting, and substrate [884]. Some culvert designs, such as those with one-way tunnels and vertical entry chutes, were found to be unsuitable and resulted in high mortality rates [884]. One study also noted that despite the installation of culverts, thousands of amphibians were still killed on the road [884]. Human assistance for migrating amphibians has also been studied. Despite efforts to move large numbers of amphibians across roads, two studies in Italy and the UK observed population declines of 64-70% over 6-10 years in toad populations that were being assisted [784]. In the UK, one study found that over 500 toads were still killed on roads at 7% of sites with human assistance patrols [784].",

Studies found that captive-bred green and golden bell frogs, released mainly as tadpoles, either did not establish breeding populations or only established them in one out of four release programs (872). Some captive-bred green and golden bell frogs released as tadpoles were found to have survived for at least 13 months after release (872). Other studies in Australia showed that a high proportion of captive-bred frogs released as eggs survived to metamorphosis, and there was limited breeding by released frogs (870).

This was the case at sites with only road closures and at sites that also had assisted crossings and barrier fences (842). Seven of eight studies found that installing barrier fencing along with culverts decreased amphibian road deaths (756). The effectiveness of these barriers can be dependent on the length and material of the fence (756). Some amphibians, such as treefrogs and 10% of common toads, were found to be able to climb over barrier fencing (756). For green frogs and leopard frogs, barriers of at least 0.6 m high were required to prevent them from climbing over (756). One study found that only a low number of amphibians were diverted by barriers (756). In six of seven studies, the installation of culverts or tunnels as road crossings was found to significantly decrease amphibian road deaths, although one of these studies noted this was only true when barrier fencing was also installed (884). One study found no effect on road deaths from installing culverts or tunnels (884). Fifteen of twenty-four studies found that culverts and tunnels were used by amphibians, however, five studies found that they were used by less than 10% of amphibians or not used at all (884). The use of culverts and tunnels by amphibians can be affected by their diameter, length, lighting, and substrate (884). Some culvert designs were found to be unsuitable for amphibians, and one study highlighted that thousands of amphibians were still killed on the road where tunnels were installed (884).",
