Clearing or opening patches in forests generally increases butterfly species richness and abundance but can decrease moth species richness (Action ID 3938). Studies found higher butterfly abundance and species richness in cleared patches compared to unmanaged forest, with 19 out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern benefiting from small forest clearings. However, wider woodland rides had lower moth abundance than standard width rides or mature forest.\n\nCoppicing woodland typically increases butterfly abundance and species richness while potentially reducing macro-moth abundance compared to mature forest (Action ID 3939). Coppiced woodlands supported higher abundance of butterflies generally and heath fritillary specifically, as well as eastern eggar moth caterpillars. Different aged coppice supported different butterfly and moth communities, though macro-moth species richness did not change with coppice age.\n\nThinning trees within forests increases both butterfly species richness and abundance (Action ID 3940). Coniferous woodlands that had been thinned, sometimes with prescribed burning or mulching, showed greater butterfly species richness and abundance compared to unmanaged woodland. One study found that partially-cleared forest plots had higher butterfly species richness but lower moth species richness than closed-canopy forest.\n\nUsing thinning instead of clearcutting generally maintains moth species richness better than other harvesting methods (Action ID 3868). A controlled study found macro-moth species richness was higher after thinning than after patch-cutting or clearcutting, with richness similar to unharvested forest.",

Additionally, research on Fender's blue butterfly found that caterpillar survival was lower in prairie plots burned one year before compared to unburned plots, indicating that recently burned areas may have reduced survival rates for early life stages.

Management considerations include leaving some areas unburned during prescribed burning operations, which can help mitigate negative impacts.

Population responses showed that some species (heath fritillary adults, marsh fritillary caterpillars, Fender's blue caterpillars and eggs) had higher abundance after burning, while others (Brenton blue butterfly, rosy marsh moth caterpillars, regal fritillary adults) had lower abundance on burned land.

Clearing patches in forests was found to increase butterfly species richness and abundance compared to unmanaged patches or closed canopy forest, as evidenced by studies showing higher general butterfly abundance and specific species increases (e.g., chequered blue, woodland brown, high brown fritillary, small pearl-bordered fritillary). However, cleared patches showed lower moth species richness than coppiced woodland or mature forest. One UK study found that larger cleared patches supported higher butterfly species richness and abundance than undisturbed forest, while another found both wider and standard width rides had similar macro-moth species richness to mature forest. Woodland coppicing also created habitat for butterflies, with studies showing higher butterfly species richness in coppiced woodland compared to unmanaged woodland, and higher abundance of butterflies generally and heath fritillary specifically. Coppiced woodlands supported different communities of moths and butterflies depending on coppice age, with recent coppice (2-4 years) generally supporting higher abundances than older coppice (>15 years). Both management techniques created habitat heterogeneity important for different species groups.",
