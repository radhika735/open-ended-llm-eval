Position matters - bat box orientation and sunlight exposure affected occupancy, with boxes on buildings having higher occupancy than those on trees (action 1024).

Artificial caves and hibernacula demonstrated gradual adoption, with one study showing increasing bat numbers over nine years after construction (action 2049).

Placement factors include: orientation and sun exposure (affects occupancy with orientation and sunlight amount being important), height (studies show mixed results with some finding height affects occupancy while others found no effect), location type (higher occupancy on buildings than trees in some studies), habitat context (farm forestry sites vs native forest, pine vs mixed deciduous stands), and prior bat presence (higher occupancy in areas where bats were known to roost before installing boxes). Additional factors include the number of boxes installed (greater numbers across a site increase occupancy likelihood) and microclimate management (modifying roost temperatures can increase bat numbers).

      "relevant_summary": "Based on action documents, eight studies evaluated captive breeding effects, showing that 6-100% of female bats captured in the wild successfully conceived, gave birth and reared young in captivity across studies in the USA, UK, Italy and Brazil. Two studies found that two of five and two of three bats born in captivity successfully gave birth to live young. Seven studies found that 20-100% of bat pups born in captivity survived from 10 days to adulthood. However, no studies evaluated the effects of releasing captive-bred bats back to the wild. Four studies evaluated rehabilitation of injured/orphaned bats. One study in Brazil found two hand-reared orphaned greater spear-nosed bats survived over three months in captivity and reached normal species size after 60 days. Two studies in the UK and Italy found 70-90% of hand-reared pipistrelle bats survived 4-14 days after wild release, with six of 21 bats joining wild colonies. One UK study found 13% of ringed hand-reared pipistrelle bats were found alive in bat boxes 38 days to four years after release. Another UK study found bats that flew in large flight cages for longer periods survived longer and were more active after release. Importantly, no studies evaluated breeding bats specifically to supplement wild populations affected by white-nose syndrome.",
