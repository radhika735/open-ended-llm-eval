Trapping with food bait (tinned meat) was found to be more effective than pheromone baits, catching over half of all trapped crayfish in a controlled study in Italy (Action ID: 1029). Natural predation using eels and pike has shown effectiveness in reducing crayfish populations in replicated controlled studies in Italy and France (Action ID: 1030). Chemical control using the natural pyrethrum Pyblast at 0.05 mg/l concentration was effective at killing crayfish in water, though application to drained burrows was not effective, as shown in a replicated controlled study in Italy (Action ID: 1036). Barriers made of concrete dams with anti-crawling features successfully contained crayfish spread upstream in a before-and-after study in Spain conducted between 2007-2010 (Action ID: 1037). Male sterilization through X-ray exposure reduced offspring production by 43% in a replicated laboratory study in Italy (Action ID: 1032).
