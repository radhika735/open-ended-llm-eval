Planting or maintaining ground cover in vineyards significantly increases soil organic matter according to ten studies from Mediterranean and similar climates (Action 1367). This practice also enhances soil microbial biomass and reduces erosion. Adding compost to vineyard soils consistently increases organic matter levels, as demonstrated in twelve studies from Mediterranean countries including Italy and Spain (Action 1362). Using reduced tillage practices shows strong benefits for soil organic matter, with fourteen Mediterranean studies finding increased organic matter compared to conventional tillage (Action 1371). Additionally, growing cover crops during fallow periods and amending soils with manures or compost (Action 911) effectively builds soil organic carbon and nutrient levels. Retaining crop residues on vineyard soils also contributes to higher soil organic carbon and nitrogen content (Action 907). These practices work synergistically and can be combined for maximum benefit in Mediterranean vineyard conditions.",

Cover crops also reduce soil erosion (two studies from Israel and USA found less erosion with cover crops compared to fallows) and increase water-stable soil aggregates. For crop production, effects are more variable: six studies found lower cash crop yields with cover crops, three found higher yields, and eight found inconsistent differences, while seven studies found no yield differences. Legume cover crops performed better than non-legumes, with eight studies showing higher cash crop yields when legumes were used as cover crops. Water management shows mixed results, with some studies finding reduced water availability but others showing less water loss through drainage, runoff, or evaporation.

The use of grazers to manage vegetation shows mixed results, with some studies finding higher plant cover and abundance with cattle, sheep, or goat grazing compared to ungrazed plots, while other studies found lower cover or no difference (Action 1419). Using fewer grazers resulted in higher cover of some plant species in areas with lower grazing intensities, though plant diversity responses were inconsistent across studies (Action 1418). Seasonal grazing showed different effects on plant cover and diversity depending on timing, with some studies finding differences in species number and diversity between plots grazed at different times (Action 1421). Rotational grazing demonstrated limited evidence, with one study finding higher native plant cover after adoption, while another found no difference in plant density but more reproductive stems under rotational grazing (Actions 1420, 3965). Excluding grazers entirely showed complex effects, with 32 studies finding higher biomass, cover, or abundance of some plant groups in ungrazed areas, while 14 studies found lower abundance of some plant groups, and plant diversity responses varied significantly (Action 1417). Ceasing grazing to allow early succession revealed that grasslands abandoned for different time periods showed varying species richness compared to grazed grasslands, with some studies finding higher richness in abandoned grasslands and others finding lower richness (Action 3956). The evidence consistently indicates that Mediterranean grassland plant biodiversity responses to grazing management are highly context-dependent, varying with grazing intensity, timing, and specific environmental conditions.",

Reduced tillage and no-tillage systems have been shown to increase soil aggregate water-stability compared to conventional tillage, with seven replicated studies finding that soils without tillage were more stable than tilled soils. Growing cover crops beneath main crops or between crop rows increases soil stability, with studies from France showing reduced erosion under cover crops and controlled studies demonstrating highest soil stability under grass covers. Maintaining ground cover in orchards and vineyards also significantly improves soil aggregation, with four replicated randomized controlled studies from Chile and Spain finding that soil aggregates were more water-stable in plots with seeded cover crops compared to tilled or bare soils. Retaining crop residues on fields reduces soil erosion and improves aggregation, as shown by a Canadian replicated site comparison study that found mixed effects on soil physical properties including the size of soil aggregates. Adding mulch to crops increases soil stability and reduces erosion, with five studies from India, France, Nigeria and the UK finding that mulches increased soil stability and reduced both soil erosion and runoff. Crop rotation practices can also enhance soil structure, with one replicated controlled study from Syria finding higher water-stability in soils with crop rotations compared to continuous crops.",

Reducing cutting frequency on grasslands has demonstrated positive effects for pollinators including butterflies and moths, with studies from Italy and Germany showing meadows cut once/year had higher species richness compared to those cut multiple times/year (3961). Vineyard management practices that encourage native plants and reduce chemical inputs have been shown to increase butterfly abundance in Spain (3919). No-tillage practices in arable fields have evidence of benefit, with studies finding more pollinators in plots with no tillage compared to deep tillage (1405, 2516). Creating or retaining hedgerows provides significant benefits for pollinator communities, with studies showing higher bee species richness and abundance in fields with hedgerows (2515). Managing landscapes to enhance floral resources has shown positive correlations with pollinator abundance (362), and providing set-aside areas in farmland has been documented to benefit various wildlife groups including pollinators (156). Diversifying ground vegetation and canopy structure around woody crops like olive groves has shown higher reptile diversity and abundance, indicating ecosystem benefits that could extend to pollinators (3526).",

Specifically, 14 studies found more organic matter in soils with reduced tillage versus conventional tillage, while a meta-analysis and 14 additional studies found more organic matter in no-tillage soils compared to tilled soils.\n\nConservation tillage practices are most effective when combined with crop residue retention and cover cropping.

Growing winter cover crops in arable fields significantly increased soil organic matter (measured as carbon) in Mediterranean-type climates, with a meta-analysis and ten controlled studies from Italy, Spain, and the USA demonstrating consistent benefits.\n\nThe research indicates that the combination of no-tillage or reduced tillage with residue retention and cover crops creates optimal conditions for soil organic matter accumulation.

      "relevant_summary": "For Mediterranean farmland, planting flowers shows evidence of increasing pollinator activity on adjacent crops, with one replicated controlled study from Spain finding more pollinators on coriander flowers next to planted flower strips compared to unplanted field margins (actions 2468, 1406). Flower planting also increased wild bee species and individuals in some comparisons, though results varied for different pollinator groups (action 1406). Implementation studies from Italy and Spain showed that pollinator response to flower strips depended on the number and type of flower species planted, with some species being more attractive than others (actions 2468, 1406).\n\nPlanting hedgerows showed different benefits, with studies primarily from the USA (as no Mediterranean-specific hedgerow studies were found) demonstrating increased native bee species richness and crop visitation rates by native bees adjacent to hedgerows, though honey bee and syrphid fly responses were inconsistent (actions 1407, 2515). Hedgerows supported more bee species, syrphid fly species, and specialist bees compared to field edges without hedgerows (actions 1407, 2515). The effectiveness of hedgerows increased with age, with older hedgerows supporting more bee and syrphid fly species than younger ones (actions 1407, 2515).\n\nNeither intervention showed consistent effects across all pollinator groups, with flowers showing more variable results and hedgerows primarily benefiting native bees. The evidence base is limited for Mediterranean contexts, with most hedgerow studies originating from the USA.",
