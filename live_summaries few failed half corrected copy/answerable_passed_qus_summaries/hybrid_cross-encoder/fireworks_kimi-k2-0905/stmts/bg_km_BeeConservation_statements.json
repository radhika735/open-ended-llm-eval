Sowing uncropped margins with agricultural nectar and pollen mixes, particularly those containing perennial leguminous flowering plants, attracts significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated, grassy or cropped margins - though these mixes require re-sowing every few years as their value degrades over time. Native wildflower seed mixes also support higher abundance and species richness of bumblebees compared to cropped edges, with perennial leguminous herbs providing important forage sources, especially for long-tongued species. Naturally regenerated uncropped margins can support more bumblebees than cropped margins, though their value is often based on thistle species considered pernicious weeds and their benefits are not consistent year-to-year. Providing grass strips at field margins can enhance bumblebee abundance and diversity, with 6 m wide margins showing positive effects. Conservation headlands (unsprayed field margins within crops) do not attract more foraging bumblebees than conventional fields. Rough grassland areas in field margins also attract nest-searching queen bumblebees at higher densities than other habitat types during spring.",

Planting dedicated floral resources including phacelia has shown substantial foraging by wild bees, with trials recording 8-35 bee species visiting planted patches (action 17). Comparisons between mix types show that agricultural forage plant mixtures (including legumes) attract greater numbers of bumblebees than perennial wildflower mixes, at least in the first year after establishment.
