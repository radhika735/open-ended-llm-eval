    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from multiple studies, prescribed fire in North American forests has mixed effects on ecosystem components. For young trees, five of 15 studies found prescribed fire increased density and biomass, while two found it decreased new tree density, and eight found no effect or mixed effects depending on species, location, and fire frequency (Action 1220). For mature trees, four of eight studies found prescribed fire decreased tree cover, density and diversity, while three found no effect or mixed effects, and seven studies found it increased tree mortality (Action 1217). \n\nFor understory plants, eight of 22 studies found prescribed fire increased cover, density and biomass, while six found it decreased plant cover, and eight found no effect or mixed effects. Fourteen of 24 studies found it increased species richness and diversity of understory plants, while nine found no effect or mixed effects (Action 1221).\n\nRegarding wildlife, studies showed mixed responses: some bird species (particularly open habitat species) were more abundant in burned pine forests, while closed-forest species and ground nesters appeared adversely affected by burning (Action 318). For amphibians, eight of 14 studies found no effect of prescribed forest fires on abundance or species numbers, while three found fires increased abundance or species numbers, and one found abundance decreased with fires (Action 877).\n\nSome studies found restoration benefits: coniferous forests restored by burning (often combined with thinning) had higher butterfly species richness than unburned forest (Action 3877). Prescribed burning can also mimic natural fire cycles (Action 1622), though studies specifically evaluating prescribed burning for reducing wildfire potential were not found (Action 1623).",

For herbicide use, one replicated, randomized, controlled study in the USA found no effect on total native plant species richness (action 1229, 1314). Mechanical/manual removal showed mixed results: one replicated, controlled study in Hawaii found that removal of invasive grass species increased understory plant biomass, while another in the USA found no effect on understory plant diversity (action 1228). One study in Ghana found that removal of invasive weed species increased tree seedling height, but another in Hawaii found no effect on growth rate of native species (action 1228). For prescribed fire and grazing, no evidence was found for their effects on invasive plant control in forests (actions 1196, 1195). Similarly, no evidence was found for using hot water to control Crassula helmsii (action 1275). Some studies evaluated broader effects: one before-and-after study in the UK found that habitat management including invasive plant control tripled a natterjack toad population (action 823), while two studies in the USA found that control of introduced saltcedar and partial removal of velvet mesquite did not change small mammal species richness or abundances (action 2529).",

A review of programmes in the USA and Canada found that education alone was not sufficient to change behaviour, although it served as a necessary catalytic factor for economic incentives and law enforcement (action 162). However, several studies demonstrated positive outcomes from education and awareness campaigns. In the Philippines, a communication, education, and public awareness campaign led to increased Philippine crocodile populations and reduced human killing of crocodiles (action 3682). Similarly, in Costa Rica, a community-based education programme resulted in decreased poaching of leatherback turtle nests (action 3682), while in Dominica, education combined with road signs reduced road deaths of lesser Antillean iguanas (action 3682). In aquatic environments, three studies found that educational whale-watching tours and exhibitions in the North Atlantic Ocean, Bangladesh, and Peru increased participants' willingness to support marine conservation through behaviour change and donations (action 2935). However, some studies showed limited or no effectiveness, such as an information leaflet program in the USA that failed to reduce hotel energy consumption (action 3682) and awareness efforts in Taiwan that had no effect on green tree frog conservation (action 831). The evidence suggests that while education and awareness campaigns can be effective components of conservation strategies, they are most successful when combined with other interventions rather than used in isolation.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents reviewed, soil amendments after tree planting show mixed results depending on the type of amendment and tree species. Organic matter amendments demonstrate several benefits including increased microbial biomass and activity (902), higher soil organic carbon levels (902), and increased soil nutrients (902). However, in wetland environments, high amounts of compost can negatively impact plant community composition by favoring species characteristic of drier conditions and reducing plant species richness and diversity (3310), though it can increase individual tree size (3310). Manure applications show mixed effects on tree survival and growth depending on species and dose (3311).\n\nLime applications reveal predominantly negative or neutral effects. Studies found lime application decreased pine seedling survival (1259), typically reduced survival of planted fen herbs (1825), and reduced growth rates for most peat swamp tree seedlings (1825). However, some studies found lime increased survival of planted fen mosses (1825) and vegetation cover in one study (1249).\n\nFertilizer applications show variable results. Some studies found fertilizer increased tree size (1260, 3306) and growth rates (3306), while others found no significant effects on tree height, diameter, survival, or health (1260, 3306). One study reported mixed effects on seedling survival and height (1260).",

Similarly, a study in the Republic of Congo found that most reintroduced central chimpanzees survived over five years in areas where communities received monetary benefits, though a study across Rwanda, Uganda and Democratic Republic of Congo found mountain gorilla numbers still declined despite community development projects.\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"1152\",\n    \"1509\"\n  ]\n}"

In Europe, soil scarification/ploughing was found to increase cover and diversity of understory plants in Portugal, while vegetation removal combined with mechanical soil disturbance increased understory plant cover and diversity in both Portugal and France. European studies also showed that fertilization after planting increased tree size in Portugal. In North America, ploughing was found to increase understory plant cover and diversity in the USA, though one study found no effect on invasive grass spreading. Soil scarification studies in Canada showed mixed effects on tree density, while a replicated controlled study found that ploughing did not decrease spreading distance and density of invasive grass seedlings in the USA. The available evidence suggests that mechanical soil disturbance techniques tend to show positive effects on understory vegetation in both regions, while fertilization effects are more variable across different locations and tree species.",

    "relevant_summary": "Main alternatives to clearcutting for timber harvesting include shelterwood harvesting, patch retention harvesting, selective logging, group selection harvesting, and thinning. Shelterwood harvesting generally shows positive effects on understory plants, with six of seven studies finding increased abundance, species richness, and diversity of understory plants, as well as improved growth and survival of young trees compared to clearcutting. However, one study found shelterwood harvesting decreased plant species richness and abundance. Group-selection harvesting shows mixed results, with four of eight studies finding increased cover and diversity of understory plants and young tree density, while two studies found decreased understory species richness and biomass. Patch retention harvesting lacks specific studies on forest plant effects, with no studies found evaluating its effects on butterflies and moths compared to clearcutting. Selective or reduced impact logging shows similar species richness of moths to clearcutting but lower than unharvested forest. Thinning trees generally benefits understory plants, with 17 of 25 studies finding increased density and cover, and 13 of 19 studies finding increased species richness and diversity. Five of ten studies on selective tree removal found increased density and cover of understory plants, with four of seven studies finding increased species richness and diversity.",

Excluding livestock from forest areas using wire fences has been shown to increase biomass, species richness, density, and cover of understory plants in four of eight studies, while three of four studies found increased size and density of regenerating trees and number of regenerating trees. Reducing grazing intensity in forests specifically increased the number of tree saplings and understory biomass according to studies in the UK and Greece. Ceasing livestock grazing in forest, open woodland, and savanna habitats showed mixed effects on reptile populations, with two of five studies finding higher abundance of reptiles and lizards in ungrazed areas, while other studies found similar abundances between grazed and ungrazed areas. Seasonal removal of livestock (shortening grazing periods) demonstrated benefits for butterflies and moths, with three controlled studies finding higher abundance of butterflies and caterpillars in grasslands where cattle or sheep were removed seasonally compared to year-round grazing. Reducing grazing intensity by lowering stocking density showed positive effects, with eight of eleven studies finding greater abundance of butterflies, moths, and their caterpillars at lower stocking densities. When livestock were excluded from semi-natural habitats including woodland, four of eight studies found higher abundances of mammals such as mule deer, small mammals, and European rabbits.",

Mechanically removing understorey vegetation was found to NOT increase small mammal abundances based on three replicated studies. Prescribed burning in forests showed varied effects on amphibians - most studies found no effect on abundance or species numbers, while some found mixed effects depending on species and timing, with a few showing increases or decreases. Mechanical vegetation removal increased amphibian species richness but not abundance, and improved butterfly diversity in cork oak woodlands. Thinning followed by prescribed fire had mixed effects on plant cover and tree density. Prescribed burning in deciduous forests showed little impact on bird species richness. However, several key interventions including thinning vegetation to prevent wildfires, building fire breaks, using fire prevention signs, adopting zero burning policies near peatlands, planting trees after wildfire, and raising water levels to prevent fires all lack evidence from direct evaluation studies.",

For legal protection, two site comparison studies found that legally protected forests had increased tree species richness, diversity, and density of young trees in Nigeria and Iran (Action ID: 1233). However, one study found no effect on seed density and diversity in Mexico. Community-based forest management showed positive outcomes, with two studies from Ethiopia and Nepal finding that forest cover increased more in community-managed forests compared to non-community managed forests (Action ID: 1152), though one study in Colombia found no difference in deforestation rates. Financial incentives for community forest management demonstrated varied results: a study in Belize showed a 138% increase in black howler monkey populations over 13 years when communities received monetary benefits (Action ID: 1509), while a study across Rwanda, Uganda, and Democratic Republic of Congo found a 28% decline in mountain gorillas over 41 years despite community development projects. Public engagement through awareness campaigns showed some positive impacts, including increased amphibian pond creation in Estonia and the UK, and successfully reached 50,000+ people annually in some programs (Action ID: 831), though one study found no effect on a green tree frog project in Taiwan. Community engagement in conservation activities demonstrated positive outcomes for reptile populations, including reduced poaching of turtle eggs in Mozambique and Costa Rica, and fewer crocodile killings in the Philippines (Action ID: 3681). However, several actions lacked sufficient evidence, including legal protection from development (Action ID: 1169) and forest certification programs (Action ID: 1500).",

However, one study in the USA found it decreased plant biomass.\n\nRemoving burnt trees and branches did not show significant benefit for European wild rabbit populations in Spain compared to leaving branches in place.\n\nReplanting native trees in logged areas showed mixed results, with one study in Ghana finding similar species richness but lower diversity compared to naturally regenerating secondary forest nine years after replanting.\n\nPlanting trees after wildfire currently has no available evidence for its effectiveness on forest recovery.\n\nRetaining dead trees after uprooting showed that areas where trees were left on site were used more by desert cottontails in the USA compared to cleared areas.\n\nUsing prescribed fire for forest restoration and maintenance has been studied more extensively. Eight of 14 studies found no effect on amphibian abundance or species numbers, while four studies showed mixed effects depending on species, year, or season of burn. Three studies found increased abundance or species numbers from prescribed fires.\n\nForest restoration or creation programs showed variable results across different ecosystems and restoration methods, with some studies finding increased species richness and abundance while others found mixed or negative effects depending on restoration approach and comparison groups.",
