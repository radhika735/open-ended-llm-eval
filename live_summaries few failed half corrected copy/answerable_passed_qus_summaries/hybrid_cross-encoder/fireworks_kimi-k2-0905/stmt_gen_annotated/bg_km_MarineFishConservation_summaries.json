    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence, long-term fishery closures show more positive effects on marine fish abundance compared to temporary closures. Long-term closures (6-8 years) demonstrated higher abundance in 2 of 7 fish species in the Gulf of Maine and Bismark Sea (action 2655). In contrast, temporary closures showed no increase in fish biomass or abundance for cod in the Atlantic Ocean over nine years (action 2664), and no increase in invertebrate biomass at sites seasonally closed to fishing in the English Channel (action 2098). However, both temporary and long-term closures showed mixed or neutral results for some species - temporary closures had no effect on cod survival or condition (action 2664), while long-term closures showed either similar or lower abundance for certain species like monkfish and salmon (action 2655). The evidence suggests that longer protection periods may be necessary to see measurable increases in fish abundance, though responses vary by species.",

Six studies\\u00a0found similar fish species/richness between one and 20 years after all fishing was banned in protected areas, compared to fished areas. One systematic review in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans\\u00a0found no difference in species richness between unfished protected areas and fished areas. One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that the effects of prohibiting all fishing on fish species richness/diversity after 15 years varied with the sampling method used.\\n\\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (66 STUDIES)\\n\\nAbundance (64 studies): Thirty of 54 site comparison studies (18 replicated, eight replicated and paired, two before-and-after, one paired and before-and-after, and one replicated and before-and-after) in the Indian Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, Pacific Ocean, Tasman Sea, Coral Sea, Philippine Sea, Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and the Sulu Sea, found that marine protected areas that had been prohibiting all fishing for up to 25 years or more, had higher abundances (density and/or biomass) of all fish (total fish biomass, total fish density), fishery targeted fish species, non-fishery targeted fish species\\u00a0and all or most of the individual fish species/groups monitored, except fish densities (all or most)\\u00a0and non-fishery targeted species, compared to unprotected fished areas and/or partly-fished protected areas. The studies also found that in some cases where the total fish biomass or densities were higher in no-fished areas, the effect varied between individual groups of fish based on species family\\u00a0and/or position in the food chain, commercial target and non-target species, fish sizes, depth\\u00a0and habitat types. Eight studies found that inside protected areas prohibiting all fishing there were similar abundances of all fish, and all or most of the individual fish species/groups monitored, compared to fished areas between one and 20 years after implementation. The other sixteen studies\\u00a0found that the effect of prohibiting fishing in protected areas for three to 20 years on fish abundance varied between fish species or groups and on their fished status (fishery target or non-target)\\u00a0and/or position in the food chain. One also found that the effect varied with size or age of the protected areas. Five of six reviews (three systematic) across the world, in the Pacific and/or Atlantic Oceans\\u00a0and in unreported regions\\u00a0found that non-fished marine reserves with one to 27 years of protection had higher abundances of all fish, all fish and invertebrates combined\\u00a0and blue cod\\u00a0compared to fished areas, but there were differences between species/groups and fishing intensity outside reserves. The other review\\u00a0found that fish abundance varied between species in no-take marine reserves between one and 25 years old, and was affected by food chain position, level of exploitation and duration of protection. One replicated study in the Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found a long-term decline in the abundance/presence of eight of 12 shark and ray species inside an established (&gt;15 years) no-fishing protected area, however enforcement was poor. One before-and after, site comparison study in the Pacific Ocean, found no differences in overall fish abundance between a marine reserve closed permanently to fishing for five years and a closed area that was harvested for two years during the same period. One site comparison study in the Coral Sea\\u00a0found that in a no-take zone of an area protected for at least 10 years, fish abundance of four of six fish groups were similar to no-entry and fished zones, but two had lower abundance than the no-entry zone. One replicated, paired, site comparison study in the Tasman Sea\\u00a0found that in a non-fished marine park zone abundance of commercially targeted fish was higher than partly fished zones but lower than unprotected areas after four to eight years.\\nReproductive success (1 study): One site comparison study in the Mediterranean Sea\\u00a0found more eggs of four commercially targeted fish species inside a non-fished marine reserve enforced for three years than in fished areas outside the reserve.\\nSurvival (1 study): One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that prohibiting all fishing in a marine protected area for three years resulted in similar survival of red hind grouper, compared to fished areas.\\nCondition (20 studies): Two global review studies\\u00a0(one systematic) and two systematic reviews in the Pacific Ocean\\u00a0and the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans\\u00a0found that prohibiting all fishing in marine protected areas for one to 27 years resulted in larger fish overall\\u00a0and larger blue cod\\u00a0compared to fished areas, but there were differences between individual fish families or species. Eight of 11 site comparison studies (four replicated, one before-and-after, one paired, and one replicated and paired) in the Tasman Sea, Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, Atlantic Ocean, Java Sea\\u00a0and the Philippine Sea, found that non-fished protected areas had larger fish overall\\u00a0and larger individuals of all or most of the fish species/groups monitored, compared to fished areas, after one to 22 years. The other three studies\\u00a0found similar fish sizes of all or all but one species, compared to fished areas one to 16 years after all fishing was prohibited. Three site comparison studies (one replicated) in the Coral Sea, Caribbean Sea\\u00a0and the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that fish size in protected areas that had not been fished for six to more than 20 years, varied between fish species or food chain groups. One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that red hind grouper were larger, but had similar growth, in an area protected from fishing for three years compared to fished areas. One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that young lemon sharks in areas protected from fishing for 20 years had similar growth rates, but lower condition, than sharks in unprotected fished areas.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)\\u00a0\\n\\nBehaviour change (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in the Pacific and Indian Oceans\\u00a0found that surgeonfish and parrotfish inside established protected areas where fishing was prohibited, showed a similar avoidance response to fishing gears as in fished areas, and this increased with increasing fishing intensity outside the protected areas. One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that in non-fished areas protected for one and 24 years, fish grazing rates were higher compared to fished areas.\\n\\n\\u00a0OTHER (15 STUDIES)\\n\\nUse (7 studies): Four of six site comparison studies in the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0and the Tasman Sea\\u00a0found that marine protected areas where all fishing had been prohibited for at least five to 15 years, were used for a large proportion of time by shark and ray species\\u00a0and commercially important reef fish species, compared to fished areas, thus were provided protection from fishing. Two other studies\\u00a0found that time spent inside areas closed to all fishing for 20 years\\u00a0and over 30 years, varied between species and with size for three shark species\\u00a0and with size for giant trevally. One replicated study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that most individuals of five fish species remained inside a marine reserve zone closed to fishing over a nine-year period.\\n\\n\\nCatch abundance (2 studies): One of two site comparison studies in the Mediterranean Sea\\u00a0and Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found that commercial fish catch rates in small-scale traditional fisheries were highest closest to a marine reserve closed to all fishing for 22 years, and decreased with increasing distance from the reserve. The other study\\u00a0found that there was no increase in fish catch rates in commercially landed catch in the five years after a no-fishing zone was implemented in a co-managed protected area.\\nStock biomass (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that the stock biomass (the harvested portion of the population) of reef fish species was highest in enforced protected areas closed to all fishing, compared to various other area management regimes.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\nFishing mortality (2 studies): Two site comparison studies in the North Sea\\u00a0and Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found that prohibiting fishing in protected areas resulted in reduced commercial fishing mortality of corkwing wrasse tagged inside non-fished marine reserves compared to fished areas, and that the overall fishing mortality of grey reef sharks tagged inside protected areas was low.\"\n}"

Separator trawls: A replicated, randomized study in the North Sea found that separator trawls separated unwanted cod from target fish species into the lower codend, where a larger mesh size allowed more unwanted smaller cod to escape capture (action 2711).\n\n2. Topless (coverless) trawls: Two of four replicated, controlled studies in the North Sea found that topless trawls reduced the catch of unwanted Atlantic cod and discards of commercial fish species compared to conventional trawl types. One study found that topless trawls reduced unwanted catches of larger but not smaller haddock (action 2712).\n\n3. Size-sorting escape grids: Multiple studies in the North Sea showed that fitting size-sorting escape grids to trawl nets reduced catches of unwanted cod and haddock compared to trawls without grids. However, results were mixed on whether this improved size-selection for these species specifically (action 2720).\n\n4. Mesh escape panels/windows: Studies in the North Sea found that fitting mesh escape panels to trawl nets reduced unwanted catches of various fish species including cod and haddock, though some studies found no reduction for these specific species compared to nets without panels/windows (action 2716).\n\n5. Different escape grid configurations: Studies showed that different designs or configurations of size-sorting escape grid systems in trawl nets had varying effects on reducing unwanted catches, with some configurations being more effective than others depending on the specific circumstances (action 2728).\n\nThe effectiveness of these modifications varies depending on factors such as species, fish size, gear configuration, and fishing conditions.",

Mesh escape panels (2716) showed effectiveness in 30 of 38 studies, with 9 studies demonstrating improved size selectivity for species like Atlantic cod and haddock, though results varied with panel position and design. Size-sorting escape grids (2720) were effective in 14 of 17 studies at reducing unwanted catch of various species including cod, haddock, and whiting, with improved size-selection reported for haddock in 2 of 3 relevant studies, though performance varied by species. Large supported openings (2723) were effective in 6 of 7 studies at reducing unwanted catch of species like red snapper and other fish, though specific size-selectivity improvements were not as prominently featured in the evidence. When used in combination (2726), grids and large openings together were effective in 3 of 4 studies at reducing unwanted catch. The evidence suggests that mesh escape panels have the broadest evidence base for size-selectivity improvements, while grids show strong performance for unwanted catch reduction, and large supported openings are effective but with more limited evidence for size-selectivity specifically.",

Prohibition of static fishing gear: One study in the Coral Sea found that areas closed to non-towed fishing gears had higher overall shark abundance when sampled with longlines compared to areas where commercial gillnets were permitted. Shark length was greater for two of five species/groups in these closed areas. Prohibition of line fishing: One study in the Indian Ocean found that prohibiting offshore line fishing and all other boat-based fishing resulted in higher abundances of four fish species that were over-exploited by line fishing compared to areas where boat-based line and spear fishing was permitted. The evidence suggests both types of prohibitions can have positive effects on fish abundance, but they target different aspects - static gear prohibition appears beneficial for shark populations, while line fishing prohibition helps recover species specifically over-exploited by line fishing.",

Studies found that zones with higher protection levels (no-take/no-entry zones) generally had greater fish abundance, biomass, and species richness compared to partially fished zones within the same protected area. Site comparison studies across multiple regions (South Africa, Australia, Italy, Philippines) found that fish abundance and biomass varied with the level of restriction, with no-fishing zones having higher values than partially fished zones. Fish sizes were also larger in zones with greater protection restrictions. However, one study found that while abundance increased in no-entry zones compared to no-take and fished zones, the effects varied between fish feeding groups, zone protection level, and reef region. Fish behavior also showed positive responses in high-protection zones, with tagged reef fish remaining mainly in zones where all or nearly all fishing was prohibited for up to 20 years.",

One study found that after 14 years of closure to bottom trawling, recruitment of young red mullet had increased. However, another study found that closing an area to bottom trawling did not increase recruitment or survival of young haddock seven years after closure compared to trawled areas.\n\nMediterranean Sea: Studies in the Mediterranean show generally positive results. After a 14-year closure to bottom trawling, adult red mullet showed increased biomass and larger sizes. Additionally, after the closure of an area to bottom trawling, recruitment of young red mullet had increased, though this was not consistent across all fish groups.\n\nIndian Ocean (Tasmania, Kenya): Research from the Indian Ocean region shows variable results depending on habitat type and individual fish groups. Studies found that closing areas to towed bottom gears for 3-14 years had effects on fish size that varied between individual fish groups and with habitat type, compared to fished areas.\n\nOverall Effectiveness: The effectiveness of bottom fishing gear prohibitions appears to be highly variable across regions and is influenced by several factors including the duration of closure (ranging from 3 to 15 years in these studies), habitat type, and specific fish species or groups studied.",

Topless trawls were studied more extensively with four studies across the North Sea, Gulf of Maine, and Baltic Sea regions. These studies showed mixed but generally positive results - two studies found they reduced unwanted Atlantic cod catch and discards of commercial species, one found they reduced catches of larger but not smaller haddock and larger cod only in one case, and another found discarded catches were reduced for one of four commercial species.

One study also found lower numbers of unwanted species (fish and invertebrates) in modified traps. However, three studies found no effect on unwanted catches of white croaker, non-commercial fish, or undersized Atlantic cod, with one study noting increased non-target haddock catches. Survival effects: One replicated, controlled study found similar survival rates between small herring that escaped through size-sorting grids and trap-caught herring that did not pass through grids. Size-selectivity improvements: Three of four replicated studies found that traps modified with square mesh escape windows or larger mesh sizes improved size-selectivity for Atlantic cod, black sea bass, and most fish species compared to smaller mesh and/or standard gear, while one study found no effect on panga size-selectivity.",

The studies also found that in some cases where the total fish biomass or densities were higher in no-fished areas, the effect varied between individual groups of fish based on species family\\u00a0and/or position in the food chain, commercial target and non-target species, fish sizes, depth\\u00a0and habitat types. Eight studies found that inside protected areas prohibiting all fishing there were similar abundances of all fish, and all or most of the individual fish species/groups monitored, compared to fished areas between one and 20 years after implementation. The other sixteen studies\\u00a0found that the effect of prohibiting fishing in protected areas for three to 20 years on fish abundance varied between fish species or groups and on their fished status (fishery target or non-target)\\u00a0and/or position in the food chain. One also found that the effect varied with size or age of the protected areas. Five of six reviews (three systematic) across the world, in the Pacific and/or Atlantic Oceans\\u00a0and in unreported regions\\u00a0found that non-fished marine reserves with one to 27 years of protection had higher abundances of all fish, all fish and invertebrates combined\\u00a0and blue cod\\u00a0compared to fished areas, but there were differences between species/groups and fishing intensity outside reserves. The other review\\u00a0found that fish abundance varied between species in no-take marine reserves between one and 25 years old, and was affected by food chain position, level of exploitation and duration of protection. One replicated study in the Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found a long-term decline in the abundance/presence of eight of 12 shark and ray species inside an established (&gt;15 years) no-fishing protected area, however enforcement was poor. One before-and after, site comparison study in the Pacific Ocean, found no differences in overall fish abundance between a marine reserve closed permanently to fishing for five years and a closed area that was harvested for two years during the same period. One site comparison study in the Coral Sea\\u00a0found that in a no-take zone of an area protected for at least 10 years, fish abundance of four of six fish groups were similar to no-entry and fished zones, but two had lower abundance than the no-entry zone. One replicated, paired, site comparison study in the Tasman Sea\\u00a0found that in a non-fished marine park zone abundance of commercially targeted fish was higher than partly fished zones but lower than unprotected areas after four to eight years.\\nReproductive success (1 study): One site comparison study in the Mediterranean Sea\\u00a0found more eggs of four commercially targeted fish species inside a non-fished marine reserve enforced for three years than in fished areas outside the reserve.\\nSurvival (1 study): One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that prohibiting all fishing in a marine protected area for three years resulted in similar survival of red hind grouper, compared to fished areas.\\nCondition (20 studies): Two global review studies\\u00a0(one systematic) and two systematic reviews in the Pacific Ocean\\u00a0and the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans\\u00a0found that prohibiting all fishing in marine protected areas for one to 27 years resulted in larger fish overall\\u00a0and larger blue cod\\u00a0compared to fished areas, but there were differences between individual fish families or species. Eight of 11 site comparison studies (four replicated, one before-and-after, one paired, and one replicated and paired) in the Tasman Sea, Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, Atlantic Ocean, Java Sea\\u00a0and the Philippine Sea, found that non-fished protected areas had larger fish overall\\u00a0and larger individuals of all or most of the fish species/groups monitored, compared to fished areas, after one to 22 years. The other three studies\\u00a0found similar fish sizes of all or all but one species, compared to fished areas one to 16 years after all fishing was prohibited. Three site comparison studies (one replicated) in the Coral Sea, Caribbean Sea\\u00a0and the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that fish size in protected areas that had not been fished for six to more than 20 years, varied between fish species or food chain groups. One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that red hind grouper were larger, but had similar growth, in an area protected from fishing for three years compared to fished areas. One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that young lemon sharks in areas protected from fishing for 20 years had similar growth rates, but lower condition, than sharks in unprotected fished areas.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)\\u00a0\\n\\nBehaviour change (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in the Pacific and Indian Oceans\\u00a0found that surgeonfish and parrotfish inside established protected areas where fishing was prohibited, showed a similar avoidance response to fishing gears as in fished areas, and this increased with increasing fishing intensity outside the protected areas. One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that in non-fished areas protected for one and 24 years, fish grazing rates were higher compared to fished areas.\\n\\n\\u00a0OTHER (15 STUDIES)\\n\\nUse (7 studies): Four of six site comparison studies in the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0and the Tasman Sea\\u00a0found that marine protected areas where all fishing had been prohibited for at least five to 15 years, were used for a large proportion of time by shark and ray species\\u00a0and commercially important reef fish species, compared to fished areas, thus were provided protection from fishing. Two other studies\\u00a0found that time spent inside areas closed to all fishing for 20 years\\u00a0and over 30 years, varied between species and with size for three shark species\\u00a0and with size for giant trevally. One replicated study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that most individuals of five fish species remained inside a marine reserve zone closed to fishing over a nine-year period.\\n\\n\\nCatch abundance (2 studies): One of two site comparison studies in the Mediterranean Sea\\u00a0and Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found that commercial fish catch rates in small-scale traditional fisheries were highest closest to a marine reserve closed to all fishing for 22 years, and decreased with increasing distance from the reserve. The other study\\u00a0found that there was no increase in fish catch rates in commercially landed catch in the five years after a no-fishing zone was implemented in a co-managed protected area.\\nStock biomass (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that the stock biomass (the harvested portion of the population) of reef fish species was highest in enforced protected areas closed to all fishing, compared to various other area management regimes.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\nFishing mortality (2 studies): Two site comparison studies in the North Sea\\u00a0and Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found that prohibiting fishing in protected areas resulted in reduced commercial fishing mortality of corkwing wrasse tagged inside non-fished marine reserves compared to fished areas, and that the overall fishing mortality of grey reef sharks tagged inside protected areas was low.\"\n}"

Rotated diamond mesh (90° orientation) showed improved size selectivity in 4 of 6 studies for cod, red mullet, common pandora, and round-bodied species, but no improvement for plaice, annular sea bream, and flatfish. One study found no improvement for cod, plaice and flounder with rotated mesh. Both approaches showed consistent patterns: improved selectivity for round-bodied fish but limited effectiveness for flatfish species.

In the Tasman Sea, studies found that fish assemblage/species composition was different before and after prohibiting all commercial fishing - one study in an estuary showed changes after two years, and another study in the wider region surrounding two marine reserves found different species composition five years after their creation. In contrast, a study in the South Atlantic Ocean found no change in species composition between a reserve closed to all commercial fishing for 40 years and unprotected fished areas. Similarly, for fish diversity, the South Atlantic study found no difference in overall fish diversity between the 40-year protected area and fished areas, while research from other regions showed varying results. For abundance specifically, the Tasman Sea studies produced mixed findings - one study found most fish species had lower abundance two years after closure compared to before, while another found fish abundance varied over time with some groups higher than others. In the South Atlantic, the research showed higher abundances of one of four commercially targeted fish species in the 40-year protected area compared to fished areas, with another study finding mixed effects on fish densities varying with level of commercial exploitation and higher abundances of five of five commercially exploited species.",

One site comparison study in the Firth of Clyde\\u00a0found that marine protected areas prohibiting all fishing had more female lobsters with eggs than fished areas, after four to seven years.\\nCrustacean condition (8 studies): One review of studies in New Zealand, and five of seven site comparison studies (four replicated, one replicated and randomized) in the North Atlantic Ocean, the Bristol Channel and the Irish Sea, the Firth of Clyde, the Florida Keys, the South Pacific Ocean, the Coral Sea, and the Tasman Sea, found that marine protected areas prohibiting all fishing had bigger lobsters\\u00a0and crabs\\u00a0compared to seasonally fished or fully fished areas, after four to seven years depending on the study. Three found mixed effects on lobsters\\u00a0and crabs\\u00a0depending on species, sex, and locations, after one to seven years depending on the study.\\nCrustacean population structure (2 studies): Two replicated site comparison studies (one randomized) in the Tasman Sea\\u00a0and the Mediterranean Sea\\u00a0found that marine protected areas prohibiting all fishing had different population size structures of lobsters compared to commercial fishing exclusion zones (only for females)\\u00a0and compared to fished areas, after either 15 years\\u00a0or 21 to 25 years.\\nEchinoderm abundance (3 studies): Two of three site comparison studies (two replicated, one paired) in the North Pacific Ocean, the South Pacific Ocean, and the North Pacific Ocean, found that marine protected areas prohibiting all fishing had similar abundance of Kina sea urchins after more than 10 years, and sea cucumbers after eight years\\u00a0to fished areas, and a third found higher abundance of red sea urchins after approximately 30 years. One also found that the effects on abundance of red sea urchins depended on the age of the protected area and the size of the urchins.\\nEchinoderm condition (1 study): One paired, site comparison study in the South Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found that marine protected areas that had been prohibiting all fishing for over 10 years had heavier Kina sea urchins compared to fished areas.\\nMollusc abundance (10 studies): Four of 10 site comparison studies (including replicated before-and-after, and site comparison) in the North Atlantic Ocean, the North Pacific Ocean\\u00a0the South Pacific Ocean, the Tasman Sea, and the Foveaux Straight\\u00a0found that inside a marine reserve prohibiting all fishing, abundances/biomass of giant clams, adult queen conch, Cook\\u2019s turban snails, rock scallops\\u00a0and green abalone\\u00a0were higher compared to a fished area, after eight to 36 years depending on the study. Six found similar abundances of scallop species, pink abalone, juvenile queen conch, and top shell species, after five to 36 years depending on the study. Three found lower abundances of star limpets after 23 to 25 years\\u00a0and blacklip abalone after 15 to 16 years.

Six studies\\u00a0found similar fish species/richness between one and 20 years after all fishing was banned in protected areas, compared to fished areas. One systematic review in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans\\u00a0found no difference in species richness between unfished protected areas and fished areas. One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that the effects of prohibiting all fishing on fish species richness/diversity after 15 years varied with the sampling method used.\\n\\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (66 STUDIES)\\n\\nAbundance (64 studies): Thirty of 54 site comparison studies (18 replicated, eight replicated and paired, two before-and-after, one paired and before-and-after, and one replicated and before-and-after) in the Indian Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, Pacific Ocean, Tasman Sea, Coral Sea, Philippine Sea, Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and the Sulu Sea, found that marine protected areas that had been prohibiting all fishing for up to 25 years or more, had higher abundances (density and/or biomass) of all fish (total fish biomass, total fish density), fishery targeted fish species, non-fishery targeted fish species\\u00a0and all or most of the individual fish species/groups monitored, except fish densities (all or most)\\u00a0and non-fishery targeted species, compared to unprotected fished areas and/or partly-fished protected areas. The studies also found that in some cases where the total fish biomass or densities were higher in no-fished areas, the effect varied between individual groups of fish based on species family\\u00a0and/or position in the food chain, commercial target and non-target species, fish sizes, depth\\u00a0and habitat types. Eight studies found that inside protected areas prohibiting all fishing there were similar abundances of all fish, and all or most of the individual fish species/groups monitored, compared to fished areas between one and 20 years after implementation. The other sixteen studies\\u00a0found that the effect of prohibiting fishing in protected areas for three to 20 years on fish abundance varied between fish species or groups and on their fished status (fishery target or non-target)\\u00a0and/or position in the food chain. One also found that the effect varied with size or age of the protected areas. Five of six reviews (three systematic) across the world, in the Pacific and/or Atlantic Oceans\\u00a0and in unreported regions\\u00a0found that non-fished marine reserves with one to 27 years of protection had higher abundances of all fish, all fish and invertebrates combined\\u00a0and blue cod\\u00a0compared to fished areas, but there were differences between species/groups and fishing intensity outside reserves. The other review\\u00a0found that fish abundance varied between species in no-take marine reserves between one and 25 years old, and was affected by food chain position, level of exploitation and duration of protection. One replicated study in the Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found a long-term decline in the abundance/presence of eight of 12 shark and ray species inside an established (&gt;15 years) no-fishing protected area, however enforcement was poor. One before-and after, site comparison study in the Pacific Ocean, found no differences in overall fish abundance between a marine reserve closed permanently to fishing for five years and a closed area that was harvested for two years during the same period. One site comparison study in the Coral Sea\\u00a0found that in a no-take zone of an area protected for at least 10 years, fish abundance of four of six fish groups were similar to no-entry and fished zones, but two had lower abundance than the no-entry zone. One replicated, paired, site comparison study in the Tasman Sea\\u00a0found that in a non-fished marine park zone abundance of commercially targeted fish was higher than partly fished zones but lower than unprotected areas after four to eight years.\\nReproductive success (1 study): One site comparison study in the Mediterranean Sea\\u00a0found more eggs of four commercially targeted fish species inside a non-fished marine reserve enforced for three years than in fished areas outside the reserve.\\nSurvival (1 study): One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that prohibiting all fishing in a marine protected area for three years resulted in similar survival of red hind grouper, compared to fished areas.\\nCondition (20 studies): Two global review studies\\u00a0(one systematic) and two systematic reviews in the Pacific Ocean\\u00a0and the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans\\u00a0found that prohibiting all fishing in marine protected areas for one to 27 years resulted in larger fish overall\\u00a0and larger blue cod\\u00a0compared to fished areas, but there were differences between individual fish families or species. Eight of 11 site comparison studies (four replicated, one before-and-after, one paired, and one replicated and paired) in the Tasman Sea, Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, Atlantic Ocean, Java Sea\\u00a0and the Philippine Sea, found that non-fished protected areas had larger fish overall\\u00a0and larger individuals of all or most of the fish species/groups monitored, compared to fished areas, after one to 22 years. The other three studies\\u00a0found similar fish sizes of all or all but one species, compared to fished areas one to 16 years after all fishing was prohibited. Three site comparison studies (one replicated) in the Coral Sea, Caribbean Sea\\u00a0and the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that fish size in protected areas that had not been fished for six to more than 20 years, varied between fish species or food chain groups. One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that red hind grouper were larger, but had similar growth, in an area protected from fishing for three years compared to fished areas. One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that young lemon sharks in areas protected from fishing for 20 years had similar growth rates, but lower condition, than sharks in unprotected fished areas.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)\\u00a0\\n\\nBehaviour change (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in the Pacific and Indian Oceans\\u00a0found that surgeonfish and parrotfish inside established protected areas where fishing was prohibited, showed a similar avoidance response to fishing gears as in fished areas, and this increased with increasing fishing intensity outside the protected areas. One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that in non-fished areas protected for one and 24 years, fish grazing rates were higher compared to fished areas.\\n\\n\\u00a0OTHER (15 STUDIES)\\n\\nUse (7 studies): Four of six site comparison studies in the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0and the Tasman Sea\\u00a0found that marine protected areas where all fishing had been prohibited for at least five to 15 years, were used for a large proportion of time by shark and ray species\\u00a0and commercially important reef fish species, compared to fished areas, thus were provided protection from fishing. Two other studies\\u00a0found that time spent inside areas closed to all fishing for 20 years\\u00a0and over 30 years, varied between species and with size for three shark species\\u00a0and with size for giant trevally. One replicated study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that most individuals of five fish species remained inside a marine reserve zone closed to fishing over a nine-year period.\\n\\n\\nCatch abundance (2 studies): One of two site comparison studies in the Mediterranean Sea\\u00a0and Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found that commercial fish catch rates in small-scale traditional fisheries were highest closest to a marine reserve closed to all fishing for 22 years, and decreased with increasing distance from the reserve. The other study\\u00a0found that there was no increase in fish catch rates in commercially landed catch in the five years after a no-fishing zone was implemented in a co-managed protected area.\\nStock biomass (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that the stock biomass (the harvested portion of the population) of reef fish species was highest in enforced protected areas closed to all fishing, compared to various other area management regimes.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\nFishing mortality (2 studies): Two site comparison studies in the North Sea\\u00a0and Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found that prohibiting fishing in protected areas resulted in reduced commercial fishing mortality of corkwing wrasse tagged inside non-fished marine reserves compared to fished areas, and that the overall fishing mortality of grey reef sharks tagged inside protected areas was low.\"\n}"

One systematic review in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans\\u00a0found no difference in species richness between unfished protected areas and fished areas.

The studies also found that in some cases where the total fish biomass or densities were higher in no-fished areas, the effect varied between individual groups of fish based on species family\\u00a0and/or position in the food chain, commercial target and non-target species, fish sizes, depth\\u00a0and habitat types. Eight studies found that inside protected areas prohibiting all fishing there were similar abundances of all fish, and all or most of the individual fish species/groups monitored, compared to fished areas between one and 20 years after implementation. The other sixteen studies\\u00a0found that the effect of prohibiting fishing in protected areas for three to 20 years on fish abundance varied between fish species or groups and on their fished status (fishery target or non-target)\\u00a0and/or position in the food chain. One also found that the effect varied with size or age of the protected areas. Five of six reviews (three systematic) across the world, in the Pacific and/or Atlantic Oceans\\u00a0and in unreported regions\\u00a0found that non-fished marine reserves with one to 27 years of protection had higher abundances of all fish, all fish and invertebrates combined\\u00a0and blue cod\\u00a0compared to fished areas, but there were differences between species/groups and fishing intensity outside reserves. The other review\\u00a0found that fish abundance varied between species in no-take marine reserves between one and 25 years old, and was affected by food chain position, level of exploitation and duration of protection. One replicated study in the Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found a long-term decline in the abundance/presence of eight of 12 shark and ray species inside an established (&gt;15 years) no-fishing protected area, however enforcement was poor. One before-and after, site comparison study in the Pacific Ocean, found no differences in overall fish abundance between a marine reserve closed permanently to fishing for five years and a closed area that was harvested for two years during the same period. One site comparison study in the Coral Sea\\u00a0found that in a no-take zone of an area protected for at least 10 years, fish abundance of four of six fish groups were similar to no-entry and fished zones, but two had lower abundance than the no-entry zone. One replicated, paired, site comparison study in the Tasman Sea\\u00a0found that in a non-fished marine park zone abundance of commercially targeted fish was higher than partly fished zones but lower than unprotected areas after four to eight years.\\nReproductive success (1 study): One site comparison study in the Mediterranean Sea\\u00a0found more eggs of four commercially targeted fish species inside a non-fished marine reserve enforced for three years than in fished areas outside the reserve.\\nSurvival (1 study): One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that prohibiting all fishing in a marine protected area for three years resulted in similar survival of red hind grouper, compared to fished areas.\\nCondition (20 studies): Two global review studies\\u00a0(one systematic) and two systematic reviews in the Pacific Ocean\\u00a0and the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans\\u00a0found that prohibiting all fishing in marine protected areas for one to 27 years resulted in larger fish overall\\u00a0and larger blue cod\\u00a0compared to fished areas, but there were differences between individual fish families or species. Eight of 11 site comparison studies (four replicated, one before-and-after, one paired, and one replicated and paired) in the Tasman Sea, Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, Atlantic Ocean, Java Sea\\u00a0and the Philippine Sea, found that non-fished protected areas had larger fish overall\\u00a0and larger individuals of all or most of the fish species/groups monitored, compared to fished areas, after one to 22 years. The other three studies\\u00a0found similar fish sizes of all or all but one species, compared to fished areas one to 16 years after all fishing was prohibited. Three site comparison studies (one replicated) in the Coral Sea, Caribbean Sea\\u00a0and the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that fish size in protected areas that had not been fished for six to more than 20 years, varied between fish species or food chain groups. One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that red hind grouper were larger, but had similar growth, in an area protected from fishing for three years compared to fished areas. One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that young lemon sharks in areas protected from fishing for 20 years had similar growth rates, but lower condition, than sharks in unprotected fished areas.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)\\u00a0\\n\\nBehaviour change (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in the Pacific and Indian Oceans\\u00a0found that surgeonfish and parrotfish inside established protected areas where fishing was prohibited, showed a similar avoidance response to fishing gears as in fished areas, and this increased with increasing fishing intensity outside the protected areas. One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that in non-fished areas protected for one and 24 years, fish grazing rates were higher compared to fished areas.\\n\\n\\u00a0OTHER (15 STUDIES)\\n\\nUse (7 studies): Four of six site comparison studies in the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0and the Tasman Sea\\u00a0found that marine protected areas where all fishing had been prohibited for at least five to 15 years, were used for a large proportion of time by shark and ray species\\u00a0and commercially important reef fish species, compared to fished areas, thus were provided protection from fishing. Two other studies\\u00a0found that time spent inside areas closed to all fishing for 20 years\\u00a0and over 30 years, varied between species and with size for three shark species\\u00a0and with size for giant trevally. One replicated study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that most individuals of five fish species remained inside a marine reserve zone closed to fishing over a nine-year period.\\n\\n\\nCatch abundance (2 studies): One of two site comparison studies in the Mediterranean Sea\\u00a0and Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found that commercial fish catch rates in small-scale traditional fisheries were highest closest to a marine reserve closed to all fishing for 22 years, and decreased with increasing distance from the reserve. The other study\\u00a0found that there was no increase in fish catch rates in commercially landed catch in the five years after a no-fishing zone was implemented in a co-managed protected area.\\nStock biomass (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that the stock biomass (the harvested portion of the population) of reef fish species was highest in enforced protected areas closed to all fishing, compared to various other area management regimes.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\nFishing mortality (2 studies): Two site comparison studies in the North Sea\\u00a0and Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found that prohibiting fishing in protected areas resulted in reduced commercial fishing mortality of corkwing wrasse tagged inside non-fished marine reserves compared to fished areas, and that the overall fishing mortality of grey reef sharks tagged inside protected areas was low.\"\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from multiple studies, temporary and long-term fishery closures show different effects on marine fish populations. Temporary closures (Action ID 2664) showed mixed results with one study finding no increase in cod biomass, survival, or length composition over nine years compared to fished areas, while another study found that during a temporary grouper fishery closure, spear fisher catch numbers of other fish groups (herbivores) increased, indicating they were being targeted more compared to the open season. Catch rates of red mullet and total catch increased after temporary closures in targeted fisheries over 10 years, but European hake showed no change.\n\nLong-term fishery closures (Action ID 2655) demonstrated more consistent positive effects, with studies showing higher weights of young salmon returning to rivers five years after closure in the Norwegian Sea, and higher abundance of some fish species in closed areas compared to open areas after six to eight years. However, effects varied by species with some showing no change or even lower abundance. Long-term closures also reduced unwanted catch of cod and reduced overall fishing effort for lesser sandeel in the North Sea.\n\nComprehensive marine protected areas with complete fishing prohibition (Action IDs 2224 and 2682) showed the most robust positive effects after 1-25+ years, with 30 of 54 studies finding higher abundances of fish compared to fished areas, while temporary closures showed more variable and often limited benefits. The evidence suggests that long-term closures and permanent no-take zones generally provide more consistent benefits for fish population recovery than temporary closures.",

Eight studies found that inside protected areas prohibiting all fishing there were similar abundances of all fish, and all or most of the individual fish species/groups monitored, compared to fished areas between one and 20 years after implementation. The other sixteen studies\\u00a0found that the effect of prohibiting fishing in protected areas for three to 20 years on fish abundance varied between fish species or groups and on their fished status (fishery target or non-target)\\u00a0and/or position in the food chain. One also found that the effect varied with size or age of the protected areas.

The other review\\u00a0found that fish abundance varied between species in no-take marine reserves between one and 25 years old, and was affected by food chain position, level of exploitation and duration of protection. One replicated study in the Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found a long-term decline in the abundance/presence of eight of 12 shark and ray species inside an established (&gt;15 years) no-fishing protected area, however enforcement was poor. One before-and after, site comparison study in the Pacific Ocean, found no differences in overall fish abundance between a marine reserve closed permanently to fishing for five years and a closed area that was harvested for two years during the same period. One site comparison study in the Coral Sea\\u00a0found that in a no-take zone of an area protected for at least 10 years, fish abundance of four of six fish groups were similar to no-entry and fished zones, but two had lower abundance than the no-entry zone.

Three site comparison studies (one replicated) in the Coral Sea, Caribbean Sea\\u00a0and the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that fish size in protected areas that had not been fished for six to more than 20 years, varied between fish species or food chain groups. One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that red hind grouper were larger, but had similar growth, in an area protected from fishing for three years compared to fished areas.

One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that in non-fished areas protected for one and 24 years, fish grazing rates were higher compared to fished areas.\\n\\n\\u00a0OTHER (15 STUDIES)\\n\\nUse (7 studies): Four of six site comparison studies in the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0and the Tasman Sea\\u00a0found that marine protected areas where all fishing had been prohibited for at least five to 15 years, were used for a large proportion of time by shark and ray species\\u00a0and commercially important reef fish species, compared to fished areas, thus were provided protection from fishing. Two other studies\\u00a0found that time spent inside areas closed to all fishing for 20 years\\u00a0and over 30 years, varied between species and with size for three shark species\\u00a0and with size for giant trevally. One replicated study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that most individuals of five fish species remained inside a marine reserve zone closed to fishing over a nine-year period.\\n\\n\\nCatch abundance (2 studies): One of two site comparison studies in the Mediterranean Sea\\u00a0and Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found that commercial fish catch rates in small-scale traditional fisheries were highest closest to a marine reserve closed to all fishing for 22 years, and decreased with increasing distance from the reserve. The other study\\u00a0found that there was no increase in fish catch rates in commercially landed catch in the five years after a no-fishing zone was implemented in a co-managed protected area.\\nStock biomass (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that the stock biomass (the harvested portion of the population) of reef fish species was highest in enforced protected areas closed to all fishing, compared to various other area management regimes.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\nFishing mortality (2 studies): Two site comparison studies in the North Sea\\u00a0and Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found that prohibiting fishing in protected areas resulted in reduced commercial fishing mortality of corkwing wrasse tagged inside non-fished marine reserves compared to fished areas, and that the overall fishing mortality of grey reef sharks tagged inside protected areas was low.\"\n}"

Catch rates of red mullet and total catch increased after temporary closures in targeted fisheries over 10 years, but European hake showed no change.\\n\\nLong-term fishery closures (Action ID 2655) demonstrated more consistent positive effects, with studies showing higher weights of young salmon returning to rivers five years after closure in the Norwegian Sea, and higher abundance of some fish species in closed areas compared to open areas after six to eight years. However, effects varied by species with some showing no change or even lower abundance. Long-term closures also reduced unwanted catch of cod and reduced overall fishing effort for lesser sandeel in the North Sea.\\n\\nComprehensive marine protected areas with complete fishing prohibition (Action IDs 2224 and 2682) showed the most robust positive effects after 1-25+ years, with 30 of 54 studies finding higher abundances of fish compared to fished areas, while temporary closures showed more variable and often limited benefits.

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence, several spatial management actions show effectiveness for protecting spawning fish and their habitats:\n\n**Total Fishing Prohibitions in Marine Protected Areas (MPAs)** represent the most comprehensively studied approach, with 79 studies showing mixed but generally positive results. These areas, when enforced for 1-25+ years, demonstrated different fish community composition and higher species richness/diversity compared to fished areas in 14 of 20 studies. Thirty of 54 studies found higher abundances (density and biomass) of fish, including fishery-targeted species, though effects varied by species, food chain position, and habitat type. Importantly, 8 of 11 studies found larger fish overall and larger individuals of most species monitored.\n\n**Temporary Fishery Closures** specifically targeting spawning periods showed limited effectiveness. Five studies found no increase in spawning stock biomass, survival, or length composition of cod over nine years following temporary closures compared to fished areas. However, one study reported that tagged adult cod spent nearly a third of their time inside seasonally closed spawning areas, providing protection during critical periods.\n\n**Protecting Spawning Fish from Capture** through seasonal closures yielded mixed results. Four studies found no increase in Atlantic cod spawning stock biomass, survival, or length composition over nine years following implementation. However, two studies showed that closed spawning and nursery areas were used by tagged adult Atlantic cod during spawning periods and by young school sharks for up to 80% of time.\n\n**Prohibition of Bottom Fishing Gears** in specific areas showed variable results across three studies. One study found higher numbers of larger, older cod after 15 years, while another found species-specific responses varying with depth and temperature. Fish densities showed no consistent effect after 2-7 years in protected versus non-protected areas.\n\n**Zonation Systems** within MPAs allowing different activity levels showed positive effects on specific species, with crustaceans like lobsters showing increased abundance and size in no-fishing zones compared to areas with fewer restrictions.\n\n**Periodic Fishing** (allowing fishing only during specific periods) showed promising results in one study, with areas fished only for short periods having greater fish biomass than continuously fished areas and similar biomass to permanently closed areas.",

One site comparison study in the Coral Sea\\u00a0found that in a no-take zone of an area protected for at least 10 years, fish abundance of four of six fish groups were similar to no-entry and fished zones, but two had lower abundance than the no-entry zone. One replicated, paired, site comparison study in the Tasman Sea\\u00a0found that in a non-fished marine park zone abundance of commercially targeted fish was higher than partly fished zones but lower than unprotected areas after four to eight years.\\nReproductive success (1 study): One site comparison study in the Mediterranean Sea\\u00a0found more eggs of four commercially targeted fish species inside a non-fished marine reserve enforced for three years than in fished areas outside the reserve.\\nSurvival (1 study): One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that prohibiting all fishing in a marine protected area for three years resulted in similar survival of red hind grouper, compared to fished areas.\\nCondition (20 studies): Two global review studies\\u00a0(one systematic) and two systematic reviews in the Pacific Ocean\\u00a0and the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans\\u00a0found that prohibiting all fishing in marine protected areas for one to 27 years resulted in larger fish overall\\u00a0and larger blue cod\\u00a0compared to fished areas, but there were differences between individual fish families or species. Eight of 11 site comparison studies (four replicated, one before-and-after, one paired, and one replicated and paired) in the Tasman Sea, Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, Atlantic Ocean, Java Sea\\u00a0and the Philippine Sea, found that non-fished protected areas had larger fish overall\\u00a0and larger individuals of all or most of the fish species/groups monitored, compared to fished areas, after one to 22 years. The other three studies\\u00a0found similar fish sizes of all or all but one species, compared to fished areas one to 16 years after all fishing was prohibited. Three site comparison studies (one replicated) in the Coral Sea, Caribbean Sea\\u00a0and the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that fish size in protected areas that had not been fished for six to more than 20 years, varied between fish species or food chain groups. One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that red hind grouper were larger, but had similar growth, in an area protected from fishing for three years compared to fished areas. One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that young lemon sharks in areas protected from fishing for 20 years had similar growth rates, but lower condition, than sharks in unprotected fished areas.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)\\u00a0\\n\\nBehaviour change (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in the Pacific and Indian Oceans\\u00a0found that surgeonfish and parrotfish inside established protected areas where fishing was prohibited, showed a similar avoidance response to fishing gears as in fished areas, and this increased with increasing fishing intensity outside the protected areas. One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that in non-fished areas protected for one and 24 years, fish grazing rates were higher compared to fished areas.\\n\\n\\u00a0OTHER (15 STUDIES)\\n\\nUse (7 studies): Four of six site comparison studies in the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0and the Tasman Sea\\u00a0found that marine protected areas where all fishing had been prohibited for at least five to 15 years, were used for a large proportion of time by shark and ray species\\u00a0and commercially important reef fish species, compared to fished areas, thus were provided protection from fishing. Two other studies\\u00a0found that time spent inside areas closed to all fishing for 20 years\\u00a0and over 30 years, varied between species and with size for three shark species\\u00a0and with size for giant trevally. One replicated study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that most individuals of five fish species remained inside a marine reserve zone closed to fishing over a nine-year period.\\n\\n\\nCatch abundance (2 studies): One of two site comparison studies in the Mediterranean Sea\\u00a0and Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found that commercial fish catch rates in small-scale traditional fisheries were highest closest to a marine reserve closed to all fishing for 22 years, and decreased with increasing distance from the reserve. The other study\\u00a0found that there was no increase in fish catch rates in commercially landed catch in the five years after a no-fishing zone was implemented in a co-managed protected area.\\nStock biomass (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that the stock biomass (the harvested portion of the population) of reef fish species was highest in enforced protected areas closed to all fishing, compared to various other area management regimes.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\nFishing mortality (2 studies): Two site comparison studies in the North Sea\\u00a0and Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found that prohibiting fishing in protected areas resulted in reduced commercial fishing mortality of corkwing wrasse tagged inside non-fished marine reserves compared to fished areas, and that the overall fishing mortality of grey reef sharks tagged inside protected areas was low.\"\n}"

Six studies were reviews of marine reserves (New Zealand, Latin America/Caribbean, regions unspecified\\u00a0and across the world).\\n\\n\\u00a0COMMUNITY RESPONSE (26 STUDIES)\\u00a0\\n\\nCommunity composition (7 studies): Seven site comparison studies (two replicated, and one before-and-after) in the Mediterranean Sea,\\u00a0Indian Ocean, Philippine Sea\\u00a0and the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that protected areas where all fishing had been prohibited for between three and 16 years, had a different fish community composition, compared to fished areas.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\nRichness/diversity (22 studies): Fourteen of 20 site comparison studies (eight replicated, one replicated and paired, and one before-and-after) in the Indian Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, Philippine Sea, Tasman Sea, Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, Coral Sea\\u00a0and the Pacific Ocean, found that marine protected areas that had prohibited all fishing for between one to more than 25 years, had higher fish species/richness compared to fished areas. Six studies\\u00a0found similar fish species/richness between one and 20 years after all fishing was banned in protected areas, compared to fished areas. One systematic review in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans\\u00a0found no difference in species richness between unfished protected areas and fished areas. One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that the effects of prohibiting all fishing on fish species richness/diversity after 15 years varied with the sampling method used.\\n\\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (66 STUDIES)\\n\\nAbundance (64 studies): Thirty of 54 site comparison studies (18 replicated, eight replicated and paired, two before-and-after, one paired and before-and-after, and one replicated and before-and-after) in the Indian Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, Pacific Ocean, Tasman Sea, Coral Sea, Philippine Sea, Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and the Sulu Sea, found that marine protected areas that had been prohibiting all fishing for up to 25 years or more, had higher abundances (density and/or biomass) of all fish (total fish biomass, total fish density), fishery targeted fish species, non-fishery targeted fish species\\u00a0and all or most of the individual fish species/groups monitored, except fish densities (all or most)\\u00a0and non-fishery targeted species, compared to unprotected fished areas and/or partly-fished protected areas. The studies also found that in some cases where the total fish biomass or densities were higher in no-fished areas, the effect varied between individual groups of fish based on species family\\u00a0and/or position in the food chain, commercial target and non-target species, fish sizes, depth\\u00a0and habitat types. Eight studies found that inside protected areas prohibiting all fishing there were similar abundances of all fish, and all or most of the individual fish species/groups monitored, compared to fished areas between one and 20 years after implementation. The other sixteen studies\\u00a0found that the effect of prohibiting fishing in protected areas for three to 20 years on fish abundance varied between fish species or groups and on their fished status (fishery target or non-target)\\u00a0and/or position in the food chain. One also found that the effect varied with size or age of the protected areas. Five of six reviews (three systematic) across the world, in the Pacific and/or Atlantic Oceans\\u00a0and in unreported regions\\u00a0found that non-fished marine reserves with one to 27 years of protection had higher abundances of all fish, all fish and invertebrates combined\\u00a0and blue cod\\u00a0compared to fished areas, but there were differences between species/groups and fishing intensity outside reserves. The other review\\u00a0found that fish abundance varied between species in no-take marine reserves between one and 25 years old, and was affected by food chain position, level of exploitation and duration of protection. One replicated study in the Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found a long-term decline in the abundance/presence of eight of 12 shark and ray species inside an established (&gt;15 years) no-fishing protected area, however enforcement was poor. One before-and after, site comparison study in the Pacific Ocean, found no differences in overall fish abundance between a marine reserve closed permanently to fishing for five years and a closed area that was harvested for two years during the same period. One site comparison study in the Coral Sea\\u00a0found that in a no-take zone of an area protected for at least 10 years, fish abundance of four of six fish groups were similar to no-entry and fished zones, but two had lower abundance than the no-entry zone. One replicated, paired, site comparison study in the Tasman Sea\\u00a0found that in a non-fished marine park zone abundance of commercially targeted fish was higher than partly fished zones but lower than unprotected areas after four to eight years.\\nReproductive success (1 study): One site comparison study in the Mediterranean Sea\\u00a0found more eggs of four commercially targeted fish species inside a non-fished marine reserve enforced for three years than in fished areas outside the reserve.\\nSurvival (1 study): One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that prohibiting all fishing in a marine protected area for three years resulted in similar survival of red hind grouper, compared to fished areas.\\nCondition (20 studies): Two global review studies\\u00a0(one systematic) and two systematic reviews in the Pacific Ocean\\u00a0and the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans\\u00a0found that prohibiting all fishing in marine protected areas for one to 27 years resulted in larger fish overall\\u00a0and larger blue cod\\u00a0compared to fished areas, but there were differences between individual fish families or species. Eight of 11 site comparison studies (four replicated, one before-and-after, one paired, and one replicated and paired) in the Tasman Sea, Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, Atlantic Ocean, Java Sea\\u00a0and the Philippine Sea, found that non-fished protected areas had larger fish overall\\u00a0and larger individuals of all or most of the fish species/groups monitored, compared to fished areas, after one to 22 years. The other three studies\\u00a0found similar fish sizes of all or all but one species, compared to fished areas one to 16 years after all fishing was prohibited. Three site comparison studies (one replicated) in the Coral Sea, Caribbean Sea\\u00a0and the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that fish size in protected areas that had not been fished for six to more than 20 years, varied between fish species or food chain groups. One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that red hind grouper were larger, but had similar growth, in an area protected from fishing for three years compared to fished areas. One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that young lemon sharks in areas protected from fishing for 20 years had similar growth rates, but lower condition, than sharks in unprotected fished areas.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)\\u00a0\\n\\nBehaviour change (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in the Pacific and Indian Oceans\\u00a0found that surgeonfish and parrotfish inside established protected areas where fishing was prohibited, showed a similar avoidance response to fishing gears as in fished areas, and this increased with increasing fishing intensity outside the protected areas. One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that in non-fished areas protected for one and 24 years, fish grazing rates were higher compared to fished areas.\\n\\n\\u00a0OTHER (15 STUDIES)\\n\\nUse (7 studies): Four of six site comparison studies in the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0and the Tasman Sea\\u00a0found that marine protected areas where all fishing had been prohibited for at least five to 15 years, were used for a large proportion of time by shark and ray species\\u00a0and commercially important reef fish species, compared to fished areas, thus were provided protection from fishing. Two other studies\\u00a0found that time spent inside areas closed to all fishing for 20 years\\u00a0and over 30 years, varied between species and with size for three shark species\\u00a0and with size for giant trevally. One replicated study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that most individuals of five fish species remained inside a marine reserve zone closed to fishing over a nine-year period.\\n\\n\\nCatch abundance (2 studies): One of two site comparison studies in the Mediterranean Sea\\u00a0and Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found that commercial fish catch rates in small-scale traditional fisheries were highest closest to a marine reserve closed to all fishing for 22 years, and decreased with increasing distance from the reserve. The other study\\u00a0found that there was no increase in fish catch rates in commercially landed catch in the five years after a no-fishing zone was implemented in a co-managed protected area.\\nStock biomass (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that the stock biomass (the harvested portion of the population) of reef fish species was highest in enforced protected areas closed to all fishing, compared to various other area management regimes.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\nFishing mortality (2 studies): Two site comparison studies in the North Sea\\u00a0and Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found that prohibiting fishing in protected areas resulted in reduced commercial fishing mortality of corkwing wrasse tagged inside non-fished marine reserves compared to fished areas, and that the overall fishing mortality of grey reef sharks tagged inside protected areas was low.\"\n}"

One before-and-after study in the South China Sea\\u00a0found that in the five years after the creation of two marine reserves with limits on commercial fishing activity, overall fish density in the nearby wider region increased. One replicated, site comparison study in the Tasman Sea\\u00a0found that in areas of a marine reserve closed to commercial trapping, fish abundance varied over 10 years and was higher for some groups than others compared to reserve sites open to trapping.\\nCondition (1 study):\\u00a0One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that in marine reserve areas banning all commercial fishing for five years, overall fish size was bigger compared to fished areas.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\\n\\nUse (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in the Greenland Sea\\u00a0found that areas closed to commercial fishing (trawling) had higher recaptures of tagged smaller immature cod than adult cod over time compared to trawled areas, indicating they were more likely to have an increased protection from fishing.\"\n}"
