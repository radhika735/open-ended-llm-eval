No studies were found that evaluated educating the public to improve bat perception and behavior (action 1000), or educating farmers, land managers and communities about bat benefits for habitat management (action 2040). However, one UK study on engaging farmers and landowners to manage land for bats (action 1936) showed promising results: during a five-year project, the overall population of greater horseshoe bats at four maternity roosts increased, and 77 bat-related management agreements covering approximately 6,536 ha of land were established. Regarding general public awareness campaigns (action 162), a review of programs in the USA and Canada argued that education alone was not sufficient to change behavior, although it served as a necessary catalytic factor for economic incentives and law enforcement. While education campaigns for other wildlife groups (reptiles) have shown measurable conservation benefits including increased abundance (Philippine crocodiles), reduced poaching (leatherback turtle nests), and decreased human-caused mortality (Philippine crocodiles), similar evidence is lacking specifically for bat conservation initiatives.",

Red lighting has shown promise, with studies finding that red lighting resulted in higher activity for some bat species compared to white or green lighting, and more soprano pipistrelles emerged from roosts when lit with red light compared to white light (action IDs: 2021). Using ultraviolet filters on lights can also be beneficial, with one study finding that hedges lit with ultraviolet filtered lights had higher soprano pipistrelle activity than those lit with unfiltered light (action ID: 1020). Low intensity lighting is another strategy, with one controlled study in caves finding that low intensity white lights or red lights resulted in fewer bat flights than full white lighting (action ID: 1994). Directing lighting away from bat access points or habitats is recommended as a strategy, though no studies have yet evaluated its effectiveness (action ID: 2019).

However, another review found that while Yuma myotis and Mexican free-tailed bats recolonised most maintained roosts in similar numbers, pallid bats did not return after bridge replacement works (Action ID: 1966). Providing alternative roosts showed poor results - bat houses provided during bridge replacement were used by fewer bats than original roosts at one site and not used at all at three sites (Action ID: 2942).

A review of 109 studies found that 72 bat species used bat boxes, with 18 species commonly using them and 31 species using them as maternity roosts. Bat box design matters - studies found bats preferred black boxes over grey, white or wooden boxes, and occupancy varied with orientation, height, and position (on buildings vs trees).\n\nReinstating bat roosts in felled tree trunks (Action 2048): One before-and-after study in the UK found that a roost reinstated by attaching the felled tree trunk to a nearby tree continued to be used by common noctule bats as a maternity roost.\n\nCreating alternative roosts within developments (Action 949): Eleven studies evaluated creating alternative bat roosts within developments. Some studies found bats used purpose-built roosts after original roosts were destroyed, while others found lower usage than the original roosts.\n\nProviding bat boxes, bat grilles, and improvements to roosts (Action 95): No evidence was captured for the effects of these actions, indicating more research is needed.",

Four UK studies found that while development licences for bats increased, 81% of licensees did not conduct required post-development monitoring. Licensed activities during building developments had negative impacts, with 68% of roosts being destroyed. Only 31-67% of compensation roosts provided under licence were used by bats, and new alternative roosts were four times less likely to be used than retained roosts. Retaining existing roosts and access points during development (Action ID 947) showed better outcomes, with two-thirds of retained roosts being used after development, and retained roosts were more likely to be used than newly created roosts.",

Microclimate management is crucial, with one study showing increased bat numbers after artificial roosts were modified to reduce internal temperatures (action 2052). Bat boxes showed variable occupancy rates across 44 studies, with 31 species using them as maternity roosts, though only 18 species used them commonly (action 1024). Design factors significantly influence success: black bat boxes were used more than grey, white, or wooden alternatives (action 1024), and bats showed preferences for specific designs including multi-compartment boxes and concrete versus wooden materials. Position matters - bat box orientation and sunlight exposure affected occupancy, with boxes on buildings having higher occupancy than those on trees (action 1024). Height effects varied between studies, while location type influenced success, with farm forestry sites showing higher occupancy than native forest (action 1024). Artificial caves and hibernacula demonstrated gradual adoption, with one study showing increasing bat numbers over nine years after construction (action 2049). Success was enhanced when artificial roosts were installed in areas where bats were known to roost previously (action 1024). Tree hollow creation showed promise, with eight of 16 artificial tree hollows being used by long-eared bats (action 2047), suggesting that mimicking natural roost characteristics improves acceptance.",

The other two studies in the USA\\u00a0and UK\\u00a0found that bats displaced from buildings did not use any of 43 bat houses of four different designs\\u00a0or 12 heated bat boxes of one design. One review\\u00a0of 109 studies across Europe, North America and Asia found that 72 bat species used bat boxes, although only 18 species commonly used them, and 31 species used them as maternity roosts. Twenty-two studies (including 17 replicated studies, one before-and-after study and two reviews)\\u00a0found bats occupying less than half of bat boxes provided (0\\u201349%).

One of two studies in Spain\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0found higher occupancy rates in larger bat boxes. One study in the USA\\u00a0found that bats used both resin and wood cylindrical bat boxes, but another study in the USA\\u00a0found that resin bat boxes became occupied more quickly than wood boxes. One study in the UK\\u00a0found higher occupancy rates in concrete than wooden bat boxes. One study in the USA\\u00a0found that Indiana bats used rocket boxes more than wooden bat boxes or bark-mimic roosts. One study in Spain\\u00a0found that more bats occupied bat boxes that had two compartments than one compartment in the breeding season. One study in Lithuania\\u00a0found that bat breeding colonies occupied standard and four/five chamber bat boxes and individuals occupied flat bat boxes. Four studies in the USA, UK, Spain\\u00a0and Australia\\u00a0found bats selecting four of nine, three of five, three of four and one of five bat box designs. One study in the UK\\u00a0found that different bat box designs were used by different species. One study in Costa Rica\\u00a0found that bat boxes simulating tree trunks were used by 100% of bats and in group sizes similar to natural roosts.\\nBat box position (11 studies): Three studies in Germany, Spain\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0found that bat box orientation and/or the amount of exposure to sunlight affected bat occupancy, and one study in Spain\\u00a0found that orientation did not have a significant effect on occupancy. Two studies in the UK\\u00a0and Italy\\u00a0found that bat box height affected occupancy, and two studies in Spain\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0found no effect of height. Two studies in the USA\\u00a0and Spain\\u00a0found higher occupancy of bat boxes on buildings than on trees. One study in Australia\\u00a0found that bat boxes were occupied more often in farm forestry sites than in native forest, one study in Poland\\u00a0found higher occupancy in pine relative to mixed deciduous stands, and one study in Costa Rica\\u00a0found higher occupancy in forest fragments than in pasture. One study in the USA\\u00a0found higher occupancy rates in areas where bats were known to roost prior to installing bat boxes.

Design factors include: color (black boxes used more than grey, white, or wooden boxes), size (larger bat boxes showed higher occupancy rates), material (concrete boxes had higher occupancy than wooden ones; resin boxes became occupied more quickly than wood), compartment configuration (two-compartment boxes occupied by more bats than one-compartment during breeding season), and specific design variants (rocket boxes preferred over wooden boxes or bark-mimic roosts by Indiana bats). Placement factors include: orientation and sun exposure (affects occupancy with orientation and sunlight amount being important), height (studies show mixed results with some finding height affects occupancy while others found no effect), location type (higher occupancy on buildings than trees in some studies), habitat context (farm forestry sites vs native forest, pine vs mixed deciduous stands), and prior bat presence (higher occupancy in areas where bats were known to roost before installing boxes). Additional factors include the number of boxes installed (greater numbers across a site increase occupancy likelihood) and microclimate management (modifying roost temperatures can increase bat numbers). However, 22 studies found bats occupying less than half of provided boxes (0-49%), while nine studies found occupancy rates above 50% (54-100%), indicating that even optimally designed and placed boxes may not always be used.",

Twenty-two studies (including 17 replicated studies, one before-and-after study and two reviews)\\u00a0found bats occupying less than half of bat boxes provided (0\\u201349%). Nine replicated studies\\u00a0found bats occupying more than half of bat boxes provided (54\\u2013100%).\\n\\nOTHER (23 STUDIES)\\n\\nBat box design (16 studies): Three studies in Germany, Portugal\\u00a0and Australia\\u00a0found that bats used black bat boxes more than grey, white\\u00a0or wooden\\u00a0boxes. One of two studies in Spain\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0found higher occupancy rates in larger bat boxes. One study in the USA\\u00a0found that bats used both resin and wood cylindrical bat boxes, but another study in the USA\\u00a0found that resin bat boxes became occupied more quickly than wood boxes. One study in the UK\\u00a0found higher occupancy rates in concrete than wooden bat boxes. One study in the USA\\u00a0found that Indiana bats used rocket boxes more than wooden bat boxes or bark-mimic roosts. One study in Spain\\u00a0found that more bats occupied bat boxes that had two compartments than one compartment in the breeding season. One study in Lithuania\\u00a0found that bat breeding colonies occupied standard and four/five chamber bat boxes and individuals occupied flat bat boxes. Four studies in the USA, UK, Spain\\u00a0and Australia\\u00a0found bats selecting four of nine, three of five, three of four and one of five bat box designs. One study in the UK\\u00a0found that different bat box designs were used by different species. One study in Costa Rica\\u00a0found that bat boxes simulating tree trunks were used by 100% of bats and in group sizes similar to natural roosts.\\nBat box position (11 studies): Three studies in Germany, Spain\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0found that bat box orientation and/or the amount of exposure to sunlight affected bat occupancy, and one study in Spain\\u00a0found that orientation did not have a significant effect on occupancy. Two studies in the UK\\u00a0and Italy\\u00a0found that bat box height affected occupancy, and two studies in Spain\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0found no effect of height. Two studies in the USA\\u00a0and Spain\\u00a0found higher occupancy of bat boxes on buildings than on trees. One study in Australia\\u00a0found that bat boxes were occupied more often in farm forestry sites than in native forest, one study in Poland\\u00a0found higher occupancy in pine relative to mixed deciduous stands, and one study in Costa Rica\\u00a0found higher occupancy in forest fragments than in pasture. One study in the USA\\u00a0found higher occupancy rates in areas where bats were known to roost prior to installing bat boxes. One review in the UK\\u00a0found that bat boxes were more likely to be occupied when a greater number of bat boxes were installed across a site.\"\n}"

Twelve studies found that organic farming resulted in higher bat activity and species richness compared to conventional farming in some cases, with five of nine studies showing higher overall bat activity on organic farms. Agroforestry systems that retain or plant native trees and shrubs amongst crops (action ID 963) showed varied results across eight studies, with some finding higher bat species diversity and abundance in plantations with varied shade cover. Reducing pesticide, herbicide and fertiliser use (action ID 2013) demonstrated positive effects in four studies, with farms using fewer chemicals showing higher bat activity and species diversity. Managing hedges specifically for bats (action ID 1943) showed limited but positive effects in two UK studies, with hedges trimmed less frequently having more bat species and higher activity. However, there is currently no evidence available for several potentially beneficial practices including increasing semi-natural habitat (action ID 1938), retaining remnant forest (action ID 1947), managing ditches for bats (action ID 1944), practicing integrated farm management (action ID 169), or planting in-field trees (action ID 1946).",

Four studies evaluated rehabilitation of injured/orphaned bats. One study in Brazil found two hand-reared orphaned greater spear-nosed bats survived over three months in captivity and reached normal species size after 60 days. Two studies in the UK and Italy found 70-90% of hand-reared pipistrelle bats survived 4-14 days after wild release, with six of 21 bats joining wild colonies. One UK study found 13% of ringed hand-reared pipistrelle bats were found alive in bat boxes 38 days to four years after release.

Two studies in the UK and Italy found 70-90% of hand-reared pipistrelle bats survived 4-14 days after wild release, with six of 21 bats joining wild colonies. One UK study found 13% of ringed hand-reared pipistrelle bats were found alive in bat boxes 38 days to four years after release. Another UK study found bats that flew in large flight cages for longer periods survived longer and were more active after release. Importantly, no studies evaluated breeding bats specifically to supplement wild populations affected by white-nose syndrome.\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"2053\",\n    \"2054\",\n    \"2009\",\n    \"2039\"\n  ]\n}"
