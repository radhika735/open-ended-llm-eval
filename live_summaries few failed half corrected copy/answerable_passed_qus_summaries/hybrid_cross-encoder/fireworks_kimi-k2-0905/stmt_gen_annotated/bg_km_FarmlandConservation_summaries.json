Soil health improvements are consistently reported, with twelve studies from Europe and other regions finding higher soil organic carbon in soils under no-tillage or reduced tillage systems compared to conventionally tilled soil. Eight studies found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage, while four trials found higher nutrient retention. Erosion control benefits are documented, with seven European and international trials showing reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. However, potential drawbacks include increased soil compaction, with three replicated trials from Europe finding higher compaction under reduced tillage. Water management challenges are noted, with three European trials finding that conventional ploughing and sub-soiling improved the soil's ability to absorb water and increased soil water content. Yield impacts show mixed results, with one replicated study finding lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage. Some studies found negative effects on certain wildlife, with twenty-six studies from nine European countries finding reducing tillage had either negative, no effect, or no consistent effects on abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates, earthworm abundance, biomass, or species richness, mammal abundance, and some bird species.",

Two studies found that crop type affected the number of weeds under different tillage regimes.\\nOne small replicated trial in the UK compared bird numbers under two different forms of reduced tillage, and found more birds from species that make up the \\u2018Farmland Bird Index\\u2019 on broadcast than non-inversion tillage fields.\\nTwo studies looked at the long-term effects of reduced tillage on earthworms (after ten years). One study found higher earthworm biomass under reduced tillage, the other study found earthworm abundance was the same between conventional and reduced tillage plots.\\nThree of the studies mentioned above did not distinguish between the effects of reducing tillage and reduced pesticide and/or fertilizer inputs.\"\n}"

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done.

    "relevant_summary": "Available management techniques for restoring or creating species-rich wet meadows in European agricultural landscapes include multiple approaches that can be used individually or in combination. Water level management is a key technique, with raising water levels in ditches or grassland showing positive effects on wetland plants, invertebrates, and breeding birds (Action 121). Traditional water meadow maintenance involves managing water flow through irrigation systems, with studies from Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and UK showing increased bird populations and plant species richness (Actions 696, 3971, 119).\n\nVegetation management techniques include cutting or mowing, with 20 studies showing that cutting herbaceous plants can increase plant species richness and maintain stable vegetation communities. Summer cutting (June) was found to be particularly effective for maintaining vegetation stability. The timing of cutting is important, with different seasons producing varying effects on plant communities (Actions 3044, 3070, 1759).\n\nGrazing management is another important technique, with studies showing that light to moderate cattle grazing can maintain plant species richness similar to mowing regimes. Grazing intensity affects results, with intermediate cattle grazing showing higher abundance of marsh fritillary caterpillars compared to high or low intensity grazing (Actions 3050, 3112, 3971).\n\nFor restoration of degraded sites, topsoil removal has proven effective, with 6 studies showing increased plant species richness and improved establishment of target species when combined with seeding or planting. Introduction of target plant species through hay spreading, seed transfer, or planting seedlings is commonly used alongside other techniques (Actions 3415, 3221, 3426, 1711).\n\nCombined approaches are often most successful, with studies finding that removing topsoil and introducing target plant species together, plus managing water levels and using appropriate grazing or mowing regimes, provides the best results for restoring species-rich wet meadow communities.",

Set-aside areas demonstrate benefits across multiple wildlife groups, with 20 out of 34 studies showing benefits or higher wildlife use compared to conventional farming (action IDs 156, 175). A systematic review found significantly higher densities of farmland birds on set-aside fields compared to conventionally farmed fields in both winter and summer periods. Set-aside management influences outcomes, with naturally regenerated set-aside supporting more bird species than sown set-aside, and older set-aside (>1 year) harboring more plants and insects. \n\nIn contrast, converting arable land to permanent grassland has shown limited benefits for wildlife, with all seven studies finding no clear benefit to wildlife including birds, grey partridges, brown hares, and plants (action IDs 210, 561). One UK study even showed grey partridge numbers declined significantly after arable fields were converted to grassland. However, grassland restoration does show some positive effects on soil organisms, with increased diversity of soil animals, higher microbial biomass, activity and carbon storage under grassland compared to arable use (action ID 905).",

Physical nest protection methods include using individual nest exclosures or barriers around ground-nesting bird nests, which studies from Sweden and the USA found can increase hatching success and reduce predation rates. Habitat management alternatives include leaving cultivated, uncropped margins or plots (including lapwing plots) which provide nesting habitat and have been shown to increase northern lapwing hatching success. Planting wild bird seed or cover mixtures creates beneficial habitat that 32 out of 33 studies found increased bird populations or densities compared to other habitats. Set-aside areas provide important nesting habitat, with systematic reviews showing significantly higher densities of farmland birds on set-aside fields compared to conventionally farmed fields. Other non-lethal alternatives include reducing tillage practices which can increase Eurasian skylark nest density, creating raised nesting areas to protect from weather extremes, and implementing nest marking during harvest operations to prevent accidental destruction by farming activities. Undersowing spring cereals with clover and other cover crops has also shown benefits for bird species including Eurasian skylark and nesting dunnock.",

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes.

Six studies documented positive signs of restoration in less than five years, 11 studies found restoration benefits within 10 years, and two studies determined that restoration required more than 10 years. However, six additional studies noted limited or slow changes in plant communities following restoration efforts. Two specific studies from Germany and UK found that differences in vegetation between restored and existing species-rich grasslands persisted even nine or 60 years after restoration was initiated. The timeframe for seeing positive ecological changes therefore varies considerably, with some benefits apparent within 5 years, most within 10 years, but some grassland communities may take over a decade to show full restoration effects.",

Some agri-environment schemes enhanced wild bee diversity and abundance, particularly Swiss Ecological Compensation Areas, German organic farming, Dutch botanical agreements and Scottish Rural Stewardship (Action ID: 24). However, four European trials found no enhancement of bee numbers or species, and two UK landscape-scale studies found bumblebee populations were not enhanced (Action ID: 24).\n\nButterfly and moth responses show similar variability. Twelve of fifteen studies found higher species richness on scheme-managed land, while three found similar richness to conventional management (Action ID: 3915). Abundance results were positive in seventeen of nineteen studies, but some species showed lower abundance or similar levels to conventional farming (Action ID: 3915).\n\nWildflower strips and nectar flower mixtures generally increased butterfly and moth species richness and abundance, with eight of thirteen studies showing higher species richness than conventional margins (Action ID: 3932).

The same study found that heather moorland subject to a single controlled burn had more plant species eight years after management than control unburned plots (Action 152). This indicates that while swiping can increase plant diversity compared to no management, controlled burning may be more effective at promoting plant species richness than swiping in UK heather moorland management.\n\nEvidence also suggests that cutting to control bracken can increase the species richness of heathland plant species (Action 1653), though the effects may vary depending on the specific vegetation being managed. Overall, the available evidence suggests that controlled burning appears to be more effective than swiping for maximizing plant diversity in heather moorland management in the UK.",

Impacts included increases in the abundance of Scottish primrose and other broadleaved plant species, heather cover and numbers of true bugs, biomass of arthropods associated with the bird diet, number and diversity of moths and benefits to black grouse. Among other treatments, repeated cutting and grazing by goats were found to be effective in controlling the dominance of certain grass species. A review found management under the Environmentally Sensitive Areas scheme had broadly positive effects on moorland birds and a reduction in grazing benefited most bird species and increased heath vegetation and heather cover. A replicated before-and-after study found that moorland management under the Environmentally Sensitive Area scheme maintained the number of plant species in two out of three areas.\\nThree studies (including one before-and-after trial) reported mixed results for invertebrates or birds, where management to maintain upland heath or moorland benefited some but not all species or where the effect depended on the vegetation type. Treatments tested included reducing grazing intensity and grouse moor management (burning and predator control).\\nFour studies (including one controlled site comparison and two reviews) found that reducing the intensity of livestock grazing reduced the abundance of soil organisms including invertebrates, bacteria or fungi.

A replicated study from Ireland found that the application of farmyard manure had no long-term effect on invertebrates, whilst two studies from the UK found the increase in arthropod predators and springtails was only seen at a local not a field scale. A review found one study from the UK reporting that heavy applications of slurry can be toxic to common earthworms.\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"134\"\n  ]\n}"

However, some restoration efforts showed slower progress - three studies found that restoration was incomplete five, nine, or even 20 years later. Specific studies provide more detailed insights: grasslands restored from bare soil by seeding showed butterfly communities becoming increasingly similar to existing high-quality grasslands over the first 10 years after establishment. One replicated controlled site comparison from Sweden found that plant species richness increased with time since restoration. However, two studies from Germany and the UK found that differences in vegetation between restored and existing species-rich grasslands persisted even nine or 60 years after restoration. For wet grassland restoration, studies found some positive effects within five years, but restoration was often incomplete even after extended periods.

    "relevant_summary": "The evidence for hedgerow management and planting benefits to farmland wildlife is mixed and varies by species group. For hedge management specifically, ten studies from Switzerland and UK found managing hedges for wildlife resulted in increased berry yields, species diversity or richness of plants and invertebrates, and diversity or abundance of farmland birds (action 116). However, five UK studies found hedge management did not affect plant species richness, bumblebee queen numbers, or farmland birds, with two studies showing mixed or adverse effects including reduced hawthorn berry yield when management involved removing fruit-bearing wood (action 116).\n\nFor birds specifically, seven UK and Swiss studies found some species increased with managed hedges or were more likely to use managed hedges, though one study found no difference in species richness and four UK studies found some species declined or showed no response (action 177). For bats, one UK study found more bat species along hedges trimmed ≥3 years prior compared to recently trimmed hedges, though another study found no difference in pipistrelle activity between wildlife-managed and conventional farm hedges (action 1943).\n\nFor invertebrates, US studies show hedgerows can benefit pollinators with five studies finding more bee species in fields with hedgerows or in hedgerows themselves compared to field edges without hedgerows, and three studies finding more syrphid fly species (action 2515). For predatory invertebrates, one US study found more natural enemies in fields with hedgerows compared to weedy edges (action 2314).\n\nFor mammals, one UK study found establishing hedgerows alongside arable land increased small mammal abundance (action 2383). For reptiles, one Madagascar study found reptile communities in cultivated areas with hedges were more similar to forest communities than those from areas without hedges (action 3519).\n\nSignificant evidence gaps exist, with no studies found evaluating effects of managing hedgerows to benefit mammals (action 2382) or planting new hedges on bats (action 1942).",

A UK study found that agri-environment scheme prescriptions had local but not landscape-scale effects on bee numbers (action 24). In the Netherlands, a large replicated controlled trial showed that the average abundance of long-tongued bumblebees on field margins was positively correlated with the number of pollen and nectar agri-environment agreements in a 10 km grid square (action 21). However, two replicated trials in the UK found that bumblebee populations were not enhanced on farmland managed under agri-environment schemes at the landscape scale (action 24). For birds, twenty-six European studies found that agri-environment schemes increased population size or density for some species at the farm level, but landscape-scale effects varied (action 700). The Swiss Ecological Compensation Areas scheme, monitored at landscape scale, showed mixed effects with some bird species increasing while others decreased (action 145). A Dutch mosaic management approach within agri-environment schemes showed positive population-level changes for some wading birds like northern lapwing (action 130).",

For species-rich grassland restoration (action 3955), 2 of 5 studies found restored grasslands had lower total abundance of butterflies and day-flying moths compared to unmanaged abandoned grasslands, 2 studies found similar abundance to continuously managed grasslands, and 1 study found higher density of blue-spot hairstreak eggs. Reducing management intensity for butterflies and moths specifically (action 3958) showed 6 of 10 studies found higher species richness in less intensively managed grasslands, 3 studies found higher abundance of butterflies and declining macro-moths, while 4 studies found similar species richness between management types.

Maintaining traditional water meadows was found to increase population sizes or territories of species like northern lapwing, common redshank, and black-tailed godwit. Raising water levels in ditches or grassland was associated with increased bird numbers and breeding bird populations in agricultural landscapes. Mosaic management was particularly effective, changing northern lapwing population trends from decreases to increases and resulting in higher productivity for black-tailed godwits with reduced nest trampling by livestock. Delayed mowing or grazing dates led to increased breeding wading bird densities, though effects varied among species. Per-clutch payment schemes showed mixed results, with some studies finding slightly higher breeding densities of wading birds but no significant effects on overall population sizes over short time periods. Controlled water levels through agri-environment schemes were considered more effective than easier-to-implement options for providing good habitat for wading birds.",
