    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from multiple studies, several interventions have proven effective for restoring peatland vegetation. The moss layer transfer technique shows promising results, with studies in Canadian bogs demonstrating that restored areas developed bog-characteristic plant species within 11 years and achieved greater moss/bryophyte cover including Sphagnum compared to unrestored areas (Action 1804). Direct planting of peatland mosses is effective, with studies showing that planted Sphagnum had high survival rates (47 out of 50 planted sods survived for one year in Lithuania) and increased moss coverage in multiple locations including the Netherlands, Germany, Ireland, Estonia and Australia (Action 1818). Adding mixed vegetation to peatland surfaces shows consistent results across 18 studies in bogs, with Sphagnum moss present after 1-6 growing seasons in plots sown with vegetation containing Sphagnum, though cover was very low unless plots were mulched after spreading fragments (Action 1822). Direct planting of trees and shrubs demonstrates good survival rates, with eight studies reporting that the majority of planted trees/shrubs survived over periods between 10 weeks and 13 years in peat swamp forests and bogs, though species-specific survival varied (Action 1820). Multiple intervention approaches combining various techniques proved effective, with five studies showing increased total moss or bryophyte cover, and restoration interventions also increased cover of herbaceous plants and overall vegetation cover (Action 1803). Introducing seeds of peatland trees/shrubs showed mixed results, with some studies reporting successful germination and increased shrub cover, while others found limited survival of seedlings (Action 1824). Additional supportive interventions include removing competing vegetation, which aided Sphagnum moss survival when sown into areas where purple moor grass had been cut (Action 1840), and irrigation, which increased Sphagnum moss shoots and promoted colonization by wetland-characteristic herbs (Action 1859).",

However, Sphagnum moss cover declined in the translocated blocks in the UK study.\n\nFour studies evaluated restoration using the moss layer transfer technique, all in Canadian bogs, showing that the majority of restored areas developed bog-characteristic plant species within 11 years, with restored areas having greater moss and bryophyte cover than unrestored areas after 4-8 years (Action 1804).

Disturbing the peat surface has been shown to encourage plant colonization, with two studies in fens in Germany and Sweden reporting that soil disturbance affected plant community development over 2-3 years, with wetland- or fen-characteristic plant species colonizing disturbed plots (Action 1811). Filling or blocking ditches creates suitable conditions for natural colonization, with studies showing that blocked or filled ditches were colonized by herbs and bryophytes within 2-3 years, with vegetation cover being restored to natural, undisturbed levels in some cases (Action 1805). Pool excavation can also promote vegetation establishment, with studies in Canadian bogs showing that excavated pools were colonized by peatland vegetation over 4-6 years, though they contained different plant communities compared to natural pools (Action 1806). Creating mounds or hollows through roughening the peat surface (by harrowing, ploughing, creating vehicle tracks or adding peat blocks) has been tested, though studies focused on planted vegetation rather than natural colonization (Action 1834). Surface stabilization using coconut fibre rolls has been tested but did not significantly affect vegetation development in one UK bog study (Action 1815).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on studies evaluating policy and awareness-based approaches for peatland protection, several key strategies have shown effectiveness. Lobbying, campaigning, and demonstrating for peatland protection resulted in increased area of protected peatland in the UK, behavior change among major retailers who stopped buying compost containing peat from important peatland areas, and horticultural companies began marketing peat-free compost (Action 1849). Additionally, garden centres and local governments signed peatland conservation agreements following campaign pressure (Action 1849). Legal protection of peatlands showed mixed results, with some studies reporting that protected areas maintained greater vegetation cover than unprotected adjacent areas, though peatland area initially decreased before then increasing following legal protection (Action 1796). Payment schemes for landowners to protect peatlands demonstrated mixed effectiveness, with agri-environment schemes in the UK protecting bog habitat in three of six cases (Action 1799). On-the-ground protection measures such as anti-logging patrols resulted in decreased numbers of illegal sawmills in Indonesian peat swamp forests (Action 1800). However, some policy approaches lacked sufficient research evidence, with no studies found evaluating the effects of zero burning policies near peatlands or creating 'no net loss' wetland legislation specifically for peatlands (Actions 1856, 1797).",

General public awareness-raising activities (Action 1844) have also demonstrated impact, with one UK study reporting that following awareness-raising activities, the percentage of the public buying peat-free compost increased. Raising awareness through engaging volunteers in peatland management or monitoring (Action 1847) and raising awareness about problematic species (Action 1846) are additional awareness approaches, though no studies have yet evaluated their effectiveness.

Cutting to control problematic large trees/shrubs demonstrates effectiveness, with studies showing that tree/shrub removal can lead to plant community composition becoming more like undegraded, open fen and increased species richness and cover of fen-characteristic plants (Action 1772). One study found that species richness and cover of fen-characteristic plants increased following tree/shrub removal in a fen in Sweden (Action 1772). Additionally, cutting large trees/shrubs to maintain or restore disturbance has shown positive results, with one study in a fen in Poland finding that shrub removal (along with other interventions) resulted in plant community composition becoming more like a target fen meadow and increased abundance of fen meadow plant species (Action 1761). Physical removal of problematic plants has also shown benefits, with one study in Ireland reporting that cover of fen-characteristic plants increased after mossy vegetation was removed (Action 1768). Cutting in freshwater marshes has demonstrated increases in total vegetation coverage, plant richness, slack-characteristic plant species, and native plant richness between one and two years after clearing scrub (Action 3108). Grazing to maintain or restore disturbance shows mixed results, with some studies reporting increased cover of herb groups like cottongrasses and sedges, and reduced shrub cover in some cases, though effects vary between studies (Action 1762).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from multiple studies, different methods of introducing peatland vegetation show varying outcomes:\n\n**Whole Plants (Direct Planting):**\nFor herbs, three replicated studies reported that planted herbs survived over 2-3 years, though for six of nine species only a minority of individuals survived (Action 1819). Two replicated studies reported that individual planted herbs grew (Action 1819). For trees and shrubs, eight studies reported that the majority of planted trees/shrubs survived over periods between 10 weeks and 13 years, with species showing less than 50% survival including Dacryodes, poplar and katok (Action 1820). Four studies reported that planted trees grew, and one study reported that planted shrubs grew (Action 1820). For mosses, one study reported that 47 of 50 Sphagnum-dominated sods survived for one year, and two studies reported that mosses grew after planting (Action 1818). Five studies reported that after planting mosses, the area covered by moss increased in at least some cases (Action 1818).\n\n**Seeds:**\nFor herbs, two replicated studies reported that some planted herb seeds germinated, with three of four species germinating in a bog in Germany, but only one of seven species germinating in a fen in the USA (Action 1823). Three studies reported that plots sown with herb seeds developed cover of the sown herbs (Action 1823). For trees and shrubs, two replicated studies reported germination of heather and willow seeds in at least some sown plots, but one study reported that all germinated willow seedlings died within one month (Action 1824). Two studies reported that plots sown with shrub seeds developed greater cover of some shrubs than plots that were not sown (Action 1824).\n\n**Fragments/Mixed Vegetation:**\nSeventeen replicated studies reported that Sphagnum moss was present after 1-6 growing seasons in at least some plots sown with vegetation containing Sphagnum, with cover ranging from less than 1 to 73% (Action 1822). Six controlled studies found that Sphagnum cover was higher in sown than unsown plots (Action 1822). Five studies reported that Sphagnum cover was very low (less than 1%) unless plots were mulched after spreading fragments (Action 1822). For moss fragments specifically, eleven studies reported that Sphagnum moss was present after 1-4 growing seasons in at least some plots sown with Sphagnum, with cover ranging from negligible to greater than 90% (Action 1821). Six controlled studies found that Sphagnum cover or abundance was higher in sown than unsown plots (Action 1821).",

    "relevant_summary": "The most beneficial interventions for restoring open peatlands that have become overgrown with trees and shrubs involve a combination of cutting/removal techniques and water management strategies. \n\nCutting problematic large trees and shrubs (action 1772) in fens results in changed plant community composition becoming more like undegraded, open fen, with increased species richness and cover of fen-characteristic plants, and increased moss and vascular plant cover. Similarly, cutting large trees/shrubs to maintain or restore disturbance (action 1761) makes plant community composition more like target fen meadows and increases abundance of fen meadow plant species, while also increasing herb cover and biomass.\n\nForest plantation removal (action 1731) increases cover of herb species including cottongrasses and sedges, though it can reduce forest-characteristic moss cover initially. The intervention also increases total plant species richness, with effects being much smaller in rewetted plots than in drained plots.\n\nThe most effective approach combines tree/shrub removal with rewetting (action 1732). This combination intervention increases abundance of wetland-characteristic plants, increases Sphagnum moss cover in some cases, reduces cover of non-Sphagnum or forest-characteristic mosses, and increases cover of herbs including cottongrasses and sedges. It also increases plant species richness in rich fens and can reduce the number of tall trees present.\n\nRewetting peatlands alone (action 1756) creates conditions where drier grassland communities are replaced by more wetland- or peatland-characteristic communities, increases Sphagnum moss cover, increases cover of sedges, cottongrasses, and reed/rush species, and typically reduces or has no effect on tree and shrub cover. This intervention increases total plant species richness or diversity in many cases.\n\nFor controlling remaining problematic herbaceous vegetation after tree removal, cutting/mowing (action 1770) can increase presence of fen-characteristic plant species, increase Sphagnum moss cover, and reduce purple moor grass cover.",

Some evidence exists for general pollution mitigation approaches, though not specifically from agricultural sources. One study in a floating fen in the Netherlands found that cleaning waste water before it enters the environment (along with other interventions) increased cover of mosses characteristic of low nutrient levels and decreased vascular plant biomass (Action 1778). Three studies found that diverting or replacing polluted water sources increased Sphagnum moss cover in bogs and mosses characteristic of low nutrient levels in fens, with mixed effects on herb cover (Action 1779).

Reprofiling/relandscaping peatland before planting (action 1833) shows beneficial effects, with one study finding higher survival of sown Sphagnum mosses in reprofiled basins compared to raised plots after one growing season, and two studies reporting higher Sphagnum cover in reprofiled basins than raised plots 3-4 growing seasons after sowing. However, one study found total Sphagnum cover did not differ between reprofiled and raised plots 1-2 years after sowing. Creating mounds or hollows before planting (action 1834) has mixed results, with one study finding trees planted into peat mounds grew thicker stems than those planted at ground level, but two studies found that roughening the peat surface did not significantly affect cover of planted Sphagnum moss after 1-3 growing seasons. Adding fresh peat before planting (action 1837) showed positive effects in one study, with plots amended with fine peat supporting higher cover of two sown plant species than the original tilled bog surface, though fertilization cancelled out this effect for one species. Stabilizing peatland surface to help plants colonize (action 1815) was found ineffective in one study, where pegging coconut fibre rolls onto almost-bare peat did not affect development of vegetation cover. Disturbing peatland surface (action 1811) affected plant community development, with disturbed plots developing greater cover of weedy species and allowing colonization of wetland-characteristic species, though peat-forming species did not colonize. Some actions lack research evidence: removing upper layer of peat/soil before planting (action 1835) and roughening peat surface to create microclimates (action 1808) have no studies evaluating their effects.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, both mowing and grazing are alternatives to prescribed burning for fen vegetation management, with distinct effects:\n\n**Effects of Mowing in Fens:**\nMowing alters overall plant community composition compared to no mowing or grazing (Action 1759). Studies found that mowing increased cover of fen- or wet meadow-characteristic plants and increased total moss or bryophyte cover (Action 1759). Mowing reduced cover or abundance of at least one group of herbs including bindweed, reeds, sedges, purple moor grass and grass-like plants overall (Action 1759). Eight studies found that mowing increased plant species richness compared to no mowing or grazing (Action 1759). Fens managed by mowing had greater species richness of butterflies than fens managed by cattle grazing (Action 3950).\n\n**Effects of Grazing in Fens:**\nGrazing creates different plant community composition compared to mown fen meadows (Action 1762). Studies reported that grazing increased cover of some herb groups including cottongrasses, sedges or all grass-like plants, and in one study reduced purple moor grass cover (Action 1762). Grazed fen meadows contained fewer fen-characteristic plant species and fewer total plant species than mown meadows (Action 1762). One study found that plant species richness increased after grazing was reinstated while another reported typically no effect (Action 1762).\n\n**Comparative Effects:**\nA study found that the abundance of bog/fen-characteristic plants was similar in grazed and ungrazed fen meadows (Action 1762). Grazed fen meadows had similar vegetation structure to mown meadows (Action 1759). However, recently cut fens had fewer large copper eggs and lower caterpillar survival than uncut fens (Action 3950).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, several water level manipulation interventions have been studied on drained peatlands without planting. Rewetting peatlands by raising the water table (action ID 1756) was evaluated in 36 studies across bogs, fens, and other peatlands. This intervention typically caused drier grassland communities to be replaced by more wetland- or peatland-characteristic communities, with rewetted plots developing different plant communities compared to drained plots. Rewetting increased Sphagnum moss cover or abundance in 12 studies across multiple countries, though three studies reported mixed responses by species and two studies found no effect. The intervention increased cover of various herb groups, with particularly strong effects on sedges (increased in 13 of 15 studies), cottongrass (increased in 8 of 9 studies), and reeds/rushes (increased in 5 of 7 studies), while purple moor grass cover was typically reduced. Tree and shrub cover was generally reduced or unaffected by rewetting. Effects on overall plant species richness were mixed, with six studies reporting increases, five finding no effect, and one study reporting reduced diversity.\n\nIrrigation of peatlands without planting (action ID 1859) was studied in only two investigations. In a Canadian bog, irrigation increased Sphagnum moss shoots after one growing season but had no effect after two seasons. In a German fen, irrigation led to colonization by wetland- and fen-characteristic herbs while cover of dryland grasses decreased.\n\nDraining or replacing acidic water (action ID 1791) was evaluated in two fen studies in the Netherlands, showing mixed effects on Sphagnum moss and herb cover after 4-5 years depending on species and whether moss was also removed, though one study reported increased plant species richness.",
