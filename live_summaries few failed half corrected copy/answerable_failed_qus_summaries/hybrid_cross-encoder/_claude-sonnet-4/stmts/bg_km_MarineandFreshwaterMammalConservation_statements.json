On fishing vessels, acoustic devices had limited success for conflict reduction, with only one study finding no reduction in predation of squid catches by dolphins (Action 2815).\n\nLIGHTING MODIFICATIONS: Switching off artificial lighting at wild fisheries was tested in one study in the Puntledge River, but did not deter harbour seals from feeding on salmon released from a hatchery (Action 2825).\n\nTRANSLOCATION: Translocating mammals away from aquaculture systems has limited long-term effectiveness, as studies in the Tasman Sea found that more than half or nearly all of translocated Australian and New Zealand fur seals returned to salmon farms (Action 2776).\n\nREGULATORY APPROACHES: Two regulatory actions to prevent harmful deterrents at aquaculture systems and wild fisheries exist but have no documented studies evaluating their effectiveness (Actions 2746, 2779).",

Similarly, when tour boats followed approach regulations, fewer Guiana dolphins displayed negative behaviours such as moving away, diving, or group separation (Action 2838). Additionally, when boats approached seal colonies to 75 meters versus 25 meters, more seals remained on shore (Action 2838). Setting and enforcing vessel speed limits has proven beneficial for marine mammal survival, with studies showing fewer manatee deaths after speed limits were set and enforced in all areas, and fewer North Atlantic right whale deaths caused by collisions when vessel speed limits were set during specific periods in key habitats (Action 2777). Other potential management actions include creating designated areas or access points for recreational activities (Action 2842), introducing permits or licences for recreational watersports (Action 2841) and marine mammal watching tours (Action 2839), developing regulations for operating vessels around mammals (Action 2758), delaying or ceasing operations if marine mammals are detected within specified zones (Action 2898), and controlling human activity in marine protected areas with zonation systems (Action 2674), though no studies were found evaluating the effectiveness of most of these actions on marine mammal populations.",

Acoustic devices on fishing gear have been extensively studied and show promising results, with 14 studies demonstrating reduced entanglements of harbour porpoises, Franciscana dolphins, beaked whales and small cetaceans when acoustic devices were used on cod traps or fishing nets (Action 2808). In Australian waters specifically, studies in Moreton Bay, the Rainbow Channel and the Indian Ocean found that acoustic devices on fishing nets resulted in marine mammals approaching nets less closely and having fewer encounters (Action 2808). Deploying fishing gear at different depths has proven effective in Australian waters, with one controlled study in the Arafura Sea finding that fishing nets deployed 4.5 m below the water surface had fewer entanglements of dolphins than surface nets (Action 2793). Establishing handling and release protocols for captured mammals has shown measurable benefits, with one before-and-after study in the Great Australian Bight finding that introducing a code of conduct for releasing dolphins trapped in nets, along with avoiding dolphins during fishing, resulted in lower mortality of short-beaked common dolphins (Action 2829). Move-on rules for fishing vessels when mammals are encountered have demonstrated effectiveness in Australian waters, with the same Great Australian Bight study showing that measures to delay or relocate fishing if dolphins were encountered, along with releasing trapped dolphins, resulted in fewer short-beaked common dolphins being encircled and killed (Action 2790). Catch and hook protection devices have shown mixed results, with studies in the South Pacific Ocean (including Australia) finding that cage or chain devices on fishing hooks resulted in fewer unwanted catches of toothed whales, though effectiveness varied by device type (Action 2821). Acoustic devices on fishing vessels have been tested in Australian waters, with studies in the Rainbow Channel and Keppel Bay showing that acoustic devices deployed alongside vessels reduced surfacing and echolocation rates and time spent foraging or socializing of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins and Australian snubfin dolphins (Action 2815).",

For aquaculture systems, the evidence shows that replacing anti-predator nets more frequently at salmon farms resulted in fewer salmon losses to harbour seal predation (Action 2774). Acoustic devices at aquaculture systems demonstrated mixed effectiveness, with four of six studies showing that using acoustic devices at salmon farms reduced predation on caged salmon by grey seals, harbour seals and South American sea lions, while two studies found that acoustic devices did not reduce harbour seal predation at salmon farms (Action 2775). Translocation of mammals away from aquaculture systems showed limited effectiveness, with more than half or nearly all of Australian and New Zealand fur seals translocated away from salmon farms returning (Action 2776). For wild fisheries, the evidence is more limited and shows different patterns. Modifying fishing pots and traps to exclude mammals showed positive results, with studies finding that installing steel rods on lobster pots or metal frames on fishing pots reduced the number of Australian sea lion pups or grey seals and harbour seals that entered or became trapped in pots, and that installing wire grids or steel bars on fishing trap-nets reduced damage to salmon catches by seals (Action 2822). Acoustic devices on moorings in wild fisheries showed variable effectiveness, with one randomized controlled study finding that deploying an acoustic device on a mooring reduced the number of harbour seals feeding on migrating juvenile salmon, while other studies showed mixed results on marine mammal behavior (Action 2816). However, installing barriers at wild fisheries and switching off artificial lighting at wild fisheries both showed no effectiveness, with studies finding that these measures did not deter harbour seals from feeding on salmon released from a hatchery (Actions 2824, 2825). Notably, no studies were found evaluating regulations to prevent harmful deterrents in either aquaculture systems or wild fisheries (Actions 2746, 2779).",
