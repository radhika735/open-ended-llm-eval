In the UK, restoring moorland led to one or two pairs of northern lapwing breeding where none had previously bred; studies in the USA and Azores reported increases in target gamebird and seabird populations following shrubland restoration among other interventions, while a replicated UK study that combined several interventions found a negative relationship with the young-to-old ratio of grey partridges (364). In heathland/shrubland, restored moorland moth communities became more similar to established heather moorland than to degraded sites; in the Netherlands, heathlands restored by topsoil removal had lower butterfly species richness than the surrounding landscape, but within restored sites, abundance was higher where heather litter was spread; a UK site managed for heathland restoration supported a released silver-studded blue population that increased over 11 years and expanded its range (3946). In Mexico, restored shrubland had similar reptile and amphibian species richness to unrestored areas but higher lizard abundance (3751). For mammals, restored desert scrub or shrubland had species richness and small mammal abundance similar to undisturbed areas in the USA and Mexico; restoring shrubland after tree clearance did not increase mule deer use beyond tree clearance alone (2569). No studies were found evaluating restoration in areas predicted to have suitable future climate for shrubland species (1672) or actions to restore/create habitat connectivity between shrublands (1677).",

Adding topsoil alongside sowing increased grass biomass but reduced forb biomass compared to topsoil alone in a randomized, replicated, paired, controlled USA study (1857). Stripping/removing topsoil had mixed outcomes: two UK studies found no increase in heather or heathland species cover, one UK study found increased heather cover, another UK study found increased cover of both specialist and generalist plants without increasing species richness, one paired UK study found increased annual grass cover and decreased perennial grass cover, one UK study found turf removal reduced wavy hair grass cover, and a before-and-after UK trial found increased gorse and sheep’s sorrel cover and higher plant species numbers after stripping surface soil (1685). In heathlands restored by topsoil removal, butterfly species richness was lower than in the surrounding landscape, while abundance was higher where heather litter was spread compared to where it was not (3946). Adding mulch and fertilizer did not increase seedling abundance of seven shrub species and did not change grass cover in a randomized, controlled USA study (1694). Adding mulch followed by sowing shrub seeds increased seedling abundance of one of seven shrub species but did not reduce grass cover in a randomized, controlled USA study (1650). Using mulch alongside planting/seeding did not increase the number of shrubs or height of California sagebrush in a replicated, randomized, controlled USA study; in South Africa, applying mulch and sowing seeds increased seedling numbers but not survival (1706).",

However, two randomized, controlled studies found no increase in heather cover, one controlled study reported no change in bracken abundance, and one replicated, randomized, controlled study found no effect on species richness or diversity [1652]. Additional reported vegetation responses after bracken herbicide treatments included increased cover of wavy hair‑grass and sheep’s fescue, increased cover of gorse, increased abundance of common cow‑wheat, and increased numbers of silver birch seedlings in controlled studies [1652]. For grass control, four of five controlled studies (two replicated) reported lower grass or non‑native grass cover where herbicides were used, and two randomized, replicated, controlled studies reported reduced purple moor grass cover [1643]. Mixed or neutral responses to grass‑targeted herbicide included two randomized, controlled studies that found no reduction in grass cover, two randomized, controlled studies that found no change in forb cover, and a randomized, replicated, controlled study reporting no effect on common heather cover [1643]. Other plant community responses after grass herbicide included increased native forb cover in one randomized, controlled study, increased cover of heathland species in one randomized, controlled study, mixed effects on shrub cover in one randomized, replicated study, no effect on shrub/heathland seedling numbers in two randomized, controlled studies, and reduced abundance of one heathland species in one study [1643]. No studies were found that evaluated using herbicide combined with sowing shrubland species or combined with grazing to control bracken [1658; 1661].",

Heather regeneration responses were mixed: a Netherlands before‑and‑after study recorded increased numbers of common heather and cross‑leaved heath seedlings, while two UK site comparisons reported declines in common heather cover at higher stocking densities [1628]. Structural and ground‑layer effects included decreased overall vegetation height in a Netherlands before‑and‑after study and reduced grass height when pony numbers increased in a Spanish heathland [1628].

Species richness often increased in grazed areas in France, the Netherlands and Greece, but showed no change in Belgium and decreased in one Netherlands study (ID: 1628). Vegetation height decreased with higher livestock numbers in the Netherlands, and vegetation cover increased at one of five French sites but not at four others (ID: 1628). Grass responses included increased grass relative to heather with greater grazing intensity in a North‑Western Europe review; higher grass and sedge cover in high‑density or grazed sites in the Netherlands and France; reduced grass and herb cover in one USA trial; reduced grass height with more ponies in Spain; and mixed effects of increased cattle on grasses and herbs in the UK and Netherlands (ID: 1628).\n\nReducing numbers of large herbivores: Removing feral sheep, cattle, and horses increased shrub cover and reduced grass cover in the USA, and lowering red deer grazing increased the cover and height of common heather in the UK (ID: 1663).\n\nReducing livestock numbers: Reducing or stopping grazing increased shrub abundance or cover in UK and South African studies; UK site comparisons found heather cover declined with high density but increased with low density; ungrazed sites had higher dwarf shrub cover in the Netherlands; reducing grazing increased western gorse cover in Spain; two USA studies found stopping grazing did not increase shrub abundance; in France, ungrazed sites had higher ericaceous but lower non‑ericaceous shrub cover; and one UK study found mixed effects on shrub cover (ID: 1607). Reducing grazing increased vegetation height in one UK study but reduced heather height in another UK comparison (ID: 1607). Ungrazed sites had lower plant species numbers in France and the Netherlands, while reducing livestock increased plant cover and species numbers in Namibia/South Africa; other studies reported no change in species number in the UK, increased plant biomass in Israel, and no increase in plant cover on Gomera, Spain (ID: 1607). Grass and sedge cover were lower in ungrazed than grazed sites in France and the Netherlands; a USA study found mixed effects on grass cover; and a UK study found no change in rush or herb cover (ID: 1607).\n\nExcluding livestock with fences: Several UK and German studies found fenced areas had higher shrub cover/abundance, greater shrub biomass, and increased heather biomass and height, with higher heather presence/cover in Denmark and the UK; however, one USA comparison found decreased woody plant cover, and other USA/UK studies found mixed or no change in shrub cover (ID: 1545). One UK study found no change in plant species number but increased vegetation height and biomass, whereas another UK study found lower species richness inside fences (ID: 1545).
