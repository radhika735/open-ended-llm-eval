For salamanders, eggs were produced successfully in several studies, but success varied with tank habitat and was higher in semi‑natural than laboratory settings in some cases; some species produced eggs that did not hatch, one study reported 60% survival to hatching for Japanese giant salamanders, and larval development, body condition, and survival were influenced by water temperature, density, and rearing environment [838].

No studies were found assessing effects of riparian buffers during harvest on mammals or on butterflies and moths (2652; 3872). Coarse woody debris (CWD): In amphibians, retaining CWD in clearcuts produced no significant abundance difference for most species but overall amphibian responses (population, physiological, behavioural) were more negative where debris was retained; removing CWD in standing forest did not reduce diversity or overall abundance but reduced species richness in one study; migrating amphibians used clearcuts with retained debris more, and juvenile survival was higher in debris piles than open areas and similar to unharvested forest (843). In mammals, retaining/adding CWD yielded mixed outcomes: one study found more small mammal species groups where debris was present, another found higher numbers for two of three shrew species with increased CWD, while other studies reported no increase in small mammal numbers or records (2647). Gathering debris into piles increased mammal species richness and, in some cases, increased vole counts and small mammal abundance (2653). In reptiles, leaving debris after logging generally produced no changes in richness or abundance, though one study found higher richness and abundance than where debris was cleared and burned (3632). For birds, removing woody debris reduced overall breeding bird abundance and diversity and lowered nest survival for black-chinned hummingbirds, though some species increased after removal (345). Snags/standing deadwood: For reptiles, increasing snags and woody debris had mixed or no effects on diversity and abundance (3631). For amphibians, leaving dead or wildlife trees during clearcutting did not increase salamander abundances compared to total clearcutting, did not prevent abundance declines or composition changes relative to unharvested plots, and reproductive metrics were similar or lower in harvested plots including those with retained dead/wildlife trees (845). Variable retention (retaining structural elements such as live trees/snags): bird responses were mixed, with nine species at higher densities and five at lower densities in variable-retention stands relative to controls (332).",
