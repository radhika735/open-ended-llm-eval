Spatial–temporal measures include temporary closures, which showed mixed outcomes: cod biomass, survival and length composition did not increase versus fished areas, tagged cod spent about a third of time inside a seasonal spawning closure, real-time closures reduced the annual amount of cod caught, and some targeted fisheries saw increased catch rates after closures (2664); other temporary closures affected non-fish taxa, including reduced lethal turtle strandings and fishery shutdowns when turtle bycatch limits were reached (3545), and for benthic invertebrates produced varied changes in abundance and condition when areas were temporarily closed or reopened (2098). Long-term closures showed mixed fish responses but included reductions in unwanted cod catch when combined with gear-limited areas and reduced overall fishing effort for sandeel (2655). Size-based regulations include minimum landing sizes, where evidence on recruitment and discards was mixed, with some reductions in catches of the youngest fish in one case and persistence of immature fish in landings in another (2735); size limits for recreational species lacked direct evaluations for invertebrates (2274). Gear selectivity modifications offer alternatives to reduce mortality of non-target or undersized fish, such as fitting trawl nets with escape panels/windows and size-sorting grids, which reduced unwanted catches and improved size-selectivity in multiple studies (2727, 2725, 2721).",

In the Mediterranean Sea, site comparisons reported no increase in biomass for some targeted species 2–13 years after closure compared to a fished area, while other studies in this and additional basins recorded higher abundances for subsets of species (e.g., some commercially targeted and non-targeted groups) [2667]. In the Indian Ocean and Gulf of Mexico, among site comparison studies, some found higher abundances for parts of the fish community, while others reported mixed outcomes across species/groups [2667]. In the South Atlantic Ocean, one study found no change in fish species composition relative to fished areas, and among abundance-focused comparisons spanning this and other basins, responses ranged from higher abundances in some commercially exploited species to mixed effects depending on exploitation history [2667]. In the Tasman Sea, a before-and-after study found lower abundances for most species two years after closure in an estuary, while another study in a reserve zone closed to commercial trapping reported abundance patterns that varied over a decade and among fish groups [2667]. In the South China Sea, overall fish density in the wider region increased within five years after reserves limiting commercial fishing were created, alongside shifts in assemblage composition [2667]. Syntheses and multi-region studies of fully non-fished marine protected areas across the Indian, Atlantic, Mediterranean, Pacific, Tasman, Coral, Philippine, and Caribbean seas, as well as the Gulf of Mexico and Sulu Sea, frequently found higher total fish abundance/biomass and higher abundances of many targeted and non-targeted species compared to fished or partially fished areas, though several studies reported similar or species-dependent effects, with variability linked to species group, trophic position, fish size, depth, habitat, and protected area age/size [2682].",

Alternative designs/configurations of size‑sorting escape grids in trawls improved size‑selectivity for unwanted redfish, Greenland halibut, and target hake in some cases, with other studies showing species‑specific outcomes or no improvement [2728]. Decreasing trawl codend circumference/diameter improved size‑selectivity for haddock, Atlantic cod, whiting, European hake, and red mullet in several studies and a review, though effects varied among species and could be reduced for one species [2706]. In encircling nets, transparent netting panels improved size‑selectivity for one of four commercial fish species [2703]. Modified traps/pots with square‑mesh escape windows or larger mesh improved size‑selectivity for Atlantic cod, black sea bass, and most species tested, though one study found no effect for panga [2702]. Adding moving stimulator devices alongside square‑mesh escape panels improved cod size‑selectivity for one of three device types in the Baltic Sea [2729]. Some modifications showed no improvement: reducing the main trawl body size did not improve size‑selection of cod and haddock [2705], and LED lights on a size‑sorting grid did not improve size‑selectivity for long rough dab, Atlantic cod, haddock, and redfish [2695].",
