For butterflies and moths, studies from the UK, Ireland and Canada reported higher species richness and/or abundance along hedgerows than on beetle banks, non-hedgerow grass margins, field interiors or 5–10 m away, with one study finding similar richness to grass banks; planting gorse, oak and blackthorn within hedgerows supported more arthropod species (including caterpillars) than hawthorn, and moths near hedgerows were more likely to fly parallel to them [3976]. For bats, hedges trimmed ≥3 years prior had more bat species recorded and higher activity for two of eight species/species groups than hedges trimmed the previous winter, while pipistrelle activity did not differ between hedges managed for wildlife under agri‑environment schemes and hedges on conventional farms; no studies were found assessing planting new hedges for bats [1943, 1942]. For mammals, establishing or retaining/enhancing hedgerows alongside arable land increased small mammal abundance, brown hare density was higher in arable sites but not grassland sites, and Irish hare numbers did not increase [2383].\n• Beetle banks (general biodiversity): Reviews and replicated studies from the UK and Denmark reported mixed outcomes: some positive effects on invertebrate densities, distributions, ground beetle density and diversity (often season‑dependent), variation among grass species, group‑specific responses, several findings of lower or no differences relative to other habitats, bird use or increases when combined with other measures with mixed/no associations in other cases, lower plant species richness on banks in summer or limited benefits relative to other margins, and evidence that beetle banks act as nest sites for harvest mice [651]. For butterflies and moths in the UK, beetle banks had lower butterfly richness and adult abundance than hedgerows, similar caterpillar abundance to margins and crops, and higher micro‑moth richness and abundance than conventionally managed margins, with similar macro‑moth richness/abundance [3927]. For mammals, beetle banks had higher densities of harvest mouse nests than field margins [2393]. For natural enemies and pests, multiple studies and reviews from Canada, the UK and USA found more invertebrate predators on beetle banks than crops in several cases (with temporal/seasonal variability), mixed comparisons versus other refuges, variable or limited spillover into crops, largest pest reductions closest to or on banks, fewer pests in fields with a bank in one review, potential economic savings if pest thresholds are avoided, and higher predator numbers on certain sown grass species [729].\n• Other linear features: No evidence was found on managing stone‑faced hedge banks to benefit farmland wildlife [73].",
