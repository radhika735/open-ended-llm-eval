Growing cover crops as living mulches or between rows increased soil organic matter in two controlled trials, with one trial finding no effect (897). Growing cover crops in fallow periods improved soil structure and nutrient retention, with studies reporting increased soil carbon and, in several trials, increased nitrogen and carbon under cover crops, although some European studies found no marked effect on soil organic matter (898). Applying manures and agricultural composts increased soil organic carbon in multiple studies and increased soil organic matter in one controlled, randomized, replicated study, while some studies found no effect on organic matter (911). Applying composts (not otherwise specified) at high rates increased soil organic matter and microbial biomass in a controlled, randomized, replicated trial (889). Incorporating fresh plant material or crop remains (e.g., straw) increased soil organic carbon across multiple studies and, in some cases, improved aggregation and reduced nitrate leaching (910). Retaining crop residues increased soil organic carbon and nitrogen in two randomized, replicated trials (907). Reduced tillage increased soil organic matter relative to conventional tillage in multiple replicated studies and a meta-analysis, though some studies found similar levels (1371). No-tillage increased soil organic matter relative to tilled soils in many replicated studies and a meta-analysis, with some studies finding mixed or similar results (1369). Changing tillage practices toward reduced or no-till increased soil organic carbon across numerous studies and often maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure, though results varied by context (906).",

Mixed organic–inorganic amendments raised soil organic carbon and nutrients in several trials, with manure alone also boosting carbon; one trial found inconsistent nutrient effects [902]; incorporating plant material increased soil carbon across multiple studies and sometimes increased aggregate size, and straw combined with NPK raised carbon [910]; retaining residues increased soil organic carbon and nitrogen, sometimes only when fertilizer was applied [907].

Growing cover crops increased microbial biomass in several studies, with five replicated, randomized, controlled studies finding more microbial biomass and one study reporting inconsistent differences; one trial found greater microbial biomass under ryegrass than a ryegrass/vetch mix [1345, 898]. In perennial systems, cover or ground covers increased microbial biomass in some or all comparisons across four replicated studies [2304]. Reduced tillage increased microbial biomass in many comparisons (11 of 15 studies), though some studies found less or no difference compared to conventional tillage [1371, 2307]. No-tillage sometimes increased, sometimes decreased, and sometimes did not change microbial biomass, though several studies reported higher microbial biomass without tillage [2306]. Grass buffer strips increased microbial biomass in one replicated, randomized, controlled study [2308]. Adding sewage sludge produced similar microbial biomass to controls in two studies [2303]. Including legumes in rotations showed mixed effects on microbial biomass (more in some comparisons, less in others) [2305, 1368].",
