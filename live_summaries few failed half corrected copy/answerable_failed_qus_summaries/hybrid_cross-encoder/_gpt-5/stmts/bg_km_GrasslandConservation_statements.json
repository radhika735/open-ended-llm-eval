Managing vegetation after introduction by mowing can raise richness: annual mowing after sowing increased plant species richness versus grazing, and higher mowing frequency increased richness of characteristic grassland species and sown-species richness in trials [3419]. Transferring plant material such as green hay from intact grassland alongside seeding/planting sometimes increased target plant species richness and cover, though some studies found no change [3426]. Adjusting the season/timing of mowing can influence richness; in a fen meadow, species richness increased more over two years in summer‑mown plots than in spring‑ or autumn‑mown plots [1771]. Reducing overall management intensity on permanent grasslands (e.g., altering combinations of grazing/mowing/fertilizer) has, in several European studies, benefited plants, though results were mixed across studies [69]. Broader evidence on restoring or maintaining species‑rich grassland identifies effective techniques including grazing, introducing plant species, hay spreading and mowing, with many studies reporting increased plant species richness or vegetation quality under such regimes [133, 702].",
