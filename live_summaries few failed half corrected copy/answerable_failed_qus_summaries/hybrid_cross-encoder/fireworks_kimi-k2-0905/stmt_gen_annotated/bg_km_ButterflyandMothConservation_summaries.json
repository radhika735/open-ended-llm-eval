    "relevant_summary": "The most effective farmland management practices for increasing butterfly and moth abundance include: 1) Planting nectar flower mixture/wildflower strips (Action ID: 3932) - these provide essential nectar sources and habitat, with studies showing higher species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths compared to conventional field margins, cropped fields, or grass-only margins. 2) Converting to organic farming (Action ID: 3907) - organic farms show greater species richness and abundance of butterflies and burnet moths compared to conventional farms, with abundance increasing with time since conversion. 3) Increasing or maintaining natural/semi-natural habitat in the farmed landscape (Action ID: 3910) - farms with greater proportions of semi-natural habitat or woodland in surrounding areas support higher species richness and abundance. 4) Planting grass buffer strips/margins (Action ID: 3982) - particularly wider margins (up to 6m) and floristically enhanced grass buffers show higher abundance and species richness compared to cropped field edges. 5) Delaying cutting or grazing dates (Action ID: 3967) - grasslands cut once in July or September rather than May/June show greater abundance of butterflies and burnet moths. 6) Using rotational mowing (Action ID: 3966) - grasslands with staggered mowing or rotational management have higher species richness and abundance compared to annual full-site mowing. 7) Leaving unsprayed conservation headlands (Action ID: 3898) - these show greater species richness and abundance of butterflies compared to sprayed headlands. 8) Creating uncultivated margins (Action ID: 3981) - longer or wider uncultivated margins that are not cut, or only cut in spring/autumn, support higher species richness and abundance compared to summer-cut margins.",

    "relevant_summary": "Alternative management strategies to prescribed burning for maintaining open grassland habitats for butterflies include rotational mowing, changing mowing regimes, grazing management, mechanical vegetation removal, and herbicide application. Rotational mowing (mowing strips in alternate years or leaving some areas uncut) can increase butterfly species richness and abundance compared to annual complete mowing. Delaying cutting dates to July or September rather than May/June can increase butterfly abundance. Changing mowing regimes (such as mowing in August vs November) can maintain caterpillar populations. Grazing management shows mixed results - intensive grazing generally reduces butterfly abundance compared to light or no grazing, while traditional low-intensity grazing can be beneficial. Mechanical removal of mid-storey or ground vegetation and herbicide application are additional alternatives, though evidence for their effectiveness specifically for butterflies is limited. Maintaining species-rich semi-natural grasslands through extensive management (light grazing or annual mowing) can support butterfly communities.",

One of three replicated, site comparison studies in Germany\\u00a0and Switzerland\\u00a0found that traditional hay meadows mown once/year in June or July had a higher abundance of heath fritillary adults and caterpillars than old, abandoned meadows. One study found that summer-grazed or mown grasslands had a higher abundance of farmland butterflies and burnet moths, but a lower abundance of woodland butterflies and burnet moths, than abandoned grasslands. The third study found that mown grasslands had a lower abundance of moths than unmown grasslands, but grazed grasslands had a similar abundance of moths to ungrazed grasslands. Two replicated, site comparison studies in China\\u00a0and Switzerland\\u00a0found that semi-natural grasslands managed by grazing\\u00a0or cutting twice/year after mid-June\\u00a0had a lower abundance of marsh fritillary eggs and caterpillars\\u00a0and adult butterflies\\u00a0than ungrazed margins and intercrops\\u00a0or sown wildflower strips. One replicated, site comparison study in Hungary\\u00a0found that semi-natural grasslands managed by either light grazing or mowing once/year in May or June had a higher abundance of butterflies than conventional wheat fields.\\nSurvival (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in China\\u00a0found that marsh fritillary eggs had a similar survival rate in uncultivated, grazed meadows and cultivated, ungrazed field margins and intercrops, but the survival of caterpillars was higher in the grazed meadows.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (5 STUDIES)\\nUse (5 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies in Austria\\u00a0and Germany\\u00a0found that 14 species of moth\\u00a0preferred grazed pastures while 24 others avoided them, and three species of butterfly\\u00a0and ten nocturnal moths\\u00a0preferred mown meadows, while 19 nocturnal moth species avoided them. One replicated, site comparison study in Spain\\u00a0found that meadows managed by summer-grazing or hay-mowing were more likely to be occupied by grizzled skipper and painted lady than unmanaged meadows, but small pearl-bordered fritillary occurred less frequently in grazed meadows than in hay meadows or abandoned meadows. One replicated, site comparison study in Finland and Russia\\u00a0found that three of 37 butterfly species preferred meadows which were mown annually in July or August to cattle-grazed pasture, but the other 34 species showed no preference. One replicated, site comparison study in China\\u00a0found that uncultivated, grazed meadows were less likely to be occupied by marsh fritillary eggs and caterpillars than cultivated field margins and intercrops.\"\n}"

Retaining connectivity between habitat patches helps butterfly populations persist, with well-connected low quality habitat patches more likely to retain Alcon large blue populations than less well connected patches. Habitat corridors also facilitate movement, as common buckeye butterflies were more likely to colonize distant habitat patches when released on corridors of suitable habitat. Restoring or creating habitat connectivity has been shown to increase the abundance of multiple butterfly species, including Karner blue, high brown fritillary, small pearl-bordered fritillary, marsh fritillary, and regal fritillary butterflies. Connected habitat patches also promote movement between patches, with common buckeye and variegated fritillary butterflies more likely to move between connected than unconnected patches. Grassland strips providing nectar or shelter were more likely to be used by butterfly species than strips with no resources.",

    "relevant_summary": "Multiple UK studies demonstrate that reducing management intensity on permanent grasslands significantly benefits butterfly and moth populations. Key techniques include: 1) Rotational mowing - cutting strips in alternate years or leaving rotational areas uncut increases butterfly and burnet moth abundance compared to annual complete mowing, with two heath fritillary populations surviving on rotationally mown grasslands while six went extinct on unmanaged grasslands; 2) Delayed cutting - mowing grassland once in July instead of May/June increases butterfly abundance and species richness, with September cutting maintaining stable scarce large blue butterfly populations while May mowing led to decreases over time; 3) Reducing fertilizer and chemical inputs - unfertilized UK grasslands support greater species richness of specialist moths and similar abundance of adult butterflies compared to fertilized grasslands; 4) Altering mowing regimes on road verges and greenspaces - less frequent mowing or leaving areas unmown increases butterfly species richness and abundance compared to regularly mown areas. These findings are supported by evidence that 24 out of 58 moth species prefer less intensively managed UK grasslands, and reducing grazing combined with stopping chemical applications increased both species richness and total abundance of large moths.",

The German study found managed orchards had similar species richness but lower abundance of butterflies and burnet moths compared to abandoned orchards, and similar community composition between managed and abandoned orchards. The USA study found unmanaged and partially managed orchards had greater species richness and diversity of leaf-eating arthropods (including caterpillars) than commercially managed orchards.\n\nFor vineyard management: Two studies evaluated managing vineyards for butterflies and moths, one in the USA and one in Spain. The USA study found grass strips between vine rows had greater butterfly species richness than vine rows themselves, and vineyards with fewer chemicals had greater butterfly species richness than conventionally managed vineyards. Another USA study found vineyards managed to encourage native plants with rare insecticide use had greater butterfly abundance than conventionally managed vineyards.\n\nFor chemical reductions: Eleven studies evaluated reducing fertilizer, pesticide or herbicide use generally, with two studies each in the USA and Germany. These found that orchards, crop edges, farms, vineyards and agricultural landscapes managed with reduced or no chemical inputs had greater species richness and abundance of adult butterflies and moths, or caterpillars, compared to conventional chemical applications.\n\nFor organic farming: Thirteen studies evaluated converting to organic farming, including one study in Germany. Seven of eleven studies found organic farms had greater species richness of butterflies and moths than conventional farms, and seven of eleven studies found organic farms had greater abundance of butterflies and moths than conventional farms.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from action documents, several grazing management strategies show beneficial effects for butterfly species richness in European grasslands:\n\nReducing grazing intensity by lowering stocking density appears to be one of the most beneficial strategies. Five of eight replicated studies in the UK, Sweden, Germany, USA and Switzerland found that grasslands grazed with lower stocking densities of sheep, cattle or mixed livestock had greater species richness of adult butterflies, all moths and burnet moths compared to higher stocking densities (Action 3959).\n\nSeasonal removal of livestock also shows benefits for butterfly richness. Two of three controlled studies in the UK found that grasslands where cattle or sheep were removed during summer months had similar or greater species richness of butterflies compared to continuously grazed grasslands (Action 3960).\n\nRotational grazing demonstrates positive effects with two of four studies in France and USA finding that rotationally grazed grasslands had greater species richness of butterflies and burnet moths than continuously grazed grasslands, though results varied by stocking density and study duration (Action 3965).\n\nChanging livestock type can also benefit butterfly richness, with studies in Sweden and France finding that semi-natural grasslands grazed by cattle or horses had greater species richness of butterflies and burnet moths than sheep-grazed grasslands (Action 3963).\n\nConversely, increasing grazing intensity or cutting frequency generally shows negative effects, with studies finding lower species richness and abundance of butterflies in intensively grazed sites compared to low or no grazing (Action 3962).\n\nCeasing grazing entirely produces mixed results - some studies show increased butterfly richness after 4-10 years of abandonment, while others show similar or reduced richness compared to grazed grasslands (Action 3956).",

One replicated, site comparison study in Switzerland\\u00a0found that meadows managed by mowing at least twice/year after mid-June had a different community composition of butterflies to sown wildflower strips.\\nRichness/diversity (11 studies): Three of six site comparison studies (including five replicated studies) in Germany, the USA, Russia and Finland, Italy\\u00a0and the Czech Republic\\u00a0found that the species richness of butterflies was similar on semi-natural grassland managed by light grazing or by annual mowing in July or August, and on prairies managed by cattle grazing and/or rotational burning. One study found that the species richness of butterflies was higher in grassland managed by sheep and cattle grazing than in grassland mown annually for hay in June. One study found that the species richness of moths was higher in grassland managed by annual mowing than grassland managed by grazing, and the species richness of butterflies was highest in grasslands where mowing was staggered throughout the year, with some areas left uncut. The sixth study found that in some areas, the species richness of specialist and grassland butterflies was higher in prairies managed by two-year rotational haying, and in other areas it was higher in prairies managed by grazing, but in all cases richness was higher at sites longer after they were last managed. Two replicated, site comparison studies in Germany\\u00a0found that species-rich grasslands managed by summer-grazing, grazing\\u00a0or mowing\\u00a0had a similar species richness of butterflies and burnet moths\\u00a0and nocturnal moths\\u00a0to unmanaged grassland. However, one of these studies also found that grasslands managed by mowing had a lower species richness of nocturnal moths than unmown grassland. Two replicated, site comparison studies in Germany\\u00a0and Hungary\\u00a0found that old meadows mown in July\\u00a0and lightly grazed or annually mown meadows\\u00a0had a higher species richness of adult butterflies\\u00a0and caterpillars\\u00a0than recently established set-aside\\u00a0or cereal crops. One replicated, site comparison study in Switzerland\\u00a0found that meadows mown at least twice/year after mid-June had a similar species richness of butterflies to sown wildflower strips.\\n\\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (16 STUDIES)\\n\\nAbundance (16 studies): Five of ten site comparison studies (including nine replicated studies) in Germany, the USA, Russia and Finland, Italy, Spain\\u00a0and the Czech Republic\\u00a0found that semi-natural grasslands had a similar abundance of butterflies generally, and individual species of butterflies\\u00a0and moth caterpillars, when managed by extensive sheep, sheep and goat, cattle\\u00a0or livestock\\u00a0grazing compared to annual\\u00a0or occasional\\u00a0mowing, or rotational mowing or burning. Four of these studies found that grasslands managed by cattle, sheep\\u00a0or livestock\\u00a0grazing had a higher abundance of butterflies generally, and individual species of butterflies\\u00a0and moth caterpillars, than grasslands managed by annual mowing, rotational burning\\u00a0or unmanaged grasslands. Three of these studies found that grasslands managed by haying had a higher abundance of individual butterfly species\\u00a0than grasslands managed by grazing\\u00a0or burning\\u00a0or unmanaged grasslands. Four of these studies found that specific butterfly species\\u00a0and all butterflies\\u00a0were less abundant in mown, grazed\\u00a0or rotationally burned\\u00a0grassland than in unmanaged, rotationally burned\\u00a0or grazed and burned grassland.\\u00a0The ninth study found that in some areas, the abundance of specialist and grassland butterflies was higher in prairies managed by two-year rotational haying or by grazing, but in all cases abundance was higher at sites longer after they were last managed. One of three replicated, site comparison studies in Germany\\u00a0and Switzerland\\u00a0found that traditional hay meadows mown once/year in June or July had a higher abundance of heath fritillary adults and caterpillars than old, abandoned meadows. One study found that summer-grazed or mown grasslands had a higher abundance of farmland butterflies and burnet moths, but a lower abundance of woodland butterflies and burnet moths, than abandoned grasslands. The third study found that mown grasslands had a lower abundance of moths than unmown grasslands, but grazed grasslands had a similar abundance of moths to ungrazed grasslands. Two replicated, site comparison studies in China\\u00a0and Switzerland\\u00a0found that semi-natural grasslands managed by grazing\\u00a0or cutting twice/year after mid-June\\u00a0had a lower abundance of marsh fritillary eggs and caterpillars\\u00a0and adult butterflies\\u00a0than ungrazed margins and intercrops\\u00a0or sown wildflower strips. One replicated, site comparison study in Hungary\\u00a0found that semi-natural grasslands managed by either light grazing or mowing once/year in May or June had a higher abundance of butterflies than conventional wheat fields.\\nSurvival (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in China\\u00a0found that marsh fritillary eggs had a similar survival rate in uncultivated, grazed meadows and cultivated, ungrazed field margins and intercrops, but the survival of caterpillars was higher in the grazed meadows.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (5 STUDIES)\\nUse (5 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies in Austria\\u00a0and Germany\\u00a0found that 14 species of moth\\u00a0preferred grazed pastures while 24 others avoided them, and three species of butterfly\\u00a0and ten nocturnal moths\\u00a0preferred mown meadows, while 19 nocturnal moth species avoided them. One replicated, site comparison study in Spain\\u00a0found that meadows managed by summer-grazing or hay-mowing were more likely to be occupied by grizzled skipper and painted lady than unmanaged meadows, but small pearl-bordered fritillary occurred less frequently in grazed meadows than in hay meadows or abandoned meadows. One replicated, site comparison study in Finland and Russia\\u00a0found that three of 37 butterfly species preferred meadows which were mown annually in July or August to cattle-grazed pasture, but the other 34 species showed no preference. One replicated, site comparison study in China\\u00a0found that uncultivated, grazed meadows were less likely to be occupied by marsh fritillary eggs and caterpillars than cultivated field margins and intercrops.\"\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "Research has shown several alternative management practices for field margins and headlands that benefit butterfly populations on UK farmland beyond sowing wildflower mixes. Conservation headlands (leaving headlands unsprayed) have been shown to increase both butterfly species richness and abundance compared to sprayed headlands, with studies finding greater species richness of butterflies and higher abundance of butterflies and caterpillars in unsprayed headlands. Hedgerow management practices, including planting new hedges and managing existing hedgerows for wildlife, have demonstrated significant benefits. Planting new hedges has been found to result in higher species richness of butterflies and macro-moths compared to crops or pasture, with higher abundance of butterflies, moths and gatekeepers along hedgerows. Managing hedgerows through cutting regimes (cutting once every 2-3 years or in autumn rather than winter) has shown higher abundance of adult butterflies and moths, with hedgerows containing trees supporting higher butterfly abundance than simple hedgerows. Creating uncultivated margins around fields has shown benefits including higher species richness of butterflies in longer or wider margins and higher abundance of butterflies compared to cereal fields. Grass buffer strips planted around fields have been found effective when they are wider (up to 6m wide), with floristically enhanced grass buffers showing greater species richness and abundance of butterflies than standard grass margins. Leaving uncropped, cultivated margins can increase butterfly abundance in some species, while buffer strips to reduce pesticide run-off have been shown to increase moth abundance compared to conventionally managed margins. Proper cutting management of these margins (cutting only in spring or autumn rather than summer) results in higher species richness and abundance of butterflies.",

Reducing field size or maintaining small fields has been shown to increase both species richness and abundance of butterflies and burnet moths compared to landscapes with larger fields (Action ID: 3974). Creating beetle banks - raised strips within arable fields - can increase micro-moth species richness and abundance compared to conventionally managed field margins (Action ID: 3927). Planting new hedges within agricultural landscapes provides habitat with higher species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths compared to crop fields or pasture (Action ID: 3976). Leaving unharvested crop headlands within arable fields can create habitat with greater butterfly species richness and abundance than harvested crops (Action ID: 3924). Leaving uncropped, cultivated margins or plots within fields can increase butterfly abundance, particularly when managed under agri-environment schemes (Action ID: 3923). Planting wildflower strips or nectar flower mixtures within fields significantly increases both species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths compared to conventional field margins or cropped fields (Action ID: 3932). Finally, increasing overall crop diversity across the farmed landscape, while showing mixed results, represents another approach to creating habitat heterogeneity within agricultural systems (Action ID: 3921).",

For rotational burning, four replicated studies found that prairies burned more than 1-4 years ago had higher total abundance of prairie specialist, grassland, and all butterflies compared to prairies burned more recently (Action ID: 3883). The abundance of regal fritillary was higher in rotationally burned prairies four years after the last burn compared to one or eight years after burning.

One replicated, site comparison study in Switzerland\\u00a0found that meadows managed by mowing at least twice/year after mid-June had a different community composition of butterflies to sown wildflower strips.\\nRichness/diversity (11 studies): Three of six site comparison studies (including five replicated studies) in Germany, the USA, Russia and Finland, Italy\\u00a0and the Czech Republic\\u00a0found that the species richness of butterflies was similar on semi-natural grassland managed by light grazing or by annual mowing in July or August, and on prairies managed by cattle grazing and/or rotational burning. One study found that the species richness of butterflies was higher in grassland managed by sheep and cattle grazing than in grassland mown annually for hay in June. One study found that the species richness of moths was higher in grassland managed by annual mowing than grassland managed by grazing, and the species richness of butterflies was highest in grasslands where mowing was staggered throughout the year, with some areas left uncut. The sixth study found that in some areas, the species richness of specialist and grassland butterflies was higher in prairies managed by two-year rotational haying, and in other areas it was higher in prairies managed by grazing, but in all cases richness was higher at sites longer after they were last managed. Two replicated, site comparison studies in Germany\\u00a0found that species-rich grasslands managed by summer-grazing, grazing\\u00a0or mowing\\u00a0had a similar species richness of butterflies and burnet moths\\u00a0and nocturnal moths\\u00a0to unmanaged grassland. However, one of these studies also found that grasslands managed by mowing had a lower species richness of nocturnal moths than unmown grassland. Two replicated, site comparison studies in Germany\\u00a0and Hungary\\u00a0found that old meadows mown in July\\u00a0and lightly grazed or annually mown meadows\\u00a0had a higher species richness of adult butterflies\\u00a0and caterpillars\\u00a0than recently established set-aside\\u00a0or cereal crops. One replicated, site comparison study in Switzerland\\u00a0found that meadows mown at least twice/year after mid-June had a similar species richness of butterflies to sown wildflower strips.\\n\\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (16 STUDIES)\\n\\nAbundance (16 studies): Five of ten site comparison studies (including nine replicated studies) in Germany, the USA, Russia and Finland, Italy, Spain\\u00a0and the Czech Republic\\u00a0found that semi-natural grasslands had a similar abundance of butterflies generally, and individual species of butterflies\\u00a0and moth caterpillars, when managed by extensive sheep, sheep and goat, cattle\\u00a0or livestock\\u00a0grazing compared to annual\\u00a0or occasional\\u00a0mowing, or rotational mowing or burning. Four of these studies found that grasslands managed by cattle, sheep\\u00a0or livestock\\u00a0grazing had a higher abundance of butterflies generally, and individual species of butterflies\\u00a0and moth caterpillars, than grasslands managed by annual mowing, rotational burning\\u00a0or unmanaged grasslands. Three of these studies found that grasslands managed by haying had a higher abundance of individual butterfly species\\u00a0than grasslands managed by grazing\\u00a0or burning\\u00a0or unmanaged grasslands. Four of these studies found that specific butterfly species\\u00a0and all butterflies\\u00a0were less abundant in mown, grazed\\u00a0or rotationally burned\\u00a0grassland than in unmanaged, rotationally burned\\u00a0or grazed and burned grassland.\\u00a0The ninth study found that in some areas, the abundance of specialist and grassland butterflies was higher in prairies managed by two-year rotational haying or by grazing, but in all cases abundance was higher at sites longer after they were last managed. One of three replicated, site comparison studies in Germany\\u00a0and Switzerland\\u00a0found that traditional hay meadows mown once/year in June or July had a higher abundance of heath fritillary adults and caterpillars than old, abandoned meadows. One study found that summer-grazed or mown grasslands had a higher abundance of farmland butterflies and burnet moths, but a lower abundance of woodland butterflies and burnet moths, than abandoned grasslands. The third study found that mown grasslands had a lower abundance of moths than unmown grasslands, but grazed grasslands had a similar abundance of moths to ungrazed grasslands. Two replicated, site comparison studies in China\\u00a0and Switzerland\\u00a0found that semi-natural grasslands managed by grazing\\u00a0or cutting twice/year after mid-June\\u00a0had a lower abundance of marsh fritillary eggs and caterpillars\\u00a0and adult butterflies\\u00a0than ungrazed margins and intercrops\\u00a0or sown wildflower strips. One replicated, site comparison study in Hungary\\u00a0found that semi-natural grasslands managed by either light grazing or mowing once/year in May or June had a higher abundance of butterflies than conventional wheat fields.\\nSurvival (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in China\\u00a0found that marsh fritillary eggs had a similar survival rate in uncultivated, grazed meadows and cultivated, ungrazed field margins and intercrops, but the survival of caterpillars was higher in the grazed meadows.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (5 STUDIES)\\nUse (5 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies in Austria\\u00a0and Germany\\u00a0found that 14 species of moth\\u00a0preferred grazed pastures while 24 others avoided them, and three species of butterfly\\u00a0and ten nocturnal moths\\u00a0preferred mown meadows, while 19 nocturnal moth species avoided them. One replicated, site comparison study in Spain\\u00a0found that meadows managed by summer-grazing or hay-mowing were more likely to be occupied by grizzled skipper and painted lady than unmanaged meadows, but small pearl-bordered fritillary occurred less frequently in grazed meadows than in hay meadows or abandoned meadows. One replicated, site comparison study in Finland and Russia\\u00a0found that three of 37 butterfly species preferred meadows which were mown annually in July or August to cattle-grazed pasture, but the other 34 species showed no preference. One replicated, site comparison study in China\\u00a0found that uncultivated, grazed meadows were less likely to be occupied by marsh fritillary eggs and caterpillars than cultivated field margins and intercrops.\"\n}"

The other three studies found that hedgerows managed according to agri-environment scheme prescriptions (including less frequent\\u00a0or winter cutting, gap-filling\\u00a0and restricted mowing, in one case in combination with other agri-environment scheme habitat) had a similar species richness of butterflies\\u00a0and moths\\u00a0to conventionally managed hedgerows.\\n\\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (17 STUDIES)\\n\\nAbundance (17 studies): Four of six replicated studies (including four randomized, paired, controlled studies, one controlled study, and one paired, site comparison study) in the UK\\u00a0found that hedgerows cut once every 2\\u20133 years, cut in autumn, or cut to allow incremental growth, had a higher abundance of adult butterflies and moths, moth caterpillars and pupae\\u00a0and brown hairstreak eggs\\u00a0than hedgerows cut to the same size every winter. However, one of these studies also found that hedgerows cut to allow incremental growth had a similar abundance of moth caterpillars and pupae to hedgerows cut to the same size. The other two studies found that hedgerows managed by gap-filling and cutting every three years had a similar abundance of moths to conventionally managed hedgerows, and that hedgerows cut in winter, or less frequently in autumn, had more concealed moth caterpillars, but a similar abundance of free-living caterpillars, to hedgerows cut annually in autumn. Three of five replicated, site comparison studies (including one paired study) in the UK\\u00a0and Costa Rica\\u00a0found that hedgerows with trees had a similar total abundance of macro-moths to hedgerows without trees. The other two studies found that hedgerows with trees, or with a more complex structure, had a higher abundance of butterflies\\u00a0and pale shining brown moths\\u00a0than simple hedgerows. Two replicated, site comparison studies in Belgium\\u00a0and Italy\\u00a0found that hedgerows managed with scalloped edges, or maintained at below 1 m tall, had more brown hairstreak eggs\\u00a0and a higher abundance of adult butterflies, than hedgerows with straight edges\\u00a0or allowed to grow over 2 m tall. One of two studies (including one controlled and one replicated, site comparison study) in the UK\\u00a0found that laid or coppiced hedgerows had a higher abundance of butterflies than unmanaged hedgerows. The other study found that managed hedgerows had a lower abundance of caterpillars than remnant hedgerows. One replicated, randomized, site comparison study in the UK\\u00a0found that butterfly abundance was higher in fields with hedgerows of a larger volume, but only in one of two study years. One replicated, site comparison study in the UK\\u00a0found that field margins next to hedgerow trees had a higher abundance of most shrub- and tree-feeding, but not grass- and herb-feeding, moth species than margins away from hedgerow trees.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\"\n}"

In coffee plantations, shade-grown systems support higher species richness of caterpillars compared to sun-grown monocultures (action 3931), and farms with mixed native and non-native tree species show higher butterfly diversity than those with single non-native species (action 3920). In vineyards, grass strips between vine rows and reduced chemical management increase butterfly species richness compared to conventional management (action 3919), while maintaining ground cover can reduce leafhopper pests and increase natural enemy abundance (action 1395). For traditional orchards, the evidence is mixed, with one German study finding similar species richness but lower abundance of butterflies and burnet moths in managed versus abandoned orchards (action 3917). Diversifying ground vegetation and canopy structure around woody crops increases reptile diversity and abundance in olive groves (action 3526), though the direct effects on butterflies and moths are not documented in the available evidence.",

    "relevant_summary": "Several management actions for agricultural field boundaries have been shown to benefit butterfly and moth conservation. Planting grass buffer strips or margins around arable or pasture fields is highly effective, with 26 studies showing that wider margins (up to 6m) and floristically enhanced grass buffers or wildflower strips increase both species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths compared to conventional margins. Managing hedgerows specifically for wildlife is another key action, with 17 studies demonstrating that hedgerows cut less frequently (every 2-3 years), cut in autumn rather than winter, or managed to allow incremental growth support higher abundance of adult butterflies and moths compared to annually cut hedgerows. Planting new hedges also benefits butterflies and moths, with 7 studies showing established hedgerows have higher species richness and abundance than crop fields or pasture. Rice field banks can be managed by avoiding mowing and herbicide application, which one study found increased butterfly species richness and abundance. Creating uncultivated margins around intensive fields can be beneficial depending on management, with 10 studies showing that margins which are not grazed or cut, or only cut in spring or autumn, have higher species richness and abundance of butterflies than those cut in summer. The evidence shows that boundary management practices which reduce disturbance, increase floristic diversity, and provide structural complexity are most beneficial for butterfly and moth conservation.",

Restoring or maintaining species-rich grassland along road verges and railway lines has been found to increase both the richness and abundance of butterflies and moths compared to verges dominated by non-native vegetation. Wide road verges have higher butterfly richness and abundance than narrow verges.

Stopping the use of herbicides on road verges has been shown to increase butterfly species richness and abundance compared to verges dominated by non-native weeds where herbicides are used.

Prairies managed by haying had higher abundance of prairie specialist butterflies but lower abundance of generalist and migrant butterflies compared to burned prairies. The abundance of prairie specialists was higher in the first year after haying than in the second year, and Karner blue butterflies showed similar abundance on mowed and burned savannas.\n\nPrescribed burning shows varied effects on different butterfly species. Some studies found higher abundance of heath fritillary adults, marsh fritillary caterpillar webs, and Fender's blue caterpillars and eggs on burned lands compared to unburned or grazed areas, while other studies found lower abundance of Brenton blue butterfly eggs and adults, rosy marsh moth caterpillars, and regal fritillary adults on burned lands. Prairies managed by burning had lower abundance of prairie specialists like regal fritillary and arogos skipper compared to hayed prairies, but higher abundance of generalist and migrant species.\n\nRotational mowing appears beneficial for butterfly communities. Studies found greater species richness and abundance of butterflies in grasslands managed with rotational mowing techniques compared to complete annual mowing. European reviews indicated that rotationally mowing grassland benefitted 27 out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern.\n\nMechanical cutting/scrub clearing shows positive effects, with studies finding higher abundance of Karner blue butterflies on mechanically cut pine barrens compared to rotationally burned areas, and higher species richness and abundance of butterflies under power lines managed by mechanical cutting compared to unmanaged land.",
