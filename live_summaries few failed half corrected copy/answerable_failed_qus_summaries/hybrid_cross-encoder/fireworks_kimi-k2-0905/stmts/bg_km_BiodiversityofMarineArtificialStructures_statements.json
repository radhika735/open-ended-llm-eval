Creating habitat features is the most consistently effective approach. Creating hole habitats (>50 mm) on structures increased brown crab abundance (action 3434). Creating pit habitats (1–50 mm), along with holes, grooves and environmentally-sensitive material, had mixed effects on invertebrate abundances depending on the species group (action 3455). Creating groove habitats (1–50 mm) similarly had mixed effects on invertebrate abundances (action 3448). Creating grooves and small protrusions, ridges or ledges (1–50 mm) together led to colonization by non-mobile invertebrates (action 3452). \n\nCreating flexible habitats also showed positive effects. Short flexible habitats (1–50 mm) had mixed effects on mobile and non-mobile invertebrate abundances depending on species group and site (action 3450). Long flexible habitats (>50 mm) supported higher biomass (mostly mussels) and non-mobile invertebrate species that were absent from structure surfaces without flexible habitats, though effects varied by species group and survey timing (action 3451).\n\nTransplanting or seeding organisms onto structures increased invertebrate species richness and altered community composition (action 3471). Using textured surfaces (≤1 mm) had mixed effects on non-mobile invertebrate abundance depending on the site (action 3449). \n\nOverall, creating physical habitat complexity through holes, pits, grooves, flexible habitats, and transplanting organisms provides the most reliable interventions for increasing invertebrate abundance on subtidal artificial structures, though effects can vary by species group and environmental conditions.",

Six of eleven studies found that creating small grooves, ridges, and ledges increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species diversity and richness. These features often support species that are absent from flat structure surfaces and can alter community composition. However, two studies reported that grooves supported higher species richness than ridges or ledges when compared directly.\n\nFor large-scale features (>50 mm): Research is limited but suggests potential benefits for biodiversity. One study found that large ledges increased combined macroalgae, microalgae and invertebrate species diversity, while mixed results were observed for species richness. These features were found to increase the abundance of certain taxa like mussels and limpets, but not barnacles.\n\nEffects on specific taxa: Grooves and small linear features had mixed effects on macroalgal species richness and abundance, with results varying by location, size of features, and shore level. Similar mixed effects were observed for invertebrate communities, with some studies showing increased abundances of certain taxa while others showed no significant changes. Fish communities showed minimal responses to these features, with most studies finding no increase in fish species richness or abundance, though one study observed increased feeding activity of juvenile salmon around structures with large ledges.",
