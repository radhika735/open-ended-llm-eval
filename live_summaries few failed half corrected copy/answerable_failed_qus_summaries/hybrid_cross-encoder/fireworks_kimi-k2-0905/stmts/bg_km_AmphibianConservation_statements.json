Research shows that created ponds are highly effective, with 28 studies demonstrating that amphibians consistently use newly created ponds, with 64-100% of ponds being used and 64-68% supporting reproduction. Created wetlands have also proven successful, with 15 studies showing they support similar or higher numbers of amphibian species compared to natural wetlands. Pond restoration has yielded positive results in 15 studies, with restoration increasing amphibian species numbers and maintaining breeding populations. Ditch management under agri-environment schemes significantly increases amphibian species abundance and numbers compared to conventional management. Key factors affecting success include pond permanence, vegetation cover, surrounding landscape characteristics, distance to existing water bodies, and presence of fish. While pollution prevention and buffer strips are recommended practices, there is currently insufficient evidence to assess their specific effectiveness for amphibians in agricultural settings.",

Key challenges include species-specific differences in reproduction difficulty, dependency on environmental conditions like temperature and seasonal changes, and low survival rates in some populations.

      "relevant_summary": "Based on evidence from multiple studies across different countries, several key factors significantly influence the success or failure of amphibian colonization and breeding in newly created ponds. Pond permanence is a critical factor, with studies showing that numbers of species colonizing created ponds can be similar or lower depending on the permanence of created water bodies. Fish presence represents a major negative factor, with research demonstrating that draining ponds to eliminate fish significantly increases numbers of amphibian species, and pond drying to eliminate fish increases breeding success of frogs and newts. Vegetation cover and shading also play important roles, with canopy removal affecting breeding success of different species differently - it enabled translocated garlic toads to establish breeding populations, but did not increase hatching success of spotted salamanders in another study. Landscape context matters significantly, with pond age, vegetation cover, surrounding landscape characteristics, distance to existing ponds, and permanence all affecting amphibian use, colonization, and reproductive success in created ponds. Water level management is crucial, with studies showing that maintaining appropriate water levels enabled successful breeding by species like dusky gopher frogs, while draining ponds in particular seasons significantly increased abundance and species numbers. The success rates for amphibian establishment are highly variable, with studies reporting that amphibians established stable breeding populations in 50-100% of created ponds, used 64-100% of created ponds for reproduction, but individual species success rates varied dramatically from 2-62% depending on the species. Pond creation alone may not guarantee success, as some studies found that populations in created ponds were less stable than natural populations.",

Pond creation has been extensively studied with 28 investigations showing amphibians used created ponds, with 64-100% of ponds used for reproduction and establishment of stable populations in 50-100% of cases. Pond restoration showed mixed results, with some studies finding increased amphibian species numbers and breeding success, while others found no increase in populations. Wetland restoration and creation also proved effective, with 89% of cases showing similar or higher amphibian abundance compared to natural wetlands, and 4-15 amphibian species colonizing created wetlands. Engaging landowners and volunteers in aquatic habitat management increased natterjack toad and Taipei frog populations, with programs restoring up to 1,023 ponds or over 11,500 km2 of habitat. Habitat connectivity is also important, as retaining native vegetation corridors maintained populations of eight of 13 frog species over 20 years. Success of these interventions depends on factors such as pond permanence, vegetation cover, distance to existing ponds, and surrounding landscape characteristics.",
