Hedgerow management shows benefits when trimming is less frequent: hedges trimmed ≥3 years prior had more bat species and higher activity for two of eight species compared to recently trimmed hedges (action 1943). Creating tree plantations on agricultural land showed no difference in species richness, with two of three studies finding no difference in bat activity, though plantations next to remnant vegetation had higher activity than isolated plantations (action 958). Agri-environment schemes showed no significant benefits, with two of three studies finding no difference in overall bat activity compared to conventional farms, and one study finding lower activity on scheme farms (action 962). Creating artificial water sources such as farm ponds and reservoirs can increase bat activity compared to surrounding habitats (action 959).
