Research across multiple countries including Australia, Iran, Nepal, and the USA found that shelterwood harvesting increased abundance, species richness and diversity of understory plants, as well as the growth and survival rate of young trees in six of seven studies, though one study found negative effects. For wildlife impacts, studies in the USA found that shelterwood harvesting and group harvesting resulted in smaller reductions in salamander populations compared to clearcutting, with shelterwood showing higher or initially higher salamander abundance. However, both shelterwood harvesting and group harvesting still decreased salamander abundance compared to unharvested forests in most cases. Research on butterflies and moths found that shelterwood harvesting maintained higher species richness and faster recovery of moth populations compared to clearcutting. Regarding forest structure, Canadian studies found that partial retention harvesting decreased the density of young trees compared to clearcutting. Studies on mammals showed that selective harvesting did not consistently increase small mammal abundance compared to clearcutting, though it sometimes maintained red-backed vole populations better.",

However, one study found that removing competing herbs increased seedling biomass, and one replicated, controlled study in Canada found that removal of sheep laurel shrubs increased growth rate and height of planted black spruce seedlings (Action ID: 1256). Mechanical removal was also found to increase numbers of amphibian species compared to untreated plots (Action ID: 781).\n\n**Herbicide Application:**\nTwo of three studies (including two replicated, randomized, controlled studies) in Sweden and USA found that using herbicide after tree planting increased the size of planted trees, while one study found no effect on tree size (Action ID: 1262). However, three studies (including two randomized, replicated, controlled studies) in the USA found that understory removal using herbicide had no effect or some negative effects on amphibian abundance (Action ID: 778).\n\n**Combined Approach:**\nOne study found that vegetation removal together with mechanical disturbance of the soil increased the density of young trees (Action ID: 1274).",
