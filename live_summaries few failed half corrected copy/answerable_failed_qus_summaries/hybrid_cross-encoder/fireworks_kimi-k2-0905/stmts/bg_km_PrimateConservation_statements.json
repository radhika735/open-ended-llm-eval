For physical barriers, preventing mammals from accessing potential wildlife food sources through electric fencing and electric shock devices has demonstrated effectiveness, with studies showing these methods successfully excluded American black bears from bird feeders and stone martens from buildings [2346]. Other recommended actions include installing 'primate-proof' garbage bins [1505], removing human food waste that may serve as food sources for primates [1561], not allowing people to consume food within areas where primates can view them [1508], and implementing enforcement notices to require appropriate waste management [2345].",
