One approach is to modify the habitat to support natural pest control. For instance, planting hedgerows can increase the number of natural enemies and the parasitism of pest eggs, leading to fewer pests (1401). Similarly, planting flower strips has been found to enhance pest reduction and attract more natural enemies (1400). Another strategy involves soil management, such as adding compost, which can reduce crop diseases and plant mortality in some instances (1392). The use of organic fertilizer has shown mixed results, with one study finding an increase in aphid numbers and another finding no significant difference (1393). Direct manipulation of beneficial and harmful insect populations is also a viable strategy. For example, isolating colonies of beneficial predatory ants has been shown to reduce pest damage and increase yields (773). Conversely, excluding ants that protect pests can lead to greater parasitism of those pests and, in some cases, a reduction in their numbers (886). The use of mixed pastures instead of monocultures has been associated with a reduction in weeds and, in some studies, fewer pests (721). Finally, employing grazing instead of cutting for pasture management has demonstrated varied effects on natural enemies and, in one study, resulted in an increase in pest numbers (885).",
