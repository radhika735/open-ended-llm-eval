In contrast, a different replicated, paired, controlled study in the USA found that the average height of white cedar saplings increased by a similar amount between two and five years after planting in plots that were fenced to exclude deer and plots that were left unfenced (3330).

However, one study found a decrease in plant species richness and abundance, and another found no effect on tree abundance [1223]. In terms of wildlife, two studies in the USA on reptile populations found that shelterwood harvesting had mixed effects on reptile species richness and abundance compared to areas with no management [3636]. One study in the USA found that areas with shelterwood harvesting had a lower abundance of juvenile eastern box turtles than clearcut areas [3636]. When compared to clearcutting, three studies in the USA found that shelterwood harvesting resulted in higher, similar, or initially higher and then similar salamander abundance [851]. A meta-analysis of 24 studies in North America indicated that partial harvest, including shelterwood harvesting, led to smaller reductions in salamander populations than clearcutting [851].\n\nPartial retention harvesting has also been studied as an alternative to clearcutting.
