Evidence on reducing fertilizer inputs was mixed: some studies reported positive effects on invertebrates, while others found no or inconsistent effects, and two UK studies reported higher earthworm biomass or abundance where fertilizer inputs were not reduced; reducing two or more inputs (e.g., fertilizers with herbicides/pesticides) often showed positive effects on invertebrates and soil organisms, though negative or null effects were also recorded [139]. In permanent grasslands, stopping fertilizer inputs increased plant species richness and attracted higher abundance or species richness of some or all invertebrates in several studies; one review reported higher densities of some invertebrates in unfertilized plots than in nitrogen‑fertilized plots, whereas another review found no clear effect on soil‑dwelling invertebrate density, and one replicated UK study observed lower invertebrate abundance under reduced fertilizer inputs but differences were not significant [694].",

The third study found that abandoned cropland had a similar abundance of butterflies to cultivated farms. Two of three replicated studies (including one randomized, paired, controlled study and two site comparison studies) in the UK\\u00a0and Finland\\u00a0found that grasslands established by sowing grasses, legumes and other non-woody, broadleaved plants (forbs), or perennial grass mixes, had a higher abundance of butterflies (in one case including other pollinators) than grasslands established with grass-only mixes\\u00a0or less competitive species. The third study found that grasslands restored by sowing complex or simple seed mixes, or by natural regeneration, all had a similar abundance of caterpillars. One before-and-after study in the UK\\u00a0found that after the adoption of an Environmentally Sensitive Areas scheme on a farm, including reverting arable land to permanent grassland, the abundance of large moths and five species of butterfly increased, but the abundance of two species of butterfly decreased.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\"\n}"
