      "relevant_summary": "Across studies from The Gambia, Guinea, Liberia, the Republic of Congo, Gabon, Tanzania, Senegal, Uganda, and South Africa, many chimpanzee and gorilla reintroductions reported majority survival for at least 9 months to 5 years, with population increases documented in The Gambia and Tanzania, and several chimpanzee groups showing majority survival over 2–5 years (IDs: 1567, 1590, 1591, 1589). In Malaysia and Indonesia, outcomes included majority survival for orangutans (including 98% survival upon release and all Sumatran orangutans surviving at least three months), but one long-term study in Malaysia recorded a population decline after 33 years (IDs: 1589, 1591, 1567, 1590). In Thailand and Vietnam, multiple studies reported declines or very low survival, including a reintroduced population declining over three years and all reintroduced pygmy slow lorises assumed dead despite fostering (IDs: 1589, 1591, 1590, 1600). In Brazil and French Guiana, several studies found only a minority of reintroduced primates survived from 15 weeks up to several years, and most reintroduced golden lion tamarins did not survive over 1–7 years, whereas Belize recorded population increases and majority short-term survival in some cases (IDs: 1567, 1591, 1600, 1590). In Madagascar and India, persistence and survival were reported in several cases (including populations persisting 4–55 years in Madagascar and a population persisting at least four years in India), alongside other studies noting both majority and minority survival over months to years (IDs: 1567, 1590). Overall, the compiled evidence shows higher frequencies of majority survival and some population growth in several African country case studies; mixed results in Asian country case studies with both successes and notable failures; and mixed outcomes in American country case studies, with Belize showing increases but Brazil and French Guiana often reporting minority survival (IDs: 1567, 1590, 1591, 1589, 1600, 1595).",
