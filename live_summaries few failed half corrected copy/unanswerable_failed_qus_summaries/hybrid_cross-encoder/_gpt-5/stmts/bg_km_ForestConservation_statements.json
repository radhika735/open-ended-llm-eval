      "relevant_summary": "Across studies, several forest management actions have been associated with increases in understory plant richness and/or diversity. Logging/removing trees increased understory plant density/cover in five of 10 studies and increased species richness/diversity in four of seven studies, with other studies reporting no or mixed effects (1273). Season of harvest showed no effect on plant species richness/diversity in one replicated study comparing summer vs winter logging (1216). Thinning trees increased understory density/cover in 17 of 25 studies and increased richness/diversity in 13 of 19 studies, though some studies reported no or mixed effects and one reported decreased herbaceous abundance (1211). Prescribed fire showed mixed outcomes: some studies found increases in cover, density, biomass and richness/diversity, while others found decreases or no effect (1221). Girdling to thin trees increased understory plant species richness, diversity and cover in one before-and-after trial (1226). Vegetation removal combined with mechanical soil disturbance increased understory cover and diversity in two studies and decreased shrub cover in one study; one study also found increased density of young trees (1274). Group-selection harvesting had mixed results, with some studies reporting increased understory cover/diversity and young tree density, and others reporting decreased richness/biomass or no effect (1224). Shelterwood harvesting increased understory abundance, species richness and diversity in six of seven studies, though one study found decreased richness/abundance and another found no effect on tree abundance (1223).",
