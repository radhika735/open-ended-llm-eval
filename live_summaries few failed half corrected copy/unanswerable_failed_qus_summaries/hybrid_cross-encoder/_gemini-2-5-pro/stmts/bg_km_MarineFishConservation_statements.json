One study found that catch limits for non-target commercial species reduced the amount of unwanted halibut (2693). One study found that trawl nets fitted with a larger mesh codend caught fewer combined species of non-commercial unwanted invertebrates and fish and a lower combined biomass and abundance of non-commercial unwanted invertebrates and fish compared to a traditional codend (2135). The same study found that the larger mesh codend also caught less biomass and abundance of commercially targeted shrimps, but the biomass ratios of commercially targeted to discard species was similar for both (2135). Another study found that using larger mesh sizes in the inner and/or outer panels of trammel nets did not reduce the abundance of unwanted catch of non-commercial invertebrates (2141). We found no studies that evaluated the effects of setting unwanted catch quotas on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations (2116).",
