One study in the UK found that the number of bats using an artificial hibernaculum increased in each of the nine years after it was built [2049]. Another study in the UK found that an artificial cave was used by a small number of brown long-eared bats [2049]. Three studies in Germany and the UK found that artificial hibernacula were used by up to four bat species [2049]. One study in the UK found that a roost reinstated by attaching the felled tree trunk to a nearby tree continued to be used by common noctule bats as a maternity roost [2048]. A review in the USA found that bat houses provided as alternative roosts during bridge replacement works were used by fewer Mexican free-tailed bats than the original roost at one site and were not used by bats at all at three sites [2942]. Two replicated studies in the USA and UK found that bats did not use any of the alternative roosts provided in bat houses or a purpose-built bat wall after exclusion from buildings [949]. Three studies in the USA and UK and one review in the UK found that bat boxes or bat lofts/barns were used by bats at 13-74% of development sites, and bat lofts/barns were used by maternity colonies at one of 19 development sites [949]. Three of five before-and-after studies in Portugal, Ireland, Spain and the UK found that bat colonies used purpose-built roosts in higher or similar numbers after the original roosts were destroyed [949]. The other two studies found that bats used purpose-built roosts in lower numbers than the original roost [949]. One review in the UK found that new bat boxes/lofts built to replace destroyed roosts were four times less likely to be used by returning bats than roosts retained during development [949]. A review in the USA found that spaces created in road bridges for roosting bats to replace those lost during bridge works were recolonized by bats in similar or greater numbers to the original roosts at four of eight sites [1967]. No studies were found that evaluated the effects of providing artificial subterranean bat roosts to replace roosts in reclaimed mines or disturbed caves on bat populations [974, 1005].
