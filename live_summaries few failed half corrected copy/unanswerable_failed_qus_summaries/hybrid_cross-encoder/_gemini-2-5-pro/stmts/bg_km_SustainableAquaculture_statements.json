In Norway, a replicated, controlled study showed that salmon kept in low intensity artificial light or natural lighting had fewer lice (741). The study also found that the number of lice on the fish increased with the intensity of the artificial light (741). In Ireland, two studies on the use of cleaner wrasse to control sea lice on salmon farms had conflicting results. One controlled study discovered that corkwing and goldskinny cleaner wrasse were as effective as chemical treatments for managing lice infestations. However, another replicated, controlled study revealed that rockcook cleaner wrasse were not effective in preventing lice outbreaks (738).",
