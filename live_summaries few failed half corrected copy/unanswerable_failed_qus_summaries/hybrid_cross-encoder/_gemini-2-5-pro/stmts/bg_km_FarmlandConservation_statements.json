      "relevant_summary": "Agri-environment schemes that pay farmers for conservation measures have shown varied effects on European wildlife. For birds, while twenty-four studies found increases in population sizes or densities on scheme sites (700), and twenty-two studies showed similar positive trends (172), other studies found negative or no effects (700, 172). However, specially-designed schemes have led to population increases for cirl buntings, corncrakes and Eurasian thick-knees (172). The impact on wild bees is also mixed, with some European trials showing enhanced diversity and abundance (24), while others, including landscape-scale studies in the UK, found no such enhancements (24).\n\nFor butterflies and moths, the evidence is more consistently positive. Twelve of fifteen studies in the UK, Switzerland, and Sweden reported higher species richness or diversity on lands in agri-environment schemes, and seventeen of nineteen studies found higher abundance (3915). However, some studies noted similar or lower abundance compared to conventionally managed or unmanaged lands (3915). Specific practices like undersowing spring cereals with legumes have shown higher butterfly richness in some contexts (3926) but not others (3926).\n\nEffects on other wildlife are also variable. Payments to farmers in Denmark and Sweden helped create amphibian breeding habitat and increase populations (818), and managed ditches in the Netherlands had higher amphibian species numbers (818). For mammals, agri-environment schemes were associated with increased brown hare density in one UK region but not another and had no effect on Irish hare numbers in Northern Ireland (2387). Small mammal abundance did increase in scheme-managed field margins in the UK (2387). Conversely, studies on bats in the UK found that agri-environment schemes did not lead to significant increases in bat activity, with one study even recording lower activity (962).",
