      "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence, cutting/mowing appears to be a commonly studied and effective method for controlling problematic plants on peatlands. Action 1770 shows that cutting/mowing problematic herbaceous plants typically had no significant effect on overall plant community composition but increased fen-characteristic plant species and had mixed effects on vegetation cover in fens. Action 1759 demonstrates that cutting/mowing to maintain or restore disturbance altered plant community composition, increased cover of fen- or wet meadow-characteristic plants, increased moss cover, and reduced cover of problematic herbs including reeds, sedges, and purple moor grass across multiple studies in fens and fen meadows. Action 1771 found that timing of cutting/mowing could influence effectiveness, with summer mowing increasing plant species richness more than spring or autumn mowing. Herbicide application (Action 1776) showed mixed results, changing plant community composition but failing to prevent increases in shrub cover over time. Biological control through introducing organisms (Action 1777) showed promise in one study, where introducing a parasitic plant reduced dominant sedge cover and increased plant species richness. However, no studies were found evaluating covers/barriers (Action 1775) or physical damage methods (Action 1769) for cost-effectiveness or effectiveness on peatlands.",
