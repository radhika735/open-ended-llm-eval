Additionally, one study discovered that in one year, nests that were given extra food had lower fledging rates (648). \n\nIn 30 separate studies that examined the practice of sowing wild bird seed or cover mixture, 21 revealed beneficial outcomes (594). These studies showed that fields planted with a wild bird cover mix had a higher density, abundance, and variety of bird species than other agricultural habitats (594). Nine replicated studies from France and the UK reported mixed or negative effects of wild bird cover on birds compared to other farmland habitats (594).",
