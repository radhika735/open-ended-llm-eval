Another study indicated that creating hole habitats along with pits and grooves had mixed effects on invertebrate abundance depending on the species group (3434, 3455). Similarly, three studies on creating short flexible habitats (1-50 mm) found mixed effects on mobile and non-mobile invertebrate abundance (3450). In contrast, transplanting organisms has also shown varied outcomes. One study on transplanting oysters did not find an increase in the combined invertebrate and fish abundance (3471). However, another study reported that transplanting corals did increase coral cover on structure surfaces (3471).",
