However, both methods show evidence of effectiveness for bird populations. \n\nRegarding supplementary food provision (Action ID 648): Nine studies from France, Sweden and the UK found that supplementary food increased farmland bird abundance, breeding population size, density, body mass, hatching, nestling growth and fledging rates, and increased overwinter survival of declining house sparrow populations. However, five studies found no clear effect on farmland bird breeding abundance, reproductive success, territory size or density, or overwinter survival of stable house sparrow populations.\n\nRegarding wild bird seed or cover mixtures (Action IDs 594, 187): Thirty individual studies investigated wild bird seed or cover mixture effects, with 21 studies finding positive effects. Fourteen studies from the UK found that fields sown with wild bird cover mix had higher abundance, density, species diversity and species richness of birds than other farmland habitats. All seven studies from the UK found that fields or farms with wild bird cover had higher bird diversity than those without. Thirty-two out of 33 studies from the UK and North America found that bird densities, abundances, nesting densities or use of wild bird cover was higher than in other habitats.\n\nThe documents indicate that agri-environment schemes (which can include both interventions) involve paying farmers to cover conservation costs (Action IDs 172, 700), but specific cost comparisons between supplementary feeding and wild bird seed mixtures are not provided in the available evidence.",

Action 729 reports that six studies from Canada and the USA examined predator numbers in adjacent crops, with a review finding that predators increased in adjacent crops, though one study found effects varied with time and another found no effect. Four studies and a review found more invertebrate predators on beetle banks than in surrounding crops, including soybean crops which were specifically mentioned among the crops studied (barley, field bean, maize, oats, pea, radish, rapeseed, soybean, wheat and pasture). However, two studies found small or slow movements of predators from banks to crops, and one study found greater beetle activity in fields but this did not improve pest predation. The economic analysis indicated that beetle banks could make economic savings if they prevented pests from reaching a spray threshold or causing 5% yield loss. Studies also showed that certain grass species used in beetle banks held higher numbers of predatory invertebrates than others, suggesting design considerations affect effectiveness.",
