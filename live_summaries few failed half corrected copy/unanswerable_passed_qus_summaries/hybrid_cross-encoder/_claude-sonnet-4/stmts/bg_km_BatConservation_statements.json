Additionally, no studies have been found that evaluated the effects of breeding bats in captivity specifically to supplement wild populations affected by white-nose syndrome (Action 2009). While studies have documented successful captive breeding of bats, with 6-100% of female bats successfully conceiving, giving birth and rearing young in captivity, and 20-100% of bat pups surviving from 10 days to adulthood in captive settings (Action 2053), there is no evidence available regarding the success rates of reintroducing these captive-bred bats into wild populations, particularly in areas affected by white-nose syndrome. The only related evidence comes from rehabilitation studies, where 70-90% of hand-reared pipistrelle bats survived for at least 4-14 days after release into the wild, with six of 21 bats joining wild bat colonies, and 13% of ringed hand-reared bats were found alive 38 days to almost four years after release (Action 2054).",
