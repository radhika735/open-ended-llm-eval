Scattering food throughout the enclosure (Action ID 1315) is particularly effective, with studies showing increased feeding and exploratory behaviors in rhesus macaques, reduced abnormal behaviors in chimpanzees, decreased aggression in lemurs, and increased foraging and activity levels in gorillas. Feeding primates in social groups (Action ID 1343) also proves beneficial, with monkeys completing enrichment tasks faster and eating more unfamiliar foods when with groupmates. Providing cut branches or browse (Action ID 1332) offers another cost-effective option, as gorillas demonstrated the ability to use natural processing skills when presented with stinging nettles. While puzzle feeders (Action ID 1318) can be effective at increasing feeding time and foraging behavior while reducing inactivity, they showed mixed results including increased aggression and decreased food sharing.",
