    "relevant_summary": "According to the available evidence, no studies directly compared the cost-effectiveness of different bracken control methods in shrublands. However, several methods have been evaluated for their effectiveness in controlling bracken. One systematic review found that the herbicide asulam reduced bracken abundance if applied repeatedly, but cutting may be equally effective as herbicide (Action 105). Individual methods that have shown some effectiveness include herbicide application (asulam), which reduced bracken biomass or cover in three randomized, controlled studies in the UK (Action 1652), and cutting, which reduced bracken cover or biomass in one randomized, controlled, before-and-after trial in Norway and two randomized, controlled studies in the UK (Action 1653). However, neither method was consistently effective across all studies, with some finding no effect on bracken abundance. Other methods like cutting followed by herbicide application reduced bracken biomass or cover in three randomized studies in the UK and Norway (Action 1654). No studies evaluated combinations of herbicide with grazing or seeding shrubland plants (Actions 1658, 1661), and some methods like bracken bruising were actually found to increase bracken cover (Action 1726).",
