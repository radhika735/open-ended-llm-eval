Installing culverts or tunnels as road crossings is widely used, with 15 of 24 studies showing they were used by amphibians (by 15-85% of amphibians or 3-15 species), though effectiveness varies by design features like diameter, length, lighting, and substrate. Closing roads during seasonal amphibian migrations protects large numbers from death during breeding migrations. Human-assisted crossings involve volunteers moving amphibians across roads, with patrols moving thousands to half a million toads annually across Germany, UK, and Italy, though 64-70% of populations still declined over 6-10 years despite these efforts. Warning signage for motorists has been implemented, but is ineffective alone as over 500 toads were still killed on some roads despite signs. Modifying infrastructure like moving gully pots 10 cm away from kerbs decreased great crested newt falls by 80%.",
