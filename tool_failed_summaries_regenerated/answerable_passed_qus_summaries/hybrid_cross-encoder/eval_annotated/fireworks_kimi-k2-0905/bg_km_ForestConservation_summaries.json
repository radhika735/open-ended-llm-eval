For young trees, five of 15 studies found prescribed fire increased density and biomass, while two found it decreased new tree density, and eight found no effect or mixed effects depending on species, location, and fire frequency (Action 1220). For mature trees, four of eight studies found prescribed fire decreased tree cover, density and diversity, while three found no effect or mixed effects, and seven studies found it increased tree mortality (Action 1217). \n\nFor understory plants, eight of 22 studies found prescribed fire increased cover, density and biomass, while six found it decreased plant cover, and eight found no effect or mixed effects. Fourteen of 24 studies found it increased species richness and diversity of understory plants, while nine found no effect or mixed effects (Action 1221).\n\nRegarding wildlife, studies showed mixed responses: some bird species (particularly open habitat species) were more abundant in burned pine forests, while closed-forest species and ground nesters appeared adversely affected by burning (Action 318). For amphibians, eight of 14 studies found no effect of prescribed forest fires on abundance or species numbers, while three found fires increased abundance or species numbers, and one found abundance decreased with fires (Action 877).\n\nSome studies found restoration benefits: coniferous forests restored by burning (often combined with thinning) had higher butterfly species richness than unburned forest (Action 3877). Prescribed burning can also mimic natural fire cycles (Action 1622), though studies specifically evaluating prescribed burning for reducing wildfire potential were not found (Action 1623).",

For herbicide use, one replicated, randomized, controlled study in the USA found no effect on total native plant species richness (action 1229, 1314). Mechanical/manual removal showed mixed results: one replicated, controlled study in Hawaii found that removal of invasive grass species increased understory plant biomass, while another in the USA found no effect on understory plant diversity (action 1228). One study in Ghana found that removal of invasive weed species increased tree seedling height, but another in Hawaii found no effect on growth rate of native species (action 1228). For prescribed fire and grazing, no evidence was found for their effects on invasive plant control in forests (actions 1196, 1195). Similarly, no evidence was found for using hot water to control Crassula helmsii (action 1275). Some studies evaluated broader effects: one before-and-after study in the UK found that habitat management including invasive plant control tripled a natterjack toad population (action 823), while two studies in the USA found that control of introduced saltcedar and partial removal of velvet mesquite did not change small mammal species richness or abundances (action 2529).",

A review of programmes in the USA and Canada found that education alone was not sufficient to change behaviour, although it served as a necessary catalytic factor for economic incentives and law enforcement (action 162). However, several studies demonstrated positive outcomes from education and awareness campaigns. In the Philippines, a communication, education, and public awareness campaign led to increased Philippine crocodile populations and reduced human killing of crocodiles (action 3682). Similarly, in Costa Rica, a community-based education programme resulted in decreased poaching of leatherback turtle nests (action 3682), while in Dominica, education combined with road signs reduced road deaths of lesser Antillean iguanas (action 3682). In aquatic environments, three studies found that educational whale-watching tours and exhibitions in the North Atlantic Ocean, Bangladesh, and Peru increased participants' willingness to support marine conservation through behaviour change and donations (action 2935). However, some studies showed limited or no effectiveness, such as an information leaflet program in the USA that failed to reduce hotel energy consumption (action 3682) and awareness efforts in Taiwan that had no effect on green tree frog conservation (action 831). The evidence suggests that while education and awareness campaigns can be effective components of conservation strategies, they are most successful when combined with other interventions rather than used in isolation.",
