    "relevant_summary": "When restoring peatlands afforested for commercial forestry, cutting trees and rewetting peat (Action 1732) shows more comprehensive restoration outcomes compared to only cutting trees (Action 1731). The combined approach increases abundance of wetland-characteristic plants (Action 1732), while tree removal alone only increases cover of some herb species like cottongrasses and sedges (Action 1731). Sphagnum moss responses differ significantly - the combined intervention increases Sphagnum cover (Action 1732), whereas tree removal alone decreases Sphagnum cover over three years (Action 1731). Both approaches increase plant species richness, though one study found the effect is smaller when trees are removed from rewetted plots compared to drained plots (Action 1731). Action 1756 (rewetting alone) demonstrates that water table management is crucial for peatland restoration, showing increased Sphagnum moss cover, reduced tree/shrub cover, and increased herb cover including sedges and cottongrasses.",

The lack of evidence means that the effectiveness and potential harmful impacts of these management interventions remain unassessed.\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"1751\",\n    \"1752\",\n    \"1753\",\n    \"1754\",\n    \"1749\",\n    \"1755\",\n    \"312\",\n    \"1619\",\n    \"3022\",\n    \"3023\",\n    \"3024\",\n    \"3025\"\n  ]\n}"

Sphagnum moss cover typically increases following rewetting, with 12 of 19 studies showing increased abundance, though responses can be species-specific (1756, 1732). Herb cover generally increases, particularly sedges (13 of 15 studies), cottongrass (8 of 9 studies), and reeds/rushes (5 of 7 studies) (1756, 1732). Tree and shrub cover typically decreases or shows no effect in 10 of 13 studies (1756). Overall plant species richness and diversity may increase, though results are mixed with some studies showing no effect or reduced diversity (1756, 1732). When combined with tree removal, rewetting increases wetland-characteristic plants and herb cover while reducing forest-characteristic vegetation (1732).",

Two replicated site comparison studies in fens or fen meadows in central Europe\\u00a0found that rewetting reduced the number of fen-characteristic plant species. Two studies (one replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after) in fens in Sweden\\u00a0reported that rewetting had no effect on cover of fen-characteristic plants.\\u00a0Two before-and-after studies in fens in the USA\\u00a0and New Zealand\\u00a0reported that upland plant cover decreased following rewetting.\\u00a0\\nMoss cover (19 studies):\\u00a0Twelve studies (five replicated, two also paired and controlled) in the UK, Ireland, Germany,\\u00a0Sweden, Latvia, Canada\\u00a0and Spain\\u00a0reported that rewetting bogs, fens or other peatlands (sometimes\\u00a0along with other interventions) increased Sphagnum moss cover or abundance. Three of these studies\\u00a0reported mixed responses by species. Two additional replicated studies, in bogs in Latvia\\u00a0and forested fens in Finland, reported that rewetting had no effect on Sphagnum\\u00a0cover. Five studies (one paired, controlled, before-and-after) in Finland, Sweden\\u00a0and Canada\\u00a0reported that rewetting bogs or fens had no effect on cover of non-Sphagnum mosses (or mosses/lichens). However, two controlled studies in bogs in Ireland\\u00a0and the UK\\u00a0reported that rewetting reduced cover of non-Sphagnum mosses\\u00a0or bryophytes. One site comparison study in Finland\\u00a0reported that a rewetted peatland had similar moss cover (Sphagnum and total) to a natural peatland, but another site comparison study in Canada\\u00a0reported that a rewetted bog had lower moss cover (Sphagnum and other) than nearby target peatlands.\\nHerb cover (25 studies): Twenty-one studies (including four replicated, paired, controlled) reported that rewetting (sometimes\\u00a0along with other interventions) increased cover of at least one group of herbs.

The evidence shows mixed but generally limited effects: most studies found no effect on herb cover including cottongrass and sedges, no consistent effect on Sphagnum moss cover, and no effect on shrub cover in many cases, though some studies showed increased shrub cover. One study found that livestock exclusion increased vegetation biomass but effects varied between wetter and drier areas of bogs.\n\nReducing Grazing Intensity (Action ID 1735): Only one study evaluated this approach specifically in bogs. This study found that lower grazing intensity was associated with greater total vegetation cover, greater shrub cover, greater cottongrass cover (for one species), and higher vegetation biomass.\n\nThe key comparison suggests that reducing grazing intensity shows more consistent positive effects on vegetation cover and biomass based on limited evidence, while complete livestock exclusion shows more variable results with many studies finding no significant effects on key peatland vegetation components.",

Cutting/mowing typically increases plant species richness and moss/bryophyte cover while reducing herb cover and abundance of reeds, sedges, and purple moor grass. Annual mowing regimes are particularly effective at altering plant community composition and increasing fen-characteristic plants. In contrast, grazing effects are more variable - it can increase cover of some herb groups like cottongrasses and sedges, but may reduce Sphagnum moss cover. One comparative study found that grazed fen meadows contained fewer plant species and fewer fen-characteristic species than mown meadows.

One site comparison study in Chile\\u00a0found that excluding livestock (along with other interventions) increased overall herb cover, but one replicated, paired, controlled study in bogs in Australia\\u00a0found that excluding livestock had no effect on overall herb cover.\\nMoss cover (6 studies): Five replicated, paired, controlled studies in bogs in the UK\\u00a0and Australia\\u00a0found that excluding livestock typically had no effect on\\u00a0Sphagnum\\u00a0moss cover. Responses sometimes varied between species and sites. Three of the studies in the UK also found no effect on cover of other mosses.\\u00a0One before-and-after study in a poor fen in Spain\\u00a0reported that Sphagnum moss appeared after excluding cattle (and rewetting).\\nTree/shrub cover (8 studies): Four replicated, paired, controlled studies in bogs in the UK\\u00a0and Australia\\u00a0found that excluding livestock had no effect on shrub cover (specifically heather\\u00a0or a heathland community). One replicated, paired, controlled study in a bog in the UK\\u00a0found that excluding sheep had no effect on heather cover in wetter areas, but increased heather cover in drier areas. Three studies (including two site comparisons) in bogs in the UK, fens in the USA\\u00a0and a peatland in Chile\\u00a0found that excluding or removing livestock increased shrub cover.\\nVegetation structure (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in a bog in the UK\\u00a0found that excluding sheep increased total vegetation, shrub and bryophyte biomass but had no effect on biomass of grass-like herbs.\"\n}"

For organic mulch covers after planting, multiple studies document benefits including increased germination rates for some species (grass and shrub), improved survival of planted mosses and sedges, increased growth of transplanted sedges, and increased vegetation cover (total vegetation, mosses/bryophytes, Sphagnum mosses, or vascular plants). However, some studies found no effect on vegetation cover, and one study reported that oil palm fruit mulch reduced survival of planted peat swamp tree seedlings.\n\nFor inorganic fertilizers, benefits include increased vegetation cover, plant species richness, herb and shrub growth (especially with phosphorus), increased survival of some planted tree species, and increased growth of planted mosses, herbs, and trees. However, fertilizers also showed harms including reduced survival of some tree species, no effect on growth for some species or in some conditions, and the benefits often depend on the specific chemical composition with phosphorus showing more effects than nitrogen or potassium.\n\nFresh peat amendment showed mixed results with higher cover of sown plant species compared to original bog surface, but fertilization could cancel out this beneficial effect. Organic mulch without planting increased the number of fen characteristic plants present but did not consistently affect their cover or Sphagnum moss cover.",

Direct planting of mosses (Action 1818) showed survival rates where 47 out of 50 Sphagnum-dominated sods survived for one year in a Lithuanian bog, with five before-and-after studies reporting increased moss cover after planting in at least some cases, including one study showing planted moss spread beyond the introduction site. In contrast, spreading moss fragments on the surface (Action 1821) involved thirteen studies across bogs and fens, with eleven studies showing Sphagnum moss presence after 1-4 growing seasons, though cover ranged from negligible to greater than 90%, and six controlled studies finding higher Sphagnum cover in sown versus unsown plots, with survival often requiring additional interventions like mulching. The moss layer transfer technique (Action 1804) represents a specific restoration approach using multiple interventions that showed development of bog-characteristic plant communities within 11 years and greater moss cover than unrestored areas after 4-8 years. Additional research comparing these specific methods directly could provide more definitive guidance for restoration practitioners.",

When combined with rewetting, tree removal shows more consistent benefits including increased cover of wetland-characteristic plants, Sphagnum moss cover, and herbaceous vegetation including cottongrasses and sedges (Action ID: 1732).\n\n**Water Table Management:**\nRewetting (raising the water table) is a fundamental intervention that shows increased wetland-characteristic plant abundance, improved Sphagnum moss cover (12 of 19 studies), and enhanced herb cover including sedges and cottongrasses (21 of 25 studies) (Action ID: 1756). This intervention typically reduces tree and shrub cover while promoting peatland vegetation.\n\n**Direct Planting:**\nDirect planting interventions include planting peatland mosses (Action ID: 1818), herbs (Action ID: 1819), and trees/shrubs (Action ID: 1820). Studies show planted mosses can survive and spread, increasing moss coverage. Planted herbs typically survive over 2-3 years, and most planted trees/shrubs show >50% survival over periods up to 13 years.\n\n**Seed Introduction:**\nIntroducing seeds of peatland trees/shrubs shows mixed results, with some studies reporting successful germination and survival of heather and willow seeds, and increased shrub cover in some cases (Action ID: 1824).\n\n**Site Stabilization Techniques:**\nAdditional interventions include stabilizing the peatland surface using materials like coconut fibre rolls (Action ID: 1815), applying organic mulch (Action ID: 1813), and using the moss layer transfer technique (Action ID: 1804) which has shown development of bog-characteristic plant communities within 11 years.\n\n**Supporting Interventions:**\nBuilding artificial bird perches can encourage seed dispersal (Action ID: 1817), and reprofiling/relandscaping (Action ID: 1807) can help prepare sites for vegetation recovery.",
