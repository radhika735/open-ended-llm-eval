    "relevant_summary": "European studies have documented both benefits and harms from reduced tillage systems. Benefits include: increased soil organic matter content (Action ID: 1371), higher soil organic carbon levels (Action ID: 906), improved soil water retention and availability (Action ID: 1385), increased microbial biomass in soils (Action ID: 1371), higher earthworm abundance and activity (Action ID: 126), enhanced soil aggregation and water-stability (Action ID: 1371), reduced soil erosion and runoff (Action ID: 906), and increased numbers of some farmland birds including Eurasian skylark (Action ID: 126). However, documented harms include: potential for higher soil compaction under reduced tillage (Action ID: 906), inconsistent or lower crop yields in some cases (Action ID: 1355, 1358), mixed effects on earthworm populations with some studies showing no difference (Action ID: 126), possible increases in greenhouse gas emissions including carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide (Action ID: 1371), inconsistent effects on invertebrate populations with some showing negative or no effects (Action ID: 126), and variable responses of weed populations (Action ID: 126). The evidence base consists of multiple replicated, controlled studies from European countries including Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Lithuania, Netherlands, Slovakia, Switzerland, UK, Italy, Spain, and Portugal.",

Thirty-four studies (of which 21 were replicated and controlled and seven also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found some positive effects on earthworms, some invertebrates (other than earthworms), weeds or farmland birds, of reducing tillage compared to conventional management. Positive effects included increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms, greater abundance of some invertebrates other than earthworms, increased numbers of some weeds and/or weed species, higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying date and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields, and greater abundance of some birds - including Eurasian skylark, seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in late winter on non-inversion or conservation tillage. A review found tillage had negative effects on invertebrate numbers and no-till systems had more invertebrate bird food resources.\\nTwenty-six studies (of which 13 replicated and controlled and three also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found reducing tillage had either negative, no effect or no consistent effects on abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates (other than earthworms), earthworm abundance, biomass, or species richness, number of different plant species found as seeds, number of some weed species, mammal abundance, some bird species, and one study found bird preferences for conservation tillage fields decreased over time. Two studies found that crop type affected the number of weeds under different tillage regimes.\\nOne small replicated trial in the UK compared bird numbers under two different forms of reduced tillage, and found more birds from species that make up the \\u2018Farmland Bird Index\\u2019 on broadcast than non-inversion tillage fields.\\nTwo studies looked at the long-term effects of reduced tillage on earthworms (after ten years). One study found higher earthworm biomass under reduced tillage, the other study found earthworm abundance was the same between conventional and reduced tillage plots.\\nThree of the studies mentioned above did not distinguish between the effects of reducing tillage and reduced pesticide and/or fertilizer inputs.\"\n}"

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done. One randomized, replicated study from Portugal found no effect of tillage treatment on yield.\\n\\u00a0\\nSOIL TYPES COVERED: anthrosol, calcareous silt loam, chalky, clay, clay loam, fine sandy loam, loam, loamy-clay, loam - sandy loam, loam \\u2013 silt-loam, loamy sand, loamy silt, non-chalky clay, sandy, sandy clay loam, sandy loam, sandy silt-loam, silt loam, silty, silty-clay, silty clay loam, silty loam.\"\n}"

For cover crops between crop rows (action 897), studies demonstrated increased bacterial activity, reduced erosion, enhanced soil stability, and increased soil organic matter. In contrast, cover crops in arable fields (actions 1357, 1394, 1345) when fields are empty showed more complex effects: 7 controlled studies found less water in soils with winter cover crops compared to bare plots, 5 controlled studies found reduced water loss through drainage, runoff, or evaporation, and 10 studies found variable nitrogen effects (10 found more nitrogen, 1 found less, 10 showed inconsistent results). Cover crops in empty fields reduced nitrate leaching in 4 studies, increased microbial biomass in 5 studies, and reduced soil erosion in 2 studies. The key difference is that between-row cover crops function as living mulches with immediate soil protection benefits, while cover crops in empty fields primarily serve to improve soil health and reduce nutrient loss during fallow periods.",

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done. One randomized, replicated study from Portugal found no effect of tillage treatment on yield.\\n\\u00a0\\nSOIL TYPES COVERED: anthrosol, calcareous silt loam, chalky, clay, clay loam, fine sandy loam, loam, loamy-clay, loam - sandy loam, loam \\u2013 silt-loam, loamy sand, loamy silt, non-chalky clay, sandy, sandy clay loam, sandy loam, sandy silt-loam, silt loam, silty, silty-clay, silty clay loam, silty loam.\"\n}"

One replicated trial from the USA found higher tomato yield from soils which had been under a ryegrass cover crop. Regarding crop residue management, two randomized, replicated trials from Australia and China found higher yields when residues were retained, with one trial finding this only when residue retention was done in combination with fertilizer application and no-tillage.

Amending soil with organic processing wastes or composts (Action 891) has been shown to improve soil structure and reduce soil loss, though it may increase nutrient loss at high application rates. Adding fresh plant material or crop remains (Action 910) improves soil structure when straw is incorporated, and also increases soil organic carbon and microbial biomass. Growing cover crops when fields are empty (Action 898) improves soil structure by increasing soil porosity and interconnectivity while reducing soil resistance. Adding mulch to crops (Action 887) improves soil structure and increases soil organic matter, with studies showing mulches increase soil stability and reduce erosion. Controlling traffic and traffic timing (Action 899) reduces soil compaction and increases water filtration into the soil, with research showing higher numbers of soil pores under controlled traffic systems. Using crop rotation (Action 857) and incorporating leys into crop rotation (Action 900) also contribute to improved soil health and structure on sandy-loam soils. These actions have been tested across various European locations and demonstrate measurable improvements in soil structure, porosity, stability, and resistance to erosion when implemented on sandy-loam soils.",

    "relevant_summary": "UK studies provide several evidence sources on soil amendments and nutrient loss. Research on formulated chemical compounds shows that three replicated trials from the UK and New Zealand found nitrification inhibitors reduced nitrate losses and nitrous oxide emissions [Thompson - action 909]. Studies on manure and agricultural composts demonstrate that UK research found reduced nutrient loss and higher nitrogen levels when farmyard or poultry manure was applied, with lower nutrient loss occurring when manure was applied in winter rather than autumn [action 911]. Research on organic processing wastes found that UK trials showed improved nutrient retention when molasses were added [action 891]. Studies incorporating fresh plant material found UK evidence of higher soil nitrogen levels when compost or straw was applied, with reduced nitrate leaching when straw was incorporated [action 910].",
