While seed-eating birds were found to prefer rye grass cut only once, insect-eating birds showed more variable results, with some preferring plots cut two or more times (132). In the first two years of one study, there was no difference in ground beetle abundance and diversity between cut and uncut silage field headlands, but the uncut plots had a higher species diversity in the third year (132). There were no studies found that looked at the effects on mammals of leaving uncut areas of ryegrass in silage fields (2400).\n\nRaising the mowing height on grasslands in the UK has been found to provide benefits to Eurasian skylarks, including increased productivity (138). One review also found that raised cutting heights were less damaging to amphibians and invertebrates (138). However, another study in the UK found that raising the mowing height on grasslands had no effect on the numbers of foraging birds or invertebrates, and a separate study found no difference in invertebrate abundance (138). Foraging success of northern lapwing and common starling chicks was found to be greater in shorter grass (138). For butterflies and moths, one UK study on intensively managed grassland found that plots cut to 10 cm had a similar species richness and abundance of butterflies and caterpillars to plots cut to 5 cm (3968). A UK review noted that while raising the mowing height may have increased the productivity of Eurasian skylarks, it was not enough to maintain the local population (222).",

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes. In one trial, these introduced species more commonly occupied the boxes than native bees.\\nA small trial tested three soil-filled nest boxes for the mining bee Andrena flavipes in the UK, but they were not occupied.\"\n}"

Restored grasslands have also been found to have similar communities of flower-visiting insects to ancient species-rich grasslands [8]. On the other hand, some studies have found no discernible impact on the species richness or abundance of plants and beetles, or the abundance of butterflies and moths [133]. Additionally, a study on semi-natural grasslands restored through scrub clearance and the reintroduction of grazing or mowing revealed that the butterfly communities were different from those in existing species-rich grasslands and did not become more similar over time [3955].",
