    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, very limited evidence exists for the effectiveness of strategies to combat white-nose syndrome in bats. The only strategy with documented evidence is treating bats with probiotic bacteria (Action 2008). Two studies evaluated probiotic treatment effects: one randomized, controlled study in Canada found that treating little brown bats with a probiotic bacterium at the time of infection with white-nose syndrome increased survival within cages in a laboratory, and one randomized, controlled study in the USA found that treating little brown bats with a probiotic bacterium within a mine increased survival for free-flying bats, but not caged bats (Action 2008). Regarding disease symptoms, the Canadian study found that little brown bats treated with a probiotic bacterium at the time of infection had reduced symptoms of the disease, but bats treated 21 days prior to infection had worse symptoms, while the USA study found that little brown bats kept within cages in a mine and treated with a probiotic bacterium had a similar severity of white-nose syndrome to untreated bats (Action 2008). For all other potential strategies, no studies were found that evaluated their effectiveness, including: culling infected bats (Action 1012), vaccination against the pathogen (Action 1011), captive breeding to supplement affected populations (Action 2009), treating hibernacula environments to reduce pathogen reservoir (Action 2007), decontaminating clothing and equipment (Action 2006), and restricting human access to caves (Action 1010).",
