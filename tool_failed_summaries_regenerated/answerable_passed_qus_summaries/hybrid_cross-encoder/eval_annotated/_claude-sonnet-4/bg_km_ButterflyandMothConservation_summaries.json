    "relevant_summary": "Forest canopy opening through clearing, coppicing, and thinning has differential effects on butterfly and moth communities. Thinning trees within forests generally increases butterfly species richness and abundance, with studies showing that coniferous woodland thinned along with prescribed burning, mulching or nearby felling had greater species richness of butterflies and higher abundance of all butterflies or specialist butterflies compared to unmanaged woodland (Action 3940). However, one study found that partially-cleared forest plots had higher butterfly but lower moth species richness than closed-canopy forest (Action 3940).\n\nClearing or opening patches in forests shows mixed effects depending on the taxa and patch characteristics. Cleared patches had greater species richness of butterflies but lower species richness of moths than unmanaged patches or closed canopy forest (Action 3938). Larger cleared patches supported higher species richness and abundance of butterflies than undisturbed forest, while smaller patches did not show this benefit (Action 3938). Studies found that cleared patches generally had higher abundance of butterflies, including specific species like chequered blue, woodland brown, high brown fritillary and small pearl-bordered fritillary, compared to before management or unmanaged areas (Action 3938). A review across Europe reported that clearing small patches in forests benefitted 19 out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern (Action 3938).\n\nCoppicing woodland creates varying effects based on the age of coppice. Coppiced woodland had greater species richness of butterflies than unmanaged woodland but lower species richness of macro-moths than mature forest (Action 3939). The abundance of butterflies was higher in woodland coppiced 2-4, 5-7 or 12-15 years ago than in woodland coppiced over 15 years ago (Action 3939). Heath fritillary populations were more likely to persist for up to 20 years in coppiced woodland than in mature conifer woodland (Action 3939).\n\nAlternative harvesting methods show different impacts compared to clearcutting. Thinning resulted in higher macro-moth species richness than patch-cutting or clearcutting, with richness similar to unharvested forest (Action 3868). Selective logging produced similar species richness of moths to group selection harvesting or clearcutting, but lower than unharvested forest (Action 3867). Selectively logged forests had higher abundance of exposed moth caterpillars but similar abundance of concealed moth caterpillars compared to clearcut forests (Action 3867).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on studies from the USA, both rotational burning and leaving unburned patches during prescribed fires show benefits for butterfly populations in prairies, with some important differences:\n\n**Leaving Unburned Patches (Action 3879):** Studies show that the abundance of Karner blue butterflies increased over 2-3 years in oak savannas and prairies where unburned patches were left during prescribed burning. Six out of nine specialist butterfly species were more abundant at sites with unburned areas compared to sites without unburned areas, while one species was less abundant and two had similar abundance. Karner blue butterflies were recorded using all 11 unburned patches surveyed within oak savannas and prairies managed by burning.\n\n**Rotational Burning (Action 3883):** Multiple studies found that the total abundance of prairie specialist, grassland and all butterflies was higher on prairies burned more than one, two or four years ago than on prairies burned in the last one or two years under rotational burning management. The abundance of grassland and generalist butterflies was highest in the third year after burning, and migrant butterflies in the first year after burning. Two studies found that pine-oak barrens and prairies managed by rotational burning every 2-5 years had higher total abundance of butterflies than unmanaged sites. However, rotational burning showed mixed effects across different studies, with some finding lower abundance in rotationally burned prairies compared to unmanaged areas in certain regions.\n\n**Species-Specific Responses (Actions 3882, 3883):** Regal fritillary abundance was higher in grasslands managed by rotational burning every three years than on unmanaged sites, and abundance was higher in rotationally burned prairies four years after the last burn than one or eight years after. However, some studies found that regal fritillary and arogos skipper were less abundant in burned prairies compared to hayed prairies. Karner blue butterfly abundance was similar in rotationally burned and unmanaged oak savannas and prairies.\n\nBoth approaches provide refugia and recovery opportunities for butterfly populations, but timing since last burn appears critical for rotational burning effectiveness, while unburned patches provide immediate refugia during active burning periods.",

Using shielded \"full cut-off\" lights to remove outwards lighting was found to attract fewer individual moths and moth species compared to conventional lights without blinds or filters in a study in Slovenia (Action 3904). Using low intensity lighting reduced moth attraction compared to higher intensity lights, as demonstrated in a study in Germany where fewer moths were attracted to low intensity lights that also emitted a narrower range of yellow light with little UV compared to higher intensity lights with broader spectra including UV (Action 3902). Using 'warmer' red/yellow lighting rather than other lighting colors significantly reduced moth attraction, with four studies in Germany, the Netherlands, Slovenia and the UK finding that fewer individual moths and moth species were attracted to yellow, green, white or red lights compared to UV, actinic, blue or conventional metal halide lights (Action 3906). One study in the Netherlands found that four moth species spent more time feeding under red lights than under white or green lights, but less time feeding than when in complete darkness (Action 3906). Additional potentially beneficial actions include restricting use of polarized light (Action 3903), using glazing treatments to reduce light spill from inside lit buildings (Action 3905), restricting timing of lighting to conserve areas with natural light regimes (Action 3901), minimizing road lighting to reduce insect attraction (Action 3852), and removing or changing turbine lighting to reduce insect attraction (Action 3843), though no studies have yet evaluated these specific interventions for butterfly and moth conservation.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on evidence from 16 studies evaluating butterfly and moth translocations and 13 studies evaluating captive-bred releases, the long-term success of re-establishing butterfly populations shows mixed results. For translocation programs within former range, eight studies reported that translocated populations persisted for 2-12 years and increased in abundance (Action 3909). However, three studies found that while some translocated populations persisted for 1-49 years and increased in abundance, other populations died out within 0-7 years (Action 3909). A review across the UK and Ireland found that only 25% of translocated and released captive-bred butterfly populations survived for at least three years, with 38% dying out within that timeframe, and only 8% surviving for more than 10 years (Action 3909). Another review reported that translocated large copper populations survived for up to 38 years but ultimately died out or required supplementation by further releases (Action 3909). For translocations outside known range, two of three studies reported populations persisting and increasing in abundance over 8 and 28 years, while one population died out within one year (Action 3911). For captive-bred releases, six studies reported populations persisting for 2-28 years and increasing in abundance, while two studies found populations died out after 1, 2, or 12 years or required further releases to survive (Action 3914). One study found that three of 10 captive-bred populations established, with at least one persisting for five years (Action 3914). A review found that 25% of captive-bred populations survived for more than 3 years, 38% died out within that time, and only 8% survived for more than 10 years (Action 3914). Released captive-bred caterpillars showed lower survival rates than wild or translocated caterpillars (Action 3914).",

Planting parks, gardens and road verges with appropriate native species shows positive effects, with studies finding that gardens and road verges planted with native species had greater species richness of butterfly and moth adults and caterpillars than areas with mixed or exclusively non-native plant species, and higher abundance of butterfly and moth caterpillars (action 3842). Wildlife gardening practices can also help, with studies showing that gardens where insecticides and herbicides were not used had higher butterfly abundance (action 3834). Stopping the use of pesticides as seed dressings and sprays in flower beds and greenspaces is beneficial, with research showing gardens where insecticides and herbicides were not used had higher abundance of butterflies (action 3900). Altering mowing regimes on greenspaces and road verges provides significant benefits, with less frequently mown or unmown urban greenspaces having higher species richness and diversity of butterflies and moths than more frequently mown areas, and unmown public parks having higher abundance of all adult butterflies than regularly mown areas (action 3841). Creating nectar flower mixture and wildflower strips is effective, with studies finding sown wildflower strips had higher species richness and diversity of butterflies and moths than conventional field margins, unsown margins, and cropped fields, as well as higher abundance of butterflies (action 3932).",

    "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4",
    "provider": null,
    "relevant_summary": "Management of linear features like road verges and power lines has various effects on butterflies and moths depending on the method used. Power line management through mechanical cutting increases butterfly species richness and abundance compared to unmanaged land, with highest species richness occurring 2-4 years after scrub and tree clearance (Action 3855). The timing of power line management matters, with areas cleared 2-4 years earlier supporting higher butterfly abundance than those cleared 1 year or 6-8 years earlier, and chequered skipper abundance being higher in areas cleared \u22642 years ago than in areas cut \u22654 years earlier (Action 3855).\n\nStopping herbicide use on road verges benefits butterflies and moths. Restored roadside prairies with restricted herbicide application show greater butterfly species richness, abundance, and lower mortality risk compared to verges dominated by non-native weeds with unrestricted herbicide use (Action 3899). Transmission lines neither sprayed nor mown have greater abundance of northern pearl crescent and pearl crescent butterflies compared to sprayed and mown areas (Action 3899).\n\nMowing regimes significantly affect butterfly and moth communities. Less frequently mown or unmown urban greenspaces and road verges have higher species richness and diversity of butterflies and moths than frequently mown areas (Action 3841). Road verges mown less frequently or later in summer have fewer dead butterflies killed by traffic than more frequently or earlier mown verges (Action 3841). Roadsides mown in late summer support more ringlet butterflies than those mown in mid-summer (Action 3841).\n\nRotational mowing provides substantial benefits. Grasslands managed by mowing strips in alternate years or mowing parts of sites at different times show greater species richness and diversity of butterflies than grasslands cut completely once per year (Action 3966). Rotationally mown grasslands support higher butterfly and burnet moth abundance than grasslands cut in full, and 29 out of 32 butterfly species prefer meadows half-mown in June and August to meadows cut completely twice per year (Action 3966).\n\nSpecies-rich grassland restoration along road verges enhances butterfly and moth communities. Restored roadside prairies and verges sown with native wildflowers, more butterfly larval food plants, and more plant species support higher species richness and diversity of butterflies, day-flying moths, burnet moths, and meadow-specialist moths compared to verges dominated by non-native vegetation (Action 3854). Wide road verges support higher butterfly species richness and abundance than narrow road verges (Action 3854).\n\nReducing cutting frequency generally benefits butterflies and moths. Meadows cut once per year have higher species richness of butterflies and moths than meadows cut two or more times per year in most studies, and meadows cut occasionally or once per year support higher abundance of certain species like Scotch argus compared to intensively mown grasslands (Action 3961).",

Two of four replicated studies found that forest plots fenced to exclude or reduce the density of non-native pigs and deer had greater species richness of butterflies and macro-moths than unfenced plots (Action 3891). However, two studies found that forest plots fenced to exclude elk had mixed effects on species richness and abundance of butterflies and arthropods including moths depending on fire intensity and year (Action 3891). One study found that grassland plots fenced to exclude elk had similar species richness and abundance of butterflies to unfenced plots in all years (Action 3891). A global systematic review found that reducing or removing grazing or browsing by wild or domestic herbivores in temperate and boreal forests increased the abundance of butterflies and moths but did not affect species richness (Action 3891). For survival and condition measures, all Glanville fritillary caterpillar nests survived in grassland fenced to exclude sheep compared to 88% in grazed areas, and fewer caterpillar nests were damaged in fenced areas (Action 3891). For invertebrate herbivore exclusion, one study found higher density of pearl-bordered fritillary butterflies at sites fenced to exclude grazing animals than at unfenced sites (Action 3885). Traditional grazing management showed that wet meadows managed by light grazing with cattle or horses had similar butterfly species richness and abundance compared to mowing management, but bog fritillaries showed lower numbers and reduced use of areas after cattle grazing began (Action 3971).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence, grassland restoration from arable land generally shows positive outcomes for butterfly communities. Action 3929 found that grasslands restored from arable land developed butterfly communities that became increasingly similar to existing high-quality grasslands over the first 10 years after establishment, with 4-5-year-old created grasslands and abandoned cropland having greater species richness of butterflies than conventionally managed grassland or cultivated farms. Restored grasslands showed higher abundance of moths than conventional grassland and similar abundance to semi-natural grasslands. The effectiveness varied with establishment methods, with grasslands established by sowing grasses, legumes and forbs having higher species richness and abundance of butterflies than grass-only mixes.\n\nRegarding abandoned meadows, Actions 3957 and 3956 provide evidence on cessation of management (mowing and grazing). Action 3957 found that grasslands abandoned for various periods (3-13 years, 10-20 years) generally had similar species richness of butterflies and moths to grasslands managed by mowing, though some studies found abandoned grasslands had lower abundance of all butterflies than mowed grasslands. Action 3956 showed that grasslands abandoned from grazing for 1-25 years had mixed results - some had higher abundance of butterflies and moths than grazed grasslands, while others had lower abundance or similar levels depending on the butterfly species and time since abandonment.\n\nAction 3955 found that semi-natural grasslands restored by scrub clearance and reintroduction of grazing or mowing had different butterfly communities to existing species-rich grasslands and did not become more similar over time. However, direct comparative studies between restoration from arable land versus restoration from abandoned meadows were not identified in the evidence.",

Six out of nine specialist butterfly species were more abundant in pine barrens and prairies where unburned areas were left during prescribed burning compared to sites without unburned areas (action 3879). Negative impacts include: One study found that mixed forest and shrubland sites which had been burned the year before had similar butterfly species richness to unburned sites (action 3877). One study reported that in the spring after selective burning of eucalyptus forest there were fewer Eltham copper caterpillars than before (action 3877). The timing of prescribed burning affects outcomes, with one study finding that management of tropical savanna and floodplain with early season burning or no burning for 2-5 years increased caterpillar abundance, but management with late season burning did not (action 3878). Leaving unburned refugia appears beneficial, as Karner blue butterflies were recorded using all 11 unburned patches surveyed within oak savannas and prairies managed by burning (action 3879).",

    "relevant_summary": "Several conservation actions can be implemented in urban environments to support butterfly and moth populations. Protecting greenfield sites or undeveloped land in urban areas is effective, with studies showing protected native forest and grassland in urban areas had higher species richness of butterflies than urban parks or non-native plantations (action 3836). \n\nPlanting parks, gardens and road verges with appropriate native species significantly benefits butterfly and moth populations. Three of five studies found that gardens and road verges planted with native species had greater species richness of butterfly and moth adults and caterpillars than areas with mixed or exclusively non-native plant species. Two of three studies also found higher abundance of butterfly and moth caterpillars in gardens planted with native species (action 3842).\n\nWildlife gardening practices can provide benefits, with one study finding that gardens where insecticides and herbicides were not used had higher abundance of butterflies (action 3834). Similarly, stopping the use of pesticides as seed dressings and sprays in flower beds and greenspaces resulted in higher butterfly abundance when insecticides and herbicides were not used (action 3900).\n\nStopping herbicide use on pavements and road verges showed positive effects. One study found that restored roadside prairies where herbicide application was restricted had greater species richness and abundance of butterflies than verges with no restrictions on herbicide application (action 3899).\n\nAltering mowing regimes on greenspaces and road verges benefits butterfly and moth populations. Two studies found that less frequently mown or unmown urban greenspaces had higher species richness and diversity of butterflies and moths than more frequently mown areas. Additionally, unmown public parks and road verges had higher abundance of butterflies than regularly mown areas (action 3841).\n\nPlanting nectar flower mixtures/wildflower strips is effective for urban conservation. Eight of thirteen studies found that sown wildflower strips had higher species richness and diversity of butterflies and moths than conventional field margins, unsown margins, or cropped fields. Ten studies found that sown wildflower strips had higher abundance of butterflies than conventional field margins or unsown margins (action 3932).\n\nRestoring or maintaining species-rich grassland along road/railway verges provides significant benefits. Four studies found that restored roadside prairies and verges sown with native wildflowers had higher species richness and diversity of butterflies and moths than verges dominated by non-native vegetation. Two studies found that restored roadside prairies had greater abundance of butterflies than verges dominated by non-native vegetation (action 3854).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on evidence from European studies, sown wildflower strips consistently outperform uncultivated margins for butterfly communities in several key metrics. Sown wildflower strips had higher species richness and diversity of butterflies than conventional field margins, unsown margins, and cropped fields (action 3932). Eight of thirteen studies found sown wildflower strips had higher butterfly species richness and diversity than conventional field margins and unsown margins (action 3932). Additionally, ten studies found sown wildflower strips had higher abundance of all butterflies, generalist butterflies, and specialist butterflies than conventional field margins, unsown margins, and cropped fields (action 3932).\n\nIn direct comparisons, field margins sown with wildflowers had greater species richness and higher abundance of butterflies than grass-only field margins (action 3932). Two studies found that floristically enhanced grass buffers or wildflower strips had higher abundance of butterflies than uncultivated margins (action 3982).\n\nIn contrast, uncultivated margins showed mixed results compared to sown options. Two of five studies found that uncultivated margins had lower species richness or diversity of butterflies than margins sown with grasses and forbs or wildflowers (action 3981). Six of seven studies found that the abundance of butterflies and moths was lower in uncultivated margins than in margins sown with grasses, forbs, or wildflowers (action 3981). However, one study found the species richness of butterflies and day-flying moths was higher in permanent uncultivated margins than in sown fallow plots (action 3981).\n\nManagement factors also influence effectiveness - uncultivated margins that were not cut or were only cut in spring or autumn had higher species richness and abundance of butterflies than margins cut in summer (action 3981). Width was important for both margin types, with wider margins (up to 6m) showing greater species richness and abundance than narrower margins (actions 3981, 3982).",

However, grasslands abandoned for more than 50 years had lower species richness than grasslands mowed annually, and grasslands abandoned for 6-13 years had lower species richness than grasslands managed by traditional rotational mowing and burning.\n\nFor abundance when ceasing mowing (Action 3957): Results were mixed - four studies found that grasslands abandoned for >1-20 years had lower abundance of all butterflies or some butterfly species than grasslands mowed once or twice per year, while four other studies found that abandoned grasslands had higher abundance of all butterflies, 11 species of butterfly, and some moths than annually mowed grasslands. Two studies found that abandoned grasslands had higher abundance of woodland and hedgerow butterflies but lower abundance of grassland or farmland species, with silver-studded blue going extinct in some abandoned meadows.\n\nFor species richness when ceasing grazing (Action 3956): Six of nine studies found that grasslands not grazed for >5 years had similar species richness of butterflies and moths to grazed grasslands, with one study finding that grasslands abandoned for 5-15 years had greater species richness than sheep-grazed grasslands. However, two studies found that grasslands abandoned for >5-20 years had lower species richness than grazed grasslands. Three studies found that grasslands abandoned for 4-10 years had higher species richness than extensively or commercially grazed grasslands.\n\nFor abundance when ceasing grazing (Action 3956): Six of 20 studies found that grasslands abandoned for 1-25 years had higher abundance of butterflies, moths, and caterpillars than grazed grasslands, while four studies found lower abundance in abandoned grasslands. Four studies found similar abundance between abandoned and grazed grasslands.

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, several alternatives to prescribed fire exist for maintaining disturbance in forest habitats that benefit butterflies and moths:\n\n**Mechanical vegetation management:** Mechanically removing mid-storey or ground vegetation to create fire breaks has been shown to benefit butterflies, with cork oak woodlands having greater butterfly species richness and abundance when woody understorey vegetation was cleared more recently or regularly (Action 3881). Cutting heathland has demonstrated positive effects, with one study showing pine barrens managed by mechanical cutting had higher abundance of Karner blue butterflies than those managed by rotational burning (Action 3947).\n\n**Coppicing woodland:** This traditional management practice creates beneficial disturbance for butterflies and moths. Coppiced woodland supported different communities of moths and butterflies compared to unmanaged areas, with some studies showing greater species richness of butterflies in coppiced woodland than unmanaged woodland. The abundance of heath fritillary was higher in coppiced woodland than unmanaged woodland, and pearl-bordered fritillary populations were more likely to persist in coppiced woodland than mature conifer woodland (Action 3939).\n\n**Forest thinning:** Thinning trees within forests has proven effective for butterflies and moths. Coniferous woodland that had been thinned showed greater species richness and higher abundance of butterflies compared to unmanaged woodland. Partially-cleared forest plots had higher butterfly species richness than closed-canopy forest plots (Action 3940).\n\n**Creating forest openings:** Clearing or opening patches in forests benefits butterflies specifically. Cleared patches in forests had greater species richness of butterflies than unmanaged patches or closed canopy forest. Larger cleared patches supported higher species richness and abundance of butterflies than undisturbed forest. Various species including chequered blue, woodland brown, high brown fritillary, and small pearl-bordered fritillary showed higher abundance in cleared patches (Action 3938).\n\n**Selective logging practices:** Using selective or reduced impact logging instead of conventional logging provides benefits. Forests harvested by single tree selection maintained similar species richness of moths to other management approaches. Selectively logged forests had higher abundance of exposed moth caterpillars compared to clearcut forests (Action 3867). Group harvesting or thinning instead of clearcutting showed that thinned forests had higher species richness of macro-moths than patch-cutting or clearcutting (Action 3868).\n\n**Herbivore management:** Removing, controlling or excluding vertebrate herbivores can create beneficial conditions. Forest plots fenced to exclude non-native pigs and deer had greater species richness of butterflies and macro-moths than unfenced plots. Multiple studies showed higher abundance of butterflies, moths, and caterpillars in areas where herbivores were excluded or controlled (Action 3891).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from multiple studies, the most effective methods for reducing grazing intensity on grasslands to benefit butterfly populations include:\n\n**Seasonal removal of livestock**: Studies show that removing cattle or sheep during critical periods (summer, winter, or during peak flowering) increases butterfly abundance and diversity. Three controlled studies found grasslands where cattle or cattle and sheep were removed in summer, or sheep removed in winter, had higher abundance of butterflies and caterpillars than continuously grazed grasslands (Action 3960). However, effectiveness varies, with some studies showing similar species richness between seasonally managed and continuously grazed areas.\n\n**Reducing stocking density**: Eight replicated studies found that grasslands grazed with lower stocking densities of sheep, cattle, or mixed livestock had greater abundance of butterflies, moths, and their caterpillars than grasslands grazed at higher stocking densities (Action 3959). Five of eight studies also found greater species richness of adult butterflies, moths, and burnet moths at lower stocking densities. A European review reported that reducing grazing intensity benefitted 41 out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern.\n\n**Multiple low-intensity interventions**: Six of ten studies found that less intensively managed grasslands (combining reduced grazing, reduced fertilizer use, and modified cutting regimes) had higher species richness of butterflies and moths than conventionally managed grasslands (Action 3958). Three of four studies showed higher abundance of butterflies, micro-moths, and declining macro-moths in low-input grasslands.\n\n**Rotational grazing**: Mixed evidence exists for rotational grazing systems. Two of four studies found rotationally grazed grasslands had greater species richness and abundance of butterflies and burnet moths than continuously grazed grassland, though effectiveness varied by stocking density and year (Action 3965).\n\n**Complete grazing cessation**: Results are variable for completely stopping grazing. Six of twenty studies found grasslands abandoned for 1-25 years had higher abundance of butterflies and moths than grazed grasslands, but four studies found lower abundance in abandoned areas. The timing matters - butterfly density was highest in grasslands where grazing ceased 2-9 years ago compared to those abandoned longer or currently grazed (Action 3956).\n\nThe evidence indicates that moderate reductions in grazing intensity through seasonal removal and reduced stocking density are generally more effective for butterfly conservation than complete abandonment or very intensive management.",

Three controlled studies found grasslands where cattle or cattle and sheep were removed in summer, or sheep removed in winter, had higher abundance of butterflies and caterpillars than continuously grazed grasslands (Action 3960). However, effectiveness varies, with some studies showing similar species richness between seasonally managed and continuously grazed areas.\\n\\n**Reducing stocking density**: Eight replicated studies found that grasslands grazed with lower stocking densities of sheep, cattle, or mixed livestock had greater abundance of butterflies, moths, and their caterpillars than grasslands grazed at higher stocking densities (Action 3959). Five of eight studies also found greater species richness of adult butterflies, moths, and burnet moths at lower stocking densities. A European review reported that reducing grazing intensity benefitted 41 out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern.\\n\\n**Multiple low-intensity interventions**: Six of ten studies found that less intensively managed grasslands (combining reduced grazing, reduced fertilizer use, and modified cutting regimes) had higher species richness of butterflies and moths than conventionally managed grasslands (Action 3958). Three of four studies showed higher abundance of butterflies, micro-moths, and declining macro-moths in low-input grasslands.\\n\\n**Rotational grazing**: Mixed evidence exists for rotational grazing systems. Two of four studies found rotationally grazed grasslands had greater species richness and abundance of butterflies and burnet moths than continuously grazed grassland, though effectiveness varied by stocking density and year (Action 3965).\\n\\n**Complete grazing cessation**: Results are variable for completely stopping grazing. Six of twenty studies found grasslands abandoned for 1-25 years had higher abundance of butterflies and moths than grazed grasslands, but four studies found lower abundance in abandoned areas.
