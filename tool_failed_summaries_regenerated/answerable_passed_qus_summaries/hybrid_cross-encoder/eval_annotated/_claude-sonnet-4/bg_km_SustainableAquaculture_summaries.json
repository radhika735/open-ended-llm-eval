Natural control agents include using cleaner wrasse, with studies showing that corkwing and goldskinny cleaner wrasse were as effective at controlling lice infestation as chemical treatments, though rockcook cleaner wrasse were ineffective at preventing lice outbreaks (Action ID: 738). Environmental modifications include altering lighting, with studies showing lower numbers of lice on salmon kept in low intensity artificial light or natural lighting compared to intense artificial light (Action ID: 741), and altering cage size, with larger cages recording lower levels of amoebic gill disease compared to smaller cages (Action ID: 742). Nutritional and biological interventions include using probiotics and immunostimulants, which reduced the number of salmon infected with lice by 28% when fed a diet composed of fish meal and 28% plant-based protein, with beta-glucans decreasing lice infection levels by a further 28% (Action ID: 732). Vaccination provides higher survival rates post exposure to disease-causing bacteria including Aeromonas salmonicida, Yersinia ruckeri, marine flexibacteriosis, bacterial kidney disease, and infectious salmon anaemia (Action ID: 733). Breeding for resistance traits shows increased survival levels in salmon exposed to infectious pancreatic necrosis when families are bred for high disease resistance (Action ID: 735). Management practices include establishing fallowing systems, which recorded lower lice numbers on Atlantic salmon in cages, though showed no difference in mortality from Amoebic Gill Disease (Action ID: 1026). Freshwater bathing provides mixed results for reducing amoebic gill disease, with one study showing reduction in amoebae numbers for up to 10 days, while another found similar levels in treated and untreated salmon (Action ID: 739). Aerobic training, particularly interval training, shows higher survival rates in salmon exposed to infectious pancreatic necrosis (Action ID: 740).",

Natural control agents using cleaner wrasse show mixed effectiveness, with one controlled study in Ireland finding that corkwing and goldskinny cleaner wrasse were as effective at controlling lice infestation as chemical treatments, while another study found rockcook cleaner wrasse were ineffective at preventing lice outbreaks (Action 738). Lighting management can be effective, as a controlled study in Norway reported lower numbers of lice on salmon kept in low intensity artificial light or natural lighting, with more intense artificial light correlating with higher lice numbers (Action 741). Fallowing systems, where fish cages are left empty between production cycles, have shown promise, with a study in Scotland recording lower lice numbers on Atlantic salmon in cages using this method (Action 1026). Dietary approaches include probiotics and immunostimulants, with a controlled study in Norway finding that salmon fed a diet with beta-glucans had lice infection levels reduced by 28% compared to controls (Action 732). Freshwater bathing has been tested as a treatment method, though results are mixed, with one study in Australia showing reduction in amoebae numbers on salmon gills persisting for up to 10 days after bathing, while another found similar levels in treated and untreated salmon (Action 739). Integrated aquaculture systems represent another approach, though specific sea lice control data was not provided in the available studies (Action 932).",

For genetically modified alternatives, three controlled, replicated (two randomised) studies in Norway found no difference in growth rate of Atlantic salmon that were fed diets containing either GM or non-GM soybeans, and one randomised, replicated, controlled study found no differences in fish histology (Action 928). For yeast protein sources, one replicated, controlled experiment in Norway found no differences in weight between Atlantic salmon fed diets containing the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica compared to a control diet containing fishmeal (Action 920). For plant-based protein sources, studies from Norway found mixed results: some studies showed decreased growth rates with plant-based proteins while three replicated and/or controlled studies found similar growth rates compared to fish meal diets, and some studies found reduced final body weights while two controlled studies found similar final body weights (Action 924). Feed efficiency results were also mixed, with two replicated, controlled studies showing lowered feeding efficiency while one replicated study found increased feeding efficiency in salmon fed plant-based protein diets (Action 924). For plant-based oil sources, three replicated studies (two controlled) in Norway found growth rates were similar in salmon fed diets containing fish oil and vegetable oil, while one replicated study found growth rates were higher in fish fed vegetable oil (Action 926). Two replicated studies (one controlled) in Norway found similar average final body weights between salmon fed both fish oil and vegetable oil diets (Action 926). For krill protein sources, two replicated studies in Norway found similar final weight gain between salmon fed diets containing fish meal only or a krill meal substitute, with better growth rates when krill were de-shelled (Action 916). For bacterial protein sources, two replicated, controlled studies in Norway found similar growth rates in salmon fed either 100% fish meal diet or experimental diets containing up to 25% bacterial protein, but growth rates were lower with 50% bacterial protein, while another replicated, controlled study reported higher growth rates with 18% and 36% bacterial protein (Action 918).

Genetically modified soybeans showed no difference in growth rate compared to non-GM soybeans when fed to Atlantic salmon (Action 928). Bacterial protein can be included up to 25% as a replacement for fish meal without affecting growth rates, although at 50% replacement growth rates were lower (Action 918). Krill meal substitutes produced similar final weight gain to fish meal diets, with feed conversion ratios also being similar between fish meal and krill meal diets (Action 916). The yeast Yarrowia lipolytica showed no differences in weight compared to a control diet containing fishmeal (Action 920). Plant-based oils as alternatives to fish oil demonstrated similar growth rates and average final body weights compared to fish oil diets (Action 926). Reduced fish meal diets showed similar final weights in salmon fed low, medium or high levels of fish meal (Action 915). For supplements, phytase and phosphate supplementation showed no difference in weight gain, while taurine supplementation also showed no difference in weight gain (Action 930). Additionally, beta-glucans and mannan oligosaccharides can be added to improve specific health outcomes without negative growth impacts (Action 732).\", \"action_ids\": [\"928\",\"918\",\"916\",\"920\",\"926\",\"915\",\"930\",\"732\"]}",
