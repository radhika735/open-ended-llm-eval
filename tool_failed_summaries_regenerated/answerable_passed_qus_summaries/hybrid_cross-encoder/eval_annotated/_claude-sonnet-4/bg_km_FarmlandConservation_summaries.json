    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence from UK studies, there are distinct findings for each approach but no direct comparative studies between leaving uncut strips versus raising mowing height in silage fields. For leaving uncut strips of rye grass: Two reviews and two replicated controlled trials from the UK found that leaving uncut strips of rye grass on silage fields resulted in benefits to birds including increased numbers (Action 132). Seed-eating birds preferred rye grass cut once only, while insect-eating birds showed more variable results with some preferring plots cut two or more times (Action 132). Two reviews and replicated controlled studies found that seed-eating birds were more abundant on uncut plots than on cut plots (Action 224). One study found higher ground beetle species diversity in uncut plots by the third year of the experiment (Action 132). For raising mowing height: A review from the UK found that raising mowing height may have increased productivity of Eurasian skylarks, but not sufficiently to maintain the local population (Action 222). A randomized, replicated and controlled study from the UK found that no more foraging birds were attracted to plots with raised mowing heights, compared to plots with shorter grass (Action 222). Studies found raised cutting heights were less damaging to amphibians and invertebrates, but had no effect on numbers of foraging birds or invertebrates in another trial (Action 138). One study found that northern lapwing and common starling chicks had greater foraging success in shorter grass (Action 138). The evidence suggests uncut strips provide clearer benefits for seed-eating birds, while raising mowing height shows mixed and less consistent results for wildlife benefits in UK grasslands.",

One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage.

One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate.

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from European studies, several management techniques are available to restore or create species-rich wet meadows in agricultural landscapes. From studies across France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Switzerland and the UK, successful restoration techniques include topsoil removal, introduction of target plant species, raising water levels, grazing, mowing, or combinations of topsoil removal with target plant species introduction plus livestock exclusion (Action 119). Water level management is particularly important, with raising water levels in ditches or grassland showing positive effects on bird numbers, plant species that favour wet conditions, and invertebrate numbers in agricultural landscapes, though some studies found net loss of plant species (Action 121). Active water level management, including controlled flooding and water fluctuation, can generate plant communities characteristic of wetter conditions and increase wetland-characteristic species abundance (Action 3038).\n\nTraditional water meadow maintenance involves specific management regimes including grazing and mowing. Mowing once per year in autumn or light grazing with cattle or horses produces similar butterfly species richness (Action 3971). Grazing management shows mixed impacts, with some studies finding benefits for certain species but reduced productivity for others. Studies indicate that cutting in June maintained relatively stable vegetation, while mowing effects on plant species richness were variable (Action 696). For general grassland restoration, effective techniques include grazing, introducing plant species, hay spreading and mowing, with positive restoration signs typically visible within 5-10 years (Action 133).\n\nManagement intensity reduction through several interventions shows benefits, with 22 studies finding positive effects on wildlife groups including plants, invertebrates and birds, though results can be variable depending on the specific interventions applied (Action 69). The timing and type of management is crucial, with species-rich grasslands showing different responses to mowing versus grazing regimes depending on the target species and local conditions (Action 3908).",

Three of these studies found that grasslands managed by haying had a higher abundance of individual butterfly species\\u00a0than grasslands managed by grazing\\u00a0or burning\\u00a0or unmanaged grasslands. Four of these studies found that specific butterfly species\\u00a0and all butterflies\\u00a0were less abundant in mown, grazed\\u00a0or rotationally burned\\u00a0grassland than in unmanaged, rotationally burned\\u00a0or grazed and burned grassland.\\u00a0The ninth study found that in some areas, the abundance of specialist and grassland butterflies was higher in prairies managed by two-year rotational haying or by grazing, but in all cases abundance was higher at sites longer after they were last managed. One of three replicated, site comparison studies in Germany\\u00a0and Switzerland\\u00a0found that traditional hay meadows mown once/year in June or July had a higher abundance of heath fritillary adults and caterpillars than old, abandoned meadows. One study found that summer-grazed or mown grasslands had a higher abundance of farmland butterflies and burnet moths, but a lower abundance of woodland butterflies and burnet moths, than abandoned grasslands. The third study found that mown grasslands had a lower abundance of moths than unmown grasslands, but grazed grasslands had a similar abundance of moths to ungrazed grasslands. Two replicated, site comparison studies in China\\u00a0and Switzerland\\u00a0found that semi-natural grasslands managed by grazing\\u00a0or cutting twice/year after mid-June\\u00a0had a lower abundance of marsh fritillary eggs and caterpillars\\u00a0and adult butterflies\\u00a0than ungrazed margins and intercrops\\u00a0or sown wildflower strips. One replicated, site comparison study in Hungary\\u00a0found that semi-natural grasslands managed by either light grazing or mowing once/year in May or June had a higher abundance of butterflies than conventional wheat fields.\\nSurvival (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in China\\u00a0found that marsh fritillary eggs had a similar survival rate in uncultivated, grazed meadows and cultivated, ungrazed field margins and intercrops, but the survival of caterpillars was higher in the grazed meadows.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (5 STUDIES)\\nUse (5 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies in Austria\\u00a0and Germany\\u00a0found that 14 species of moth\\u00a0preferred grazed pastures while 24 others avoided them, and three species of butterfly\\u00a0and ten nocturnal moths\\u00a0preferred mown meadows, while 19 nocturnal moth species avoided them. One replicated, site comparison study in Spain\\u00a0found that meadows managed by summer-grazing or hay-mowing were more likely to be occupied by grizzled skipper and painted lady than unmanaged meadows, but small pearl-bordered fritillary occurred less frequently in grazed meadows than in hay meadows or abandoned meadows. One replicated, site comparison study in Finland and Russia\\u00a0found that three of 37 butterfly species preferred meadows which were mown annually in July or August to cattle-grazed pasture, but the other 34 species showed no preference. One replicated, site comparison study in China\\u00a0found that uncultivated, grazed meadows were less likely to be occupied by marsh fritillary eggs and caterpillars than cultivated field margins and intercrops.\"\n}"

For set-aside areas, 34 studies found that 20 showed benefits to or higher use by all wildlife groups considered, while 12 found some species or groups used set-aside more than crops but others did not, and two studies found no effect (Action 156). A systematic review found significantly higher densities of farmland birds on fields removed from production and under set-aside designation than on conventionally farmed fields in both winter and summer (Action 156). Set-aside areas also showed higher species richness of bees nesting or foraging when annually mown and left to naturally regenerate for two years or more (Action 7). However, set-aside did not enhance small mammal numbers relative to cropland or brown hare numbers relative to farms without set-aside areas (Action 2377).\n\nFor converting arable land to permanent grassland, the evidence shows limited benefits for some wildlife groups but not others. All seven studies looking at the effects of reverting arable land to grassland found no clear benefit to wildlife, including UK birds in winter and summer, wading birds in Denmark, grey partridges, brown hares in the UK, and plants in the Czech Republic (Action 561). One controlled before-and-after study showed that grey partridge numbers fell significantly following the reversion of arable fields to grassland (Action 561, Action 210). However, for butterflies and moths, restored grasslands showed more positive outcomes, with created grasslands having greater species richness of butterflies, burnet moths and all moths than conventionally managed grassland or cultivated farms, and higher abundance of moths than conventional grassland (Action 3929).",

    "relevant_summary": "Several alternatives to direct predator control exist for improving the breeding success of ground-nesting birds on farmland. Leaving cultivated, uncropped margins or plots (including lapwing plots) provides benefits to target farmland bird species, with studies finding increased northern lapwing hatching success and Eurasian skylark nesting success (Action 562). Creating specific skylark plots has shown positive effects, with all studies finding increases in skylark population size, breeding density, duration or success relative to fields without plots (Action 540). Providing set-aside areas in farmland shows benefits, with studies finding higher nest survival or productivity on set-aside than control fields for skylarks (Action 156). Physical protection of individual nests through exclosures offers benefits, with protected nests having higher average daily survival rates than unprotected nests for common redshank and northern lapwing, and higher hatching rates for southern dunlin (Action 108). Protecting nests from livestock trampling through fencing around individual nests has been successful (Action 237). Reducing tillage practices benefits ground-nesting birds, with studies finding higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying dates and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields (Action 126). Providing supplementary food increases farmland bird abundance, breeding population size, body mass, hatching, nestling growth and fledging rates (Action 648). Planting cereals in wide-spaced rows offers benefits over conventional wheat for Eurasian skylarks, though one study found fewer skylark nests than in control fields (Action 216).",

However, some studies found that only certain species benefited - one study found that only Eurasian skylark and Eurasian linnet benefited out of 23 farmland bird species tested, while another found only grey partridge and tree sparrow showed positive population responses (Action 695). For spring sowing, a replicated controlled study from Sweden found more bird species on areas with spring sown cereals compared with winter cereals, and a UK study found several species bred in the study site for the first time after spring sowing began (Action 207). Three studies found population increases after spring sowing began or higher populations on sites with spring-sown cereals compared to sites with winter cereals (Action 207). Five studies found that planting crops in spring rather than autumn resulted in higher numbers of farmland birds (Action 137). However, a replicated study found that winter and spring sown crops were used for different broods by Eurasian skylarks, and hatching success was lower on spring-sown crops than autumn sown (Actions 137, 207). The evidence suggests both practices provide different types of benefits to farmland birds, with overwinter stubbles particularly benefiting seed-eating birds during winter, while spring sowing appears to support breeding bird communities.",

Eight studies from Finland, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and UK found nest boxes in agricultural habitats were occupied by various species including Eurasian kestrel, long-eared owl, starlings, tits, tree sparrow, stock dove, jackdaw, Eurasian wryneck and Eurasian hoopoe (Action 155). Swedish studies showed nest success was related to pasture availability and higher positioning (Action 155). For bumblebees, three UK trials since 1989 showed very low uptake rates of 0-2.5% for various designs, though earlier trials in USA/Canada showed 10-48% uptake (Action 48). Underground nest boxes buried 5-10cm with 30-80cm entrance pipes showed 6-58% occupancy in USA, Canada and UK trials (Action 48).

Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes. In one trial, these introduced species more commonly occupied the boxes than native bees.\\nA small trial tested three soil-filled nest boxes for the mining bee Andrena flavipes in the UK, but they were not occupied.\"\n}"

Two studies found restoration took more than 10 years, and six studies found limited or slow changes in plant communities following restoration (Action 133). \n\nMore specifically, prairies restored 5-10 years ago by seeding with native species, mowing, and weeding or applying herbicide had greater abundance of certain butterfly species than prairies restored 1-2 years ago, and similar abundance to remnant prairies (Action 3943). Grasslands restored from bare soil by seeding developed butterfly communities that were increasingly similar to existing high-quality grasslands over the first 10 years after establishment (Action 3929). Studies found that 4-5-year-old created grasslands had greater species richness of butterflies, burnet moths and all moths than conventionally managed grassland (Action 3929).\n\nHowever, some differences persist over longer periods - two studies found differences in vegetation between restored and existing species-rich grasslands nine or 60 years after restoration (Action 133). The species richness of butterflies on restored grasslands remained similar over time since restoration, showing stability once established (Action 3955).

For invertebrates, 6 out of 10 studies from three European countries showed agri-environment schemes maintained or had little or no effect on some invertebrates in terms of diversity, abundance, species richness or bee colony growth, while five studies found increases in abundance or species richness of some invertebrates (Action 700). Specifically for wild bees, four replicated trials in Europe showed enhanced diversity and/or abundance of foraging wild bees on land managed under various European agri-environment schemes, but four other replicated trials found that the number of bees and/or bee species was not enhanced (Action 24). For amphibians, one replicated study in the Netherlands found that ditches managed under agri-environment schemes had higher numbers of amphibian species and higher abundance than conventionally managed ditches (Action 818).
