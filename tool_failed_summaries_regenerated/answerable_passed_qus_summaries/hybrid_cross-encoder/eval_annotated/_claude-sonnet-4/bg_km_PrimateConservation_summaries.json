Population outcomes also varied: one study in Belize found that primate population increased five years after reintroduction, while one study in Thailand found that primate population declined post-reintroduction (Action 1591).\n\nSurvival rates showed mixed patterns. Six studies in Brazil, French Guiana, Indonesia, Madagascar, and South Africa found that a minority of primates survived for at least fifteen weeks to seven years after reintroduction, while five studies in Brazil, French Guiana, Gabon, and South Africa found that a majority of primates survived for at least two months to one year (Action 1591).\n\nBehavioral integration appeared successful in some cases.

A before-and-after study in Belize found that a black howler monkey population increased after the construction of pole bridges over man-made gaps (Action 1457). In Madagascar, a before-and-after study found that all six monitored lemur species used bridges to cross roads and pipelines (Action 1457).\n\n**Rope Bridges Between Canopies:** Nine studies found that rope bridges were used by a range of mammals, with seven studies finding between three and 25 species using rope bridges (Action 2556). One study found that crossing rates were higher over the canopy bridges than at ground level (Action 2556). A study in Australia found that arboreal marsupials using rope bridges did not suffer high predation rates when doing so (Action 2556).\n\n**Green Bridges (Overpasses):** No evidence was found for the effects of installing green bridges on primate populations specifically (Action 1456).\n\n**Underground Crossings for Terrestrial Species:** While not specifically tested on primates, twenty-five studies found that tunnels, culverts or underpasses under roads were used by various mammals, with seventeen of 20 studies finding that these crossing structures beneath roads were used by mammals (Action 2514).

Wearing face-masks is recommended to avoid transmission of viral and bacterial diseases to primates (Action 1537). Studies show that mountain gorilla numbers increased by 168% over 41 years while being visited by researchers and visitors wearing face-masks, alongside other interventions. Limiting the time that researchers and tourists are allowed to spend with habituated animals is another important measure (Action 1539), with mountain gorilla populations increasing by 168% over 41 years while being visited during restricted time periods. Ensuring that researchers and tourists are up-to-date with vaccinations and healthy is essential (Action 1546), as mountain gorilla numbers increased by 168% over 41 years while sick/unwell researchers and visitors were not allowed to visit gorillas. Regular disinfection of clothes and boots is recommended (Action 1547), with mountain gorilla numbers increasing by 168% over 41 years while being visited by researchers and tourists whose clothes were disinfected. Maintaining a safety distance to habituated animals is crucial (Action 1538), with mountain gorilla numbers increasing by 168% over 41 years while being observed from a safety distance. Additional recommended measures include implementing quarantine for people arriving at and leaving the site (Action 1540), wearing gloves when handling primate food and tool items (Action 1548), avoiding contact between wild primates and human-raised primates (Action 1555), and putting up signs to warn people about not feeding primates (Action 1507), which reduced aggressive interactions between Japanese macaques and humans after prohibiting tourist feeding.",

Regular continuous supplementary feeding shows mixed results - two studies found primate populations increased in China and The Gambia, while two studies in Thailand and Malaysia found populations declined after regular provision (action 1526). Three studies found majority survival rates with continuous feeding, and one study in Liberia found majority of introduced chimpanzees survived for at least one year (action 1526). Supplementary feeding only during resource scarce periods demonstrated positive survival outcomes - one study found majority of chimpanzees survived for at least five years in Republic of Congo, one study found wild olive baboons survived for at least 17 years after drought-period feeding in Kenya, and one study in Madagascar found black-and-white ruffed lemurs maintained similar diets to wild individuals (action 1527). Temporary supplementary feeding showed variable results - one study in Tanzania found chimpanzee population increased after two months of feeding, but one study in Brazil found golden lion tamarin population declined after one year. Four studies found only minority survival rates for reintroduced primates, while other studies found majority survival rates ranging from 27 months in Guinea to four years in Republic of Congo (action 1528). Social feeding approaches showed that monkeys completed enrichment tasks faster when fed in social groups compared to feeding alone, and ate more unfamiliar foods when groupmates were present (action 1343). No evidence was found for the effectiveness of establishing prey populations as a supplementary feeding strategy (action 1529). Prohibition of feeding showed that Japanese macaque populations declined in size and productivity after limiting and then prohibiting food provisioning (action 1502).",

For primates born and reared in cages, studies found poor outcomes: most reintroduced golden lion tamarins did not survive over seven years or had higher mortality than wild-born tamarins (Action 1594), more cage-reared squirrel monkeys died or were returned to captivity post-reintroduction compared to wild-born monkeys (Action 1594), and the diet of cage-reared black-and-white ruffed lemurs did not overlap with wild lemurs (Action 1594). In contrast, primates born and raised in free-ranging environments showed better dietary adaptation, with black-and-white ruffed lemurs' diets overlapping with wild lemurs (Actions 1596, 1595), though survival remained mixed with only two out of three reintroduced black lion tamarins surviving over four months (Action 1596). Primates with limited free-ranging experience showed intermediate results, with appropriate dietary overlap but variable survival outcomes - most black-and-white ruffed lemurs died over five years while most western lowland gorillas survived between nine months and four years (Action 1595). For other mammals, black-footed ferrets reared in outdoor pens had higher post-release survival rates than ferrets raised indoors, while Tasmanian devils reared in large enclosures did not show survival advantages over intensively managed animals (Action 2507). Rehabilitation programs showed mixed results across species, with most golden lion tamarins not surviving over seven years despite rehabilitation, while most vervet monkeys, chimpanzees, and some gorillas showed better survival rates following pre-release rehabilitation (Actions 1597, 1600).",

However, one before-and-after study in Gabon found that a majority of juvenile western lowland gorillas survived for at least seven years after nesting platforms were provided alongside other interventions (Action 1530). \n\nFor artificial water sources specifically provided to primates, the outcomes varied by species and duration of study. One before-and-after trial in Brazil found that a minority of reintroduced golden lion tamarins survived over seven years when provided with supplementary water alongside other interventions (Action 1531). One before-and-after study in Madagascar found that a minority of reintroduced black-and-white ruffed lemurs survived for five years despite being provided with supplementary water alongside other interventions (Action 1531). A before-and-after study in South Africa found that a minority of vervet monkeys had survived for 10 months when provided with supplementary water alongside other interventions (Action 1531). A before-and-after study in Gabon found that a majority of western lowland gorillas survived for at least nine months while being provided with supplementary water alongside other interventions (Action 1531). All studies involved these interventions alongside other conservation measures, making it difficult to isolate the specific effects of the artificial non-food resources.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on available evidence, primate relocation for managing human-wildlife conflict in residential areas shows mixed outcomes. For benefits, one study found that 'problem' rhesus monkeys that were translocated survived and remained at release sites for at least four years (Action 1422). Additionally, crop-raiding olive baboons translocated from farmland had similar survival rates to non-translocated populations after 16 years (Action 1422). For primates relocated from development sites, studies found that majorities survived for 5-30 months following translocation to natural habitat (Action 1558), and rhesus monkeys remained at their release sites (Action 1558). However, there are significant drawbacks. No direct evidence exists for the effects of relocating primates to non-residential areas on primate populations (Action 1423). Studies of mammal translocation more broadly show concerning patterns: translocated grizzly bears had lower survival rates than non-translocated bears (Action 2336), fewer than half of translocated black bears survived after one year (Action 2336), and translocated crop-raiding African elephants had lower survival rates than non-translocated elephants (Action 2485). Additionally, many translocated mammals return to their original locations or continue causing problems - at least some brown/grizzly and black bears returned to their capture locations and/or continued causing nuisance after translocation (Actions 2336, 2341), and leopards translocated away from human areas attacked more humans and livestock than before translocation (Action 2336).",

Implementing a 'no-feeding of wild primates' policy showed effectiveness, with one controlled, before-and-after study in Japan finding that several previously increasing Japanese macaque populations declined in size and productivity after limiting and then prohibiting food provisioning (Action 1502). Putting up signs to warn people about not feeding primates also demonstrated benefits, with one review in Japan finding that aggressive interactions between Japanese macaques and humans declined after prohibiting tourists from feeding of monkeys (Action 1507). Other available management actions include not allowing people to consume food within natural areas where primates can view them (Action 1508), installing 'primate-proof' garbage bins (Action 1505), removing human food waste that may potentially serve as food sources for primates to avoid disease transmission and conflict with humans (Action 1561), and installing mechanical barriers to deter primates such as fences and ditches (Action 1436). However, for these latter actions, no evidence was found for their effects on primate populations during systematic searches. Diversionary feeding approaches have been tested for mammals generally, with two before-and-after studies in the USA finding that diversionary feeding reduced nuisance behaviour by black bears (Action 2323), though specific evidence for primates was not found.",
