Seed-eating birds were more abundant on uncut and ungrazed plots than on uncut and grazed plots (224). A replicated, controlled, randomized UK study found no difference in ground beetle abundance and diversity between cut and uncut headlands in the first two years, but higher species diversity in uncut plots in the third year; no studies were found assessing effects on mammals (132, 2400). Raising mowing/cutting height: A replicated, controlled study and a review from the UK found raised mowing heights benefited Eurasian skylark, including increased productivity, and a review reported raised cutting heights were less damaging to amphibians and invertebrates (138). However, a randomized, replicated, controlled UK trial found no effect of raised mowing height on numbers of foraging birds or invertebrates, and one replicated controlled study found no difference in invertebrate abundance (138). A UK review found raised mowing height may have increased skylark productivity but not enough to maintain the local population (222). On intensively managed UK grassland, plots cut to 10 cm had similar butterfly species richness and abundance to plots cut to 5 cm (3968).",

One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil.

Additional syntheses report that some species occur at higher densities or use set\u2011aside more than other habitats while some occur at lower densities; species richness was often higher on set\u2011aside than crops; waders and skylarks had higher productivity in three of four studies, though one found lower skylark productivity on set\u2011aside; naturally regenerated set\u2011aside tended to hold more birds and species than sown set\u2011aside; evidence on rotational vs non\u2011rotational set\u2011aside was mixed (175). For mammals, set\u2011aside did not increase small mammal or brown hare numbers relative to cropland or other non\u2011crop habitats, though wood mice used uncut set\u2011aside more after harvest (2377). For butterflies and moths, several studies found higher species richness and, in some cases, higher abundance on sown or naturally regenerating set\u2011aside versus cereal fields\u2014especially with less competitive grasses\u2014though other studies found similar richness or abundance to arable, pasture, or uncultivated habitats (3980). Conversion/reversion of arable to permanent grassland: Syntheses of multiple replicated studies found no clear benefits to birds, with one controlled before\u2011and\u2011after UK study reporting significant declines in grey partridge after reversion (561; 210). For butterflies and moths, 10 studies show restored grasslands can develop communities increasingly similar to high\u2011quality grasslands over the first decade; species richness was often higher than on conventional grassland or cultivated farms; abundance was sometimes higher than on conventional grassland or crop fields, though not always increasing with time since restoration; sowing with diverse mixes or with forbs/perennial mixes often increased richness or abundance compared with grass\u2011only mixes; some taxa increased while others decreased following schemes including grassland reversion (3929).",

On agricultural land, three trials (India, Germany, USA) showed occupied solitary bee nests could double over three years, while parasitism and mortality in boxes were documented across 11 trials with variable rates (47). There is no direct evidence on the effects of introducing pre-stocked solitary-bee nest boxes on farmland wildlife (81). For birds in European agricultural habitats, studies from Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK reported occupancy of nest boxes by multiple species (including kestrel, long-eared owl, starling, tits, tree sparrow, stock dove, jackdaw, wryneck and hoopoe), increases in Eurasian kestrel clutches and breeding tree sparrows after provision, and relationships of success with habitat (more pasture) and with box height (higher boxes having higher occupancy, eggs and hatched young) (155). For European rollers in Spain, use of nest boxes increased over time and varied by habitat; success did not differ between new and old boxes, though older boxes saw earlier laying (494). For falcons, studies from Europe and elsewhere reported that local populations increased after nest-site installation in some cases, with high or equal-to-natural productivity often recorded, though other studies found lower productivity or non-use, and use and productivity could vary with box design and position (489). For owls, UK and European studies reported apparent local population increases following artificial nest installation and high or equal-to-natural breeding success in several cases, though other controlled studies found lower productivity, species interactions affecting success, or lower juvenile survival from artificial nests; use was at least as frequent as natural sites in some studies and varied with design and position in others (490).",

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes. In one trial, these introduced species more commonly occupied the boxes than native bees.\\nA small trial tested three soil-filled nest boxes for the mining bee Andrena flavipes in the UK, but they were not occupied.\"\n}"

For created/restored prairies, abundance of Fender\u2019s blue eggs was greater 5\u201310 years after restoration than at 1\u20132 years, and similar to remnant prairies [3943].

For plants, several studies found AES maintained or had little/no effect on richness or diversity, some found increases, and some found decreases; Environmentally Sensitive Areas in England helped halt loss of semi-natural grasslands but were less effective at enhancing/restoring biodiversity, and flower abundance increased in some Estonian areas (Action 700). For invertebrates, results were mixed: some studies found maintenance or little/no effect and others found increases; bee responses were local rather than landscape-scale in a UK study (Action 700), with additional bee-focused trials across Europe showing both enhanced diversity/abundance under AES and cases with no enhancement, and two UK landscape-scale trials finding no enhancement of bumblebee populations (Action 24). For mammals, UK evidence showed one positive study and three with mixed effects depending on region or species (Action 700). For bats, UK studies reported no significant differences between AES and conventional farms in most cases, with some instances of lower activity on AES farms (Action 962). For amphibians, European evidence includes creation of breeding habitat or increased frog/toad populations in Denmark and Sweden, and higher amphibian species numbers and abundance in Dutch ditches under AES than in conventional management (Action 818). Baseline comparisons noted that some wildlife numbers were higher before AES implementation in certain studies, while two baseline datasets found no overall differences in birds or soil biota between AES and non-AES areas (Action 700).",

Eleven studies (including one systematic review and four reviews) found negative or no effects. One UK study found higher numbers of some birds where higher tier management was in place, another UK study found no difference between Entry Level or Higher Level Stewardship Scheme fields.

Seven studies (including three replicated paired site comparisons and one European review) found agri-environment schemes maintained or had little or no effect on plants, plant diversity or species richness. Three studies found increases in plant species richness in areas with agri-environment schemes, two found decreases. A replicated site comparison study from Estonia found higher flower abundance on farms with agri-environment schemes in two out of four areas. A review found Environmentally Sensitive Areas in England had contributed to halting the loss of semi-natural grassland habitats but were less effective at enhancing or restoring grassland biodiversity.\\nTen studies from three European countries (including two replicated paired site comparisons and a review) looked at the effects of agri-environment schemes on invertebrates. Six studies (including two replicated site comparisons) showed agri-environment schemes maintained or had little or no effect on some invertebrates in terms of diversity, abundance, species richness or bee colony growth. Five studies found increases in abundance or species richness of some invertebrates. A UK study found agri-environment scheme prescriptions had a local but not a landscape-scale effect on bee numbers.\\nFour studies (including two replicated site comparisons and a review) from the UK looked at the effects of agri-environment schemes on mammals.
