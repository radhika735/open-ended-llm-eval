    "relevant_summary": "Documented benefits of reduced tillage systems on European farms include several soil and environmental improvements. Multiple studies from European countries found increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage (action 906). Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA found higher soil organic carbon in soils under no-tillage or reduced tillage systems compared to conventionally tilled soil (action 906). Studies from Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Switzerland and the UK found positive effects on farmland wildlife, including increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms, greater abundance of some invertebrates, increased numbers of some weeds and/or weed species, higher Eurasian skylark nest density, and greater abundance of some birds including seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in late winter (action 126). Seven replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing (action 906). Studies from European countries found reduced tillage maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure, with higher nutrient retention (action 906).\n\nDocumented harms include increased soil compaction in some cases, with three replicated trials from Australia, Canada, and Europe finding higher compaction under reduced tillage (action 906). Some European studies found negative effects or no consistent effects on abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates and earthworms, number of different plant species found as seeds, and some bird species (action 126). Crop yield impacts varied by crop type: studies from Spain found lower cereal and legume yields in some comparisons with reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage, though other studies found higher or similar yields (action 1359). Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover (action 906). Three replicated trials from Europe and India found that conventional ploughing increased soil's ability to absorb water and soil water content compared to reduced tillage (action 906).",

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done. One randomized, replicated study from Portugal found no effect of tillage treatment on yield.\\n\\u00a0\\nSOIL TYPES COVERED: anthrosol, calcareous silt loam, chalky, clay, clay loam, fine sandy loam, loam, loamy-clay, loam - sandy loam, loam \\u2013 silt-loam, loamy sand, loamy silt, non-chalky clay, sandy, sandy clay loam, sandy loam, sandy silt-loam, silt loam, silty, silty-clay, silty clay loam, silty loam.\"\n}"

Thirty-four studies (of which 21 were replicated and controlled and seven also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found some positive effects on earthworms, some invertebrates (other than earthworms), weeds or farmland birds, of reducing tillage compared to conventional management. Positive effects included increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms, greater abundance of some invertebrates other than earthworms, increased numbers of some weeds and/or weed species, higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying date and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields, and greater abundance of some birds - including Eurasian skylark, seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in late winter on non-inversion or conservation tillage. A review found tillage had negative effects on invertebrate numbers and no-till systems had more invertebrate bird food resources.\\nTwenty-six studies (of which 13 replicated and controlled and three also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found reducing tillage had either negative, no effect or no consistent effects on abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates (other than earthworms), earthworm abundance, biomass, or species richness, number of different plant species found as seeds, number of some weed species, mammal abundance, some bird species, and one study found bird preferences for conservation tillage fields decreased over time. Two studies found that crop type affected the number of weeds under different tillage regimes.\\nOne small replicated trial in the UK compared bird numbers under two different forms of reduced tillage, and found more birds from species that make up the \\u2018Farmland Bird Index\\u2019 on broadcast than non-inversion tillage fields.\\nTwo studies looked at the long-term effects of reduced tillage on earthworms (after ten years). One study found higher earthworm biomass under reduced tillage, the other study found earthworm abundance was the same between conventional and reduced tillage plots.\\nThree of the studies mentioned above did not distinguish between the effects of reducing tillage and reduced pesticide and/or fertilizer inputs.\"\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, growing cover crops between crop rows and growing them when fields are empty have different effects:\n\n**Cover crops between crop rows (intercropping/living mulches):**\nAction 897 found that cover crops between crop rows increased bacterial numbers and activity, reduced erosion, and increased soil organic matter in some cases. Action 124 showed that intercropping (such as cabbage with French beans or clover) increased ground beetle abundance. Action 1394 found that cover crops (living mulches) between broccoli plants resulted in fewer aphids in some comparisons, but also found fewer parasitized aphids compared to plots without cover crops. Action 1352 showed that ground cover between vine rows in orchards generally resulted in similar grape yields compared to bare soil, with mixed effects on grape quality.\n\n**Cover crops in empty fields (winter cover crops/fallows):**\nAction 1357 found that winter cover crops in arable fields typically reduced water content in soils and decreased water loss through drainage, runoff, or evaporation compared to bare fallows. Action 1351 showed mixed effects on cash crop yields - some studies found lower yields, some higher yields, and many found no differences between plots with or without winter cover crops. Action 1345 demonstrated that winter cover crops increased soil organic matter, nitrogen content, microbial biomass, and reduced soil erosion compared to fields without cover crops. Action 1394 found that winter cover crops reduced weed numbers in most comparisons and showed mixed effects on disease severity.\n\n**Key differences:**\nThe intercropping approach appears to focus more on immediate pest management and maintaining ongoing soil biological activity, while winter cover crops in empty fields provide stronger benefits for soil structure, nutrient retention, erosion control, and water management during non-growing seasons.",

For yield effects, one replicated trial from the USA found higher tomato yield from soils which had been under a ryegrass cover crop.\n\n**Soil Organic Carbon Effects:**\nBoth practices demonstrate positive effects on soil organic carbon. Cover crops showed increased carbon levels across multiple studies (Action 898), while green manures demonstrated higher soil organic carbon in controlled studies (Action 908). When fresh plant material or crop remains are incorporated into soil, six studies from China, Denmark and India found higher carbon levels when plant material was added (Action 910).\n\n**Crop Yield Effects:**\nGreen manures resulted in increased grain yields in studies from India and Pakistan (Action 908). Cover crops showed higher tomato yield in one USA trial (Action 898). Manures and agricultural composts, which share similarities with green manures, showed higher crop yields in four controlled, replicated studies from India, Spain and Turkey, with one study finding higher yields when manure was applied in combination with cover crops (Action 911).\n\nThe soil types covered for green manures included clay loam, while cover crops were tested across a broader range including clay, loam, sandy clay, sandy-loam, silty-clay, and silty-loam soils (Actions 908, 898).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on studies from European countries including Spain, Italy, Portugal, Denmark, and Norway, different tillage practices on sandy loam soils show distinct benefits and drawbacks. Reduced tillage and no-tillage practices generally demonstrate benefits for soil organic matter, with multiple studies finding higher soil organic carbon and organic matter content compared to conventional tillage (actions 906, 1369, 1371). Benefits for soil organisms include increased microbial biomass, earthworm abundance, and improved biodiversity of soil fauna under reduced and no-tillage systems (actions 906, 126, 1369, 1371, 2306, 2307). For nutrient retention, reduced tillage shows mixed but generally positive effects, with studies finding higher nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium levels in some comparisons, though results vary by location and conditions (actions 1369, 1371). Soil structure benefits include improved water-stability of aggregates and reduced soil erosion under reduced tillage systems (actions 906, 1369, 1371). However, drawbacks include potential soil compaction issues, with studies showing higher compaction under reduced tillage in some cases (action 906). For drought conditions, conventional ploughing showed better soil water absorption and content compared to reduced tillage (action 906). Some studies found lower crop yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage (action 906). Greenhouse gas emissions show mixed results, with some studies finding increased carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions under no-tillage systems (actions 1369, 1371). Timing modifications, such as delaying ploughing until spring on sandy loam soils, can reduce soil loss and nitrate leaching (action 712). The effectiveness of different tillage practices varies depending on specific soil conditions, climate, and management practices, with sandy loam soils covered in studies from multiple European countries showing these varied responses.",

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done.

    "relevant_summary": "Evidence from several studies shows mixed effects of incorporating grass or pasture into arable systems on soil nutrients. One replicated study from Denmark found that reducing the extent of grass pasture in leys reduced undesirable nitrogen uptake by grasses, requiring lower fertilizer rates for subsequent crops (Action 900). Regarding crop rotations that include forage crops, four studies from Australia, Canada, and Denmark found increased soil organic carbon under crop rotation, particularly when legumes were included (Action 857). Three of five replicated trials from Canada, Portugal and Syria found increased soil organic matter when legumes were included in rotation, though one study found lower soil organic matter levels with longer crop rotations (Action 857). For nitrogen specifically, research shows variable results: one replicated, randomized, controlled study from Australia found more nitrogen in soils with crop rotations compared to continuous crops in one of four comparisons, while one study from Italy found less nitrogen in some comparisons, and two studies from Portugal and Spain found similar amounts of nitrogen in soils with or without crop rotations (Action 1368). Two studies from Portugal and Spain found less phosphorus in soils with crop rotations compared to continuous crops in some comparisons (Action 1368). Cover crops, which can include grasses, showed more consistent benefits: ten replicated, controlled studies from Italy, Spain, and the USA found more nitrogen in soils with winter cover crops compared to soils without them in some comparisons, while five studies found more nitrogen in soils that were cover cropped with legumes compared to non-legumes (Action 1345). Additionally, one replicated study from Canada found that including forage crops in crop rotations increased water infiltration (Action 857).",

    "relevant_summary": "Several actions can improve soil structure on European farms with sandy-loam soils. Soil amendments are effective, including adding organic processing wastes or their composts which improve soil structure and reduce soil loss according to trials from Spain and the UK (Action 891). Fresh plant material or crop remains can be incorporated, with one study from India finding improved soil structure when straw was incorporated (Action 910). Manures and agricultural composts increase soil organic matter, create larger soil aggregations and have positive effects on soil physical properties according to studies from Denmark and Germany (Action 911). Mixed organic and inorganic amendments can be more effective than inorganic fertilizers alone, with one controlled trial from India finding mixed amendments more effective at reducing soil crack size in dry soil (Action 902). \n\nCover crops improve soil structure when fields are empty, with three randomized studies from Denmark, Turkey and the UK finding that growing cover crops improved soil structure, including higher soil porosity, interconnectivity and lower soil resistance (Action 898). Adding mulch to crops improves soil structure and increases soil organic matter according to trials from Canada, Poland and Spain (Action 887). Retaining crop residues increases soil organic carbon and nitrogen, with two randomized trials from Australia and China finding these benefits (Action 907).\n\nTillage modifications also improve soil structure. Changing tillage practices, specifically reducing tillage, increases soil organic carbon and organic matter with improved soil structure, as found in twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA (Action 906). Controlling traffic and timing reduces compaction and increases soil porosity, with five trials from Europe and Australia finding less compaction, reduced runoff and increased water filtration (Action 899). Soil can also be amended with bacteria or fungi, with one controlled trial from Turkey finding increased soil organic matter content under mycorrhizal-inoculated compost applications (Action 888).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, the most consistently beneficial actions for increasing microbial biomass in soil include organic amendments, reduced tillage practices, and diverse cropping systems. Adding organic matter through various means shows consistent benefits: applying composts increases soil organic matter levels and microbial biomass (action 889), while amending soil with manures and agricultural composts results in higher microbial biomass according to three controlled, replicated studies from the UK and USA (action 911). Adding bacteria or fungi directly also increases microbial diversity according to one randomized, replicated trial from India (action 888). Retaining crop residues provides benefits, with one replicated study from Mexico finding higher microbial biomass when crop residues were retained (action 907). Adding fresh plant material or crop remains also increases microbial biomass according to one randomized, replicated experiment from Belgium (action 910). Reduced tillage practices consistently benefit microbial communities: eleven replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Italy, Spain, and the USA found more microbial biomass in soils with reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage in some comparisons (action 2307), while five replicated, controlled studies from Italy and Spain found more microbial biomass in soils without tillage compared to soils with tillage in some or all comparisons (action 2306). Cover crops also provide benefits, with one replicated trial from the USA finding greater microbial biomass under ryegrass compared to a ryegrass/vetch cover crop mix (action 898), and four replicated studies from France and the USA finding more microbial biomass in soils with ground cover compared to bare or tilled soils in some or all comparisons (action 2304). Including legumes in crop rotation shows mixed results, with one replicated, controlled study from Italy finding more microbial biomass in soils with crop rotations compared to continuous crops in some comparisons (action 2305), while crop rotation generally increases the number of microbes and diversity according to four randomized, replicated trials from Canada, Portugal and Zambia (action 857).",

    "relevant_summary": "Incorporating leys into arable farming systems in Europe produces several documented effects across different aspects of agriculture and biodiversity. In terms of soil and fertilizer management, one replicated study from Denmark found that reducing the extent of grass pasture in leys reduced the undesirable uptake of nitrogen by grasses, therefore requiring lower rates of fertilizer for subsequent crops (Action ID 900). For pest management and biodiversity, a controlled study in Finland found that creating clover leys resulted in higher spider abundance and fewer pest insects than a barley control plot (Action ID 643). However, the duration of leys affects their ecological value, as a study in the UK found that one-year ley plots had significantly lower earthworm species richness and abundance than three-and-a-half-year leys (Action ID 643). In terms of plant diversity, a replicated study in the UK found that grass leys had fewer plant species than nine other conservation measures (Action ID 643). When arable land is converted to permanent grassland, several studies across Europe documented biodiversity benefits for butterflies and moths. Multiple studies in the UK, Finland, Switzerland and Taiwan found that restored grasslands developed butterfly communities increasingly similar to existing high-quality grasslands over time, with higher species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths compared to conventionally managed farmland (Action ID 3929). However, effects on birds are mixed, as all five studies looking at the effects of reverting arable land to grassland found no clear benefit to birds, with one controlled before-and-after study from the UK showing that grey partridge numbers fell significantly following the reversion of arable fields to grassland (Action ID 210). Grass buffer strips and margins around arable fields also provide biodiversity benefits, with multiple studies across Europe and the USA finding higher species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths in grass margins compared to cropped field edges, particularly when margins are wider or floristically enhanced (Action ID 3982).",
