    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from action documents, several food-based enrichment strategies have been shown to effectively reduce stereotypic behaviors in large captive carnivores like felids and bears. Presenting food frozen in ice decreased abnormal or stereotypic behaviors and increased activity levels in bears and felids (action 1923). Hiding food around enclosures increased exploring and foraging behaviors and decreased stereotypical pacing in leopard cats and black bear (action 1915). Presenting food inside objects such as Boomer balls increased exploratory and foraging behaviors and decreased stereotypic behaviors in sloth bears and spectacled bears (action 1924). Providing bones, hides or partial carcasses decreased the frequency of stereotypic behaviors in lions, tigers and Arctic foxes, while also increasing activity and manipulation time in felids and red foxes (action 1902). Implementing unpredictable feeding schedules reduced the frequency of stereotypic pacing behaviors in tigers and cheetahs and increased behavioral diversity in red foxes and alertness in black-footed cats (action 1904). Providing devices to simulate live prey, including sounds, lures, pulleys and bungees, increased activity levels and behavioral diversity in felids and decreased pacing behavior in cougars, though pacing initially increased in tigers (action 1927). However, allocating fast days resulted in large felids pacing more frequently on non-feeding days (action 1906). Scattering food around enclosures increased locomotion in maned wolves (action 1921).",

Scattering food throughout the enclosure increased feeding and exploratory behaviors in rhesus macaques, reduced abnormal behaviors in chimpanzees, reduced aggression in lemurs, increased foraging and activity levels in gorillas (Action 1315). In contrast, hiding food in containers (including boxes and bags) increased activity levels and foraging behaviors in lemurs and gibbons, but the evidence base is more limited with only two studies compared to three studies for scattering (Action 1316). While both methods promote foraging behaviors and increase activity levels, scattering food appears to have additional benefits in reducing problematic behaviors such as abnormal behaviors and aggression that were not reported for container-based feeding enrichment.",

Temperature manipulation shows limited evidence: one small study in Italy found that one of six females bred following a temperature drop from 20-24\u00b0C to 17\u00b0C combined with filling of an egg laying pond (action 1864). One Australian study found that providing a pre-breeding cooling period, alongside other measures including allowing females to gain weight, separating sexes during non-breeding periods, providing mate choice and playing recorded mating calls, increased breeding success (action 1864). Artificial rainfall manipulation has shown positive results in two studies in Germany and Austria, where simulating wet and dry seasons stimulated breeding and egg deposition, though in the German study no toadlets survived past 142 days old (action 1872). However, no evidence was found for the effectiveness of simulating rainfall using sound recordings of rain and thunderstorms (action 1867). Similarly, no evidence was captured for varying enclosure humidity using humidifiers, foggers, misters or artificial rain (action 1863). General captive breeding research shows that reproductive success depends on temperature or simulated wet and dry seasons according to multiple studies, with 30-88% of eggs hatching and survival rates to metamorphosis of 75%, to froglets of 17-51%, or to adults of 50-90% (action 835). UV lighting manipulation showed no difference in clutch size between frogs given ultraviolet boost compared to background levels, though UV-boosted frogs had significantly greater fungal loads (action 1865). No evidence was found for several other environmental manipulation techniques including hibernation periods, dormancy during simulated drought, or varying water flow speeds (actions 1868, 1869, 1870).",

Additionally, hiding food decreased stereotypical pacing in leopard cats and black bears, and reduced the time Canadian lynx spent sleeping during the day (Action 1915). In contrast, scattering food around enclosures increased locomotion in maned wolves, and maned wolves spent more time in sections of their enclosure with scattered food compared to sections with food presented on a tray (Action 1921). The evidence base for hiding food appears more extensive, with studies documenting effects across multiple species and behaviors, while the evidence for scattering food is limited to studies with maned wolves.",

For larval development, formulating diets with higher protein content is effective, with one study finding that tadpoles reared on a diet containing 46% protein had higher growth rates, survival and body weights at metamorphosis compared to diets containing less protein (Action 1889). Diet composition also affects larval development, as tadpoles had higher body mass and reached more advanced developmental stages when fed control diets of rabbit chow and fish food or freshwater algae, compared to those fed only pine or oak pollen, which prevented metamorphosis entirely (Action 1889). For breeding adults, supplementing diets with carotenoids can affect reproductive outcomes, with one study finding that adding carotenoids to fruit flies fed to frogs reduced the number of clutches but increased the number of tadpoles and successful metamorphs (Action 1887). However, no evidence was found for the effectiveness of supplementing diets with vitamins or calcium through prey dusting (Action 1886) or gut loading prey (Action 1885), or for formulating adult diets to reflect the nutritional composition of wild foods (Action 1884).",

Feeding whole chickens to ocelots resulted in lower digestible energy and fat compared to commercial diet, and African wildcats had lower organic matter digestibility compared to ground-chicken diet (Action 1901). In contrast, providing live vertebrate prey showed different behavioral effects: hunting behaviour increased and sleeping decreased when a fishing cat was provided with live fish, but there was no change in stereotypical behaviours in tigers when provided with live fish (Action 1925). The studies indicate species-specific responses to both feeding approaches, with whole carcass feeding showing more documented effects on both behavior and physiology, while live prey provision primarily demonstrated effects on natural hunting behaviors in specific species.",

    "relevant_summary": "Several documented alternatives to standard commercial diets have been studied for captive carnivores like maned wolves and cheetahs. For maned wolves specifically, a plant-derived protein diet increased digestible energy and dry matter digestibility but decreased mineral retention and plasma taurine levels compared to a supplemented animal-based protein diet (Action 1903). Supplementing animal-protein diets with taurine increased plasma taurine levels in maned wolves (Action 1908). For cheetahs, feeding whole rabbit carcasses resulted in lower blood protein urea, zinc and vitamin A levels compared to supplemented beef, and showed lower levels of inflammatory bowel indicators (Action 1901). Cheetahs fed a commercial diet had similar likelihood of developing gastritis as those fed horse meat, with lower levels of blood protein urea but higher levels of creatine, and plasma concentrations of a-tocopherol, retinol and taurine within recommended ranges for domestic cats when fed commercial meat diet or whole chicken carcasses (Action 1900). Additional alternatives include supplementing meat-based diets with prebiotic plant material such as Jerusalem artichoke, which increased gut microbiota types, faecal scores and faecal moisture content in leopards (Action 1905).",
