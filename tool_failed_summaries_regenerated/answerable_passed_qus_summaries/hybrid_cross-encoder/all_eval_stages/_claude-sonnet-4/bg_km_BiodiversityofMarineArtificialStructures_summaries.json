Long flexible habitats had mixed effects on fish species richness around structures, depending on fish presence when flexible habitats were created, and mixed effects on the abundance of fishes or seahorses depending on species and timing (Action 3451). For invertebrates, long flexible habitats had mixed effects on mobile and non-mobile invertebrate abundance depending on species group and survey week, with one study reporting that flexible habitats decreased mussel abundance on structure surfaces but the flexible habitats themselves supported higher biomass than structure surfaces (Action 3451). Short flexible habitats had mixed effects on mobile and non-mobile invertebrate community composition depending on density or length of flexible habitats (Action 3450). Short flexible habitats also had mixed effects on mobile and non-mobile invertebrate abundance depending on survey week, species group, and flexible habitat length, and mixed effects on seahorse abundance depending on survey week (Action 3450). Long flexible habitats were used by seahorses, while behavioral data was not available for short flexible habitats (Actions 3451, 3450).",

Rock pools also supported species that were absent from structure surfaces without pools.\n\n**Pit habitats (1-50 mm)** showed strong effectiveness, with eight of 12 replicated controlled studies finding that pit habitats increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness and/or diversity (Action ID: 3475). Pit habitats also supported macroalgae, invertebrate and/or fish species that were absent from surfaces without added habitats.\n\n**Hole habitats (>50 mm)** demonstrated consistent positive effects, with three replicated controlled studies finding that hole habitats increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species diversity and/or richness (Action ID: 3467). Hole habitats also supported species that were absent from structure surfaces without added habitat features.\n\n**Combinations of grooves and small ridges/ledges (1-50 mm)** showed effectiveness, with six of 11 replicated controlled studies finding that these combinations increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species diversity and/or richness (Action ID: 3474). These combinations also supported species that were absent from structure surfaces without grooves and ridges.\n\n**Moderately Effective Methods:**\n\n**Groove habitats (1-50 mm)** alone showed mixed results, with three of six replicated controlled studies finding increased species richness and/or diversity (Action ID: 3473). However, grooves consistently supported species that were absent from structure surfaces without grooves.\n\n**Small protrusions (1-50 mm)** when combined with other habitat types showed positive effects, with two replicated controlled studies finding increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness (Action ID: 3462).\n\n**Less Effective Methods:**\n\n**Small ridges or ledges (1-50 mm)** alone showed limited effectiveness, with mixed results and typically supporting lower species richness than grooves created between them (Action ID: 3464).\n\n**Large ridges or ledges (>50 mm)** showed inconsistent results, with only one of two studies finding increased species diversity (Action ID: 3465).\n\n**Textured surfaces (\u22641 mm)** had mixed effects on species richness depending on the type of texture and site (Action ID: 3466).\n\n**Short flexible habitats (1-50 mm)** actually decreased combined species richness in one study (Action ID: 3459).\n\nThe evidence suggests that creating water-retaining features (rock pools, holes, pits) and three-dimensional complexity through combinations of habitat types are most effective for enhancing species richness and diversity on intertidal artificial structures.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on studies conducted in European marine environments, the outcomes of creating textured surfaces on intertidal structures vary considerably depending on the type of texture created, the specific site, and the species being measured. \n\nStudies from the UK and Netherlands demonstrate that creating textured surfaces (\u22641 mm) had mixed effects on combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness on structure surfaces, with outcomes depending on both the type of texture created and the site (Action 3466). The same studies found that creating textured surfaces, along with using environmentally-sensitive material, had mixed effects on barnacle and mobile invertebrate abundances, depending on the site, while one study found increased barnacle abundance regardless of texture type, though different textures supported different abundances (Action 3466). Creating textured surfaces did not increase macroalgal abundance on structure surfaces according to two studies in the Netherlands (Action 3466).\n\nFor larger-scale surface modifications, creating natural rocky reef topography on intertidal structures in the UK had mixed effects on barnacle and mobile invertebrate abundances depending on the site, and did not increase combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness (Action 3435). However, natural topography was colonized by macroalgae and limpets, with limpets using shaded grooves and water-retaining depressions (Action 3435).\n\nCreating groove habitats (1-50 mm) on intertidal structures showed varied outcomes across European studies. In the UK and Netherlands, creating groove habitats did not increase macroalgal abundance on structure surfaces according to two studies (Action 3473). For invertebrate responses, three of four studies from Australia, the Netherlands and the UK found that creating groove habitats did not increase invertebrate, limpet or chiton abundances (Action 3473). However, groove habitats were reported to be used by mussels and periwinkles in Netherlands studies (Action 3473).\n\nCreating pit habitats (1-50 mm) on intertidal structures also showed variable outcomes in European environments. Studies from the UK and Netherlands found that creating pit habitats did not increase macroalgal abundance on structure surfaces according to three of four studies (Action 3475). For invertebrates, studies in the Netherlands and UK found mixed results, with some showing no increase in invertebrate abundance while others found mixed effects on barnacle and mobile invertebrate abundances depending on site, species, animal size, and pit characteristics (Action 3475).\n\nCombined modifications involving grooves and small protrusions, ridges or ledges (1-50 mm) demonstrated varied outcomes depending on multiple factors. UK studies found mixed effects on mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate, limpet, mussel, juvenile oyster and barnacle abundances, with outcomes depending on the depth/height of grooves and ridges, the presence of large ledges or water-retaining and light-shading covers, the shore level, and the site (Action 3474).",

Creating structural habitat features shows promise, with long flexible habitats (>50 mm) supporting fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without flexible habitats and having mixed effects on fish abundance depending on species and fish presence when created (3451). Small adjoining cavities or 'swimthrough' habitats (\u2264100 mm) supported six fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without swimthroughs and had mixed effects on juvenile fish community composition and abundance depending on site and survey conditions (3436). Large adjoining cavities or 'swimthrough' habitats (>100 mm) supported fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without swimthroughs, increased overall fish species richness and abundance, though individual species responses varied (3456). \n\nCreating hole habitats (>50 mm) combined with other features like grooves and pits supported fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without added habitat features, though effects on fish abundance were mixed depending on species group (3434). Similarly, groove habitats (1-50 mm) when combined with holes, pits and environmentally-sensitive material supported fish species that were absent from similar structures without added habitat features, but had mixed effects on fish abundances depending on species group (3448).\n\nManagement approaches also show benefits, with harvesting restrictions supporting fish species that were absent from unrestricted structures and higher fish species richness, though effects on total fish abundance were mixed (3457). Reducing maintenance activities can increase seahorse abundance on structure surfaces (3447). Using environmentally-sensitive materials such as ECOncrete\u2122 combined with habitat features supported fish species that were absent from standard-concrete or fibreglass structure surfaces, though effects on fish abundances were mixed depending on species group (3470). Creating artificial reefs with different 3-D structures and materials showed no consistent differences in combined mobile invertebrate and fish richness or abundance between different reef designs (2259).",

The survival of canopy algae transplants varied depending on wave-exposure and surrounding habitat, with some studies reporting that no canopy algae transplants survived regardless of protective measures (Action 3471). The presence and mesh size of cages around transplants significantly affected both survival and cover, with two studies finding that canopy algae cover increased and/or was higher when transplanted under cages but decreased and/or was lower when left uncaged (Action 3471). Surface orientation was found to affect growth but had no effect on survival in one study (Action 3471). Wave-exposure influenced the growth of canopy algae transplants, with growth varying depending on this factor and surface orientation (Action 3471). Distance from source populations also played a role, as the abundance of kelp recruits on subtidal artificial structures varied depending on the distance from transplanted kelp individuals (Action 3471). Creating natural rocky reef topography on subtidal artificial structures did not increase the abundance of juvenile canopy macroalgae that settled onto structure surfaces, regardless of topography depth (Action 3446). Surface texture also influenced algae establishment, with textured surfaces having mixed effects on macroalgal abundance depending on the species group and site (Action 3449). Maintenance activities affected algal growth, as reducing the frequency of cleaning on subtidal artificial structures increased macroalgal abundance on structure surfaces (Action 3447).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on multiple studies across various geographic locations, several habitat modifications have been consistently effective for altering ecological communities on intertidal artificial structures:\n\n**Pit habitats (1-50 mm)** are among the most extensively studied and effective modifications. Twenty-two studies found that creating pit habitats altered community composition in four of six studies and increased species richness in eight of 12 studies (Action ID: 3475). These habitats supported macroalgae, invertebrate and fish species that were absent from unmodified surfaces.\n\n**Groove habitats (1-50 mm)** demonstrated consistent effectiveness across 14 studies. Creating grooves altered fish community composition and increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness in three of six studies (Action ID: 3473). Grooves, along with pits, supported species absent from surfaces without these modifications.\n\n**Flexible habitats** showed promise with both long (>50 mm) and short (1-50 mm) versions altering community composition. Long flexible habitats supported macroalgae, mobile and non-mobile invertebrates absent from unmodified surfaces (Action ID: 3460). Short flexible habitats altered combined macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate community composition (Action ID: 3459).\n\n**Hole habitats (>50 mm)** consistently increased species diversity and richness across three studies and altered community composition, supporting species absent from unmodified surfaces (Action ID: 3467).\n\n**Small protrusions (1-50 mm)** increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness in two studies conducted in Singapore (Action ID: 3462).\n\n**Environmentally-sensitive materials** showed mixed results, with hemp-concrete and ECOncrete\u2122 (along with added habitat features) altering community composition and increasing species richness, while other materials like shell-concrete showed limited effects (Action ID: 3469).\n\n**Large protrusions (>50 mm)** supported species absent from unmodified surfaces but did not consistently increase species richness (Action ID: 3463).\n\nThe most consistently effective modifications across multiple studies were pit habitats, groove habitats, and flexible habitats, which reliably altered community composition and increased species diversity while supporting species not found on unmodified artificial structures.",

    "relevant_summary": "The evidence for creating adjoining cavities or 'swimthrough' habitats on artificial structures varies significantly between subtidal and intertidal zones and depends on cavity size. For subtidal structures, there is substantial evidence supporting swimthrough habitats. Four studies examined small swimthrough habitats (\u2264100 mm) on subtidal structures in France, Morocco, Mayotte, and France, finding mixed effects on juvenile fish community composition, species richness, and abundance depending on site, survey month, and species (Action 3436). Two studies examined large swimthrough habitats (>100 mm) on subtidal structures in Mayotte and the USA, with one study finding that large swimthroughs increased overall fish species richness and abundance on structure surfaces, though effects varied by fish size class and species (Action 3456). Both small and large subtidal swimthroughs were reported to be used by various species including juvenile spiny lobsters, sea firs, adult fish, juvenile fish, and groupers (Actions 3436, 3456). For intertidal structures, the evidence is much more limited. Two studies examined small swimthrough habitats (\u2264100 mm) on intertidal structures in the UK, Netherlands, and South Africa, finding that they did not alter mobile invertebrate community composition, increase species richness or diversity, but did increase mobile invertebrate abundance on structure surfaces (Action 3468). Notably, no studies were found that evaluated large swimthrough habitats (>100 mm) on intertidal artificial structures, indicating a complete absence of evidence for this intervention in intertidal zones (Action 3438).",

Studies in Italy and Croatia found that cover of canopy algae transplanted onto subtidal artificial structures increased when transplanted under cages but decreased when left uncaged (Action 3471). In Japan, kelp recruit abundance on subtidal artificial structures varied depending on distance from transplanted kelp individuals and surface orientation (Action 3471). Survival of transplanted canopy algae varied depending on wave exposure, surrounding habitat, and presence of protective cages (Action 3471). For intertidal structures, macroalgae transplanted onto artificial structures were more likely to survive at mid- and highshore locations than at lowshore (Action 3472).\n\n**Creating Textured Surfaces:** Creating textured surfaces (\u22641 mm) on intertidal artificial structures did not increase macroalgal abundance on structure surfaces according to two studies in the Netherlands (Action 3466). Similarly, creating textured surfaces on subtidal artificial structures had mixed effects on macroalgal abundance depending on species group and site in Italy (Action 3449).\n\n**Creating Topographical Features:** Creating natural rocky reef topography on subtidal artificial structures did not increase abundance of juvenile canopy macroalgae in Italy (Action 3446). Creating small protrusions (1-50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures had mixed effects on macroalgal abundance depending on species in Japan (Action 3453). Creating large ridges or ledges (>50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures, combined with grooves and small protrusions, increased rockweed abundance in the USA (Action 3465).\n\n**Creating Flexible Habitats:** Creating short flexible habitats (1-50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures had mixed effects on macroalgal abundance depending on species group and site in Australia (Action 3459).\n\n**Modifying Structure Slope:** Reducing the slope of intertidal artificial structures did not increase macroalgal abundance on structure surfaces in Australia (Action 3461).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available studies, biodiversity outcomes of creating large hole habitats (>50mm) on artificial structures show notable differences between subtidal and intertidal zones across the specified regions.\n\nIn subtidal zones in Israel and Sweden (Action 3434), three studies found that creating hole habitats altered the combined macroalgae and invertebrate or mobile invertebrate and fish community composition on and around structures, and supported mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate and/or fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without added habitat features. However, biodiversity outcomes were mixed: two of three studies found increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness and/or diversity, while one study found no increase in combined mobile invertebrate and fish species richness or diversity. Population-level effects were generally limited, with one study showing no increase in combined mobile invertebrate and fish abundance, and mixed effects on species-specific abundances depending on the species group.\n\nIn intertidal zones in Australia and Europe (Action 3467), five studies examined hole habitats on artificial structures in southeast Australia, the UK, the Netherlands, and northern Israel. These studies consistently found that hole habitats altered the combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition on structure surfaces and supported macroalgae and/or non-mobile invertebrate species that were absent from structure surfaces without added habitat features. All three studies examining richness/diversity found that creating hole habitats increased the combined macroalgae and invertebrate species diversity and/or richness on structure surfaces. However, population-level effects were limited, with studies showing no increase in macroalgal abundance and mixed effects on invertebrate abundance. One study in Australia reported that hole habitats were used by sea slugs, urchins and octopuses.\n\nThe key difference appears to be that intertidal hole habitats showed more consistent positive effects on species diversity/richness across studies, while subtidal hole habitats showed more variable outcomes for diversity measures and generally limited population-level effects.",

On intertidal structures, these features alter the combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition and support species that are absent from structures without these modifications (action 3474). Six of 11 studies found that creating grooves and small ridges/ledges increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species diversity and/or richness on structure surfaces, while five studies found mixed effects depending on the depth/height of grooves and ridges, shore level, species group, and site (action 3474). The effects on overall abundance are variable, with studies finding no increase, increases when combined with other features or covers, or mixed effects depending on size, arrangement, shore level, and site (action 3474). For invertebrate abundance specifically, five of seven studies found mixed effects on mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate, limpet, mussel, juvenile oyster, and barnacle abundances, depending on the depth/height of grooves and ridges, presence of large ledges or water-retaining covers, shore level, and site (action 3474). On subtidal structures, the effects are more limited in scope but similar in nature - one of two studies found that groove habitats and small ledges altered community composition and increased species richness and diversity, while effects on abundance were mixed depending on surface orientation (action 3452). The created features are actively colonized by microalgal species on intertidal structures (action 3474) and by macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrates on subtidal structures (action 3452).",

Creating short flexible habitats (1-50 mm) had mixed effects on non-mobile invertebrate abundance on structure surfaces and mobile invertebrate abundance during high tide, depending on species group and site (Action 3459). Creating natural rocky reef topography had mixed effects on barnacle and mobile invertebrate abundances depending on site (Action 3435).\n\n**Material composition**: Using environmentally-sensitive materials had variable effects - using limestone-cement along with creating pits, grooves, small ridges and texture had mixed effects on mobile invertebrate and barnacle abundance depending on site and wave-exposure, while some studies found no increase in tubeworm, oyster, limpet, barnacle and combined invertebrate abundances when using different materials (Action 3469).\n\n**Site characteristics**: Multiple studies found that effects on invertebrate abundance varied significantly depending on the specific site where modifications were implemented (Actions 3475, 3459, 3435, 3469, 3476, 3467).\n\n**Shore level and depth**: Creating rock pools had mixed effects on invertebrate abundances depending on shore level and pool depth (Actions 3476, 3467).\n\n**Wave exposure**: The effects of material modifications on invertebrate abundance varied depending on wave-exposure levels (Action 3469).\n\n**Species group**: Effects varied depending on the specific invertebrate species or groups being measured, with different responses observed for mobile vs. non-mobile invertebrates, and for different taxonomic groups (Actions 3475, 3459, 3476, 3467).\n\n**Structural slope**: Reducing the slope of intertidal artificial structures did not increase oyster or mobile invertebrate abundance on structure surfaces (Action 3461).",

Creating natural rocky reef topography had mixed effects on barnacle and mobile invertebrate abundances depending on site (Action 3435).\\n\\n**Material composition**: Using environmentally-sensitive materials had variable effects - using limestone-cement along with creating pits, grooves, small ridges and texture had mixed effects on mobile invertebrate and barnacle abundance depending on site and wave-exposure, while some studies found no increase in tubeworm, oyster, limpet, barnacle and combined invertebrate abundances when using different materials (Action 3469).\\n\\n**Site characteristics**: Multiple studies found that effects on invertebrate abundance varied significantly depending on the specific site where modifications were implemented (Actions 3475, 3459, 3435, 3469, 3476, 3467).\\n\\n**Shore level and depth**: Creating rock pools had mixed effects on invertebrate abundances depending on shore level and pool depth (Actions 3476, 3467).\\n\\n**Wave exposure**: The effects of material modifications on invertebrate abundance varied depending on wave-exposure levels (Action 3469).\\n\\n**Species group**: Effects varied depending on the specific invertebrate species or groups being measured, with different responses observed for mobile vs. non-mobile invertebrates, and for different taxonomic groups (Actions 3475, 3459, 3476, 3467).\\n\\n**Structural slope**: Reducing the slope of intertidal artificial structures did not increase oyster or mobile invertebrate abundance on structure surfaces (Action 3461).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"3475\",\n    \"3459\",\n    \"3435\",\n    \"3469\",\n    \"3476\",\n    \"3467\",\n    \"3461\"\n  ]\n}"
