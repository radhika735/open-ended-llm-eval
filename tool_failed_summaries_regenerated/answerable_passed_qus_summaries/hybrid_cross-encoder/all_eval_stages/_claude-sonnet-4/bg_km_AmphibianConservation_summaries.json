    "relevant_summary": "Several actions can be taken to mitigate the impacts of roads on amphibian populations. Closing roads during seasonal amphibian migration has been found effective, with two studies in Germany showing that large numbers of amphibians were protected from death during breeding migrations at road closure sites and at road closure sites with assisted crossings and barrier fences (Action 842). Installing barrier fencing along roads is another effective measure, with seven of eight studies in Germany, Canada and the USA finding that barrier fencing with culverts decreased amphibian road deaths, provided that the fence length and material were effective. However, barriers must be at least 0.6 m high to prevent some species from climbing over (Action 756). Installing culverts or tunnels as road crossings has shown significant success, with six of seven studies in Canada, Germany, Italy, Hungary and the USA finding that installing culverts or tunnels significantly decreased amphibian road deaths, though this was most effective when barrier fencing was also installed. Fifteen of 24 studies found that culverts/tunnels were used by amphibians, with usage rates of 15-85% of amphibians or 3-15 species (Action 884). Restoring habitat connectivity can also be effective, as demonstrated by one study in Italy where raising a road on a viaduct to restore connectivity between two wetlands significantly decreased deaths of migrating amphibians (Action 840). Warning signage for motorists has been tested but showed limited effectiveness, with one study in the UK finding that despite warning signs and human assistance, over 500 toads were still killed on some roads (Action 841).",
