    "relevant_summary": "Ten studies evaluated the effects of coppicing on butterflies and moths, eight in the UK, one in France, and one in Germany [3939]. Fourteen studies assessed the impact of clearing or opening patches in forests on butterflies and moths, with five in the UK, two in Finland, two in Japan, one in Sweden, one in the USA, one in Canada, one in the Czech Republic, and one review across Europe [3938]. Six studies investigated the effects of thinning trees on butterflies and moths, with three in the USA and one in each of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Finland, and the Czech Republic [3940].\n\nThree replicated studies in the UK, Japan, and the Czech Republic found that cleared forest patches had a higher species richness of butterflies but a lower species richness of moths than unmanaged areas or closed-canopy forests [3938]. Similarly, a study in the Czech Republic showed that partially-cleared forest plots had more butterfly species but fewer moth species than closed-canopy forests [3940]. One study in the UK discovered that wider woodland rides and coppiced woodland hosted more unique macro-moth species than standard-width rides or mature forest [3938, 3939]. Another UK study found that coppiced woodland had a greater butterfly species richness than unmanaged woodland, while a separate study noted lower macro-moth species richness in coppiced woodland compared to mature forest [3939]. The species richness and diversity of fruit-feeding butterflies were similar between a thinned forest and an unmanaged one in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, although rarer species were less common in the thinned forest [3940]. In the UK and France, moth and butterfly communities differed in coppiced woodlands of varying ages [3939].\n\nFive studies in the UK, Finland, Sweden, and Japan revealed that cleared forest patches had a higher abundance of butterflies, including species like the chequered blue, woodland brown, high brown fritillary, and small pearl-bordered fritillary, compared to unmanaged or coppiced areas [3938]. Conversely, a UK study indicated that wider rides had a lower abundance of macro-moths than standard-width rides or mature forest [3938]. Four studies in the USA and Finland found that thinned coniferous woodland, sometimes combined with other management like prescribed burning, had a higher abundance of all or specialist butterflies than unmanaged woodland [3940]. Two UK studies reported a higher abundance of butterflies in general, and the heath fritillary in particular, in coppiced woodland versus unmanaged woodland [3939]. However, another UK study observed lower macro-moth abundance in coppiced woodland compared to mature forest, with no change based on the age of the coppice [3939]. The timing of management is also a factor, with one UK study showing that patches cleared 2\u20134 years prior had a greater abundance of heath fritillary than patches cleared 7\u201311 years ago or within the first year of clearance [3938]. Similarly, studies in the UK, France, and Germany found butterfly abundance to be higher in woodland coppiced 2, 2\u20134, 5\u20137, or 12\u201315 years ago than in areas coppiced 5\u201311 or more than 15 years ago [3939]. A review across Europe reported that clearing small forest patches benefited 19 out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern [3938]. Finally, a UK study reported an increase in breeding sites for the pearl-bordered fritillary and Duke of Burgundy in cleared forest patches that were also managed with cutting, grazing, and ride widening [3938].",

    "relevant_summary": "Altering mowing regimes on greenspaces and road verges has been shown to affect butterflies and moths. Two studies found that less frequently mown or unmown urban greenspaces had a higher species richness and diversity of butterflies and moths than more frequently mown areas (3841). Unmown public parks and road verges also had a higher abundance of all adult butterflies (3841). One study reported that roadsides mown in late summer had more ringlet butterflies than those mown in mid-summer (3841). Furthermore, road verges mown less frequently or later in the summer had fewer dead butterflies killed by traffic (3841). One study found that scarce copper butterflies more frequently occupied less frequently mown urban grasslands (3841). However, one study found that the management of road verges and land under power lines did not affect butterfly species richness (3841). In the Netherlands, one study noted that butterflies were only recorded on mowed verges where hay was removed (3841).\n\nRegarding herbicide use, one study in the USA found that restored roadside prairies with restricted herbicide application had greater butterfly species richness and abundance and a lower butterfly mortality risk compared to verges dominated by non-native weeds and grasses with no herbicide restrictions (3899). Conversely, a Canadian study found that transmission lines (road verges and power lines) that were not sprayed or mown had a similar species richness of butterflies to those that were sprayed and mown (3899).\n\nFor land under power lines, two studies in Finland found that land managed by mechanical cutting had a higher species richness of butterflies than unmanaged land, with the highest richness observed 2-4 years after scrub and tree clearance (3855). One study in Canada, however, found similar butterfly species richness under power lines and on road verges, regardless of whether they were mown once or twice a year, or left unmown (3855). In terms of abundance, one study found that mechanically cut land under power lines had a higher abundance of butterflies than unmanaged land (3855). Another study found that land under power lines and on road verges managed by mowing had a lower abundance of some butterfly species but a similar abundance of others when compared to unmown areas (3855). The time since management also plays a role, with one study finding that chequered skipper abundance was highest in areas cleared within the last two years (3855), and another study noting that pearl-bordered fritillaries used areas where scrub had been cleared one or two years earlier, but not three or more years ago (3855).",

One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in Australia found that managing a tropical savanna and floodplain with early season burning for 2-5 years increased the abundance of caterpillars, but management with late season burning did not [3878].\\n\\nConversely, one replicated, before-and-after study in Australia reported that in the spring after selective burning of eucalyptus forest, there were fewer Eltham copper caterpillars than before the burn [3877]. One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that one out of nine specialist butterfly species was less abundant in pine barrens and prairies where unburned areas were left during prescribed burning compared to at sites without unburned areas [3879].\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"3877\",\n    \"3878\",\n    \"3879\"\n  ]\n}"

Forty-one studies from eight European countries (including five reviews and twenty-three replicated controlled studies, of which one randomized and two site comparisons) found evidence that flower strips had a positive influence on invertebrate numbers with increased abundance, species richness/diversity, or both. Ten studies (nine replicated of which two controlled) found invertebrates visited or foraged on flower strips but did not specify increases/decreases in numbers. Two studies found effects on ground beetles other than changes in numbers. One replicated controlled study showed that ground beetles were more active or had enhanced feeding/reproductive conditions in flower strips. A review found flower strips supported ground beetle species that were rarely found in crops. Fifteen studies reported mixed or negative effects of flower strips on invertebrates. Six studies found no significant effects.\\n\\n\\nTwenty-one studies looked at the effects of flower strips on plants. Sixteen studies from seven European countries (including ten replicated controlled studies of which one randomized) found evidence that flower strips had higher plant cover, number of flowers, diversity, and species richness. One review found flower strips benefited plants but did not specify how. Four studies found negative or no effects of flower strips on the number or diversity of plant species.\\u00a0Five studies described the effects of different margin establishment or management techniques on plants.\\n\\n\\nSeven studies investigated birds and wildflower strips. Four replicated, controlled studies from Switzerland and the UK (two of which were randomized) and one review of European studies found evidence that plots sown with a wildflower or legume seed mix had a positive influence on birds. Flower strips attracted more birds or bird species and the number of birds using flower strips increased over time. Eurasian skylarks preferentially foraged in, and nested in or near, sown weed patches and were less likely to abandon their territories when they included sown weed patches. However one replicated trial in Switzerland found barn owls avoided sown wildflower areas. Two winter recording periods of the same replicated, controlled study in the UK found there were not more bird species or individuals on wildflower plots compared to control margins.\\n\\n\\nAll five studies investigating the effects of wildflower strips on small mammals (four replicated studies from Switzerland and one review of studies from north-western Europe) found evidence that small mammals benefit from strips sown with wildflowers or flowers rich in pollen and nectar, with increases in abundance, density and species richness. One replicated study from Switzerland reported that most common vole home ranges and core regions of their territories were found within a wildflower strip.\\n\\n\\nNineteen studies (of which eight replicated, controlled) reported positive effects on biodiversity of sowing specific plant species including\\u00a0phacelia,\\u00a0and/or other plant species such as borage and red clover. Three replicated studies (two also controlled) found negative impacts or no effects on biodiversity of sowing phacelia.\"\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "Ceasing mowing on grasslands has shown varied effects on butterfly populations. Two studies found that the butterfly and moth community composition in grasslands abandoned for over 5 years was similar to that in managed grasslands [3957]. However, another study reported that over 6 years of abandonment, the butterfly community became dominated by generalist species [3957]. In terms of species richness, five of seven studies found that grasslands abandoned for 3-20 years had a similar number of butterfly and moth species to mown grasslands [3957]. In contrast, one study found that grasslands abandoned for more than 50 years had lower butterfly species richness [3957]. The abundance of butterflies also showed mixed results, with some studies finding a lower abundance of certain butterfly species in grasslands abandoned for over a year [3957], while others found a higher abundance of all butterflies in grasslands left uncut for a summer [3957]. Some studies also noted a shift in community composition, with an increase in woodland and hedgerow butterfly species but a decrease in grassland species in abandoned meadows [3957].\n\nSimilarly, the cessation of grazing on grasslands has led to a range of outcomes for butterflies. Two studies found that the butterfly and moth community composition in grasslands abandoned for more than 5 years was similar to that in grazed grasslands [3956]. However, another study observed that after 6 years of abandonment, the butterfly community was dominated by generalist species [3956]. Butterfly species richness in abandoned grasslands was found to be similar to grazed grasslands in six of nine studies [3956], while some studies found lower richness [3956] and others found higher richness in abandoned grasslands [3956]. One study also found that species richness was highest in grasslands where grazing had ceased for 2-9 years compared to those abandoned for longer or those currently being grazed [3956]. Butterfly abundance also varied, with some studies reporting higher numbers in abandoned grasslands [3956], while others found lower [3956] or similar numbers [3956]. Additionally, some studies found that an increase in woodland and hedgerow butterflies was accompanied by a decrease in grassland species, with the extinction of some species in abandoned meadows [3956]. A review in Europe noted that ceasing grazing benefited six out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern [3956].",

For moths, studies found that their abundance and species richness were similar in woodland that was coppiced 1-4, 5-8, and 12-20 years ago (3939).
