In contrast, creating 'rock pools' on intertidal artificial structures has been examined in eighteen studies across various locations (3476). Nine out of twelve of these studies found that rock pools supported higher combined species diversity and/or richness of macroalgae, invertebrates, and/or fish compared to surfaces without pools (3476). thirteen studies reported that rock pools supported species that were not present on structure surfaces without pools (3476). However, the effects could be mixed, with three studies finding similar species richness in pools and on structure surfaces (3476). The community composition and species richness in created pools could also be similar or different to natural rock pools (3476). Two studies noted that a variety of marine life used the created rock pools (3476).",

Some studies found an increase in the overall species diversity and/or richness of macroalgae and invertebrates (3474), while others reported mixed effects depending on factors like the site, shore level, and the specific design of the features (3474).

However, other studies on subtidal structures found mixed effects on community composition and species richness depending on the orientation of the structure's surfaces (3452). When it comes to species abundance on intertidal structures, studies have reported mixed results. Some found an increase in overall abundance when features were paired with water-retaining covers (3474), while others found no change (3474) or mixed effects (3474). The abundance of invertebrates such as limpets and mussels increased in some cases, while barnacle abundance did not (3465). Fish abundance and richness on intertidal structures generally did not increase with the addition of these features (3474, 3465), but an increase in juvenile salmon feeding activity was observed (3465, 3474). On subtidal structures, the addition of grooves and small protrusions had mixed effects on the abundance of macroalgae and invertebrates (3452).

On intertidal structures, these features have altered the macroalgae and invertebrate community composition (3474) and supported species that were not present on surfaces without them (3474). Some studies found an increase in the overall species diversity and/or richness of macroalgae and invertebrates (3474), while others reported mixed effects depending on factors like the site, shore level, and the specific design of the features (3474). For subtidal structures, creating these features, in some cases along with holes and environmentally-sensitive materials, also altered the community composition, supported species that were previously absent, and increased species richness and diversity (3452). However, other studies on subtidal structures found mixed effects on community composition and species richness depending on the orientation of the structure's surfaces (3452). When it comes to species abundance on intertidal structures, studies have reported mixed results. Some found an increase in overall abundance when features were paired with water-retaining covers (3474), while others found no change (3474) or mixed effects (3474).
