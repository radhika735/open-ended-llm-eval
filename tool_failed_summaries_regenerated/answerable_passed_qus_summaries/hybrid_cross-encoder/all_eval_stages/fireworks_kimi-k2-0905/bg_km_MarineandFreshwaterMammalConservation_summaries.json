For aquaculture systems, six studies showed mixed results: four studies found that acoustic devices reduced predation on caged salmon by seals and sea lions or reduced seal approaches to fish cages, while two studies found no reduction in seal predation or dolphin presence around fin-fish farms. For fishing gear applications, the evidence is more limited and less promising. Only one study examined acoustic decoys to divert mammals from fishing gear, finding that increasing distance between the decoy and fishing lines reduced sperm whale presence at the lines, though whale arrival times and overall presence were unaffected. Additionally, five studies on acoustic devices deployed from fishing vessels showed that while dolphins avoided boats more frequently and killer whales maintained greater distances during initial exposure, the devices did not reduce predation of squid catches by dolphins. Overall, acoustic devices appear to show more consistent beneficial effects for reducing human-wildlife conflict at aquaculture systems compared to their use on fishing gear, where effects are either limited or ineffective for reducing catch predation.",

Behavior studies showed some reduction in echolocation clicks by harbour porpoises at barium sulfate nets, though approach distances remained similar to conventional nets.\\n\\nIn contrast, attached acoustically reflective objects (action 2806) showed consistently negative results across two studies: one controlled study found metallic bead chains attached to fishing nets did not reduce dolphin entanglements, and another controlled study found acrylic beads attached next to fishing hooks did not reduce sperm whale predation on fish catches.\\n\\nThe evidence base is also notably different: acoustically reflective materials were tested in five studies across multiple regions (Canada, Denmark, Argentina), while attached objects were only tested in two studies (Australia, Alaska).

    "relevant_summary": "Evidence shows several direct management interventions can boost threatened mammal populations. Translocation of marine and freshwater mammals has been successful, with studies showing 50-83% survival rates for translocated Hawaiian monk seal pups, and over 25% of translocated seals reproduced after release (Action ID: 2930). Captive breeding and release programs show mixed results - while two of three released Antillean manatees and two of 14 Florida manatees survived at least one year (Action ID: 2933), primates born and reared in cages had poor survival outcomes compared to wild-born individuals (Action ID: 1594), though those raised in free-ranging environments had better outcomes (Action ID: 1596).\n\nDisease treatment interventions show potential, with medical treatment healing most infected mouflons against foot rot disease (Action ID: 2581). Providing supplementary food has demonstrated positive effects on reproduction and survival across multiple studies, increasing breeding proportions in striped mice, arctic fox litters, and prairie vole litter sizes, while also improving survival rates for mule deer, bank voles, and eastern cottontail rabbits (Action ID: 2367). Supplementary feeding during translocation also improved survival and reproductive success for various species including black-tailed prairie dogs, red squirrels, and Eurasian badgers (Action ID: 2470).\n\nRemoving problematic individuals can benefit populations - after removing aggressive male Hawaiian monk seals, adult female survival increased and fewer females were injured (Action ID: 2929). Training mammals to avoid predators showed limited success, with trained greater bilbies not showing increased post-release survival despite some behavioral changes (Action ID: 2580).",

Catch protection devices on longlines had mixed results: one study found fewer unwanted catches of toothed whales using cage or chain devices, while two studies showed reduced damage to fish catches by sperm whales, killer whales and toothed whales using net sleeves or cage and chain devices. However, two other studies found that 'umbrella' or 'spider' devices on fishing hooks did not reduce predation or damage by whales. A study with streamer devices found they reduced dolphin predation on fish bait but only during initial trials. In contrast, modifying fishing pots and traps demonstrated more consistent positive outcomes: two studies showed steel rods on lobster pots or metal frames on fishing pots reduced sea lion pup and seal entries/trapping. Four studies found that wire grids or steel bars on trap-nets, along with other modifications, consistently reduced damage to salmon catches by seals and reduced dolphin interactions with crab pots. One study even found higher catches of undamaged salmon due to reduced seal predation after installing wire grids on trap-nets.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on multiple studies from various coastal waters including the North Atlantic Ocean, North Sea, Mediterranean Sea, and Baltic Sea, acoustic devices attached to fishing gear have shown several benefits in protecting porpoises and other marine mammals. Nine studies found that these devices resulted in fewer entanglements of various species including harbour porpoises, Franciscana dolphins, humpback whales, beaked whales, and small cetaceans. The primary mechanism appears to be behavioral modification - twelve of sixteen controlled studies found that acoustic devices caused marine mammals including harbour porpoises to approach nets less closely, have fewer encounters with nets, and reduce activity in surrounding areas. Additionally, some studies documented reduced damage to fish catches caused by dolphins and seals when acoustic devices were used.\n\nHowever, the evidence is not uniformly positive. Four studies found that acoustic devices did not have significant effects on bottlenose dolphins, harbour porpoises, or dugongs. Three studies showed mixed results with fewer entanglements of some species but not others. Some controlled studies in the North Sea and elsewhere found that acoustic devices reduced porpoise entanglements in some fishing areas but not others. One study noted that while porpoise echolocation activity decreased, the probability of porpoises approaching within 125 meters of the device actually increased over time, suggesting potential habituation effects.\n\nThe evidence primarily comes from studies on harbour porpoises and other marine mammals in temperate coastal waters, with most research focusing on gillnets, cod traps, and trawl fisheries. While the devices show promise for bycatch reduction, their effectiveness appears to vary by location, gear type, and potentially by the specific acoustic parameters used.",

These modifications successfully prevented Australian sea lion pups and grey/harbour seals from entering pots, and reduced salmon damage by seals. For fishing nets, seven studies evaluated exclusion and escape devices, with three controlled studies demonstrating reduced entanglements of Antarctic fur seals and common bottlenose dolphins (2823). However, survival rates varied - less than one third of dolphins exited escape hatches alive, and fur seal survival was higher with larger escape openings. Both approaches showed effectiveness, with pot/trap modifications demonstrating clear benefits in reducing seal predation and damage, while net devices showed mixed results for survival post-escape.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence, the most beneficial actions for reducing human-wildlife conflict at wild fisheries include several approaches for different wildlife groups. For marine mammals, installing exclusion and escape devices on fishing nets reduced entanglements of Antarctic fur seals and common bottlenose dolphins (actions 2823, 2808). Using acoustic devices on fishing gear was effective in 12 of 16 studies, reducing encounters with and damage from harbour porpoises, common bottlenose dolphins, and seals (action 2808). Modifying fishing pots and traps with wire grids or steel bars reduced seal access and damage to salmon catches (action 2822). Establishing handling and release protocols for captured mammals resulted in lower mortality of short-beaked common dolphins (action 2829).\n\nFor seabirds, using streamer lines on longlines showed strong evidence for reducing bycatch across multiple studies, with the effect enhanced when multiple streamer lines were used (action 285). Setting longlines at night reduced bycatch rates in six of eight studies (action 283). Setting lines underwater through specialized funnels reduced bycatch of northern fulmars, albatross and petrels (action 288). Releasing offal overboard during line setting significantly reduced attacks and captures of albatross and petrels (action 299). However, one study found that barriers installed at wild fisheries did not effectively deter harbour seals from feeding on salmon (action 2824).\n\nThe effectiveness of these actions varies by species, with some interventions working better for certain wildlife groups than others.",
