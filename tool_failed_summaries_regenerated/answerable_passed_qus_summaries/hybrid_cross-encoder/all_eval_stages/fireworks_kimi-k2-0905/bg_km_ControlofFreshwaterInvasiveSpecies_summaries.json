Seven studies found that glyphosate reduced C. helmsii, with one study showing 98% reduction when combined with diquat, and another achieving 80% reduction when covering with carpet before glyphosate treatment. Three out of four studies found that diquat or diquat alginate reduced or eradicated submerged C. helmsii, while one study found no effect. Treatment with dichlobenil and terbutryne showed partial reductions in biomass in controlled trials, but one field study found no effect from dichlobenil. Hydrogen peroxide was found to be ineffective according to one controlled study.\n\nPhysical methods show different effectiveness results. Lightproof barriers (black sheeting or carpet strips) were effective in five before-and-after studies, eradicating or severely reducing C. helmsii cover, although progressive recolonization occurred at two sites. Salt water was highly effective, with two replicated controlled container trials and two field trials finding that seawater eradicated C. helmsii. There is currently no evidence available for the effects of manual or mechanical control methods.\n\nThe combination of physical and chemical methods shows promise, with one study finding that covering C. helmsii with carpet followed by glyphosate treatment killed 80% of the plant.",

A study in France found that shooting metamorphosed individuals before reproduction as part of a combination treatment resulted in a significant reduction in the number of recorded adults and juveniles. For biocide application, a replicated controlled study found that chemical treatments including caffeine (10% solution), chloroxylenol (5% solution), and a combined treatment of Permethrin (4.6% solution) and Rotenone (1% solution) were effective in killing American bullfrogs.

Mechanical removal has proven highly effective, with suction dredging reducing Asian clam densities by 96% within sediment over two weeks, with the reduction persisting for a year (action 1120). Various dredge types have also shown effectiveness, achieving biomass reductions of 74-95% and density reductions of 65-95% (action 1120). For industrial water systems, mechanical removal combined with regular cleaning of industrial pipes and the addition of sand filters has been found to be effective methods for permanently removing or reducing Asian clam numbers (action 1119). Temperature manipulation is another viable approach, as controlled studies show that water temperatures of 36\u00b0C or higher kill Asian clams within or after four days (action 1116). Salinity adjustment has also demonstrated 100% mortality when Asian clams are exposed to high salinities (18-34\u2030) (action 1115). However, oxygen reduction appears ineffective as studies indicate Asian clams are resistant to extremely low oxygen levels regardless of temperature or immersion duration (action 1113).",

For water primrose (Ludwigia grandiflora), studies found that hand pulling and raking failed to reduce abundance in some cases, whereas hand-pulling from pond margins successfully eradicated a smaller population (Action ID: 1138). A combination approach using glyphosate herbicide followed by mechanical removal achieved a 75% kill rate (Action ID: 1140). For skunk cabbage (Lysichiton americanus), annual physical removal over five years successfully removed an entire stock of recently established plants (Action ID: 1101), while manual removal was effective for small outbreaks of small-growing plants. However, twice-yearly full removal over four years still required large numbers of plants to be removed annually (Action ID: 1101). For floating pennywort (Hydrocotyle ranunculoides), a two-week physical removal program resulted in growth exceeding removal rates, and while mechanical digger removal plus monthly hand picking greatly reduced coverage, it did not achieve complete eradication (Action ID: 1126). These findings suggest that population size, plant age, frequency of removal, and use of combination treatments are key factors influencing success.",
