    "relevant_summary": "Across multiple studies, opening forest canopies by clearing, coppicing, or thinning commonly increased butterfly richness and/or abundance, while macro-moths often declined relative to closed or mature forest. Cleared patches had higher butterfly species richness than unmanaged or closed-canopy areas, but lower moth richness; larger clearings supported higher butterfly richness and abundance than undisturbed forest, and wider rides had lower macro-moth abundance than standard-width rides or mature forest; butterfly richness and abundance sometimes declined over the first three years post-clearance, and some species\u2019 abundance peaked 2\u20134 years after clearance (3938). Thinning (often alongside prescribed burning, mulching, or nearby felling) increased butterfly richness and abundance within 1\u20134 years compared to unmanaged woodland or before management, while a thinned forest had similar fruit-feeding butterfly richness and abundance to an unmanaged regenerating forest, and partially cleared plots showed higher butterfly but lower moth richness than closed-canopy plots (3940). Coppiced woodland supported different moth and butterfly communities than mature forest; butterfly richness and abundance were higher in coppiced than unmanaged woodland and tended to be greater in more recently coppiced stands (e.g., 2\u20137 or 12\u201315 years since cutting) than in older (>15 years) stands; macro-moths had lower richness and abundance in coppiced than in mature forest and did not vary consistently with coppice age (3939).",

On road verges and pavements, restricting or stopping herbicide use in restored roadside prairies was linked to greater butterfly richness and abundance and lower mortality risk than verges dominated by non-native grasses without restrictions; on transmission lines, unsprayed and unmown sites had similar butterfly richness but higher abundance of northern/pearl crescents than sprayed and mown sites, with similar total abundance [3899]. Altering mowing on greenspaces/road verges showed that less frequent or no mowing increased butterfly/moth richness and diversity; unmown parks and road verges/under power lines had higher abundance for all adult butterflies or for pearl/northern pearl crescents, while other species showed similar abundance; late-summer roadside mowing had more ringlets than mid-summer; less frequent or later mowing reduced numbers of butterflies killed by traffic; butterflies were recorded on verges mown once or twice a year and on unmown verges, but on mown verges they were only recorded where hay was removed [3841]. Restoring or maintaining species-rich grassland along verges (e.g., sowing native wildflowers, increasing larval host plants, plant species richness, and flowering plants) increased richness and sometimes abundance of butterflies, day-flying and burnet moths compared to non-native dominated verges; wider verges had higher richness and abundance; in Canada, mown or unmown verges and power-line sites had similar richness and abundance to remnant prairies; mortality risk was lower on restored prairie verges than non-native grass verges, but more dead butterflies/moths occurred on roads with tall meadow verges and with habitat in the central reservation; less frequent or later mowing reduced roadkill; monarch parasite loads on mown verge milkweed were similar to prairies [3854]. Planting road verges with appropriate native species was associated in some studies with higher richness of butterfly/moth adults and caterpillars than verges with mixed or non-native plants, though other studies found similar adult richness, and effects on abundance were mixed [3842].",

Sixty-four individual studies show some benefits to one or more wildlife groups.\\n\\n\\nSixty-five individual studies reported the effects of flower strips on invertebrates. Of these, fifty reported positive effects. Forty-one studies from eight European countries (including five reviews and twenty-three replicated controlled studies, of which one randomized and two site comparisons) found evidence that flower strips had a positive influence on invertebrate numbers with increased abundance, species richness/diversity, or both. Ten studies (nine replicated of which two controlled) found invertebrates visited or foraged on flower strips but did not specify increases/decreases in numbers. Two studies found effects on ground beetles other than changes in numbers. One replicated controlled study showed that ground beetles were more active or had enhanced feeding/reproductive conditions in flower strips. A review found flower strips supported ground beetle species that were rarely found in crops. Fifteen studies reported mixed or negative effects of flower strips on invertebrates. Six studies found no significant effects.\\n\\n\\nTwenty-one studies looked at the effects of flower strips on plants. Sixteen studies from seven European countries (including ten replicated controlled studies of which one randomized) found evidence that flower strips had higher plant cover, number of flowers, diversity, and species richness. One review found flower strips benefited plants but did not specify how.

Four replicated, controlled studies from Switzerland and the UK (two of which were randomized) and one review of European studies found evidence that plots sown with a wildflower or legume seed mix had a positive influence on birds. Flower strips attracted more birds or bird species and the number of birds using flower strips increased over time. Eurasian skylarks preferentially foraged in, and nested in or near, sown weed patches and were less likely to abandon their territories when they included sown weed patches.

Community composition sometimes remained similar to managed sites, but after abandonment the community became dominated by generalist species with fewer generations per year (3957, 3956). For diversity, after stopping mowing, five of seven studies reported similar species richness to managed grasslands, with some cases of lower richness after 6\u201313 years or >50 years, and one case of higher richness when meadows were left uncut all summer (3957). After stopping grazing, six of nine studies reported similar richness to grazed sites, one found greater richness than sheep-grazed grassland, two found lower richness after >5\u201320 years or many years, one found higher richness where grazing ceased 2\u20139 years ago than in >10-year abandonments or currently grazed, and three studies reported higher richness in grasslands abandoned 4, 5\u201310 or >10 years compared to extensively or commercially grazed, with similarity to lightly grazed in two cases (3956). For abundance, stopping mowing led to lower abundance in some studies, higher abundance in others, species-specific or habitat-shifted responses (woodland/hedgerow species increasing, grassland/farmland species decreasing), local extinctions in some cases (e.g., silver-studded blue), mixed species responses across regions, and time-since-abandonment effects (e.g., similar abundance after ~6 years but lower after >25 years with no caterpillars) (3957). After stopping grazing, six of 20 studies found higher abundance than grazed (sometimes only vs intensive grazing), four found lower, four found similar, four reported species-specific mixed responses, one found density higher 2\u20139 years post-cessation than in >10-year abandonments or currently grazed, local extinctions occurred for large blue and silver-studded blue in some meadows, species-specific responses included clouded Apollo being lower than lightly grazed but higher than heavily grazed, and one European review reported benefits for six of 67 species of conservation concern (3956).",

(2) Seasonally removing livestock (e.g., removing cattle in summer, not grazing silage fields in September, removing sheep in winter or during peak flowering) increased butterfly and caterpillar abundance in several replicated, controlled UK studies, while other studies found similar richness or abundance compared to continuous grazing (3960). (3) Using rotational grazing sometimes resulted in greater butterfly and burnet moth species richness and/or abundance than continuous grazing, including cases where rotational systems outperformed continuous grazing at higher stocking densities, though other studies found similar or mixed responses among species (3965). (4) Delaying cutting or first grazing dates (e.g., grazing commencing after mid\u2011June, cutting in July/September rather than May/June) was associated with higher abundance of butterflies, burnet moths and caterpillars in several studies, and one study reported higher abundance of clouded Apollo where grazing started after 15 June alongside lower stocking density (3967). For context, increasing grazing intensity generally reduced butterfly and moth richness or abundance relative to low or no grazing in multiple studies (3962).",
