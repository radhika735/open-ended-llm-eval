Thirty-four studies (of which 21 were replicated and controlled and seven also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found some positive effects on earthworms, some invertebrates (other than earthworms), weeds or farmland birds, of reducing tillage compared to conventional management. Positive effects included increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms, greater abundance of some invertebrates other than earthworms, increased numbers of some weeds and/or weed species, higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying date and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields, and greater abundance of some birds - including Eurasian skylark, seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in late winter on non-inversion or conservation tillage. A review found tillage had negative effects on invertebrate numbers and no-till systems had more invertebrate bird food resources.\\nTwenty-six studies (of which 13 replicated and controlled and three also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found reducing tillage had either negative, no effect or no consistent effects on abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates (other than earthworms), earthworm abundance, biomass, or species richness, number of different plant species found as seeds, number of some weed species, mammal abundance, some bird species, and one study found bird preferences for conservation tillage fields decreased over time. Two studies found that crop type affected the number of weeds under different tillage regimes.\\nOne small replicated trial in the UK compared bird numbers under two different forms of reduced tillage, and found more birds from species that make up the \\u2018Farmland Bird Index\\u2019 on broadcast than non-inversion tillage fields.\\nTwo studies looked at the long-term effects of reduced tillage on earthworms (after ten years).

Comparing no tillage to reduced tillage, four replicated, controlled studies from Italy, Lebanon, and Spain found fewer weeds under no tillage in some or all comparisons (with two of these also finding more weeds in some comparisons), while other studies reported either more weeds under no tillage or no difference; for weed species, one Spanish study found fewer species under no tillage and two studies from Italy and Spain found similar species numbers [1398].",

Thirty-four studies (of which 21 were replicated and controlled and seven also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found some positive effects on earthworms, some invertebrates (other than earthworms), weeds or farmland birds, of reducing tillage compared to conventional management. Positive effects included increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms, greater abundance of some invertebrates other than earthworms, increased numbers of some weeds and/or weed species, higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying date and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields, and greater abundance of some birds - including Eurasian skylark, seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in late winter on non-inversion or conservation tillage. A review found tillage had negative effects on invertebrate numbers and no-till systems had more invertebrate bird food resources.\\nTwenty-six studies (of which 13 replicated and controlled and three also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found reducing tillage had either negative, no effect or no consistent effects on abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates (other than earthworms), earthworm abundance, biomass, or species richness, number of different plant species found as seeds, number of some weed species, mammal abundance, some bird species, and one study found bird preferences for conservation tillage fields decreased over time.

Growing cover crops in arable fields increased microbial biomass in several replicated, randomized, controlled studies (mostly USA), with one Italian before-and-after study reporting inconsistent effects; studies also found more bacteria and fungi in Spain and more mycorrhizal spores/species in Italy under cover crops [1345]. A replicated, randomized, controlled trial in Italy reported that applying a high rate of compost increased microbial biomass [889]. A replicated, randomized, controlled study in Italy found plots with grass buffer strips had higher microbial biomass [2308]. Two replicated, controlled studies in Spain found similar microbial biomass with or without added sewage sludge [2303]. Additional non-Mediterranean evidence related to microbial biomass includes: higher microbial biomass and activity with mixed organic\u2013inorganic amendments in trials from China and India, and greater microbial biomass under a ryegrass cover crop versus a ryegrass/vetch mix in the USA; traffic control studies reported conflicting microbial biomass outcomes in Poland and Denmark [902, 898, 899].",

For soil nutrients, some experiments reported higher soil nitrogen, ammonium, phosphorus and potassium under organic fertilization, though several studies found similar levels, and one study observed lower nitrate with organic inputs; soil pH responses were mixed (higher, lower, or similar depending on study) [1366]. Soil biological responses included higher microbial biomass in some comparisons, but some studies found fewer bacteria, nematodes or mites under organic fertilization [1366]. Soil structure sometimes improved, with greater aggregation in some trials, though others found no difference [1366]. Greenhouse gas outcomes were mixed: some studies recorded higher CO2 emissions with organic fertilizers, similar or greater soil CH4 uptake in some cases, and similar or lower N2O emissions in others; effects varied with organic input type (e.g., solid organic fertilizers associated with lower N2O than inorganic, liquid/slurry sometimes increasing CH4 emissions compared with manure) [1366]. For crop production, replicated trials in Mediterranean countries found yields that were sometimes higher with organic fertilizers, sometimes lower, and sometimes similar to inorganic fertilizers; in one Spanish study, alfalfa yield was higher with organic fertilizer in one of two comparisons [1350]. Regarding pests, one replicated, randomized, controlled study found more aphids with organic fertilizer in some comparisons, while another in the same system found similar aphid numbers [1393].",

Soil health: Compared with reduced tillage, soils under no-tillage in Spain and Italy sometimes had more organic matter (and sometimes similar), nitrogen was sometimes higher, sometimes lower, or similar; phosphorus was higher or similar; potassium was similar; microbial biomass was mostly similar (sometimes higher or lower in parts), denitrifying bacteria were fewer in one study; soil aggregation and water stability were sometimes higher, sometimes lower, or similar; greenhouse gases were sometimes lower or similar (multiple replicated studies, largely Spain and Italy) [1370]. Water availability: In Spain and the USA, soils without tillage often had more water than with tillage in some or all comparisons; Lebanon reported less water in some comparisons; some studies were mixed; barley water-use efficiency was higher without tillage in Spain in some comparisons; one Spanish study found lower porosity without tillage (14\u201315 studies) [1384]. Pests and crop damage: Versus conventional tillage, no-tillage had more weeds in some comparisons, inconsistent differences in others, and similar weed numbers in one study; weed species were sometimes more or similar; one study found fewer broomrapes; one Syrian study reported higher Ascochyta blight under no-tillage (9 studies plus 1 on disease) [1397].
