    "relevant_summary": "Several factors influence the success of chemical control for invasive aquatic plants like water primrose and parrot's feather. For water primrose, the herbicide triclopyr TEA applied at a 0.25% concentration has been found to kill 100% of young plants (1139). The herbicide glyphosate has also been shown to be effective, with its success being influenced by the use of adjuvants, as 97% mortality was achieved when mixed with a non-oil based sticking agent, and 100% mortality was achieved when combined with TopFilm (1139). The herbicide halosulfuron-methyl has also been shown to significantly reduce water primrose coverage (1139). Additionally, combining herbicide application with physical removal methods has been successful, with one study showing a 75% kill rate of water primrose when using glyphosate and a surface active agent followed by mechanical removal (1140). Another study showed an 85-90% reduction in Peruvian primrose-willow coverage through a combination of herbicide application, physical removal, and other actions (1140).\n\nFor parrot's feather, the herbicide 2,4-D has been found to reduce its growth and biomass (1606). The effectiveness of 2,4-D can be enhanced when combined with other herbicides, such as MCPA, which resulted in the complete elimination of parrot's feather (1606). Combining 2,4-D with carfentrazone-ethyl also led to a higher reduction in cover than the herbicide dichlobenil alone in the short term (1606). Other herbicides such as imazamox, imazapyr, glyphosate, and gluphosinate-ammonium have also been found to reduce the growth or biomass of parrot's feather (1699). Conversely, the herbicides fluridone, clopyralid, and copper chelate were found to be ineffective in reducing the growth of parrot's feather (1699).",
