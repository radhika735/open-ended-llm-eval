    "relevant_summary": "The most beneficial actions for creating field margins to support wildlife on arable farms include: Sowing uncropped margins with native wildflower seed mixes which support higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees compared to cropped edges, grassy margins, or naturally regenerated margins (Action 19). Sowing field margins with agricultural nectar and pollen seed mixes containing perennial leguminous flowering plants attracts significantly more foraging bumblebees than other margin types, though these mixes may need re-sowing every few years (Action 18). Creating uncultivated margins around intensive fields has shown benefits for invertebrates including bees, with 19 studies finding higher plant diversity and species richness compared to conventionally managed margins, though 6 studies found no difference (Action 63). Leaving uncropped, cultivated margins or plots provides benefits to farmland birds, plants, invertebrates and mammals including increased species richness of plants and bumblebees, abundance of spiders and ground beetles, and improved breeding success for birds like northern lapwing and Eurasian skylark (Action 562). Planting field margins with diverse plant species has been shown to increase activity of certain bat species like soprano pipistrelles and barbastelle bats (Action 1941).",

Fourteen studies from the UK (including one systematic review and nine replicated controlled trials of which four randomized, and three reviews) found that fields sown with wild bird cover mix had higher abundance, density, species diversity and species richness of birds than other farmland habitats. Six studies from the UK (including one review and two replicated studies) found that birds showed a preference for wild bird cover and used it significantly more than other habitats. One review found the grey partridge population increased substantially on farms where conservation measures including cover crops were in place. Nine replicated studies from France and the UK reported mixed or negative effects of wild bird cover on birds compared to other farmland habitats. Six studies found that mixtures including kale or a mixture of kale and/or other species attracted the largest number of bird species or highest bird abundance. \\nTwelve studies from the UK looked at the effects of wild bird cover strips on invertebrates. Seven studies from the UK (including one review and four replicated controlled studies of which two were also randomized) found positive effects. Farmland habitats sown with wild bird cover mix were used more by butterflies, and had a higher abundance or species richness of butterflies and/or bees than other farmland habitats. One review found wild bird cover benefited invertebrates. Four studies (including one review and two replicated trials) reported mixed or negative effects of wild bird cover on invertebrate numbers compared with other farmland habitats. One study found that bees and butterflies showed preferences for particular plant species. \\nEight studies from the UK looked at plants and wild bird cover. Six studies (including two reviews and two replicated controlled trials) found that planting wild bird cover mix was one of the three best options for conservation of annual herbaceous plant communities, benefited plants and resulted in increased plant diversity and species richness. However two replicated studies (of which one a site comparison) found mixed/negative effects for plant species richness.\\nOne replicated trial from the UK found that small mammal activity was higher in wild bird cover than in the crop in winter but not in summer.\"\n}"

Managing ditches to benefit wildlife showed that some farmland birds responded positively to the presence of ditches managed for wildlife, with bunded ditches visited by more birds than non-bunded ditches (Action 180). Maintaining traditional water meadows resulted in increased population sizes or territories of northern lapwing, common redshank and black-tailed godwit and increased plant species richness (Action 696).\n\nDrawbacks: Raising water levels resulted in a net loss of plant species in one study and did not affect lapwing foraging rate, while another study found common snipe declined on sites under management to maintain water meadows (Actions 121, 696). Some farmland bird species did not respond positively or responded negatively to ditch management (Action 180). Studies found that managing traditional water meadows by grazing had mixed impacts on wildlife and the productivity of northern lapwings was too low to sustain populations on three of the four water meadows managed for waders (Action 696).",

Nest protection through exclosures can benefit species including northern lapwing and southern dunlin by increasing hatching success compared to unprotected nests. Creating uncropped cultivated margins or plots (including specific 'lapwing plots') provides nesting habitat where northern lapwing, Eurasian skylark, grey partridge and yellow wagtail have been observed breeding. Spring planting of crops rather than autumn planting creates more suitable nesting conditions, with northern lapwings selecting spring-sown crops for nesting more than expected based on availability. Creating dedicated skylark plots specifically increases both Eurasian skylark population density and productivity compared to fields without plots.

For birds, two reviews and one study found positive effects or bird usage of beetle banks, while two studies found mixed effects and one study found no farmland bird species were associated with beetle banks. Beetle banks also acted as nest sites for harvest mice and had higher densities of harvest mouse nests than field margins. For hedgerow management, ten studies found managing hedges for wildlife increased berry yields, species diversity or richness of plants and invertebrates, and diversity or abundance of farmland birds. However, five studies found no effect on plant species richness, bumblebee queens or farmland birds.
