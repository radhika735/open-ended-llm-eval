For fencing, one controlled study found that deer exclusion fencing increased shrub height, and five studies in freshwater wetlands showed mixed results: fencing sometimes increased survival of planted tree seedlings depending on factors like planting season and site conditions, and increased tree seedling height in some cases but not others. One study found planted swamp gum seedlings had much higher survival rates over one year in mammal-excluded plots compared to open plots. For tree guards, one replicated, randomized, controlled study found that light-colored plastic tree shelters increased survival rates of planted tree seedlings, while one replicated, controlled study found tree guards increased tree height after 37 months but not after 44 months. One study in a nutria-invaded wetland found that plastic guards significantly increased both height and diameter growth rates of planted baldcypress seedlings over one growing season. No direct comparative studies between fencing and tree guards were found in the available evidence.",

Several studies found no significant effects on planted seedling emergence, survival, growth rate, or frost damage (Action 1256), though one study noted increased seedling biomass when competing herbs were removed, and another found that removing sheep laurel shrubs increased growth rate and height of planted black spruce seedlings. In freshwater wetlands, clearing vegetation before planting typically had no clear effect on seedling height, diameter, or survival, though it sometimes increased survival rates when specific competitive species like reed canarygrass were removed (Action 3334). However, vegetation removal can negatively impact overall forest biodiversity - applying herbicides after restoration planting was found to decrease plant species richness and diversity (Action 1241). Vegetation removal combined with mechanical soil disturbance increased cover and diversity of understory plants while decreasing understory shrub cover, and also increased density of young trees (Action 1274). Studies on mammal responses showed mixed results, with one finding increased use by American martens where competing vegetation was removed in clearcut areas, while other studies found mixed or no effects on moose and snowshoe hares (Action 2644).",

Several studies evaluating access restriction measures exist, but primarily for non-forest ecosystems. For forest-specific interventions, there is no evidence found for the effects of creating managed paths/signs to contain disturbance (Action ID: 1170) or providing paths to limit extent of disturbance to mammals (Action ID: 2337), meaning no studies have directly tested these interventions. Evidence from other ecosystems shows mixed results: six studies on using signs and access restrictions to reduce disturbance at nest sites (Action ID: 309) found increased numbers of breeders, higher reproductive success or lower levels of disturbance in waders and terns, while one small study found no effect on eagle reproductive success. Similarly, 11 studies on installing cave gates to restrict public access (Action ID: 999) showed mixed results for bat populations, with some finding more bats after gate installation and others finding negative behavioral effects. Overall, there is a notable absence of direct evidence for most forest-specific recreation and tourism management interventions, indicating a critical research gap in this area.",

Shelterwood harvesting results in higher plant diversity, lower grass cover, and higher density of tree species compared to clearcutting (1214). Group-selection harvesting increases cover and diversity of understory plants and density of young trees (1224). Thinning trees by girdling increases understory plant species richness, diversity and cover (1226). Variable retention management supports higher densities of bird species compared to control stands (332). Patch retention harvesting contains more birds of more species than clearcut areas while maintaining similar numbers to unharvested areas (330). Thinning trees within forests increases the density, cover, species richness and diversity of understory plants (1211). Selective or reduced impact logging maintains species richness and diversity while supporting higher butterfly abundance (3867). Harvesting groups of trees or using thinning instead of clearcutting results in higher species richness of macro-moths (3868).",

For young trees, 6 of 12 studies found thinning increased young tree density, though effects varied with one study showing decreased density and five showing no or mixed effects (action 1210). Understory plants showed consistent positive responses, with 17 of 25 studies finding increased density and cover, and 13 of 19 studies showing increased species richness and diversity, though some studies found no effects or mixed results (action 1211). Thinning by girdling specifically increased understory plant species richness, diversity and cover (action 1226). The combination of thinning followed by prescribed fire increased understory plant cover and abundance as well as deciduous tree density in 3 of 6 studies (action 1227). Beyond vegetation, thinning affected wildlife populations differently - amphibians showed mixed responses with population declines in some studies (action 852), while reptiles generally maintained similar abundance and species richness compared to unthinned areas (action 3627). Mammal responses varied by species, with some small mammals increasing in abundance while larger mammals like deer showed no consistent preference for thinned areas (action 2650).",
