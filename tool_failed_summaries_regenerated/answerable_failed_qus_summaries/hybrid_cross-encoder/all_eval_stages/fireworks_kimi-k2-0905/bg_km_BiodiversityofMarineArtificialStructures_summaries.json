    "relevant_summary": "Several interventions can increase invertebrate abundance on subtidal artificial structures based on the evidence from these studies. Creating habitat features is the most consistently effective approach. Creating hole habitats (>50 mm) on structures increased brown crab abundance (action 3434). Creating pit habitats (1\u201350 mm), along with holes, grooves and environmentally-sensitive material, had mixed effects on invertebrate abundances depending on the species group (action 3455). Creating groove habitats (1\u201350 mm) similarly had mixed effects on invertebrate abundances (action 3448). Creating grooves and small protrusions, ridges or ledges (1\u201350 mm) together led to colonization by non-mobile invertebrates (action 3452). \n\nCreating flexible habitats also showed positive effects. Short flexible habitats (1\u201350 mm) had mixed effects on mobile and non-mobile invertebrate abundances depending on species group and site (action 3450). Long flexible habitats (>50 mm) supported higher biomass (mostly mussels) and non-mobile invertebrate species that were absent from structure surfaces without flexible habitats, though effects varied by species group and survey timing (action 3451).\n\nTransplanting or seeding organisms onto structures increased invertebrate species richness and altered community composition (action 3471). Using textured surfaces (\u22641 mm) had mixed effects on non-mobile invertebrate abundance depending on the site (action 3449). \n\nOverall, creating physical habitat complexity through holes, pits, grooves, flexible habitats, and transplanting organisms provides the most reliable interventions for increasing invertebrate abundance on subtidal artificial structures, though effects can vary by species group and environmental conditions.",

Multiple replicated, controlled studies from Australia, the UK, Spain, and Malaysia have consistently shown that created rock pools support higher combined macroalgae, invertebrate, and fish species diversity and richness compared to structure surfaces without pools (Action ID: 3476). Specifically, nine of twelve replicated studies found increased species richness and diversity in created pools, with three studies reporting similar richness to natural rock pools. The pools support macroalgae, mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate, and fish species that are absent from structure surfaces without pools. Additionally, hole habitats and pit habitats on intertidal artificial structures have also been shown to increase combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness and diversity on structure surfaces (Action IDs: 3467, 3475). A before-and-after study in Australia specifically reported that creating pools, along with reducing the slope of a structure, increased the combined macroalgae, invertebrate, and fish species richness on the structure.",

Multiple studies found that grooves combined with small protrusions/ridges/ledges (1-50 mm) increased macroalgae and invertebrate species richness in 6 of 11 studies, while effects on abundance were mixed (Action ID 3474). Pit habitats (1-50 mm depressions) increased species richness in 8 of 12 studies, with higher densities increasing abundance of certain species like periwinkles (Action ID 3475). Small ridges or ledges (1-50 mm elevations) had mixed effects - some studies found no increase in richness while others found positive effects when combined with multiple habitat types (Action ID 3464). Large ridges or ledges (>50 mm) showed more consistent positive effects, increasing species diversity and overall macroalgae, microalgae and invertebrate abundance (Action ID 3465). The effects varied significantly depending on factors such as habitat size and arrangement, shore level, site characteristics, and the presence of additional habitat features like water-retaining covers or environmentally-sensitive materials. Many studies documented that these created habitats supported species that were absent from flat artificial structure surfaces.",

Creating hole habitats (>50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures consistently altered community composition in all three studies examined. This intervention, particularly when combined with other features like grooves, environmentally-sensitive materials, and small ledges, consistently changed the combined macroalgae and invertebrate or mobile invertebrate and fish community composition on and around structures. Using environmentally-sensitive materials also showed consistent effectiveness, with six of eleven studies finding that materials such as shell-concrete, quarried rock, or ECOncreteTM in place of standard-concrete altered the combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition. When combined with texture, grooves, holes, pits, and/or small ledges, these materials consistently changed community composition. Creating pit habitats (1\u201350 mm) combined with holes, grooves, and environmentally-sensitive material consistently altered community composition. Creating groove habitats (1\u201350 mm) also consistently altered community composition when combined with other habitat features. Creating textured surfaces (\u22641 mm) showed mixed results, with two of three studies finding altered community composition. Creating long flexible habitats (>50 mm) supported different species assemblages compared to structures without flexible habitats. In contrast, ceasing or altering maintenance activities showed less consistent effects, with one study finding no alteration of community composition.",
