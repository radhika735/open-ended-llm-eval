Five studies found no effect of controlling understory vegetation on the emergence, survival, growth rate or frost damage in planted seedlings, though one found removing competing herbs increased seedling biomass (Action 1256). One study found that removal of sheep laurel shrubs increased the growth rate and height of planted black spruce seedlings (Action 1256). In freshwater wetlands, clearing vegetation before planting tree/shrub seedlings typically had no clear or significant effect on their height after 1-4 growing seasons, though one study found planted baldcypress seedlings were taller when planted amongst cut woody vegetation than below an uncleared canopy (Action 3334). For tree survival, clearing vegetation typically had no clear effect, though removing reed canarygrass before planting tree/shrub seedlings often increased survival rates (Action 3334).\n\nRegarding forest biodiversity effects, vegetation removal combined with mechanical soil disturbance increased the cover and diversity of understory plants while decreasing understory shrub cover (Action 1274). This combination also increased the density of young trees (Action 1274). Removal of invasive grass species increased understory plant biomass, and removal of invasive weed species increased tree seedling height (Action 1228). Tree thinning, which reduces competition, showed that 17 of 25 studies found increased density and cover of understory plants, while 13 of 19 studies found increased species richness and diversity of understory plants (Action 1211). Similarly, logging trees increased density and cover of understory plants in 5 of 10 studies, and increased species richness and diversity of understory plants in 4 of 7 studies (Action 1273).",

Ground preparation before tree planting has shown positive effects, with six of seven studies finding that ground preparation treatments increased the survival and growth rate of planted trees (action 1263). Soil disturbance techniques include scarification or ploughing, where two of three studies found that ploughing increased the density of young trees, and two replicated controlled studies found mixed effects of tilling on different tree species (action 1251). Vegetation removal combined with mechanical soil disturbance increased the cover and diversity of understory plants and increased the density of young trees (action 1274).\n\nFertilizer application has demonstrated benefits, with six of eight studies finding that applying fertilizer increased total plant cover, understory plant biomass, size of young trees, and cover of seeded plant species (action 1248). Organic fertilizer shows specific advantages over inorganic fertilizer, with eight replicated studies finding more organic matter in soils with organic fertilizer compared to inorganic fertilizer, and four studies finding more microbial biomass in soils with organic fertilizer (action 1366). Adding organic matter to soil shows mixed results, with one study finding that leaf litter addition increased species richness of young trees, and another study finding that adding plant material to the soil surface increased total plant cover (action 1250).\n\nSoil amendments using a mix of organic and inorganic materials have proven effective, with five controlled trials finding higher microbial biomass and activity in soils with mixed manure and inorganic fertilizers, and four trials finding more organic carbon in soils with mixed fertilizers (action 902). Formulated chemical compounds can also improve soil conditions, with five of six studies showing increased soil organic matter or carbon when nitrogen or phosphorus fertilizer was applied (action 909). However, specific soil enhancers after tree planting showed mixed results, with different soil enhancers having mixed effects on tree seedling survival and height (action 1153). Mycorrhizal inoculation shows some promise, with studies finding that inoculating soil with mycorrhizal fungi before planting increased vegetation cover and height of certain plant species (action 3429).",

    "relevant_summary": "The evidence regarding the effectiveness of managing public access and tourism to mitigate human disturbance in forests is extremely limited. Most studies specifically examining forest contexts show no available evidence. One study from Spain (action 312) found that reducing visitor group size in forests resulted in fewer birds observed as visitor numbers increased, primarily due to decreases in collared dove and serin abundance. For path management, one UK study (action 311) found that two wader species nested closer to or at higher densities near a path following resurfacing that resulted in fewer people leaving the designated path. However, there is no evidence available for the effects of creating managed paths and signs to contain disturbance specifically in forests (action 1170). The broader literature on visitor management shows some positive evidence for restricting access: studies found that restricting access to protected areas resulted in higher populations of medium-sized and large mammals compared to unrestricted access areas, increased area use by grizzly bears and leopards, and reduced bear mortality (action 2330). One study showed that removing or closing roads increased area use by black bears (action 2325). However, many common visitor management strategies lack direct evaluation, with no studies found for restricting pedestrian access to natural areas (action 3022), creating designated recreational access points (action 2842), adopting ecotourism principles (action 3025), or using signs and access restrictions for amphibians (action 795).

Studies on preventing livestock grazing in forests found that two of three studies in Brazil, UK and Costa Rica increased survival, species richness and diversity of understory plants, while one study found mixed effects (Action 1206). In Israel, preventing cattle grazing increased the density of oak seedlings and saplings (Action 1206). Wire fencing to exclude livestock from forest sections showed varied effectiveness across locations: four of eight studies in Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Israel, New Zealand, Spain, West Africa and the USA found increased biomass, species richness, density and cover of understory plants, while four studies found mixed effects or no effect (Action 1205). For tree regeneration specifically, three of four studies in Mexico, Kenya, Israel and Panama found that livestock exclusion increased the size and density of regenerating trees, while one study found decreased tree density but not tree size (Action 1205). Shortening grazing periods showed regional differences: one study in Spain found increased abundance and size of regenerating oak trees, one study in Australia found no effect on native plant species richness, and one study in the UK found higher numbers of tree seedlings following summer compared to winter grazing (Action 1208). Reducing grazing intensity also varied by location: studies in the UK found increased tree saplings and in Greece found increased understory biomass (Action 1207). Studies on ceasing livestock grazing in forest, open woodland and savanna showed that two studies in each of Argentina and Australia and one in Mexico had mixed results for reptile species richness and abundance (Action 3511).",

    "relevant_summary": "Several management techniques involving tree removal can be used to increase forest structural diversity. Shelterwood harvesting is a technique where trees are removed gradually in multiple stages rather than all at once, and studies show this method results in higher plant diversity and higher density of tree species compared with clearcutting (action 1214). Additionally, shelterwood harvesting increases abundance, species richness and diversity of understory plants, as well as the growth and survival rate of young trees (action 1223). Selective logging is another technique where specific trees are removed rather than clearing large areas, and studies indicate this method can maintain similar reptile species richness compared to high intensity selective logging (action 3637). Reduced impact logging has smaller effects on wildlife abundance than conventional logging (action 989) and can maintain similar species richness and diversity to primary forest (action 3867). Tree thinning is a technique where the density of trees is reduced, and thinning by girdling increases understory plant species richness, diversity and cover (action 1226). Regular forest thinning can result in areas having similar reptile species richness compared to areas with no thinning, with some studies showing higher abundance of reptiles than areas with no thinning (action 3627). Patch retention harvesting retains small patches of trees during harvest operations and areas under this method contain more birds of more species than clearcut areas while retaining similar numbers to unharvested areas (action 330). Variable retention management, which leaves trees distributed across the harvest area rather than concentrated in patches, resulted in nine bird species occurring at higher densities compared to control stands (action 332). Post-wildfire thinning increases plant species richness and increases the cover of aspen saplings (action 1234).",
