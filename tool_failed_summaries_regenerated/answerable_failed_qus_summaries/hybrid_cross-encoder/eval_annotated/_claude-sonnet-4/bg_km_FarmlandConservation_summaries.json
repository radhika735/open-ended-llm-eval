    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from multiple studies, the most beneficial actions for creating field margins to support wildlife on arable farms include several specific approaches. Leaving cultivated, uncropped margins or plots provides benefits to target farmland bird species, plants, invertebrates, and mammals, with increased species richness of plants, bumblebees, spiders, abundance of ground-dwelling invertebrates and ground beetles, increased stone curlew breeding population size, northern lapwing hatching success, and Eurasian skylark nesting success (Action 562). Creating uncultivated margins around intensive arable fields supports more invertebrates and higher plant diversity than conventionally managed field margins, with 19 studies finding they support more invertebrates (including bees) and/or higher plant diversity or species richness than conventional margins (Action 63). Sowing uncropped arable field margins with agricultural nectar and pollen mix, particularly with perennial leguminous flowering plants, attracts significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated, grassy or cropped field margins (Action 18). Planting grass buffer strips around arable fields increases butterfly species richness and abundance, with wider grass margins (up to 6m wide) having greater species richness of butterflies, macro-moths and micro-moths than narrower margins (Action 3982). Leaving headlands in fields unsprayed (conservation headlands) results in greater species richness and abundance of butterflies than sprayed headlands (Action 3898). Taking field corners out of management is positively correlated with grey partridge overwinter survival (Action 128). Reducing field size or maintaining smaller fields leads to higher species richness and abundance of butterflies and burnet moths compared to areas with larger fields (Action 3974).",

    "relevant_summary": "Evidence from multiple studies shows both supplementary feeding and cover provision have benefits for farmland birds during winter, though with varying effectiveness. For supplementary feeding, nine studies from France, Sweden and the UK found that provision of supplementary food increased farmland bird abundance, breeding population size, density, body mass, hatching, nestling growth and fledging rates, and increased overwinter survival of a declining house sparrow population (Action 648). Four studies found that farmland songbirds used supplementary food when provided, including targeted species such as tree sparrow, yellowhammer and corn bunting (Action 648). However, five studies found no clear effect of supplementary food provision on farmland bird breeding abundance, reproductive success, territory size, overwinter survival of stable house sparrow populations, or tree sparrow nest box use (Action 648). For cover provision, fourteen studies from the UK found that fields sown with wild bird cover mix had higher abundance, density, species diversity and species richness of birds than other farmland habitats (Action 594). Six studies found that birds showed a preference for wild bird cover and used it significantly more than other habitats, with one review finding grey partridge population increased substantially on farms where conservation measures including cover crops were in place (Action 594). Regarding overwinter stubbles specifically, eight studies found that at least some species or groups of farmland birds were positively associated with over-winter stubbles, with two studies reporting that seed-eating birds in particular were more abundant on stubbles (Action 203).

    "relevant_summary": "Several specific actions can be taken on farmland to support invertebrate populations like bees and beetles. Planting dedicated floral resources on farmland has shown substantial benefits, with fourteen trials in Europe and North America recording substantial numbers of wild bees foraging on perennial or annual sown flowering plants, particularly on patches sown with phacelia where all but one trial found substantial numbers of foraging wild bees and bumblebees, with six trials recording 8-35 bee species (Action ID: 17). Planting nectar flower mixture/wildflower strips has proven effective, with 80 individual studies investigating these strips and 64 showing benefits to wildlife groups, including 50 studies reporting positive effects on invertebrates with increased abundance and species richness (Action ID: 442).\n\nCreating beetle banks provides benefits to farmland biodiversity, with fourteen reports from eight studies finding positive effects on invertebrate densities, distribution, and higher ground beetle density and species diversity in spring and summer, though effects varied between specific grass species and invertebrate groups (Action ID: 651). Managing the agricultural landscape to enhance floral resources shows promise, with one large replicated controlled trial demonstrating that long-tongued bumblebee abundance on field margins was positively correlated with the number of pollen and nectar agri-environment agreements in a 10 km grid square (Action ID: 362).\n\nReducing chemical inputs supports invertebrate populations, with studies on restricting certain pesticides showing that using specific fungicides reduced chick food insect abundance less than others (Action ID: 565). Reducing pesticide or fertilizer use through organic farming methods has shown some benefits, with studies finding increased wood mouse abundance when pesticides were reduced, though effects varied by species (Action ID: 2539). Managing grassland through reduced cutting frequency benefits pollinators, with studies finding that meadows cut once per year had higher species richness of butterflies and other pollinators compared to meadows cut two or more times per year (Action ID: 3961). Similarly, reducing grazing intensity by seasonal removal of livestock has shown benefits, with studies finding grasslands where cattle were removed in summer had higher abundance of butterflies and other pollinators than grasslands grazed throughout the summer (Action ID: 3960).",

For controlling invasive non-native plants such as Himalayan Balsam and Japanese knotweed, removing all flower heads of giant hogweed plants at peak flowering time dramatically reduced seed production according to two randomized controlled trials in the Czech Republic (Action 104). Mechanical and manual removal of invasive plants showed mixed results - one study in Hawaii found that removal of invasive grass species increased understory plant biomass, while a study in Ghana found that removal of invasive weed species increased tree seedling height, though a study in the USA found no effect of invasive shrub removal on understory plant diversity and a Hawaii study found no effect on native species growth rate (Action 1228). Herbicide use to control invasive plant species showed no effect on total native plant species richness in one US study (Action 1229). Introducing parasitic organisms to control problematic plants showed promising results in one Belgian fen meadow study, where it altered plant community composition, reduced cover of dominant sedge, increased moss cover, and increased overall plant species richness (Action 1777). However, there is currently no evidence available for the effectiveness of managing wild deer numbers or controlling grey squirrels on farmland wildlife (Actions 111, 106). Similarly, no studies were found evaluating biological control or chemical biocides for managing invasive species in farmland contexts (Actions 2172, 2171).",

    "relevant_summary": "Managing water levels and features like ditches and ponds on farmland shows both positive and negative effects for biodiversity enhancement. Benefits include increased invertebrate biomass or abundance, plant species richness, emergent plant cover, amphibian diversity and abundance, bird visit rates and higher numbers of some bird species from managing ditches under agri-environment schemes (Action 135). Raising water levels in ditches or grassland was associated with increased bird numbers, breeding bird numbers, plant species that favour wet conditions, and invertebrate numbers or biomass in agricultural landscapes (Action 121). Additionally, higher plant diversity was found on ditch banks along unsprayed edges compared to those sprayed with pesticides (Action 135). For pond management, maintaining pond water levels increased natterjack toad populations or maintained newt populations (Action 833) and enabled successful breeding by dusky gopher frogs (Action 833). However, drawbacks were also identified. Some studies found that ditch management had negative or no clear effects on some farmland bird species or plants (Action 135). Raising water levels resulted in a net loss of plant species and did not affect lapwing foraging rate (Action 121). Unflooded pastures contained a high biomass of soil macroinvertebrates of importance to breeding wading birds (Action 121). Additionally, re-wetting soils on old arable fields was not an effective method of reducing nutrient levels and restoring species-rich grassland (Action 121). One study found that draining ponds, particularly in the summer, significantly increased abundance and numbers of amphibian species, suggesting that permanent water levels may not always be optimal (Action 833).",

Establishing wild flower areas on farmland has shown positive effects, with three of four studies in Switzerland, the UK, and Germany finding that sown wildflower areas contained more wood mice, small mammals, and common hamsters compared to grass and clover set-aside, grasslands, crops, uncultivated margins, agricultural areas, and crop fields (2359). Planting trees on farmland provides benefits, with two studies in the UK finding that farm woodland supported higher small mammal abundance than arable land or similar abundance compared to uncultivated field margins and set-aside (2386). Planting new or maintaining existing hedgerows shows promise, with a study in the UK finding that establishing hedgerows alongside arable land increased small mammal abundance (2383). Planting crops to provide supplementary food for mammals has demonstrated effectiveness, with studies in the UK and Spain finding that crops grown to provide food for wildlife resulted in higher abundance of small mammals in winter (2394). Reducing pesticide or fertilizer use can be beneficial, with one study in the UK finding that organic farming increased wood mouse abundance (2539). Reducing the intensity of grazing by domestic livestock has shown positive results, with six of nine studies in the USA, Denmark, the UK, China, Netherlands, and Norway finding that reductions in livestock grazing intensity were associated with increases in abundances of small mammals (2408). However, some interventions showed mixed or no effects: providing or retaining set-aside areas showed three studies in the UK and Switzerland finding that set-aside did not enhance small mammal numbers relative to cropland or to uncultivated field margins and farm woodland (2377).",

Direct nest protection measures include protecting individual nests of ground-nesting birds using nest exclosures, which provided higher average daily survival rates for both common redshank and northern lapwing (Action 108), and marking bird nests during harvest or mowing, where marked northern lapwing nests were less likely to fail as a result of farming operations (Action 148).\n\nHabitat creation through specialized plots is highly effective. Creating skylark plots increased skylark population size, breeding density, duration or success and reduced the likelihood of skylarks abandoning their territory, with studies from the UK and Switzerland showing positive effects (Actions 540, 214). Leaving cultivated, uncropped margins or plots (including 'lapwing plots') provided benefits including increased northern lapwing hatching success and Eurasian skylark nesting success, with northern lapwing, Eurasian skylark, grey partridge and yellow wagtail breeding in lapwing plots (Actions 562, 213).\n\nGrassland management practices include raising mowing height on grasslands, which provided benefits to Eurasian skylark including increased productivity (Action 138), and creating open patches or strips in permanent grassland, where more Eurasian skylarks used fields with open strips (Action 239).\n\nCrop management techniques include planting crops in spring rather than autumn, which resulted in higher numbers of farmland birds, with northern lapwings nesting on spring-sown crops more than expected and Eurasian skylarks using winter and spring sown crops for different broods (Action 137). Undersowing spring cereals with clover increased densities of singing Eurasian skylark and benefited various farmland wildlife (Action 136).",

    "relevant_summary": "Evidence shows that linear features like hedges and beetle banks provide varying benefits to farmland wildlife. For beetle banks, studies found positive effects on invertebrate densities and ground beetle density and species diversity in spring and summer, though effects varied between specific grass species and invertebrate groups (Action 651). Beetle banks also supported higher densities of harvest mouse nests compared to field margins (Actions 2393, 651). However, some studies found lower or no difference in invertebrate densities on beetle banks relative to other habitats (Action 651). For birds, beetle banks showed mixed results - some evidence indicated birds used beetle banks and positive effects when combined with other conservation measures, while other studies found no farmland bird species associated with beetle banks (Action 651). Studies on butterflies and moths found that beetle banks had lower species richness of butterflies compared to hedgerows (Action 3927).\n\nFor hedgerows, evidence demonstrates stronger benefits. Newly planted hedges showed higher abundance, species richness and diversity of beetles and spiders compared to crop fields or field margins (Action 538). Established hedgerows had higher species richness of butterflies and macro-moths than beetle banks, crops or pasture (Action 3976). The abundance of butterflies, moths and macro-moths was higher along hedgerows than on beetle banks, grass margins, or field interiors (Action 3976). Hedgerows also increased small mammal abundance when established alongside arable land (Action 2383). For reptiles, cultivated areas with hedges had reptile communities more similar to forests than areas without hedges (Action 3519). Additionally, hedges trimmed three or more years prior had more bat species and higher activity of certain bat species than recently trimmed hedges (Action 1943).\n\nField margins provided additional evidence - uncropped cultivated margins benefited target farmland bird species, plants, invertebrates and mammals, including increased species richness and abundance across multiple taxa (Action 562). Plant diversity in field margins increased soprano pipistrelle and barbastelle bat activity (Action 1941).",

A replicated study found northern lapwing, Eurasian skylark, grey partridge and yellow wagtail bred in lapwing plots.\\nTwo studies (a replicated study and a review) from the UK found that leaving uncropped, cultivated margins or plots on farmland had no effect on 11 out of 12 farmland bird species or ground beetles. A replicated site comparison study in the UK found fewer seed-eating birds on fallow plots for ground-nesting birds in two out of three regions.
