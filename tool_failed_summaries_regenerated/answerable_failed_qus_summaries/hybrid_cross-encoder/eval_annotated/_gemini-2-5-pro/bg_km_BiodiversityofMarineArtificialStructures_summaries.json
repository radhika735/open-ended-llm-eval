One study\\u00a0found that creating pits did not alter the community composition. One\\u00a0found that creating pits, along with grooves, small protrusions and ridges, had mixed effects depending on the size and arrangement of pits and other habitats and the site, while one\\u00a0found that varying the pit size and arrangement had no significant effect. Three of these studies, along with three other replicated, controlled studies (including one that was randomized) in the UK\\u00a0and Singapore, reported that pit habitats, along with grooves and ridges in one, supported macroalgae, invertebrate\\u00a0and/or fish\\u00a0species that were absent from structure surfaces without added habitats.\\nFish community composition (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in Singapore\\u00a0found that pit habitats created on an intertidal artificial structure, along with grooves, altered the fish community composition on and around structure surfaces, and supported species that were absent from surfaces without pits and grooves.\\nOverall richness/diversity (12 studies): Eight of 12 replicated controlled studies (including six randomized and two before-and-after studies) in the UK\\u00a0and Singapore\\u00a0found that creating pit habitats on intertidal artificial structures, along with grooves, or grooves, small protrusions and ridges\\u00a0in two studies, increased the combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness\\u00a0and/or diversity\\u00a0on structure surfaces. Two studies\\u00a0found that creating pits did not increase the species richness, while two\\u00a0found that creating pits, along with grooves\\u00a0or using environmentally-sensitive material, had mixed effects depending on the site. One of the studies\\u00a0found that varying the pit size and arrangement resulted in higher species richness, while one\\u00a0found that this had mixed effects depending on the shore level. Two of the studies\\u00a0found that varying the pit size did not affect species richness. One of them\\u00a0found that increasing the density and fragmentation of pits, along with grooves, had mixed effects on species richness.\\nAlgal richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in Singapore\\u00a0reported that creating pits on an intertidal artificial structure, along with grooves and small ridges, increased the macroalgal species richness on structure surfaces.\\nInvertebrate richness/diversity (2 studies): One of two replicated, randomized, controlled studies in Australia\\u00a0and the Azores\\u00a0reported that creating pits on an intertidal artificial structure increased the limpet and periwinkle species richness on structure surfaces, and that their richness and diversity varied depending on the pit arrangement. One\\u00a0found that creating pits did not affect the limpet species richness, regardless of the pit size.\\nFish richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in Singapore\\u00a0found that creating pit habitats on an intertidal artificial structure, along with grooves, increased the fish species richness on and around structure surfaces.\\n\\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (15 STUDIES)\\n\\nOverall abundance (5 studies): Two of five replicated, controlled studies (including three randomized and two before-and-after studies) in Singapore\\u00a0and the UK\\u00a0found that creating pit habitats on intertidal artificial structures, along with grooves in one study, increased the combined macroalgae and invertebrate abundance on structure surfaces. One study\\u00a0found that creating pits decreased their abundance and one\\u00a0found no effect. One found that creating pits, along with grooves, small protrusions and ridges, had mixed effects on abundance depending on the pit size and arrangement, shore level and site.\\nAlgal abundance (4 studies): Three of four replicated, controlled studies (including two randomized and two paired sites studies) in the Netherlands, Singapore\\u00a0and the Azores\\u00a0found that creating pit habitats on intertidal artificial structures, along with grooves and small ridges in one study, did not increase the macroalgal abundance on structure surfaces. One study\\u00a0found that creating pits had mixed effects on abundance depending on the pit size and arrangement and the site.\\nInvertebrate abundance (9 studies): Three of eight replicated, controlled studies (including six randomized and two paired sites studies) in the Azores, the Netherlands, Australia\\u00a0and the UK\\u00a0found that creating pit habitats on intertidal artificial structures did not increase the combined invertebrate\\u00a0or mobile invertebrate\\u00a0abundance on structure surfaces. Three studies\\u00a0found that creating pits, along with grooves in one study, had mixed effects on barnacle\\u00a0and/or mobile invertebrate\\u00a0abundances, depending on the site, the species, the size of animals, and/or the pit size and arrangement. Two studies\\u00a0found that creating pits, along with using environmentally-sensitive material in one, increased barnacle\\u00a0and/or mobile invertebrate\\u00a0abundances. Two of the studies found that the pit size\\u00a0or arrangement\\u00a0did not affect abundances, while two found that the effects of pit size and arrangement varied depending on the site\\u00a0and species. One replicated randomized study in the UK\\u00a0found that increasing pit density increased periwinkle abundance, but pit arrangement did not.\\nFish abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in Singapore\\u00a0found that creating pit habitats on an intertidal artificial structure, along with grooves, increased the fish abundance on and around structure surfaces.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (6 STUDIES)\\n\\nUse (5 studies): Two replicated, randomized, controlled studies in the Azores\\u00a0reported that occupancy of pit habitats created on intertidal artificial structures by limpets\\u00a0and/or periwinkles\\u00a0varied depending on the pit size\\u00a0and arrangement, the size of animals, the species\\u00a0and/or site. Three replicated studies (including two paired sites, controlled studies) in the Netherlands\\u00a0and in Singapore and the UK\\u00a0reported that pit habitats were used by periwinkles, macroalgae and invertebrates.\\nFish behaviour change (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in Singapore\\u00a0found that creating pit habitats on an intertidal artificial structure, along with grooves, increased the number of bites fishes took from structure surfaces.\"\n}"
