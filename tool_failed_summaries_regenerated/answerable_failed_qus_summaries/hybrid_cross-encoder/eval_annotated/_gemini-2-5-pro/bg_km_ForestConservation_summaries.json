One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the USA found that plastic guards increased the height and diameter growth rates of planted baldcypress seedlings over one growing season (3330).\n\nWhen it comes to fencing, one replicated, paired, controlled study in Australia reported that planted swamp gum seedlings had a much higher survival rate over one year in plots fenced to exclude mammals than in open plots (3330). However, two replicated, paired, controlled studies in freshwater wetlands in the USA reported that exclusion fencing sometimes increased the survival of planted tree seedlings, but sometimes had no clear or significant effect, depending on factors such as the season of planting, seedling elevation, and site (3330). One replicated, paired, controlled study in a floodplain swamp clearing in the USA found that fencing to exclude deer had no significant effect on total tree seedling density after three years (3330). The same study did find that the fenced plots contained taller tree seedlings after three years (3330). In contrast, a different replicated, paired, controlled study in the USA found that the average height of white cedar saplings increased by a similar amount between two and five years after planting in plots that were fenced to exclude deer and plots that were left unfenced (3330). Two replicated, paired, controlled studies in freshwater wetlands in Canada and Israel reported that protecting emergent herbs with silt screens or herbivore fencing increased survival rates over 12\u201318 months after planting (3328). There were no studies found that evaluated the effects of using fences or barriers to protect planted peatland vegetation (1839).",
