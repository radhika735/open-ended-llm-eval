    "relevant_summary": "Evidence for individual guards/shelters: One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the USA found that light-coloured plastic tree shelters increased survival of planted tree seedlings, whereas dark-coloured shelters did not [1268]. One replicated, controlled study in Hong Kong found that tree guards increased tree height after 37 months but not after 44 months [1268]. In exposed coastal sites in the USA, full-length plastic shelters for red mangrove increased survival over 4\u20138 months, while full-length bamboo shelters and below-ground plastic shelters had no clear effect; plastic shelters also produced taller propagules in three of four comparisons over 22\u2013129 days [3331]. In a nutria-invaded freshwater wetland in the USA, plastic guards on planted baldcypress increased height and diameter growth over one growing season [3330]. Evidence for fencing/exclosure: In a USA floodplain swamp clearing, fencing to exclude deer did not change total tree seedling density after three years in plots sown with tree seeds, but fenced plots contained taller seedlings after three years than unfenced plots [3330]. In created freshwater wetlands in the USA, white cedar sapling height typically increased by a similar amount in fenced and unfenced plots over two to five years [3330]. In Australian floodplain swamps, plots fenced to exclude mammals had much higher one-year survival of planted swamp gum seedlings than open plots [3330]. Two USA freshwater wetland studies reported that exclusion fencing sometimes increased survival of planted tree seedlings and sometimes had no clear or significant effect, depending on planting season, elevation, and site [3330]. Gaps: No studies were found that evaluated fences or barriers to protect planted peatland vegetation [1839].",

General logging/removal increased understory plant density and cover in about half of studies and increased understory species richness/diversity in several studies, while other studies found no or mixed effects [1273]; it increased young tree density in one replicated controlled study and showed mixed effects in another [1272]; for mature trees, logging decreased tree density/cover in some studies, increased density in others, had mixed effects on tree size (increases in several studies; decreases or no effect in others), and showed mixed effects on tree species richness/diversity, with decreases in some studies and increases or no effect in others [1271]; among non-vascular plants, logging decreased epiphyte abundance and fern fertility in two of three studies, with species-specific mixed effects reported elsewhere [1270]. Partial retention harvesting (vs clearcutting) decreased the density of young trees in three Canadian studies [1215]. Clearcutting increased understory plant cover and species richness in most of the studies reviewed, but reduced density, species richness, and diversity of mature trees in some studies; effects on young tree density/species richness were mixed across studies [1222].",
