    "question": "When trying to control bracken in UK heathlands, how does using herbicide alone compare to cutting, or a combination of both?",
    "answer": "The evidence for these methods is mixed, and all are rated as having 'unknown effectiveness'. Applying herbicide alone increased heather seedlings in one trial but had no effect on heather cover in two other studies (1652). Cutting bracken also yielded mixed results, with two studies finding it increased heather cover or biomass, while two other studies found no effect (1653). A combination of cutting and applying herbicide increased heather cover in one trial but did not alter heather biomass in another (1654). In terms of reducing bracken itself, all three methods showed a reduction in bracken biomass or cover in at least some studies (1652, 1653, 1654).",

    "answer": "Yes, the available evidence suggests that the effectiveness of fencing may vary geographically. Studies from the UK and Germany found that excluding livestock with fences increased shrub cover, abundance, or biomass (1545). In contrast, one site comparison study in the USA found that fencing led to a decrease in the cover of woody plants, while other studies in the USA and UK found either mixed or no effects on shrub cover (1545).",
