    "question": "Considering different timber harvesting methods, which are most effective for increasing understory plant diversity?",
    "answer": "The evidence suggests that shelterwood harvesting is a beneficial alternative to clearcutting for understory diversity. Three studies found that shelterwood harvesting resulted in higher plant diversity compared to clearcutting (1214). Other studies also found that shelterwood harvesting increased the abundance and species richness of understory plants (1223). While clearcutting also increased understory plant cover and richness in eight of twelve studies, it also decreased it in two studies, indicating a trade-off (1222). The effectiveness of partial retention harvesting is unknown, as studies found it decreased the density of young trees compared to clearcutting (1215).",

    "question": "What are the main benefits and negative impacts of using prescribed fire as a management tool in North American forests?",
    "answer": "Prescribed fire has both benefits and harms for North American forests. A key benefit is the increase in understory plant diversity; fourteen of 24 studies, mostly from the USA, found fire increased species richness and diversity of understory plants (1221). It can also increase the density of young trees, though this effect is inconsistent (1220). However, a significant negative impact is on mature trees. Seven studies from the USA found that prescribed fire increased mature tree mortality, and four of eight studies found it decreased tree cover, density, and diversity (1217).",

Three studies found that shelterwood harvesting resulted in higher plant diversity and tree species density compared to clearcutting (1214). When assessed independently, clearcutting was found to increase understory plant cover and richness in eight of twelve studies, but it decreased mature tree density and richness in some cases (1222). Shelterwood harvesting was found in six of seven studies to increase the abundance, richness, and diversity of understory plants, as well as the growth and survival of young trees (1223).",

Covering the ground with plastic mats decreased the cover of herbaceous plants and grasses in one study (1239). Using straw as a ground cover was found to increase the growth rate of planted trees and shrubs (1266). However, weed mats had no effect on seedling height in another study (1267).
