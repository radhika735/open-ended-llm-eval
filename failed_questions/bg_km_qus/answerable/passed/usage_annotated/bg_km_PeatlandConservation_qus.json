    "question": "To restore peatlands afforested for commercial forestry, how does simply cutting the trees compare to cutting trees and also rewetting the peat?",
    "answer": "Both actions are rated as likely to be beneficial. Cutting forest plantations alone was evaluated in four studies, which found it increased cover of some herbs like cottongrass and sedges, and increased overall plant species richness in fens (1731). Combining tree removal with rewetting has been evaluated in eleven studies and was found to change plant community composition, increase wetland-characteristic plants, and increase cover of Sphagnum moss and herbs like cottongrass. However, effects on overall plant richness were mixed in these studies (1732).",

Two studies found burning increased plant species richness or diversity (1763). However, there are documented negative impacts. Two other replicated studies found that burning reduced or limited plant species richness (1774).

In contrast, soil amendments show mixed results. Adding inorganic fertilizer has a 'Trade off between benefit and harms', as it can increase growth but has also been shown to reduce survival in some cases (1826). Adding lime is considered 'Likely to be ineffective or harmful', as studies have found it can reduce the survival and growth of planted fen herbs, Sphagnum, and peat swamp trees (1825).",

    "answer": "Directly planting mosses (1818) is considered 'Likely to be beneficial', with studies showing planted mosses survive, grow, and increase in cover. Spreading moss fragments on the surface (1821) is rated as 'Beneficial', with multiple studies finding that this technique successfully establishes Sphagnum moss cover, although success can be variable and may depend on other factors like mulching.",

There is 'Unknown effectiveness' for restoring water flow across service corridors (1741), based on a single study which found that it increased wet peatland sedges while decreasing grasses that prefer drier conditions.",

    "answer": "Interventions include cutting, removing, or thinning the forest plantation, which is rated 'Likely to be beneficial' and has been shown to increase herb cover and plant species richness (1731). This can be combined with rewetting the peat (1732), also rated 'Likely to be beneficial', which studies show can change plant community composition, increase wetland-characteristic plants, and increase moss and herb cover. General rewetting of the wider peatland area may also be beneficial (1756).",
