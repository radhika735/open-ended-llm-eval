Benefits include increased numbers of microbes and higher soil organic carbon and matter (906). However, a potential harm is higher soil compaction under reduced tillage (906). A related action, delaying ploughing until spring, was found in two European studies to reduce soil loss and nitrate leaching (712).",

Growing cover crops between main crop rows (living mulches) was found to increase bacterial numbers and reduce soil loss (897). Growing cover crops when fields are empty improved soil structure, reduced nitrate leaching, and increased soil carbon levels in several studies (898). One study on empty-field cover crops also found more diverse nematode communities (898).",
