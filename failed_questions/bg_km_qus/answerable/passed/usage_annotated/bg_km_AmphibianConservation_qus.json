    "answer": "Several actions have been studied. Installing culverts or tunnels, often with barrier fencing, can decrease road deaths (884, 756). Road closures during migration periods are also protective (842). Modifying gully pots can significantly reduce the number of newts that fall in (782). In contrast, using volunteers to assist amphibians across roads has been found to be unlikely to be beneficial, with populations still declining (784), and the effectiveness of warning signage is unknown (841).",

Studies comparing specific methods found shelterwood harvesting resulted in similar or higher salamander abundance than clearcutting (851). However, other methods like leave-tree harvesting or harvesting in small groups did not result in higher salamander abundances compared to clearcutting (846, 844). Both partial harvesting and clearcutting typically decreased salamander abundance compared to unharvested forest (844, 846, 851, 852).",

Eliminating fish by drying out ponds or catching them has been shown to increase amphibian species numbers, abundance, and breeding success (826, 827). However, the methods used can have harmful side effects. Using rotenone to eliminate fish can cause mortality in frogs and negative effects in newts (828).

Similarly, five site comparison studies in the USA found that created wetlands had similar numbers of amphibian species and abundance as natural wetlands (880). A global review that combined both interventions found that in 89% of cases, restored and created wetlands had similar or higher amphibian abundance or species numbers compared to natural wetlands (879).

In contrast, the effects in forests are more varied. Eight of 14 studies in North America found no effect of prescribed forest fires on amphibian abundance or species numbers, while others reported mixed effects, increases, or decreases depending on the species and context (877).

    "question": "What is the state of evidence on the effectiveness of removing various types of invasive predators to benefit native amphibians?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests that removing invasive predators is often a beneficial action for native amphibians. Removing American bullfrogs significantly increased populations of California red-legged frogs (825) and removing invasive Cuban tree frogs increased native tree frog abundance (822). In Mallorca, the removal of viperine snakes led to an increase in midwife toad larvae (830). Various methods of fish removal, including catching (827), pond drying (826), and using rotenone (828), have been shown to increase amphibian abundance, recruitment, or breeding success, though rotenone can also cause amphibian mortality. The evidence for mammal control is less clear; one study on controlling rats found no significant effect on a frog population, although a predator-proof enclosure did increase survival for another frog species (839).",

    "answer": "The success of reintroduction programs using captive-bred amphibians shows significant geographical and species-specific variation. For the Mallorcan midwife toad, releases in Mallorca have been successful, with studies finding that captive-bred individuals established breeding populations at 38% to 100% of release sites (873). In stark contrast, programs for the green and golden bell frog in Australia are rated as likely to be ineffective or harmful. Studies there found that released tadpoles generally failed to establish breeding populations, with only one of four major release programs resulting in a stable population (872). This highlights that the effectiveness of this intervention is highly dependent on the species and local context.",

Translocating wild amphibians is a common technique, with global reviews finding that a majority of assessed translocations resulted in established breeding populations (854). Another method is head-starting, where wild-collected eggs or larvae are raised in captivity before release; this has been shown to successfully establish or increase frog and toad populations (881).

Physical interventions like culverts and tunnels, often combined with barrier fencing, also significantly decrease amphibian road deaths (756, 884). However, the effectiveness of these physical barriers can be variable. Studies found that success depends on design factors such as fence height and material, and tunnel characteristics like length, substrate, and lighting (756, 884).

Habitat type appears to be important for some species; natterjack toads were more successfully re-established on dune or saltmarsh habitat than on heathland (859).
