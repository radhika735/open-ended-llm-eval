    "question": "In UK silage fields, what is the comparative evidence for leaving uncut strips of rye grass versus raising the mowing height to benefit wildlife?",
    "answer": "Leaving uncut strips of rye grass on silage fields is rated as 'Likely to be beneficial', with UK studies finding it increased bird numbers and invertebrate diversity (132). In contrast, raising the mowing height is rated as 'Unknown effectiveness'. While some UK studies found it increased Eurasian skylark productivity, other trials found it had no effect on foraging birds or invertebrates (138).",

    "question": "What are the documented benefits and potential drawbacks of reducing tillage on European farmland?",
    "answer": "Reducing tillage is considered 'Likely to be beneficial'. Numerous European studies found positive effects, including increased biomass and diversity of earthworms, greater abundance of some other invertebrates, increased numbers of some weed species, and benefits for birds like Eurasian skylarks (126). However, the evidence is not universally positive; twenty-six studies found that reducing tillage had negative, no, or inconsistent effects on the abundance and diversity of some invertebrates, plants, and mammals (126).",

Studies showed higher use by various wildlife groups and increased nest survival for some birds compared to control fields (156).

Protecting individual nests with exclosures offered some benefits in studies, increasing survival rates for redshank and northern lapwing nests, though it led to higher predation of adult redshank in one case (108). Modifying agricultural practices is another key alternative. Delaying mowing is 'Likely to be beneficial' for wading birds and skylarks (131), and using wildlife-friendly mowing techniques (e.g., mowing from the centre outwards) is 'Beneficial' for reducing corncrake chick mortality (698). There is currently no evidence for the effectiveness of erecting predator-proof fencing (109).",

Planting crops in spring rather than autumn was found in several studies to result in higher numbers of farmland birds (137). A replicated study also noted that Eurasian skylarks used spring and winter sown crops for different broods (137). Separately, leaving overwinter stubbles provides a key food source and has been found to support higher densities of farmland birds in winter, increase grey partridge productivity, and positively influence breeding population trends for multiple species (695).",

For birds, providing owl nest boxes in farm buildings has been found to increase barn owl population density (154), and general nest boxes led to increases in Eurasian kestrel clutches and breeding tree sparrows (155). For ground-nesting birds, providing individual nest exclosures offered some benefits, like higher nest survival rates, but one study noted higher predation of adult birds on protected nests (108). For bees, nest boxes for solitary bees were readily used with studies showing local population increases, while nest boxes for bumblebees had very low uptake rates (80).",

For species-rich grassland, some studies reported positive signs of restoration in less than five years, while others found it took more than 10 years, and two studies noted differences between restored and existing grasslands remained after 9 and 60 years respectively (133). Similarly, for wet meadow restoration, positive effects have been seen within five years, but other studies found restoration was incomplete after 9 or even 20 years (119). Restoration of upland heathland can be particularly slow, with one review concluding that vegetation changes took place very slowly after grazing was removed (650).",

The impact on plants and invertebrates is less certain, with schemes often maintaining or having little effect rather than causing significant increases (700). Specific large-scale schemes show similar variability; the Swiss Ecological Compensation Areas scheme had mixed effects on bird populations (145), while the Dutch 'mosaic management' scheme benefited northern lapwings but not other waders (130).",
