Implementing fallowing has been associated with lower sea lice numbers on salmon in Scotland, though one study in Australia found no difference in mortality from Amoebic Gill Disease [1026]. Using cleaner wrasse as natural control agents showed mixed outcomes: one controlled study found corkwing and goldsinny wrasse were as effective as chemical treatments at controlling lice, while another found rockcook wrasse were ineffective at preventing lice outbreaks [738]. Adjusting lighting intensity can influence lice levels, with lower-intensity artificial light or natural lighting associated with fewer lice, and higher-intensity artificial light associated with more lice [741]. Selective breeding for disease resistance improved survival when fish were exposed to infectious pancreatic necrosis, with families bred for high resistance showing higher survival than low-resistance families [735]. Replacing anti-predator nets more frequently at salmon farms reduced salmon losses to harbour seal predation [2774]. Additionally, fallowing cycles were associated with recovery of benthic communities beneath cages toward non-impacted conditions, which relates to farm environmental management [1027].",
