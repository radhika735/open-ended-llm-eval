(2) Fitting a size‑sorting mesh funnel (sieve net) to shrimp trawls reduced catches of unwanted (non‑commercial/discarded) fish in three replicated paired controlled studies in the North Sea (action 2722). (3) Using topless (coverless) trawls reduced unwanted Atlantic cod and discards of commercial fish species in two of four replicated controlled studies, with size‑dependent effects for haddock and cod in one study (action 2712). (4) Fitting rigid escape windows/panels reduced catches of unwanted flatfish in one replicated paired controlled study in the Baltic Sea (action 2719). (5) Decreasing codend circumference/diameter improved size‑selectivity for several species in four of eight replicated controlled studies and one review, and reduced discarded fish or total discards in some cases but not others across multiple regions (action 2706). (6) Switching to a square‑mesh rather than diamond‑mesh codend reduced non‑commercial unwanted invertebrates in one of two areas, with similar catches in the other, while maintaining similar commercial fish catches and sometimes higher shellfish catches (action 2136).",
