Other mosses/bryophytes were present after 2–3 growing seasons with cover from negligible to 76%, but in fen sites cover was <1% unless plots were mulched, shaded, or limed (1821). \n- Spreading mixed peatland vegetation fragments led to Sphagnum presence after 1–6 growing seasons with cover from <1% to 73%, with controlled studies showing higher Sphagnum cover in sown than unsown plots; five studies reported Sphagnum cover remained very low (<1%) unless plots were mulched after spreading (1822). Other mosses/bryophytes were present with cover <1–65% (1822). Vascular plants appeared after spreading, with one controlled study finding significantly higher vascular plant cover in sown plots and another finding no effect on herb cover; adding fen vegetation increased the number and cover of fen-characteristic species in one study (1822). \n- Direct planting of peatland trees/shrubs showed that the majority of planted individuals survived over 10 weeks to 13 years in several sites, though some species had <50% survival; most planted willow cuttings died within two years in one fen, and <5% survival was reported after unusually deep flooding in one peat swamp forest. Planted shrubs and trees grew in multiple studies (1820).",
