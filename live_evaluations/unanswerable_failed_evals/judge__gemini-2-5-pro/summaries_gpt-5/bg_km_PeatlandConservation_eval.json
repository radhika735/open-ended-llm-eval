Using covers or barriers to control problematic plants has no identified studies on peatland vegetation (1775). Physically damaging problematic plants has no identified studies on peatland vegetation (1769). Grazing to control problematic plants has no identified studies on peatland vegetation (1773). Cutting/removing problematic large trees/shrubs in fens changed plant community composition toward more open-fen characteristics; in Sweden it increased richness and cover of fen-characteristic plants and increased moss and vascular plant cover, whereas a replicated USA study reported shrub cover still increased over time and total plant species richness increases were prevented (1772). Cutting/mowing problematic herbaceous plants showed mixed outcomes: two Swedish rich-fen studies found no significant effect on overall community composition, a UK fen meadow study found mown plots developed different communities; one Swedish study found more fen-characteristic species in mown plots (without higher cover); cover responses varied by species, and clipping did not affect Sphagnum growth in an Estonian bog (1770). Physical removal of problematic plants in fens increased cover of fen-characteristic plants in one study, had mixed effects on herb cover, often reduced bryophyte and Sphagnum cover (especially in drained plots), and increased plant species richness only in a drained area (1768).",
