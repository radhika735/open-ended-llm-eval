For providing supplementary food, nine studies from France, Sweden and the UK (six replicated, five controlled, one randomized and paired) found increases in farmland bird abundance, breeding population size and density, body mass, hatching, nestling growth and fledging rates, and increased overwinter survival of a declining house sparrow population; fed male hen harriers bred with more females than controls [648]. Five replicated studies from the UK found no clear effects on breeding abundance, European turtle dove reproductive success, territory size or density, overwinter survival of three stable house sparrow populations, tree sparrow nest box use, or abundance of weed seeds; one Swedish replicated, controlled study found no effect on clutch size or nestling weight and lower fledging rates in one year [648]. Use of supplementary food varied by species, region, season, and proximity to other food sources [648]. For sowing wild bird seed or cover mixtures, a synthesis of 30 studies found 21 with positive effects; UK studies (including a systematic review and multiple replicated controlled randomized trials) reported higher bird abundance, density, species diversity and richness in wild bird cover than other farmland habitats, and birds preferred and used wild bird cover more than other habitats; one review reported substantial grey partridge increases on farms with conservation measures including cover crops [594]. Nine replicated studies from France and the UK reported mixed or negative effects compared to other habitats [594]. Additional UK studies on wild bird seed plots reported higher butterfly abundance or richness than some crops/grasslands, with mixed results for other invertebrates, indicating broader habitat influences associated with these mixtures [3930, 594].",
