Combining cutting with herbicide did not alter heather biomass in one UK study, increased heather cover in a Norway study, had no significant effect on cover of seven plant species in one UK study, increased plant species richness when cutting preceded herbicide compared to the reverse order, and reduced bracken biomass or cover in multiple studies (1654). Using herbicide with leaf-litter removal did not increase total plant biomass after eight years, but in three of six years heather biomass was higher than with herbicide alone (1660). No studies were found evaluating effects of cutting and burning bracken (1655) or using herbicide with sowing of shrubland seeds to control bracken (1658). A systematic review reported that repeated applications of the herbicide asulam reduced bracken abundance and that cutting may be equally effective; a laboratory trial found asulam inhibited growth of three common moss species after three weeks’ exposure but not after 24 hours (105).",
