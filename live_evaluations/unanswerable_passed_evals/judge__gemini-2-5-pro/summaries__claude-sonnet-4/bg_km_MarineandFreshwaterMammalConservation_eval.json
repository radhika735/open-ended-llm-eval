Action 2777 indicates that two studies evaluated this method. In the North Atlantic Ocean, setting vessel speed limits during specific periods in key habitats resulted in fewer North Atlantic right whale deaths caused by collisions. Additionally, in the Indian River estuarine system, fewer manatee deaths were recorded after speed limits were set and enforced in all areas. \n\nOther potential interventions identified include diverting shipping routes (action 2754), using observers on board vessels to detect mammals and allow vessel course or speed to be altered (action 2755), using remote tools to detect mammals in an area and allow vessel course or speed to be altered (action 2757), reducing shipping along inland waterways (action 2763), and designating Particularly Sensitive Sea Areas to regulate impactful maritime activities (action 2223). However, no studies were found that evaluated the effects of these alternative approaches on marine mammal populations.\n\nFor additional context, action 3531 found that limiting vessel speeds was effective for reptiles, with vessels travelling at lower speeds causing fewer catastrophic injuries to artificial loggerhead turtle shells and fewer boat-related injuries to spectacled caiman in waterways with enforced speed limits.",
