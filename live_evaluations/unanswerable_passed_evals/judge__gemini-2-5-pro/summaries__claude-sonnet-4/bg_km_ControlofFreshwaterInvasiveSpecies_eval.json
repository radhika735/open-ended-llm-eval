      "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence, double fyke nets appear to be an effective method for controlling American bullfrogs in small ponds, particularly for targeting juveniles and tadpoles. Action 1046 indicates that double fyke nets were effective in catching bullfrog tadpoles in small shallow ponds in Belgium. For adult removal, Action 1045 shows that while catchability of adult bullfrogs in small shallow ponds using one double fyke net for 24 hours was very low in Belgium, bullfrog adults can be captured overnight in a single trap floating on the water surface in the USA. However, Action 1045 also found that bullfrog populations rapidly rebounded following intensive removal of adults, suggesting that adult removal alone may not be sustainable. Combination treatments appear more effective, with Action 1045 and 1046 both noting significant reductions in bullfrog numbers when shooting of metamorphosed individuals and juvenile removal by trapping were carried out as part of combination treatments in France. Chemical control is also possible, with Action 1048 identifying several biocides that killed American bullfrogs, including caffeine (10% solution), chloroxylenol (5% solution), and combined Permethrin (4.6% solution) and Rotenone (1% solution). However, no direct evidence was found for pond draining or pond destruction methods (Actions 1042 and 1043).",
