A before-and-after study in the USA found that following wolf reintroduction, adult elk numbers approximately halved and elk calf:cow ratios approximately halved (Action 2431). This reduction in herbivore pressure can indirectly benefit tree regeneration.\n\nThe relationship between herbivore control and forest vegetation is supported by evidence from livestock grazing studies. A replicated study in the UK found that reducing grazing intensity increased the number of tree saplings (Action 1207). A site comparison study in Israel found that preventing cattle grazing increased the density of oak seedlings and saplings (Action 1206). Studies examining the exclusion of vertebrate herbivores found that forest plots fenced to exclude or reduce the density of deer and elk had effects on vegetation, with some studies showing mixed effects depending on fire intensity and year (Action 3891).\n\nAdditionally, four of five studies in Australia, Canada, Finland and the USA found that using fences to exclude grazing increased the survival, size and cover of planted trees (Action 1254), demonstrating the negative impact of herbivore browsing on tree establishment and growth.\n\nHowever, the action documents note that no studies were found that specifically evaluated the effects of reintroducing overharvested animals on vegetation (Action 3018), indicating a research gap in directly measuring the effects of predator reintroduction on forest regeneration.",

It indicates that the relationship between herbivores and tree regeneration is not always simple and can be modified by other environmental factors.
