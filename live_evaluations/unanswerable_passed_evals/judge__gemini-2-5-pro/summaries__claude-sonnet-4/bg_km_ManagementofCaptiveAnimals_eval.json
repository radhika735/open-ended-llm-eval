Presenting food items whole instead of processed increases the amount consumed and time spent feeding in macaques (Action 1323). Changing feeding times to unpredictable schedules decreases inactivity in chimpanzees (Action 1338). Providing cut branches (browse) allows captive gorillas to use the same processing skills as wild gorillas for foraging (Action 1332). Hiding food in containers such as boxes and bags increases activity levels and foraging behaviors in lemurs and gibbons (Action 1316). Feeding individuals in social groups makes enrichment tasks more efficient, requiring less time to complete in monkeys, and increases consumption of unfamiliar foods (Action 1343). Presenting feeds when smaller crowds are present increases foraging and object use in chimpanzees (Action 1324).",
