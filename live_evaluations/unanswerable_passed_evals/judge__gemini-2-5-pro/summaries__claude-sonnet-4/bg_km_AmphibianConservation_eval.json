Action 878 shows that pond restoration increased numbers of amphibian species, maintained or increased populations, or increased pond occupancy and ponds with breeding success in six replicated, before-and-after studies in Denmark, Estonia, Italy and the UK. Additionally, pond restoration increased the number of ponds used by breeding natterjack toads, and restored and created ponds were colonized by 1-7 species, with 6-65% of ponds colonized and 35% used for breeding.\n\nWetland restoration is also effective, with action 879 showing that in 89% of cases from a global review, restored and created wetlands had similar or higher amphibian abundance or numbers of species to natural wetlands. Seven of nine studies found that wetland restoration increased numbers of amphibian species, with breeding populations establishing in some cases.\n\nPayment schemes to farmers (action 818) created amphibian breeding habitat or increased frog or toad populations in three studies in Denmark, Sweden and Taiwan, and ditches managed under agri-environment schemes had higher numbers of amphibian species and higher abundance than those managed conventionally.\n\nHowever, the documents do not provide specific cost comparisons between different restoration methods to definitively identify the most cost-effective approach.",
