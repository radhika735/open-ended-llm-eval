Furthermore, under '2009: Breed bats in captivity to supplement wild populations affected by white-nose syndrome', it also states 'We found no studies'. 'Reintroducing' is the same as 'releasing' or 'supplementing'. Since no studies evaluating this action were found, it follows that no data on success rates for this specific action could be reported.",

Reintroducing bats and measuring their success rate would be a primary way to evaluate the effects of such a program. Since the context confirms that no studies on this topic were found, it logically follows that no success rates for reintroduction could have been reported.

To determine a success rate, studies must first be conducted to evaluate the effects and outcomes of such a program. This statement asserts that no such foundational studies have been performed.
