Sowing at a higher seed density increased forb species richness and cover in replicated, randomized, paired, controlled studies [3405]. Planting grassland plants increased forb species richness in 83% of cases, and adding plantings to seeding increased total and native species compared to seeding alone [3399]. Disturbing soil before seeding increased forb species richness in most cases compared to harrowing and increased forb cover in a replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study [3413]. Irrigating after sowing native seeds did not alter plant species richness in one replicated, controlled study [3430]. Using an organic erosion blanket after sowing increased overall plant species richness in one study [3431]. Inoculating soil with mycorrhiza before seeding had mixed effects: it did not change overall richness in one study, did not alter biomass of three native grass and forb species in another, but increased the abundance of some target species in one study [3429].",
