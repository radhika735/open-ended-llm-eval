If no studies evaluated the effects of releasing captive-bred bats, it logically follows that no success rates for their reintroduction (which is a form of release) could be reported from such studies.

This citation does not discuss 'reintroduction' or any 'success rates of reintroduction'. While another section (2039) mentions the lack of studies on 'releasing captive-bred bats', statement 2 solely cites 2009, which does not contain information about reintroduction success rates.

This statement indicates that no studies have evaluated the broader 'effects' of using captive-bred bats to 'supplement wild populations affected by white-nose syndrome'. Reintroduction is a specific method for supplementation, and 'success rate' is a measure of 'effects'. If no studies have even looked at the general effects of such strategies, it strongly suggests that specific success rates for reintroduction would be unavailable or not yet determined.
