      "relevant_summary": "Evidence on amphibian habitat restoration reports: Restoring wetlands often produced amphibian abundance and species richness similar to natural wetlands in multiple North American studies, with additional studies showing increases in species numbers and colonization, though some cases found lower richness or mixed effects, and outcomes varied with wetland size, proximity to sources, and seasonality [879]. Pond restoration showed mixed results by species and site, with several studies reporting increased species numbers, population maintenance or increases, colonization, and more ponds used for breeding, while other studies found no increase or inconclusive outcomes for certain species [878]. Restoring or retaining connectivity reduced road mortality when a road was elevated to reconnect wetlands and maintained multiple frog species over decades when native vegetation corridors were retained [840, 853]. Managing water levels increased or maintained certain toad and newt populations and enabled successful breeding in a threatened frog; draining ponds increased amphibian abundance and species numbers in one study [833]. Engaging landowners and volunteers was associated with population increases in some species, increased weights in aquatically managed habitats, and large-scale restoration efforts involving thousands of volunteers and up to 1,023 ponds restored or over 11,500 km2 of habitat managed [777]. Payments to farmers to cover conservation costs created breeding habitat or increased frog and toad populations in several countries and were associated with higher species numbers and abundance in agri-environment scheme ditches compared to conventional management [818]. Replanting or reseeding vegetation led to amphibian communities similar to natural sites in some contexts, increased frog species in one case, and colonization of restored habitats, though post-logging planted forests with herbicide had lower or similar abundance than naturally regenerating forests depending on species and age [849]. Reduced mowing as part of restoration was linked to increased numbers of frog species in one study [783]. Grazing management yielded mixed outcomes, with some programs increasing or maintaining populations of certain toads and others finding no advantage or lower abundance depending on species and grazing regime [780].",
