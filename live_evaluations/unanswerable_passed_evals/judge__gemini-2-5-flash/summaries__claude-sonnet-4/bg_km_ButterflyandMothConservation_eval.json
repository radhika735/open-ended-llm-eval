Action 3844 specifically states that no studies were found that evaluated the effects of changing turbine colour to reduce attraction to butterflies and moths. Similarly, action 1959 indicates that no studies were found that evaluated the effects of painting turbines to reduce insect attraction on populations. Action 3843 confirms that no studies were found that evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of removing or changing turbine lighting to reduce insect attraction. While action 258 describes a single experiment showing that thick black stripes on wind turbine blades made them more conspicuous to an American kestrel, this study focused on bird visibility rather than butterfly and moth attraction.",
