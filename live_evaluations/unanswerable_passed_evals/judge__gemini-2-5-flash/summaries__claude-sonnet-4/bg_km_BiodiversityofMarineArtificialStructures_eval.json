Twenty-two studies examined this intervention, showing that creating pit habitats increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness and/or diversity on structure surfaces in eight of 12 studies (Action ID 3475). The pit habitats supported macroalgae, invertebrate and fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without added habitats. Creating small protrusions (1-50 mm) also showed promise, with two studies in Singapore finding increased species richness when combined with grooves, small ridges and pits (Action ID 3462). Creating large ridges or ledges (>50 mm) demonstrated effectiveness in three studies, with one study reporting increased species diversity when combined with grooves and small protrusions (Action ID 3465). Reducing the slope of intertidal artificial structures showed mixed results, with one study finding increased combined macroalgae, invertebrate and fish species richness when combined with creating rock pools (Action ID 3461). Using environmentally-sensitive materials had varied effects across eight studies, with some materials like ECOncrete™ showing benefits when combined with creating grooves, small ledges and holes, while other materials showed mixed or no effects (Action ID 3469). Creating flexible habitats showed limited effectiveness, with short flexible habitats (1-50 mm) decreasing species richness in one study (Action ID 3459), though long flexible habitats (>50 mm) did alter community composition in one study (Action ID 3460).",
