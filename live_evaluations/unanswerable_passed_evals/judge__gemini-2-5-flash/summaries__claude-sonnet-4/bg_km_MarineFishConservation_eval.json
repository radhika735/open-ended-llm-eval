The additional restriction on all towed fishing gears introduces a confounding variable, making it difficult to attribute any observed effects solely to the absence of dredging.

                "reasoning": "This statement provides evidence that the presence or absence of dredging (comparing prohibited vs. dredged sites) has a measurable effect ('different combined invertebrate and fish community composition') on fish communities. While 'prohibiting dredging' is not identical to 'limiting the number of dredges', it establishes a foundational fact: dredging can indeed impact fish populations. If dredging has an effect when present versus absent, then varying the extent of dredging (e.g., by limiting the number of dredges) can reasonably be expected to also have an effect, or modulate existing effects. Therefore, this statement is relevant as it validates the premise that dredging impacts fish communities, which is crucial for understanding the effects of its limitation.",
