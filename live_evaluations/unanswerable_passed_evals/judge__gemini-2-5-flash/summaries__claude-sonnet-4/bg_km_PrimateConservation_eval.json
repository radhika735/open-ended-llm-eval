Action 1438 specifically addresses \"Use of unpalatable buffer crops\" but states that no evidence was found for the effects of using unpalatable buffer crops to prevent primates from entering agricultural areas on primate populations. The search found one study (Action 3895) on genetically modified crops that produce pesticide, but this focused on butterfly and moth survival rather than primate deterrence. Alternative deterrent strategies documented include using chili-based deterrents (Action 2492) which showed mixed results with elephants - five of seven studies found chili-based deterrents repelled elephants at least initially, while two studies found chili smoke and fences did not reduce crop raiding. Loud noise deterrents (Action 2460) also showed mixed effectiveness, with five of six studies finding loud noises reduced crop damage by various mammals including elephants and deer, while other studies found no effect.",
