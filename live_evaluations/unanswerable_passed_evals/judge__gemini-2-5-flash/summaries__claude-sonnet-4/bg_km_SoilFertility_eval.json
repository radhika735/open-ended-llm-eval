For adding mulch to crops (Action 887), one trial showed that mulch improved soil structure and increased soil organic matter, along with benefits including increased soil animal and fungal numbers, diversity and activity, higher nutrient levels, increased soil stability, reduced soil erosion and runoff, increased soil moisture, and increased yields. For growing cover crops beneath the main crop (Action 897), two controlled trials from India and South Africa found that soil organic matter increased under cover crops, though one trial from Germany found no effect on soil organic matter levels. Cover crops also showed benefits including increased bacterial numbers and activity, and reduced erosion. For growing cover crops when the field is empty (Action 898), one replicated study from Denmark and one review based mainly in Japan found increased soil carbon levels under cover crops, and one replicated study from Denmark and three controlled studies found increased nitrogen and carbon levels under cover crops.",
