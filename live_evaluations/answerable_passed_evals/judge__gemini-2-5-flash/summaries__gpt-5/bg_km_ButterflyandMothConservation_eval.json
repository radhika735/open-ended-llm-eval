Cleared patches had higher butterfly species richness than unmanaged or closed-canopy areas, but lower moth richness; larger clearings supported higher butterfly richness and abundance than undisturbed forest, and wider rides had lower macro-moth abundance than standard-width rides or mature forest; butterfly richness and abundance sometimes declined over the first three years post-clearance, and some species’ abundance peaked 2–4 years after clearance (3938). Thinning (often alongside prescribed burning, mulching, or nearby felling) increased butterfly richness and abundance within 1–4 years compared to unmanaged woodland or before management, while a thinned forest had similar fruit-feeding butterfly richness and abundance to an unmanaged regenerating forest, and partially cleared plots showed higher butterfly but lower moth richness than closed-canopy plots (3940). Coppiced woodland supported different moth and butterfly communities than mature forest; butterfly richness and abundance were higher in coppiced than unmanaged woodland and tended to be greater in more recently coppiced stands (e.g., 2–7 or 12–15 years since cutting) than in older (>15 years) stands; macro-moths had lower richness and abundance in coppiced than in mature forest and did not vary consistently with coppice age (3939).",

      "relevant_summary": "Across power-line corridors, mechanical cutting and recent scrub/tree clearance were associated with higher butterfly species richness than unmanaged land, with richness highest 2–4 years post-clearance; abundance was higher than unmanaged in some cases, while time-since-management effects varied by species, and mowing versus cutting/herbicide produced similar abundances for several species except frosted elfin, which was higher with mowing; pearl-bordered fritillaries used areas cleared 1–2 years earlier but not ≥3 years earlier [3855]. On road verges and pavements, restricting or stopping herbicide use in restored roadside prairies was linked to greater butterfly richness and abundance and lower mortality risk than verges dominated by non-native grasses without restrictions; on transmission lines, unsprayed and unmown sites had similar butterfly richness but higher abundance of northern/pearl crescents than sprayed and mown sites, with similar total abundance [3899]. Altering mowing on greenspaces/road verges showed that less frequent or no mowing increased butterfly/moth richness and diversity; unmown parks and road verges/under power lines had higher abundance for all adult butterflies or for pearl/northern pearl crescents, while other species showed similar abundance; late-summer roadside mowing had more ringlets than mid-summer; less frequent or later mowing reduced numbers of butterflies killed by traffic; butterflies were recorded on verges mown once or twice a year and on unmown verges, but on mown verges they were only recorded where hay was removed [3841]. Restoring or maintaining species-rich grassland along verges (e.g., sowing native wildflowers, increasing larval host plants, plant species richness, and flowering plants) increased richness and sometimes abundance of butterflies, day-flying and burnet moths compared to non-native dominated verges; wider verges had higher richness and abundance; in Canada, mown or unmown verges and power-line sites had similar richness and abundance to remnant prairies; mortality risk was lower on restored prairie verges than non-native grass verges, but more dead butterflies/moths occurred on roads with tall meadow verges and with habitat in the central reservation; less frequent or later mowing reduced roadkill; monarch parasite loads on mown verge milkweed were similar to prairies [3854]. Planting road verges with appropriate native species was associated in some studies with higher richness of butterfly/moth adults and caterpillars than verges with mixed or non-native plants, though other studies found similar adult richness, and effects on abundance were mixed [3842].",
