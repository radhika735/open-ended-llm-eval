Seed-eating birds were more abundant on uncut and ungrazed plots than on uncut and grazed plots (224). A replicated, controlled, randomized UK study found no difference in ground beetle abundance and diversity between cut and uncut headlands in the first two years, but higher species diversity in uncut plots in the third year; no studies were found assessing effects on mammals (132, 2400). Raising mowing/cutting height: A replicated, controlled study and a review from the UK found raised mowing heights benefited Eurasian skylark, including increased productivity, and a review reported raised cutting heights were less damaging to amphibians and invertebrates (138). However, a randomized, replicated, controlled UK trial found no effect of raised mowing height on numbers of foraging birds or invertebrates, and one replicated controlled study found no difference in invertebrate abundance (138). A UK review found raised mowing height may have increased skylark productivity but not enough to maintain the local population (222). On intensively managed UK grassland, plots cut to 10 cm had similar butterfly species richness and abundance to plots cut to 5 cm (3968).",

Additional reported benefits include reduced soil loss and runoff in several trials that included European sites (with mixed results overall) (906), higher soil organic carbon under no‑till or reduced tillage in studies that included Europe—with one randomized, replicated trial in Spain finding the opposite—and maintained or increased soil organic matter, improved soil structure, and, in some studies, higher nutrient retention (906). Reported drawbacks or limitations include cases of negative, no, or inconsistent effects on some invertebrates (including earthworms), weeds, mammals, and some bird species, with one study noting declining bird preferences for conservation‑tillage fields over time and mixed long‑term effects on earthworms; weed responses also varied by crop type (126, 211). Soil physical responses were mixed: some replicated trials (including in Europe) found higher compaction under reduced tillage, and trials from Europe and India found greater soil cracking reduction, higher infiltration, and higher soil water content with conventional ploughing and sub‑soiling than with reduced tillage; no‑till increased soil loss where crop cover was absent (906).

Additional syntheses report that some species occur at higher densities or use set‑aside more than other habitats while some occur at lower densities; species richness was often higher on set‑aside than crops; waders and skylarks had higher productivity in three of four studies, though one found lower skylark productivity on set‑aside; naturally regenerated set‑aside tended to hold more birds and species than sown set‑aside; evidence on rotational vs non‑rotational set‑aside was mixed (175). For mammals, set‑aside did not increase small mammal or brown hare numbers relative to cropland or other non‑crop habitats, though wood mice used uncut set‑aside more after harvest (2377). For butterflies and moths, several studies found higher species richness and, in some cases, higher abundance on sown or naturally regenerating set‑aside versus cereal fields—especially with less competitive grasses—though other studies found similar richness or abundance to arable, pasture, or uncultivated habitats (3980). Conversion/reversion of arable to permanent grassland: Syntheses of multiple replicated studies found no clear benefits to birds, with one controlled before‑and‑after UK study reporting significant declines in grey partridge after reversion (561; 210). For butterflies and moths, 10 studies show restored grasslands can develop communities increasingly similar to high‑quality grasslands over the first decade; species richness was often higher than on conventional grassland or cultivated farms; abundance was sometimes higher than on conventional grassland or crop fields, though not always increasing with time since restoration; sowing with diverse mixes or with forbs/perennial mixes often increased richness or abundance compared with grass‑only mixes; some taxa increased while others decreased following schemes including grassland reversion (3929).",

On agricultural land, three trials (India, Germany, USA) showed occupied solitary bee nests could double over three years, while parasitism and mortality in boxes were documented across 11 trials with variable rates (47). There is no direct evidence on the effects of introducing pre-stocked solitary-bee nest boxes on farmland wildlife (81). For birds in European agricultural habitats, studies from Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK reported occupancy of nest boxes by multiple species (including kestrel, long-eared owl, starling, tits, tree sparrow, stock dove, jackdaw, wryneck and hoopoe), increases in Eurasian kestrel clutches and breeding tree sparrows after provision, and relationships of success with habitat (more pasture) and with box height (higher boxes having higher occupancy, eggs and hatched young) (155). For European rollers in Spain, use of nest boxes increased over time and varied by habitat; success did not differ between new and old boxes, though older boxes saw earlier laying (494). For falcons, studies from Europe and elsewhere reported that local populations increased after nest-site installation in some cases, with high or equal-to-natural productivity often recorded, though other studies found lower productivity or non-use, and use and productivity could vary with box design and position (489). For owls, UK and European studies reported apparent local population increases following artificial nest installation and high or equal-to-natural breeding success in several cases, though other controlled studies found lower productivity, species interactions affecting success, or lower juvenile survival from artificial nests; use was at least as frequent as natural sites in some studies and varied with design and position in others (490).",
