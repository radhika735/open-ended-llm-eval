Cleared patches had higher butterfly species richness than unmanaged or closed-canopy areas, but lower moth richness; larger clearings supported higher butterfly richness and abundance than undisturbed forest, and wider rides had lower macro-moth abundance than standard-width rides or mature forest; butterfly richness and abundance sometimes declined over the first three years post-clearance, and some species’ abundance peaked 2–4 years after clearance (3938). Thinning (often alongside prescribed burning, mulching, or nearby felling) increased butterfly richness and abundance within 1–4 years compared to unmanaged woodland or before management, while a thinned forest had similar fruit-feeding butterfly richness and abundance to an unmanaged regenerating forest, and partially cleared plots showed higher butterfly but lower moth richness than closed-canopy plots (3940). Coppiced woodland supported different moth and butterfly communities than mature forest; butterfly richness and abundance were higher in coppiced than unmanaged woodland and tended to be greater in more recently coppiced stands (e.g., 2–7 or 12–15 years since cutting) than in older (>15 years) stands; macro-moths had lower richness and abundance in coppiced than in mature forest and did not vary consistently with coppice age (3939).",
