      "relevant_summary": "Across multiple European countries, reduced or non-inversion tillage has been associated with: increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms; greater abundance of some non-earthworm invertebrates; more weeds and/or weed species; higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying, shorter foraging distances; and greater abundance of some birds (including skylark, seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds) in late winter; a review also reported that no-till systems had more invertebrate bird food resources (all from Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Switzerland and the UK) [126]. Other documented outcomes include more soil microbes, more earthworm species, and higher microbial activity under reduced tillage in some trials, with other trials finding mixed or no effects on microbes, earthworms or other soil fauna [906]. Soil outcomes reported include reduced compaction and runoff under controlled traffic and reduced tillage in some studies, but higher compaction under reduced tillage in others [906]; reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage in several trials, but increased soil loss under no-till when there was no crop cover [906]; generally higher soil organic carbon under no/reduced tillage across many studies, alongside a randomized replicated trial from Spain finding greater soil organic carbon under conventional tillage and another trial finding no effect [906]; maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure, and higher nutrient retention in several studies, with mixed effects on soil nitrogen and one trial reporting less carbon and nitrate in no-till soil though conventionally tilled soil lost more of both [906]. Reported harms or neutral effects include negative, no, or inconsistent effects on some invertebrates (including earthworms), plant seed species numbers, some weed species, mammals, and some birds; one study found bird preferences for conservation tillage fields decreased over time; long-term earthworm responses were mixed across two 10-year studies; weed responses varied by crop type [126]. Yield effects reported include no yield difference in a randomized, replicated study from Portugal, while other non-European trials reported both lower and higher yields under different conditions [906].",
