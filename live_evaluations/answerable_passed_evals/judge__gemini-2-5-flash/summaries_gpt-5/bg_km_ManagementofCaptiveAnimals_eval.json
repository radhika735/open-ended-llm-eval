Presenting food frozen in ice decreased abnormal/stereotypic behaviours and increased activity in bears and felids (1923). Hiding food around enclosures decreased stereotypical pacing in leopard cats and a black bear, and increased exploring/foraging (1915). Providing bones, hides or partial carcasses decreased stereotypic behaviours in lions and tigers (and Arctic foxes) and increased activity/manipulation time in felids (1902). Presenting food inside objects (e.g., Boomer balls) decreased stereotypic behaviours and increased exploratory/foraging in sloth and spectacled bears, though one case reported decreased exploring/foraging in a sloth bear (1924). Devices that simulate live prey had mixed effects: pacing decreased and walking increased in cougars, but pacing initially increased in tigers when a carcass was provided on a bungee (1927). Providing live vertebrate prey increased hunting and reduced sleeping in a fishing cat, but did not change stereotypical behaviours in tigers (1925). Allocating fast days was associated with more frequent pacing on non-feeding days in large felids (1906).",

Two replicated before‑and‑after studies in Germany and Austria found that simulating wet and dry seasons (and, in Austria, moving animals to an enclosure with more egg‑laying sites and flowing water) stimulated breeding and egg deposition; in Germany, no toadlets survived past 142 days [1872]. A review and replicated studies reported that reproductive success in captivity depended on temperature or a simulated wet and dry season in some cases [835]. No evidence was captured on using sound recordings of rain and/or thunderstorms to simulate rainfall [1867]. No evidence was captured for allowing temperate species to hibernate [1868], for providing dormancy during simulated drought in highly seasonal species [1869], or for varying water flow/speed for torrent‑breeding species [1870].
