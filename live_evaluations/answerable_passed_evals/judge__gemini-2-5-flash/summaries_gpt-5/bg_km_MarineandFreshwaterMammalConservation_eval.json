On fishing gear, six studies focused on humanâ€“wildlife conflict reported that five found reduced damage to fish catches and/or nets caused by common bottlenose dolphins and seals, while one found no reduction in damage to swordfish catches by California sea lions [2808]. The evidence base is larger overall for fishing gear (33 studies total on marine mammals, with six addressing conflict outcomes) than for aquaculture systems (six studies total), with mixed outcomes in both contexts [2808, 2775].",
