Soil structure and nutrient retention improved under cover crops in randomized, replicated studies, with increases in soil carbon and, in several studies, increased nitrogen and carbon; some European studies found no marked change in soil organic matter (898). For crop production, replicated, controlled studies from Spain, Italy, France, and Israel reported lower yields in some comparisons, higher yields in some comparisons, inconsistent differences in others, and no differences in several cases; crop quality was often unchanged (1351).

Increased water-stable soil aggregates are a known mechanism for enhancing soil structure and reducing its susceptibility to erosion.
