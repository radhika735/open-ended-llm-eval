Seed-eating birds were more abundant on uncut and ungrazed plots than on uncut and grazed plots (224). A replicated, controlled, randomized UK study found no difference in ground beetle abundance and diversity between cut and uncut headlands in the first two years, but higher species diversity in uncut plots in the third year; no studies were found assessing effects on mammals (132, 2400). Raising mowing/cutting height: A replicated, controlled study and a review from the UK found raised mowing heights benefited Eurasian skylark, including increased productivity, and a review reported raised cutting heights were less damaging to amphibians and invertebrates (138). However, a randomized, replicated, controlled UK trial found no effect of raised mowing height on numbers of foraging birds or invertebrates, and one replicated controlled study found no difference in invertebrate abundance (138). A UK review found raised mowing height may have increased skylark productivity but not enough to maintain the local population (222). On intensively managed UK grassland, plots cut to 10 cm had similar butterfly species richness and abundance to plots cut to 5 cm (3968).",

Additional reported benefits include reduced soil loss and runoff in several trials that included European sites (with mixed results overall) (906), higher soil organic carbon under no‑till or reduced tillage in studies that included Europe—with one randomized, replicated trial in Spain finding the opposite—and maintained or increased soil organic matter, improved soil structure, and, in some studies, higher nutrient retention (906). Reported drawbacks or limitations include cases of negative, no, or inconsistent effects on some invertebrates (including earthworms), weeds, mammals, and some bird species, with one study noting declining bird preferences for conservation‑tillage fields over time and mixed long‑term effects on earthworms; weed responses also varied by crop type (126, 211). Soil physical responses were mixed: some replicated trials (including in Europe) found higher compaction under reduced tillage, and trials from Europe and India found greater soil cracking reduction, higher infiltration, and higher soil water content with conventional ploughing and sub‑soiling than with reduced tillage; no‑till increased soil loss where crop cover was absent (906).
