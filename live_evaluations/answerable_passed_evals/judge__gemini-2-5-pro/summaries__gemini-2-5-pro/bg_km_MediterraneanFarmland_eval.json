One study indicated that permanent ground cover is more effective than temporary cover (1367), and another found that incorporating cover crops into the soil increases organic matter (1367). Additionally, using organic fertilizer instead of inorganic fertilizer can lead to an increase in soil organic matter, as demonstrated by eight replicated studies in Mediterranean countries (1366). A study in Italy found that compost was more effective than manure for increasing organic matter (1366).",
