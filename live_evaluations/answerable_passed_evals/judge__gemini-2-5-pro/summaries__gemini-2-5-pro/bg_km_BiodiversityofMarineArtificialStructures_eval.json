One study on long flexible habitats noted an alteration in the composition of the non-mobile invertebrate community [3451], while two studies on short flexible habitats (1–50 mm) found mixed effects on the composition of both mobile and non-mobile invertebrate communities [3450]. Furthermore, one study indicated that short flexible habitats did not lead to an increase in the species richness of mobile or non-mobile invertebrates [3450].\n\nIn terms of population abundance, three studies on short flexible habitats showed mixed effects on the abundance of mobile and non-mobile invertebrates [3450]. Similarly, two out of three studies on long flexible habitats reported mixed effects on the abundance of these invertebrates [3451]. However, one study on long habitats found that they supported a higher combined biomass of macroalgae and invertebrates, primarily mussels, compared to structure surfaces without such habitats [3451]. For fish populations, two studies on long habitats revealed mixed effects on the abundance of fish and seahorses [3451]. A single study on short habitats also noted mixed effects on seahorse abundance [3450]. Finally, one study reported that seahorses used the long flexible habitats created on subtidal artificial structures [3451].",
