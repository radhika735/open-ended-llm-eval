                "reasoning": "This statement is relevant because it discusses the effectiveness of both a physical method (covering with carpet, which functions as a lightproof barrier) and a chemical method (the herbicide glyphosate) for controlling Crassula helmsii. The question explicitly asks for a comparison between these two types of methods. While this statement describes a combined treatment rather than a direct comparison, it provides a quantitative measure of effectiveness (80% kill rate) involving both categories of control mentioned in the question, making it directly pertinent to the inquiry.",

The question asks for a comparison between the effectiveness of chemical and physical methods. This statement, by highlighting a lack of evidence for a major category of a physical method, is crucial for the comparison. It indicates that for this type of control, there is no data to compare against the effectiveness of chemical methods, which is a key part of the answer.",

The question requires a comparison of physical versus chemical control methods for Crassula helmsii. By stating that there is no evidence for the effectiveness of dredging, the statement directly informs the requested comparison. It points to a lack of data for a specific physical method, which is essential information when evaluating how physical methods in general compare to chemical ones.",
