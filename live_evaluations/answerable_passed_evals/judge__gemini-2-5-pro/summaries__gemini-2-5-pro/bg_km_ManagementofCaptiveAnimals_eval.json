Providing food on a random temporal schedule has been found to reduce the frequency of stereotypic pacing in tigers and cheetahs [1904]. This unpredictable feeding schedule also increased behavioural diversity in red foxes and alertness in a black-footed cat [1904]. However, one study found that an unpredictable feeding schedule increased territorial behaviour in coyotes but did not affect travelling or foraging [1904]. For the strategy of presenting food frozen in ice, one study found that manipulation behaviours increased in lions, while another found that manipulation behaviours decreased in grizzly bears [1923]. There is no evidence for the effects of using food as a reward in animal training on captive carnivores [1928].",
