These benefits included a greater abundance of some spiders and ground beetles (131). Three studies from the UK found no change in insect predator numbers and one replicated study from Sweden found mixed effects between different predator groups (727). One of two replicated, randomised, controlled studies from the UK and USA found more pest insects in late-cut plots and one found no effect (727). Two studies from Australia and the UK found grazing instead of cutting had mixed effects on natural enemies (885).\n\nWhen grazing was used instead of cutting, one of five studies found more pests, and two studies found effects varied between pest groups and sampling dates. Two studies found no effect on pests (885). Six studies from Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK found that delaying mowing or grazing dates on grassland had no clear effect on plant species richness, ground beetle communities, the abundance of some insects and spiders, or population trends of wading bird species (131).",
