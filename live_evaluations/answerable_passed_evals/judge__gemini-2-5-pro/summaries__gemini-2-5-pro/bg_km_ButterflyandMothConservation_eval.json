      "relevant_summary": "Ten studies evaluated the effects of coppicing on butterflies and moths, eight in the UK, one in France, and one in Germany [3939]. Fourteen studies assessed the impact of clearing or opening patches in forests on butterflies and moths, with five in the UK, two in Finland, two in Japan, one in Sweden, one in the USA, one in Canada, one in the Czech Republic, and one review across Europe [3938]. Six studies investigated the effects of thinning trees on butterflies and moths, with three in the USA and one in each of Côte d’Ivoire, Finland, and the Czech Republic [3940].\n\nThree replicated studies in the UK, Japan, and the Czech Republic found that cleared forest patches had a higher species richness of butterflies but a lower species richness of moths than unmanaged areas or closed-canopy forests [3938]. Similarly, a study in the Czech Republic showed that partially-cleared forest plots had more butterfly species but fewer moth species than closed-canopy forests [3940]. One study in the UK discovered that wider woodland rides and coppiced woodland hosted more unique macro-moth species than standard-width rides or mature forest [3938, 3939]. Another UK study found that coppiced woodland had a greater butterfly species richness than unmanaged woodland, while a separate study noted lower macro-moth species richness in coppiced woodland compared to mature forest [3939]. The species richness and diversity of fruit-feeding butterflies were similar between a thinned forest and an unmanaged one in Côte d’Ivoire, although rarer species were less common in the thinned forest [3940]. In the UK and France, moth and butterfly communities differed in coppiced woodlands of varying ages [3939].\n\nFive studies in the UK, Finland, Sweden, and Japan revealed that cleared forest patches had a higher abundance of butterflies, including species like the chequered blue, woodland brown, high brown fritillary, and small pearl-bordered fritillary, compared to unmanaged or coppiced areas [3938]. Conversely, a UK study indicated that wider rides had a lower abundance of macro-moths than standard-width rides or mature forest [3938]. Four studies in the USA and Finland found that thinned coniferous woodland, sometimes combined with other management like prescribed burning, had a higher abundance of all or specialist butterflies than unmanaged woodland [3940]. Two UK studies reported a higher abundance of butterflies in general, and the heath fritillary in particular, in coppiced woodland versus unmanaged woodland [3939]. However, another UK study observed lower macro-moth abundance in coppiced woodland compared to mature forest, with no change based on the age of the coppice [3939]. The timing of management is also a factor, with one UK study showing that patches cleared 2–4 years prior had a greater abundance of heath fritillary than patches cleared 7–11 years ago or within the first year of clearance [3938]. Similarly, studies in the UK, France, and Germany found butterfly abundance to be higher in woodland coppiced 2, 2–4, 5–7, or 12–15 years ago than in areas coppiced 5–11 or more than 15 years ago [3939]. A review across Europe reported that clearing small forest patches benefited 19 out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern [3938]. Finally, a UK study reported an increase in breeding sites for the pearl-bordered fritillary and Duke of Burgundy in cleared forest patches that were also managed with cutting, grazing, and ride widening [3938].",
