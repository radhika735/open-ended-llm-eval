      "relevant_summary": "Uncropped field margins can be managed in several ways to support bumblebees on European farmland. Sowing margins with an agricultural nectar and pollen mix has been shown to attract more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated, grassy, or cropped margins [18]. In the first year, a mix of agricultural forage plants, including legumes, can attract a higher number of bumblebees than a perennial wildflower mix [18]. However, these margins may need to be re-sown every few years as their value to bumblebees degrades over time [18]. Sowing margins with a native wildflower seed mix also supports a higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees compared to cropped, grassy, or naturally regenerated margins [19]. Perennial leguminous herbs within these seed mixes are particularly important for long-tongued bumblebee species [19]. Leaving field margins to regenerate naturally can result in more bumblebees than cropped margins, but the value of this approach is not consistent from year to year and is dependent on thistle species, which are often considered weeds [20]. There is no evidence on the effects of these management practices on solitary bees [18, 19, 20].",

Context 20 states, 'Two trials found that the value of naturally regenerated uncropped field margins for bees was not consistent from year to year.'
