Cutting alone reduced bracken cover or biomass in some UK studies, showed mixed effects in a paired study, and did not reduce bracken in one controlled study; it did not increase heather cover or seedling abundance in two UK studies; species responses varied, with one study reporting increased heathland plant species richness and another reporting no change in richness but increased diversity; cover of wavy hair-grass and sheep’s fescue increased, while gorse and common cow-wheat did not increase [1653]. Combining cutting with herbicide reduced bracken biomass or cover; one UK study reported no change in heather biomass, another UK study found no significant effect on the cover of seven plant species, and a replicated UK study found higher plant species richness when cutting was followed by herbicide compared to the reverse sequence [1654].",
