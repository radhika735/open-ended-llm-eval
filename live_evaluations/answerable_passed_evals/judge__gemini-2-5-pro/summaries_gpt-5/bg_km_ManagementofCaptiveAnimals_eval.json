Presenting food frozen in ice decreased abnormal/stereotypic behaviours and increased activity in bears and felids (1923). Hiding food around enclosures decreased stereotypical pacing in leopard cats and a black bear, and increased exploring/foraging (1915). Providing bones, hides or partial carcasses decreased stereotypic behaviours in lions and tigers (and Arctic foxes) and increased activity/manipulation time in felids (1902). Presenting food inside objects (e.g., Boomer balls) decreased stereotypic behaviours and increased exploratory/foraging in sloth and spectacled bears, though one case reported decreased exploring/foraging in a sloth bear (1924). Devices that simulate live prey had mixed effects: pacing decreased and walking increased in cougars, but pacing initially increased in tigers when a carcass was provided on a bungee (1927). Providing live vertebrate prey increased hunting and reduced sleeping in a fishing cat, but did not change stereotypical behaviours in tigers (1925). Allocating fast days was associated with more frequent pacing on non-feeding days in large felids (1906).",
