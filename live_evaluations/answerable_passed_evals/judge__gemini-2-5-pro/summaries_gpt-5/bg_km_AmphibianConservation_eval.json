Installing culverts or tunnels as road crossings reduced amphibian road deaths in six of seven studies (in one case only when barrier fencing was also installed), with many studies reporting amphibians used the structures; use and effectiveness were influenced by design factors such as diameter, length, lighting, substrate, water presence, entrance location and tunnel climate, and some designs (e.g., one-way vertical chutes) caused high mortality, with one study still reporting thousands killed [884]. Using humans to assist migrating amphibians moved large numbers across roads, but studies reported 64–70% population declines over 6–10 years and over 500 toads still killed at 7% of sites [784]. Installing barrier fencing along roads, especially with culverts, decreased road deaths in seven of eight studies; at least 0.6 m height was required to prevent some frog species climbing over, though some species still climbed fences [756]. Modifying gully pots and kerbs by moving gully pots 10 cm from the kerb reduced great crested newts falling in by 80% [782].",
