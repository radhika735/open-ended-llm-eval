This statement is critically relevant because it directly addresses the \"bright light\" component of the question. By stating a lack of evidence for the effectiveness of a bright light-based method, it provides the necessary information to make a comparative assessment. The comparison of effectiveness between two methods depends on the evidence available for both.
