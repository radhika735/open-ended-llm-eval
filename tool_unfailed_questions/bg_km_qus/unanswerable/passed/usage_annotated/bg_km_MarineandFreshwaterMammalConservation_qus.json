The documents evaluate the effectiveness of conservation actions based on biological outcomes for mammal populations (e.g., survival, abundance, behavior), but they do not contain any data regarding the financial costs or economic efficiency of implementing these actions. Therefore, a comparison of cost-effectiveness is not possible.",
