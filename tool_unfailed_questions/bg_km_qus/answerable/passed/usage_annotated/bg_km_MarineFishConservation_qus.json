    "question": "How does the effectiveness of no-take marine protected areas on fish communities differ between the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean?",
    "answer": "In both the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean, studies show that prohibiting all fishing in marine protected areas can lead to different fish community compositions, as well as higher species richness and abundance compared to fished areas [2682]. Specific studies have highlighted different ecological effects; for instance, a Mediterranean study noted more fish eggs inside a reserve, while an Indian Ocean study found higher fish grazing rates, indicating positive outcomes in both regions [2682]. However, the evidence also shows some variability, as one study in the Indian Ocean found that the measured effect on species richness could differ depending on the sampling method used [2682].",
