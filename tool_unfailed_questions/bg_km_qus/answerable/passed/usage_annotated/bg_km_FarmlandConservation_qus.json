    "question": "For managing heather moorland in the UK, what is the comparative evidence for the effectiveness of swiping versus controlled burning on plant diversity?",
    "answer": "Based on studies in Northern Ireland, both swiping (flailing to simulate burning) and controlled burning can increase plant species richness compared to unmanaged plots. A replicated controlled trial found that heather moorland subjected to a single burn had more plant species eight years later than unburned plots (152). A similar trial found that flailed plots also had more plant species than unflailed controls, but fewer than burned plots (151).",

Fourteen studies found that organic fertilizers supported higher plant diversity, cover, or species richness, and increased the abundance, diversity, or biomass of earthworms and other invertebrates (134). However, the effect is not always positive; one trial found no effect on certain weed species, and another study noted that heavy slurry applications can be toxic to earthworms (134).",

Eleven studies from Europe found that undersowing increased the abundance of barnacle geese, densities of skylarks and dunnocks, and boosted the abundance and/or species richness of arthropods, including bumblebees, butterflies, spiders, and earthworms (136). While this is an alternative to conventional tillage, the direct wildlife impacts of reducing tillage itself are varied, with some studies showing benefits for earthworms and seed-eating birds, and others showing no or negative effects (126).",

The benefits, reported in seventeen studies, include increased species richness of plants and invertebrates like bumblebees and spiders, as well as increased breeding population size for stone curlews and hatching success for northern lapwings (562). On the other hand, some drawbacks have been noted. Two studies found no effect on most farmland bird species or ground beetles. One study found fewer seed-eating birds on these plots in some regions, and another review noted that pernicious weeds were more common on these margins. Additionally, a negative association was found with the proportion of young grey partridges in the population (562).",

The physical placement of the box is important; one replicated study in Sweden found that nest boxes positioned higher above the ground had higher occupancy rates, more eggs, and more hatched young (155). The surrounding habitat also plays a role, with the same study finding that nest success was related to the amount of available pasture (155). Furthermore, the type of nesting structure can impact survival after fledging. A Hungarian study found that juvenile barn owls that fledged from nest boxes were significantly less likely to be recovered alive than those reared in church towers (154).",

For wet meadow restoration, some studies found positive effects on plant communities within five years of implementing techniques like topsoil removal or introducing target species (119). Similarly, when restoring species-rich grasslands, studies have documented positive signs in less than five years, with more substantial changes often occurring within a decade (133). However, the evidence also indicates that restoration can be a very slow process, with some studies finding that restored grasslands still differ from ancient species-rich sites even after 20 to 60 years (119, 133).",

    "question": "For improving invertebrate biodiversity in UK grasslands, what is the comparative evidence between reducing management intensity versus restoring species-rich semi-natural grassland?",
    "answer": "Both reducing management intensity and actively restoring species-rich semi-natural grassland show benefits for invertebrates. Reducing management intensity on permanent grasslands, which includes lowering chemical inputs and delaying mowing, has been found in multiple studies to benefit some or all invertebrate groups studied (69). Similarly, restoring species-rich grassland has been shown to result in higher ground beetle abundance and increased pollinating insect density and diversity compared to other grassland types (133). However, some studies for both interventions reported mixed or no effects for certain invertebrate groups, indicating that outcomes can be variable (69, 133).",

    "question": "In the Netherlands, what are the most effective management strategies for increasing wading bird populations on wet grasslands?",
    "answer": "Several management strategies in the Netherlands aim to benefit wading birds. 'Mosaic management', which coordinates delayed and staggered mowing across farms, was found to change northern lapwing population trends from decreases to increases and improve black-tailed godwit productivity (130). Direct payments per clutch for farmland birds led to higher hatching success for northern lapwing and black-tailed godwit, though evidence for overall population increases was limited (146). More generally, raising water levels in ditches or grassland has been associated with increased numbers of breeding birds (121). Maintaining traditional water meadows has been shown to increase populations of northern lapwing and black-tailed godwit, though some studies noted pre-existing differences in bird numbers or low productivity (696).",

    "question": "What are the documented benefits and limitations of creating uncropped plots in arable fields for wildlife?",
    "answer": "Creating uncropped plots provides documented benefits, particularly for birds and arable plants. Smaller 'skylark plots' have been shown to increase skylark population size, breeding density, and success, as well as benefiting some plants and invertebrates (540). Larger cultivated, uncropped plots, sometimes called 'lapwing plots', provide habitat for nesting northern lapwing, Eurasian skylark, and grey partridge, and can increase the establishment and abundance of rare arable plants (562). However, there are limitations. Some studies found no significant benefit of skylark plots for certain invertebrates or seed-eating songbirds (540). Similarly, uncropped cultivated plots were found to have no effect on many farmland bird species in one study, and pernicious weeds were more common in these areas in another (562).",
