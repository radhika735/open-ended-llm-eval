    "question": "What evidence exists for the landscape-scale effects of bee conservation interventions, beyond the immediate site of action?",
    "answer": "There is limited and mixed evidence for the landscape-scale effects of bee conservation actions. One large trial found a positive landscape-scale effect, showing that the abundance of long-tongued bumblebees was correlated with the number of nectar and pollen agri-environment agreements across a 10 km grid square (21). In contrast, another trial found that bee numbers and species richness were not higher in farmland 50-1,500 m away from planted flower patches (17). Furthermore, two UK trials found that bumblebee populations were not enhanced at the farm scale by the presence of agri-environment schemes (24).",

    "question": "What unintended negative consequences or limitations have been identified when providing artificial nest boxes for bees?",
    "answer": "Several limitations and negative consequences have been documented for artificial nest boxes. For solitary bees, high rates of mortality from parasites and predators are a key issue, with rates as high as 56% recorded in one study (47). Certain nest designs, like those with plastic linings, can increase susceptibility to parasitism or mould (47). Nest boxes can also be colonized by non-native species, such as European earwigs and introduced leafcutter bees, sometimes more commonly than by native bees (47). For bumblebees reintroduced in nest boxes, social parasitism by cuckoo bees can be very high, reaching 79% in one trial (52).",

    "question": "What is the most effective design for an artificial nest box intended for bumblebees?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests that nest boxes entirely buried 5-10 cm underground with a 30-80 cm long entrance pipe are generally the most effective design for bumblebees. Seven trials testing this design found occupancy rates between 6% and 58%. In contrast, wooden surface or above-ground boxes, which are commonly marketed, appear less effective, with several trials showing very low occupancy rates (0-2.5%), and studies that directly compared designs found underground boxes were more readily occupied (48).",

    "question": "What are the documented effects on wild bees of introducing agri-environment schemes on European farmland?",
    "answer": "The evidence for the effectiveness of agri-environment schemes in Europe is mixed. Four replicated trials showed enhanced diversity and/or abundance of foraging wild bees on land under schemes such as the Swiss Ecological Compensation Areas (24). However, four other replicated trials found that bee numbers or species were not enhanced by schemes such as meadow bird agreements in the Netherlands or 6m wide grass strips in England (24). On a wider landscape scale, two UK trials found bumblebee populations were not enhanced on farmland managed under these schemes (24). One trial showed that hedges managed under a Scottish scheme did not attract more queen bumblebees than conventional hedges (15).",

    "question": "How does sowing agricultural forage plants on field margins compare to sowing native wildflower mixes in terms of benefits for bumblebees?",
    "answer": "Direct comparisons suggest that mixes of agricultural forage plants, including legumes, attract greater numbers of bumblebees than a perennial wildflower mix, at least in the first year (18). However, one small trial showed that long-tongued bumblebee species strongly preferred plots with a perennial wildflower seed mix over an annual forage plant mix (19). Furthermore, the value of margins sown with agricultural legumes may degrade over a few years, requiring re-sowing (18).",

    "question": "What factors, such as diet and social parasitism, have been shown to affect the success of captive-rearing and reintroducing bumblebee colonies?",
    "answer": "Several factors influence success. For captive rearing, the pollen diet is important; one trial showed that buff-tailed bumblebees fed freshly frozen pollen produced larger, more successful queens than those fed dried pollen, and other trials showed pollen with higher protein content led to more offspring (50). Upon reintroduction to the wild, social parasitism by cuckoo bees can be a major issue, with rates as high as 79% in one UK trial. This trial suggested parasitism could be reduced by placing colonies in landscapes with intermediate resource availability later in the season (52).",
