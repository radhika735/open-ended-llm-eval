    "question": "What are the observed effects of using chemical or plant-based attractants to enhance natural enemy populations?",
    "answer": "Growing non-crop plants that produce attractive chemicals has been found to increase the numbers of natural enemies, leading to a decrease in pests and an increase in crop yield (724). Using manufactured attractive chemicals has also been found to increase natural enemy populations and parasitism rates, but the evidence is mixed, with some studies showing variable effects between enemy groups or finding no effect on pests (754).",

    "question": "When altering the timing of chemical applications for pest control, what are the comparative effects of delaying herbicide use versus changing insecticide timing?",
    "answer": "Delaying herbicide application has been shown to increase the number of natural enemies and weeds, but the effects on pests and yield are mixed, with one study finding lower yields and another no effect (774). Similarly, altering the timing of insecticide use has shown mixed effects on yield, but one study reported more natural enemies when sprays were applied earlier, and two of four studies found fewer pests or less disease damage with earlier applications (723).",

    "question": "What are the documented financial impacts, in terms of profit and costs, of implementing various natural pest control strategies?",
    "answer": "The financial impacts vary. Push-pull systems were found to have greater economic benefits (753), while one study on alley cropping found lower costs but also lower profit (718). Organic farming was found to increase net profit only if produce received a premium (717). For specific practices, altering insecticide timing led to higher profits in one study (723), and threshold-based spraying resulted in similar profits to conventional regimes (750). Amending soils with certain plant remains increased profit compared to unweeded controls, but not weeded controls (728).",

    "question": "What actions are available to control weeds specifically in pasture or grassland systems?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests a couple of main actions. Two studies found that using mixed pasture, which involves growing multiple forage species together, reduced weeds compared to a monoculture (721). Another effective approach is to plant species that actively compete with damaging weeds; all nine studies on this action found that it reduced weed weight or ground cover (722).",
