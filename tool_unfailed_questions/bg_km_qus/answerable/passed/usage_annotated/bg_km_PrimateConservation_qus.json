    "answer": "There is currently no evidence base for the effects of actions aimed at mitigating the impacts of the mining industry on primate populations. No studies were found that directly and quantitatively tested the effects of minimizing ground vibrations from open cast mining (1451), establishing no-mining zones near watersheds (1452), using 'set-aside' areas of natural habitat within mining areas (1453), or certifying mines as ‘primate friendly’ (1454).",

    "question": "What are the most effective actions for improving habitat connectivity for primates in fragmented agricultural and urban landscapes?",
    "answer": "The most effective actions for improving primate habitat connectivity are installing rope or pole bridges and creating or protecting habitat corridors, both of which are rated as likely to be beneficial. Multiple studies have documented arboreal primates using rope and pole bridges to cross roads, with one study linking their construction to a population increase (1457). Similarly, one study found that protecting a forest corridor contributed to a significant increase in black howler monkey numbers (1580). In contrast, no evidence was found to assess the effectiveness of using fences as biological corridors (1426) or installing green bridges (overpasses) for primates (1456).",

    "question": "Following captive breeding and reintroduction, over what timeframes have primate survival and population changes been documented?",
    "answer": "Documented timeframes for outcomes of captive breeding and reintroduction vary widely. Short-term survival has been monitored, for example, for reintroduced black lion tamarins (four months, 1596) and western lowland gorillas (nine months to four years, 1595). Longer-term outcomes show mixed success. For instance, most reintroduced golden lion tamarins born and reared in cages did not survive over a seven-year period (1594), and reintroduced black-and-white ruffed lemurs with limited free-ranging experience died out over five years (1595). Other reintroduction studies show population persistence for at least four years (1590) and population increases over 25 years (1590).",

Providing training to patrols has an 'unknown effectiveness' rating, but studies have similarly found that it resulted in no gorillas being killed, an increase in immature gorillas and hoolock gibbons, and a stop to primate poaching incidents in a specific area (1477).",
