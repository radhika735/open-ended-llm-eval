    "question": "How does managing semi-natural open habitats with rough grazing compare to using prescribed fire for butterfly and moth populations?",
    "answer": "Both management techniques show mixed results. Rough grazing in habitats like saltmarsh, dunes, and fens sometimes led to higher species richness or abundance of moths and certain butterflies compared to unmanaged or heavily grazed areas, but other studies found similar or lower abundance (3944). Similarly, prescribed fire in open habitats like prairies and heathland led to higher abundance of some species (e.g., heath fritillary) but lower abundance of others (e.g., regal fritillary), with some studies finding no difference in species richness compared to unburned areas (3882).",

    "answer": "Reducing management intensity in perennial crops generally benefits butterflies and moths. Shade-grown coffee plantations supported higher caterpillar abundance and species richness than sun-grown monocultures (3931). In vineyards, encouraging native plants and reducing chemical use increased butterfly abundance, and grass strips between vines had greater butterfly species richness (3919). For orchards, unmanaged or partially managed traditional orchards had greater species richness of leaf-eating arthropods (including caterpillars) than commercially managed ones, though one study found managed orchards had lower butterfly abundance than abandoned ones (3917).",

The success of release programs is also mixed. Some released populations have persisted for over 25 years and increased in abundance, particularly when habitat is managed, while others have died out or required supplementary releases to survive (3914).

Managing existing hedgerows also provides benefits.

A potential benefit is an increased abundance of certain species; some studies found that grasslands abandoned for 1-25 years had a higher abundance of some butterflies and moths than grazed or mown grasslands (3956, 3957). However, negative consequences are also well-documented, including a long-term decline in species richness, a shift in community composition towards generalist or woodland species, and the local extinction of specialist grassland species like the large blue and silver-studded blue (3956, 3957).",

Following clearing or thinning, butterfly abundance and richness can increase within 1-4 years (3940, 3938). However, the optimal conditions may be short-lived, with butterfly abundance in cleared patches peaking 2-4 years post-management and declining thereafter (3938). Similarly, coppiced woodlands show higher butterfly abundance 2-7 years after cutting compared to older coppice (>15 years) (3939). Longer-term forest restoration can take much longer; one study found a restored forest's butterfly community only resembled that of a remnant forest after 54 years (3936).",

However, clearing patches in forests was also found to increase butterfly species richness and abundance compared to unmanaged or even coppiced areas, although moth richness could be lower (3938).

However, other attempts have failed, with populations dying out within a few years or requiring continuous releases to be sustained (3909, 3914). A review across the UK and Ireland found that while 25% of reintroduction projects survived for at least three years, 38% died out in that time, and only a small minority were known to have survived for over 10 years (3909, 3914).",
