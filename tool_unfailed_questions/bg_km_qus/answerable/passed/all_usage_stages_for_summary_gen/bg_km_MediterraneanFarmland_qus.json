    "question": "Besides adding amendments like compost or manure, what other management practices can improve soil aggregation and stability on Mediterranean farmland?",
    "answer": "Several non-amendment practices can improve soil structure. Growing cover crops in arable fields or maintaining ground cover in orchards and vineyards was found to increase water-stable soil aggregates [1345, 1367]. Using no-tillage systems was also found to result in more stable soils in the majority of studies [1369]. Adding manure was also found to improve soil stability [1363]. The evidence for crop rotations is inconsistent, with different studies finding positive, negative, and no effects on soil stability [1368].",

    "answer": "There is a trade-off between benefits and harms. The main benefit is an increase in natural enemies, with four studies finding more beneficial predators or parasitoids in plots with ground cover [1395]. However, this did not always translate to better pest control; one study found more pest damage to grapes, and results for leafhopper numbers were inconsistent. There were also mixed results for weed suppression, with one study finding fewer weeds and another finding more [1395]. This intervention can also negatively impact crop yield, with some studies finding lower grape or avocado yields [1352].",
