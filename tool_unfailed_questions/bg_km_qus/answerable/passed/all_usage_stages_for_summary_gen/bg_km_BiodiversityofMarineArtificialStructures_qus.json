    "question": "What are the effects of creating flexible habitats on the biodiversity of intertidal artificial structures?",
    "answer": "The evidence suggests creating flexible habitats on intertidal structures alters community composition. Creating short flexible habitats (1-50 mm) was found in one Australian study to alter the macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate community, but decrease overall species richness at low tide (3459). A study in the Netherlands on long flexible habitats (>50 mm) also found they altered the macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate community composition and supported species absent from structure surfaces without them (3460).",

    "question": "How do the biodiversity outcomes of creating 'rock pools' on intertidal artificial structures vary by location?",
    "answer": "Studies from multiple locations show that creating 'rock pools' generally supports species absent from other structure surfaces. In Australia, the UK, Spain, and Malaysia, studies found that rock pools supported species of macroalgae, invertebrates, and/or fish that were absent from surfaces without pools (3476). These studies also consistently found higher species diversity or richness in the created pools. However, context is important; a study in Ireland found that wave-sheltered pools filled with sediment within two years, impacting the community composition. In Australia, the effect on community composition depended on pool depth, shore level, and site (3476).",

    "answer": "Evidence for both creating short (1–50 mm) and long (>50 mm) flexible habitats on subtidal structures shows mixed results for biodiversity. Studies on short flexible habitats in Australia and France found mixed effects on invertebrate community composition and abundance, with one study finding no increase in species richness (3450). Studies on long flexible habitats in Australia and the Netherlands found they could support species absent from other surfaces and alter invertebrate community composition. However, they also had mixed effects on fish richness and the abundance of invertebrates and fish (3451).",

Creating pit habitats (1-50 mm) also increased species richness in eight of twelve studies (3475). Additionally, creating small protrusions (1-50 mm) (3462) and creating grooves along with small protrusions, ridges or ledges (3474) increased species richness in multiple studies.

Creating 'rock pools' (3476) and hole habitats (3467) successfully increased species richness and supported species not found on unmodified surfaces.

In contrast, creating short flexible habitats altered community composition but was found to decrease richness at low tide in one study (3459), and creating grooves did not increase richness (3473).

Creating large protrusions (>50 mm) (3463) and large ridges or ledges (>50 mm) (3465) on intertidal structures was found to increase the abundance of limpets and/or mussels. Conversely, one study on small ridges or ledges (1–50 mm) found they supported lower mobile invertebrate abundance than the grooves created between them (3464). When small protrusions, ridges, or ledges were created in combination with grooves, studies found mixed effects on the abundance of various invertebrates, with outcomes dependent on factors like habitat size, shore level, and location (3474).

Using environmentally-sensitive materials, often with added habitat features, altered community composition in six of eleven studies (3470).
