    "question": "What are the documented benefits and trade-offs of using traditional management practices like mowing or grazing to maintain biodiversity in fen meadows?",
    "answer": "Cutting/mowing to restore disturbance (1759) is 'Likely to be beneficial'. Studies report it can alter plant communities, increase fen-characteristic plants and moss cover, and boost overall plant richness. However, using grazing to restore disturbance (1762) has a 'Trade off between benefit and harms'. While some studies show grazing can increase cover of some herbs and reduce shrubs, others report it can reduce Sphagnum moss cover and may result in fewer plant species compared to mowing.",

Studies, mostly in fens, report this can alter plant communities, increase cover of wetland-characteristic plants like rushes and sedges, and increase overall plant species richness. Mechanically disturbing the peat surface (1811) has 'Unknown effectiveness', with two studies in fens reporting that it affected plant community development and encouraged colonization by wetland-characteristic species, but also weedy species from the seed bank.",

    "answer": "Mowing to restore disturbance in fens is likely beneficial, with studies showing it can alter plant community composition, increase moss cover, and increase species richness (1759). Cutting large trees/shrubs can also be beneficial, increasing herb cover and fen-characteristic plants (1761, 1772). Physically removing entire problematic plants, such as moss carpets, has unknown effectiveness, but one study found it increased cover of fen-characteristic plants while having mixed effects on herb cover (1768). The choice of intervention depends on whether the target is herbaceous plants, large woody plants, or other problematic species like moss carpets.",

    "question": "What are the alternatives to completely removing livestock from degraded agricultural peatlands, and how do their effects compare?",
    "answer": "The primary alternative to complete removal is to modify the grazing regime. Completely excluding livestock from degraded peatlands is likely beneficial, though many studies found no effect on key herb or moss cover (1734). An alternative with some evidence is to reduce the intensity of grazing; one study found this increased total vegetation and shrub cover (1735). Other potential alternatives, such as changing the type of livestock (1736) or changing the season of grazing (1737), have no evidence to support their effectiveness. Therefore, reducing grazing intensity is the main evidence-based alternative to complete exclusion.",

One study found that reducing harvest intensity by leaving some Sphagnum moss behind resulted in higher moss cover three years later (1744). For other strategies, no evidence was found.

    "question": "To restore a bog after peat extraction, which vegetation introduction techniques are most effective at establishing Sphagnum moss cover?",
    "answer": "Several vegetation introduction techniques are likely to be beneficial or beneficial for establishing Sphagnum moss on bogs after peat extraction. Directly planting mosses, such as Sphagnum-dominated sods, has been shown to result in high survival and increased moss cover (1818). Adding loose Sphagnum moss fragments to the surface is also beneficial, with studies reporting established Sphagnum cover ranging from negligible to over 90% (1821). Similarly, adding mixed vegetation fragments containing Sphagnum is beneficial, resulting in cover ranging from less than 1% to 73% (1822). The moss layer transfer technique, which combines spreading vegetation fragments with rewetting, reprofiling, mulching and fertilizing, is also likely to be beneficial, with one study showing it resulted in greater moss cover than an unrestored area (1804). The available evidence does not allow for a direct comparison of which method is most effective.",
