    "question": "What are the documented benefits and negative impacts of reducing or excluding livestock grazing on semi-natural farmland habitats?",
    "answer": "The impacts of reducing grazing are varied and context-dependent. Excluding livestock entirely from some semi-natural habitats has been found to benefit plants and invertebrates (150). On upland heath and moorland, reducing grazing can increase heather cover and the abundance of some plants and arthropods (647). Conversely, some studies found negative impacts, with reduced grazing intensity leading to a decrease in the abundance of soil organisms (647). One systematic review concluded that intermediate grazing levels are often optimal for plants, invertebrates, and birds on meadow pasture, highlighting that benefits for one group may require trade-offs for another (704). Another study found that northern lapwing nest survival was greater on ungrazed marshes compared to grazed ones (697).",

    "question": "In an arable landscape, what are the most beneficial actions for providing winter food for seed-eating songbirds?",
    "answer": "Several actions provide significant benefits. Leaving overwinter stubbles is a key measure, with studies showing it attracts farmland birds and positively influences their population trends (695). Planting a dedicated wild bird seed or cover mixture is also highly effective, with evidence showing these plots have a higher abundance and diversity of birds than other habitats; mixtures including kale are particularly beneficial (594). Creating conservation headlands, where spraying of herbicides and fertilizers is restricted on the outer strip of a cereal crop, increases the abundance of weed seeds for birds to eat (652). For farms with silage fields, leaving uncut strips of rye grass can also provide a valuable seed resource over winter (132).",

    "question": "What are the effects of different mowing management strategies—such as timing, height, and technique—on farmland wildlife?",
    "answer": "Mowing strategies have significant and varied effects on farmland wildlife. Delaying the date of first mowing has been found to benefit plants by increasing species richness, as well as invertebrates and birds such as the Eurasian skylark, which can see increased productivity (131). Raising the mowing height on grasslands can also benefit Eurasian skylarks by increasing their productivity and has been found to be less damaging to amphibians and invertebrates (138). Finally, the mowing technique itself is important; studies show that mowing from the centre of the field outwards can reduce chick mortality by allowing them to escape, and using bar mowers causes less harm to amphibians and invertebrates than rotary disc mowers (698).",

For controlling bracken, repeated application of the herbicide asulam has been found to be effective, as has cutting (105).

Managing existing hedgerows can increase berry yields and the diversity of plants, invertebrates, and birds (116), while planting new hedges can support higher beetle and spider diversity than crop fields (538). Creating uncultivated margins (63) or planting grass buffer strips (246) around fields supports higher invertebrate and plant diversity, and benefits birds and small mammals. Beetle banks are mounds sown with grass that can provide winter habitat for predatory insects (651). Managing ditches can increase invertebrate biomass, plant species richness, and benefit amphibians and birds (135). Buffer strips alongside water courses have also been shown to have a positive influence on plant, invertebrate, and bird diversity (120).",

Planting a wild bird seed or cover mixture provides a direct food source and has been shown to increase the abundance and diversity of birds (594). Leaving headlands in fields unsprayed (conservation headlands) increases the abundance of arable weeds, which in turn provides seeds for birds and habitat for insects (652). Undersowing spring cereals with clover can benefit birds like the Eurasian skylark and also increases arthropod abundance (136). Creating cultivated, uncropped plots provides foraging sites and can support rare arable plants, which are a food source for seed-eaters (562).
