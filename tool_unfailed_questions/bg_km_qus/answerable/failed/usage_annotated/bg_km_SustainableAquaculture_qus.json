    "question": "What is the evidence for actions that can mitigate environmental pollution from salmon farming?",
    "answer": "Several actions show potential for mitigating pollution. A trial in Tasmania found that fallowing allowed sediment community structure under salmon cages to become more similar to non-impacted sites (1027). Integrated aquaculture systems, where other species are farmed alongside salmon, have shown that blue mussels can absorb farm waste in Canada and algae growth is enhanced when placed near fish farms in Scotland (932). For waste sludge, trials in Canada found that sludge drying beds effectively removed phosphorus (943).",

    "question": "What husbandry practices, beyond feed and chemical treatments, can be used on Atlantic salmon farms to improve fish health?",
    "answer": "Several husbandry practices have been studied. Fallowing farm sites is one technique, with one Scottish study recording lower lice numbers, though an Australian study found no difference in mortality from Amoebic Gill Disease (1026). Altering cage size can also have an effect, with a study in Australia recording lower levels of amoebic gill disease in larger cages (742). Aerobic training was also found to increase survival rates in salmon exposed to infectious pancreatic necrosis in a Norwegian study (740).",

    "answer": "The evidence for non-pesticide parasite control varies between methods. The use of cleaner wrasse had mixed effects in Irish studies, with one finding them as effective as chemical treatments and another finding them ineffective (738). Similarly, fallowing was found to lower lice numbers in Scotland but had no effect on mortality from Amoebic Gill Disease in an Australian study (1026). In contrast, a Norwegian study found that adding beta-glucans to a salmon's diet consistently reduced lice infection levels by 28% (732).",

Integrated aquaculture systems have shown that other species can utilize farm waste; for instance, a Canadian study found blue mussels absorbed waste, and a US study saw greater scallop growth near farms (932). Constructing artificial reefs is another option; a study reported that these reefs were colonized by species with the potential to remove organic compounds from fish farm effluents (934).",
