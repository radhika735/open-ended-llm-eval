    "question": "Which habitat creation methods appear most consistently effective at increasing overall species richness on subtidal artificial structures?",
    "answer": "Creating complex combinations of habitats appears to be a consistently effective strategy for increasing species richness. Studies found that creating hole habitats along with other features like grooves and pits increased species richness and diversity (3434, 3455, 3448). Creating large swimthrough habitats (>100 mm) also increased fish species richness in one study (3456). In contrast, interventions like creating small swimthroughs (≤100 mm) showed mixed effects on richness (3436).",

    "question": "Which habitat creation methods are most consistently effective at altering the overall community composition on intertidal artificial structures?",
    "answer": "Several methods have been shown to alter community composition. Creating 'rock pools' is effective, with one study finding they supported a different combined macroalgae and invertebrate community compared to surfaces without them (3476). Similarly, creating hole habitats (>50 mm), often with other features, altered community composition in one study (3467). Creating both short (3459) and long (3460) flexible habitats also altered the macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate community. The creation of grooves combined with small protrusions, ridges or ledges showed positive results in three of five studies (3474). The evidence for creating only grooves is mixed (3473).",

    "question": "What are the potential negative impacts or limitations of adding topographical complexity to enhance biodiversity on intertidal artificial structures?",
    "answer": "While often beneficial, adding topographical complexity does not always lead to positive outcomes and can sometimes have negative effects. For example, one study found that creating short flexible habitats decreased the combined species richness on and around structures during low tide (3459). Creating natural rocky reef topography did not increase species richness in one UK study (3435), and neither did creating large protrusions in two studies in the UK and Australia (3463). One study also found that creating pit habitats decreased the combined macroalgae and invertebrate abundance (3475).",

    "question": "Besides choosing different construction materials, what other interventions can modify the surface of artificial structures to benefit biodiversity?",
    "answer": "Beyond altering construction materials, the physical surface of artificial structures can be modified by creating micro- or macro-scale topography. At a micro-scale, creating textured surfaces (≤1 mm) can alter community composition on subtidal structures (3449) and increase invertebrate abundance on intertidal structures (3466). At a larger scale, creating natural rocky reef topography has been tested, with mixed effects on invertebrate abundance on intertidal structures (3435) and no increase in macroalgal abundance in one subtidal study (3446). Additionally, a variety of specific habitat features can be created to add complexity, including pits (3475), grooves (3473), holes (3467), and protrusions (3462), all of which modify the surface and have shown a range of biodiversity outcomes.",
