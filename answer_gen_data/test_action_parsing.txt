Thirteen studies were in the USA\u00a0and two were in Australia.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nCommunity composition (2 studies): One of two replicated studies (one before-and-after with paired sites, one site comparison) in Australia\u00a0found that the composition of bat species differed between burned and unburned woodland sites. The other study\u00a0found that the composition of bat species was similar between unlogged forest blocks burned every two or four years and unburned blocks.\nRichness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, site comparison study in Australia\u00a0found more bat species in unlogged forest blocks burned every four years than in blocks burned every two years or unburned blocks.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (9 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (9 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies (including one controlled study) in the USA\u00a0found that the activity (relative abundance) of open habitat bat species\u00a0and evening bats\u00a0increased with the number of prescribed fires, but there was no effect on other bat species, including cluttered habitat bat species. Four replicated, before-and-after or site comparison studies (including two controlled studies) in the USA\u00a0and Australia\u00a0found that prescribed burning, prescribed burning along with thinning\u00a0or prescribed burning every four years\u00a0resulted in higher overall bat activity\u00a0or activity of Florida bonneted bats.

One replicated, randomized, site comparison study in the USA\u00a0found that three of four burning and thinning treatments resulted in higher overall bat activity. One replicated, controlled, site comparison study in the USA\u00a0found similar activity of three bat species in burned and unburned tree stands.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (6 STUDIES)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nUse (5 studies): One replicated, controlled before-and-after study in the USA\u00a0found that more female northern myotis bats roosted in burned than unburned forest. Two replicated, controlled, site comparison studies in the USA\u00a0found that fewer female northern myotis bats\u00a0and male Indiana bats\u00a0roosted in burned than unburned forest. One replicated study in the USA\u00a0found that evening bats roosted in burned but not unburned forest. One replicated, paired sites study in the USA\u00a0found that burned sites had a higher occupancy of five bat species/species groups than unburned sites, and burn severity had a negative effect on the occupancy of two bat species/species groups.\nBehaviour change (4 studies): Two replicated, controlled, site comparison studies in the USA\u00a0found no difference in roost switching frequency or the distance between roost trees for female northern myotis bats\u00a0and male Indiana bats\u00a0in burned and unburned forests. One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the USA\u00a0found that female northern myotis home ranges and core areas did not differ in size between burned and unburned forests, but home ranges were closer to burned forest than unburned forest. One replicated, site comparison study in the USA\u00a0found that home ranges of female Rafinesque\u2019s big-eared bats were located similar distances to burned and unburned forest, and male home ranges were closer to unburned forest."

The other two studies in the USA\u00a0and UK\u00a0found that bats displaced from buildings did not use any of 43 bat houses of four different designs\u00a0or 12 heated bat boxes of one design. One review\u00a0of 109 studies across Europe, North America and Asia found that 72 bat species used bat boxes, although only 18 species commonly used them, and 31 species used them as maternity roosts. Twenty-two studies (including 17 replicated studies, one before-and-after study and two reviews)\u00a0found bats occupying less than half of bat boxes provided (0\u201349%). Nine replicated studies\u00a0found bats occupying more than half of bat boxes provided (54\u2013100%).\n\nOTHER (23 STUDIES)\n\nBat box design (16 studies): Three studies in Germany, Portugal\u00a0and Australia\u00a0found that bats used black bat boxes more than grey, white\u00a0or wooden\u00a0boxes. One of two studies in Spain\u00a0and the USA\u00a0found higher occupancy rates in larger bat boxes. One study in the USA\u00a0found that bats used both resin and wood cylindrical bat boxes, but another study in the USA\u00a0found that resin bat boxes became occupied more quickly than wood boxes. One study in the UK\u00a0found higher occupancy rates in concrete than wooden bat boxes. One study in the USA\u00a0found that Indiana bats used rocket boxes more than wooden bat boxes or bark-mimic roosts. One study in Spain\u00a0found that more bats occupied bat boxes that had two compartments than one compartment in the breeding season. One study in Lithuania\u00a0found that bat breeding colonies occupied standard and four/five chamber bat boxes and individuals occupied flat bat boxes. Four studies in the USA, UK, Spain\u00a0and Australia\u00a0found bats selecting four of nine, three of five, three of four and one of five bat box designs. One study in the UK\u00a0found that different bat box designs were used by different species. One study in Costa Rica\u00a0found that bat boxes simulating tree trunks were used by 100% of bats and in group sizes similar to natural roosts.\nBat box position (11 studies): Three studies in Germany, Spain\u00a0and the USA\u00a0found that bat box orientation and/or the amount of exposure to sunlight affected bat occupancy, and one study in Spain\u00a0found that orientation did not have a significant effect on occupancy. Two studies in the UK\u00a0and Italy\u00a0found that bat box height affected occupancy, and two studies in Spain\u00a0and the USA\u00a0found no effect of height. Two studies in the USA\u00a0and Spain\u00a0found higher occupancy of bat boxes on buildings than on trees. One study in Australia\u00a0found that bat boxes were occupied more often in farm forestry sites than in native forest, one study in Poland\u00a0found higher occupancy in pine relative to mixed deciduous stands, and one study in Costa Rica\u00a0found higher occupancy in forest fragments than in pasture. One study in the USA\u00a0found higher occupancy rates in areas where bats were known to roost prior to installing bat boxes. One review in the UK\u00a0found that bat boxes were more likely to be occupied when a greater number of bat boxes were installed across a site."

Six studies were in the USA, four\u00a0were in Australia and one\u00a0was in Canada.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nRichness/diversity (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in Australia\u00a0recorded the same bat species in thinned and unthinned forest, except for the chocolate wattled bat, which was not recorded in forests with unthinned regrowth. One replicated, site comparison study in Australia\u00a0found that forest thinned up to 20 years previously had higher bat diversity than unthinned forest, but sites thinned more than 20 years previously did not differ.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (11 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (11 studies):\u00a0Five\u00a0of six replicated, site comparison studies (including two paired sites studies and one controlled study) in the USA\u00a0and Australia\u00a0found higher overall bat activity (relative abundance)\u00a0in thinned\u00a0or thinned and burned forest\u00a0than unthinned forest. The other study\u00a0found similar overall bat activity in thinned and unthinned stands. One replicated, randomized, site comparison study in the USA\u00a0found higher overall bat activity for three of four types of thinning and burning treatments. One replicated, site comparison study in Australia\u00a0found that forest thinned up to eight years previously or more than 20 years previously had higher bat activity than unthinned forest, but sites thinned 8\u201320 years previously did not differ. Three replicated, controlled studies (including one site comparison and one before-and-after study) in Canada and Australia\u00a0found that thinning increased the activity of some bat species but not others.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)"
