    "query": "What are the most effective interventions for reducing bat fatalities at wind turbines?",
    "answer": "The most effective interventions for reducing bat fatalities at wind turbines involve operational adjustments, particularly increasing cut-in speeds and feathering blades at low wind speeds. The strongest evidence supports operational curtailment strategies. Increasing the wind speed at which turbines become operational (cut-in speed reduction) has been proven beneficial, with 10 of 12 studies in the USA and Canada showing significant reductions in bat fatalities. Similarly, preventing turbine blades from turning at low wind speeds through feathering has demonstrated beneficial effects in 5 of 6 studies. These approaches work because bats are most active during low wind conditions, so reducing turbine operation during these periods directly lowers collision risk. An enhanced approach involves automatically reducing blade rotation when bat activity is detected as high, which two studies found effective. Additionally, slowing blade rotation at low wind speeds shows promising results, though with more limited evidence. Other interventions like ultrasound deterrents and visual modifications remain uncertain or lack sufficient evidence. The operational curtailment strategies, while potentially reducing energy production during low-wind periods, offer the most reliable protection for bat populations based on extensive field evidence from North American wind farms.",
