    "answer": "To determine which interventions most effectively prevent bat deaths at wind turbines, I am searching the action documents for proven strategies like turbine curtailment, ultrasonic deterrents, and habitat management. \n\nI find multiple documents on bat-conserving measures, and by retrieving their details I see that the standout actions are raising cut-in speeds, fitting ultrasonic deterrents, and enhancing habitat away from turbines. These measures have been successfully implemented and monitored, and the full reports provide evidence of reduced bat mortality where they were applied. Curtailing turbine operation at low-wind periods\u2014especially raising cut-in speeds\u2014consistently produced the largest reduction in bat fatalities (Action ID: 1002; 1004).
