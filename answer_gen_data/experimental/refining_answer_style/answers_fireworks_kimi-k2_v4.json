    "query": "What are the most effective interventions for reducing bat fatalities at wind turbines?",
    "answer": "Based on the available evidence, the most effective interventions for reducing bat fatalities at wind turbines are preventing turbine blades from turning at low wind speeds through feathering, increasing the wind speed at which turbines become operational (cut-in speed), and slowing rotation of turbine blades at low wind speeds. Five of six studies found that feathering turbine blades at low wind speeds resulted in fewer bat fatalities, with one study showing no effect. Similarly, ten of twelve studies demonstrated that increasing cut-in speeds significantly reduced bat fatalities, while only one study found that slowing blade rotation was effective. The combined approach of feathering along with increasing cut-in speed appears particularly beneficial based on multiple studies conducted in the USA and Canada. The mechanisms behind these interventions' success relate to bat behavior and wind patterns - bats are more active during low wind conditions, so preventing turbine operation during these times reduces collision risks. While feathering prevents blades from turning entirely, increasing cut-in speeds delays turbine operation until wind speeds are higher when bat activity typically decreases. These operational adjustments can be implemented without significant impacts on energy production since they primarily affect periods of low wind when electricity generation is minimal anyway.",
