    "query": "What are the most effective interventions for reducing bat fatalities at wind turbines?",
    "answer": "To effectively reduce bat fatalities at wind turbines, several interventions have proven beneficial. Preventing turbine blades from turning at low wind speeds, known as 'feathering', has shown to significantly decrease bat fatalities in multiple studies across the USA and Canada (Action 970). Similarly, increasing the wind speed at which turbines become operational, or the 'cut-in speed', has also been found to be beneficial, with numerous studies demonstrating reduced bat fatalities (Action 1960). Additionally, slowing the rotation of turbine blades at low wind speeds is likely to be beneficial, based on a study conducted in Canada (Action 2939).",
