    "query": "What are the most effective interventions for reducing bat fatalities at wind turbines?",
    "answer": "Based on the evidence, the most effective interventions for reducing bat fatalities at wind turbines are increasing the wind speed at which turbines become operational ('cut-in speed') and preventing turbine blades from turning at low wind speeds ('feathering'), both rated as beneficial. These strategies have been tested in multiple studies across the USA and Canada, with the majority finding significant reductions in bat fatalities compared to conventionally operated turbines. Additionally, automatically reducing turbine blade rotation when bat activity is high, and slowing blade rotation at low wind speeds are rated as likely to be beneficial based on replicated studies. The evidence strongly supports operational adjustments rather than deterrent technologies, with techniques like feathering turbines or raising cut-in speeds consistently reducing bat mortality across different sites and seasons.",
