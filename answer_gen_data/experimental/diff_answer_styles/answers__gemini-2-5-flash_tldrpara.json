    "answer": "The most effective interventions for reducing bat fatalities at wind turbines involve modifying turbine operation during low wind speeds.\n\nSpecifically, preventing turbine blades from turning at low wind speeds, also known as 'feathering', has been shown to be beneficial in reducing bat fatalities (Action ID: 970). This practice, sometimes combined with increasing the wind speed at which turbines become operational ('cut-in speed'), has consistently resulted in fewer bat deaths according to multiple studies conducted in the USA and Canada (Action ID: 970). Similarly, increasing the 'cut-in speed' alone has also proven to be beneficial, with many studies demonstrating a reduction in bat fatalities when turbines only start operating at higher wind speeds (Action ID: 1960). Another promising intervention, though supported by a single study, is to slow the rotation of turbine blades at low wind speeds, which was found to reduce bat fatalities in Canada (Action ID: 2939). These methods focus on mitigating the risk during periods when bats are most active and vulnerable to turbine collisions.",
