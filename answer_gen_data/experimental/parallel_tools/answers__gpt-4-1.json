    "answer": "The most effective interventions for reducing bat fatalities at wind turbines are those that alter turbine operation at times when bats are most vulnerable. Specifically, two interventions stand out as beneficial based on multiple studies:\n\n1. Preventing turbine blades from turning at low wind speeds ('feathering'): Multiple studies from the USA and Canada show that feathering turbine blades or combining feathering with increasing the cut-in speed results in fewer bat fatalities compared to conventional operations.\n2. Increasing the wind speed at which turbines become operational ('cut-in speed'): Ten out of twelve studies (mainly in the USA and Canada) found that increasing the cut-in speed, either alone or combined with feathering, effectively reduces bat fatalities.\n\nOther interventions that show promise include:\n- Slowing the rotation of turbine blades at low wind speeds (likely to be beneficial; based on one study in Canada).\n- Automatically reducing turbine blade rotation when bat activity is high (likely to be beneficial; two studies in Germany and the USA).\n\nUsing ultrasonic deterrents to keep bats away from turbines has shown mixed results and its overall effectiveness is still considered uncertain.\n\nIn summary, operational changes that limit turbine activity during periods of high bat risk, particularly through feathering and raising cut-in speeds, are the most strongly supported by current evidence for reducing bat mortality at wind farms.",
