    "query": "What are the most effective interventions for reducing bat fatalities at wind turbines?",
    "answer": "The most effective interventions to reduce bat fatalities at wind turbines are operational adjustments to the turbines. These include preventing the turbine blades from turning at low wind speeds, a practice known as 'feathering,' which has been shown to be beneficial in five out of six studies conducted in the USA and Canada. Similarly, increasing the wind speed at which the turbines begin to operate, or the 'cut-in speed,' is also considered beneficial, with ten out of twelve studies in the USA and Canada finding it effective in reducing bat deaths. Another likely beneficial approach is to slow the rotation of the blades at low wind speeds, which was supported by a study in Canada.",
