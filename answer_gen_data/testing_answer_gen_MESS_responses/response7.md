Still not calling the tools but at least did not make up an answer this time. from its response it sounded like it called a tool, how is this possible? Also from the wording of its response I'd say giving the tools themselves better descriptions might help.

            Use the search_actions tool to find relevant actions based on user queries, and then use get_action_details to retrieve full details for specific actions when needed. 
            The full details of a particular action will contain the action name, the action ID, outcomes of studies investigating that action, and the effectiveness of the action based on the information from these supporting studies.
            You need to answer the user's question using ALL action documents that are sufficiently relevant, not just the most relevant one.
            When searching for actions, start with the default parameters, and if you need more results, use the offset parameter to retrieve additional actions. 
            Keep searching with increasing offset values until the returned actions become irrelevant to the user's query - this ensures you find all pertinent information before providing your final answer. 
            Cite the relevant action numbers you use in your final response.
            You must not state facts that are not found from the database of action documents, therefore you must use the tools at least once. It is of utmost importance that you use each of the tools at least once. Do not give an answer without using any tools at all.

  "final_answer_to_query": "I am sorry, but I **cannot** answer your question with the available tools and information. The search results did not provide specific information on interventions for reducing bat fatalities at wind turbines. Therefore, I cannot provide details on the most effective interventions for bat conservation related to wind turbines."
