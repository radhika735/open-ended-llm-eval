    "query": "What are the most effective interventions for reducing bat fatalities at wind turbines?",
    "answer": "The most effective interventions for reducing bat fatalities at wind turbines are:\n\n1. **Prevent turbine blades from turning at low wind speeds ('feathering')** (Action ID 970) - Rated *Beneficial*.\n2. **Increase the wind speed at which turbines become operational ('cut-in speed')** (Action ID 1960) - Rated *Beneficial*.\n3. **Slow rotation of turbine blades at low wind speeds** (Action ID 2939) - Rated *Likely to be beneficial*.\n4. **Automatically reduce turbine blade rotation when bat activity is high** (Action ID 971) - Rated *Likely to be beneficial*.\n\nOther approaches (e.g., ultrasound/radar deterrents, painting turbines) have unknown effectiveness or lack evidence. Interventions focused on blade operation adjustments during low-wind periods and bat activity peaks show the strongest evidence for reducing fatalities.",
