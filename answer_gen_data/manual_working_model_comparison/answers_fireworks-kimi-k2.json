    "query": "What are the most effective interventions for reducing bat fatalities at wind turbines?",
    "answer": "Based on extensive evidence synthesis, the most effective interventions for reducing bat fatalities at wind turbines are:\n\n**Highly Effective:**\n- **Increase the wind speed at which turbines become operational (cut-in speed)** - This intervention has strong evidence with 12 studies (10 in the USA, 2 in Canada) showing it consistently reduces bat fatalities when properly implemented.\n- **Prevent turbine blades from turning at low wind speeds (feathering)** - Six studies demonstrated that feathering turbine blades at low wind speeds significantly reduces bat deaths.\n- **Slow rotation of turbine blades at low wind speeds** - Initial evidence from Canada shows promising results for reducing bat fatalities.\n- **Automatically reduce turbine blade rotation when bat activity is high** - Studies from Germany and the USA found this approach successfully reduces fatalities for all bat species combined and for individual species.\n\n**Potentially Effective but Uncertain:**\n- **Ultrasonic deterrents** - Four US studies showed mixed results, with effectiveness varying between years and species. In some cases, 21-51% fewer bats were killed, but results were inconsistent.\n- **Radar deterrents** and **painting turbines for increased visibility** - Currently no evidence available to assess effectiveness.\n\nThe interventions with strongest evidence base (raising cut-in speed and feathering) should be prioritized as they have consistently demonstrated significant reductions in bat fatalities across multiple well-designed studies.",
