    "relevant_summary": "- Prevent turbine blades from turning at low wind speeds (\u2018feathering\u2019): Five of six studies (USA, Canada; replicated/controlled and one before\u2011and\u2011after) reported fewer bat fatalities at feathered turbines or when feathering was combined with increased cut\u2011in speed; one study reported no reduction when blades were automatically feathered at low wind speeds. \n- Increase turbine cut\u2011in speed: Ten of 12 studies (USA, Canada; replicated, randomized, controlled and one before\u2011and\u2011after) reported fewer bat fatalities when cut\u2011in speed was increased, or when increased cut\u2011in speed was combined with feathering. Two studies reported no reduction (small sample sizes or short treatment periods).\n- Slow rotation at low wind speeds: One replicated, randomized, controlled study (Canada) reported reduced bat fatalities when blades were slowed at low wind speeds.\n- Automatically reduce blade rotation when bat activity is high: Two replicated studies (Germany, USA; one randomized/controlled, one paired sites) reported fewer bat fatalities for all bats combined and for five bat species.\n- Deter bats using ultrasound: Three replicated, randomized, controlled studies (USA; one with a before\u2011and\u2011after second year) reported mixed results. In one study\u2019s first year, 21\u201351% fewer bats were killed at turbines with ultrasonic deterrents; in the second year, outcomes ranged from 2% more to 64% fewer fatalities. Another study found mixed effects between constant vs pulsed signals across species; another found fewer fatalities for two of three species.\n- Apply textured coating to turbines: One paired sites study (USA) reported no reduction in bat activity or numbers observed.\n- Modify turbine placement; deter with radar; remove turbine lighting; retain buffers from bat habitat features; deter with low\u2011level ultraviolet light; close off turbine access points to prevent roosting; reduce turbine height; paint turbines to reduce insect attraction: No studies found evaluating effects on bat populations/fatalities.\n- Paint turbines to increase visibility: One ex situ experiment (American kestrel) found thick black stripes made blades more conspicuous than unpatterned blades; other designs were less visible or indistinguishable.

Two studies reported no reduction (small sample sizes or short treatment periods).\\n- Slow rotation at low wind speeds: One replicated, randomized, controlled study (Canada) reported reduced bat fatalities when blades were slowed at low wind speeds.\\n- Automatically reduce blade rotation when bat activity is high: Two replicated studies (Germany, USA; one randomized/controlled, one paired sites) reported fewer bat fatalities for all bats combined and for five bat species.\\n- Deter bats using ultrasound: Three replicated, randomized, controlled studies (USA; one with a before\\u2011and\\u2011after second year) reported mixed results. In one study\\u2019s first year, 21\\u201351% fewer bats were killed at turbines with ultrasonic deterrents; in the second year, outcomes ranged from 2% more to 64% fewer fatalities. Another study found mixed effects between constant vs pulsed signals across species; another found fewer fatalities for two of three species.\\n- Apply textured coating to turbines: One paired sites study (USA) reported no reduction in bat activity or numbers observed.\\n- Modify turbine placement; deter with radar; remove turbine lighting; retain buffers from bat habitat features; deter with low\\u2011level ultraviolet light; close off turbine access points to prevent roosting; reduce turbine height; paint turbines to reduce insect attraction: No studies found evaluating effects on bat populations/fatalities.\\n- Paint turbines to increase visibility: One ex situ experiment (American kestrel) found thick black stripes made blades more conspicuous than unpatterned blades; other designs were less visible or indistinguishable. (Not a bat fatality study.)\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"970\",\n    \"1960\",\n    \"2939\",\n    \"971\",\n    \"968\",\n    \"1957\",\n    \"965\",\n    \"967\",\n    \"969\",\n    \"966\",\n    \"1958\",\n    \"972\",\n    \"1955\",\n    \"1959\",\n    \"258\"\n  ]\n}"
