    "relevant_summary": "Several actions can be taken to mitigate environmental pollution from salmon farm waste. Integrated aquaculture systems allow co-cultivation of species like scallops, mussels, and algae that can absorb nutrients and waste products from salmon farms, with studies showing blue mussels effectively absorbed salmon farm waste in Canada and enhanced algal growth when placed adjacent to fish farms in Scotland. Establishing fallowing cycles, demonstrated in a Tasmanian trial, allows sediment communities under Atlantic salmon cages to recover, with community structure becoming more similar to non-impacted sites over two fallowing cycles. Artificial reefs can be constructed near aquaculture systems to capture and utilize nutrient run-offs, though studies show invertebrate community composition on these reefs remains similar to reefs without aquaculture influence. Ceasing aquaculture activity has been shown to allow invertebrate communities to recover, with Mediterranean Sea studies showing increases in health-indicating worms and decreases in pollution-indicating worms after farming cessation. Other potential interventions include reducing aquaculture stocking densities to lessen waste production, improving fish food and pellets to reduce waste generation, and implementing regular water treatment systems to clean waste water before it enters the marine environment.",
