    "relevant_summary": "Issue enforcement notices for non bear-proof garbage dumpsters did not reduce garbage accessibility to black bears (2345). Providing diversionary feeding reduced nuisance behaviour by black bears in two USA-based studies (2323). Scaring mammals using electric fences successfully deterred polar bears from compounds, while chasing bears with dogs kept them away from human areas in some studies, though noise deterrents were ineffective in other cases (2347). Translocating habituated bears resulted in nearly half returning to capture sites, but success improved when moving younger bears farther across geographic barriers (2341, 2336). Conditioned taste aversion caused black bears to avoid laced food sources (2384). Preventing access to food via electric shock devices stopped black bears from damaging bird feeders (2346). Brown bears habituated to humans exhibited less aggression toward visitors compared to non-habituated bears (2340). Translocating crop-raiding black bears reduced recapture at crop sites, though survival rates for translocated bears were generally lower (2336, 2485). Diversionary feeding for livestock predation did not reduce bear attacks on livestock (2437).",
