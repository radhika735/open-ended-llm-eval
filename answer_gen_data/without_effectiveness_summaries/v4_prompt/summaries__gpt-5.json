    "relevant_summary": "Evidence indicates several actions can reduce bear-related conflicts. Diversionary feeding reduced nuisance behaviour by black bears in two before-and-after studies, and brown bears in Slovenia obtained 22\u201363% of annual dietary energy from provided food (2323). Scaring/deterrence had mixed outcomes: some studies found noise/pain deterrents did not prevent black bears returning to urban or human-occupied sites, while other studies found such actions deterred bears from seeking food; chasing nuisance black bears with dogs caused them to stay away longer; an electric fence prevented polar bear entry to a compound; chemical and acoustic repellents did not deter polar bears from baits in most cases (2347). Preventing access to food sources with electric shock devices stopped American black bears from accessing or damaging bird feeders (2346). Conditioned taste aversion led black bears to avoid treated foods (2384). Issuing enforcement notices requiring appropriate dumpster use did not reduce garbage accessibility to black bears (2345). Translocating problem or habituated bears often resulted in bears returning to capture locations and/or continuing nuisance, and for grizzly and black bears reduced survival compared to non-translocated bears; however, one controlled study found translocated brown bears occurred less frequently inside high potential conflict areas than non-translocated bears (2336, 2341).",
