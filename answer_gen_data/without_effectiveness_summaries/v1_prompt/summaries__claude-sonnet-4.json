    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available research, several actions have been evaluated for reducing human-wildlife conflict with bears, with varying degrees of effectiveness:\n\n**Most Effective Actions:**\n- **Diversionary feeding**: Studies in the USA showed this reduced nuisance behavior by black bears, with brown bears in Slovenia consuming 22-63% of their annual energy from provided diversionary food sources.\n- **Physical deterrents and barriers**: Electric fencing proved effective at excluding black bears from accessing bird feeders and preventing polar bear entry to compounds. Electric shock devices successfully prevented black bears from accessing or damaging bird feeders.\n- **Conditioned taste aversion**: Studies found that lacing foodstuffs with illness-inducing substances led to avoidance by black bears.\n\n**Mixed Effectiveness Actions:**\n- **Deterrent methods**: Results varied for scaring or deterring bears - two studies found noise and pain deterrents ineffective at preventing black bears from returning to urban areas, while two other studies found such actions did deter bears from seeking food at human sites. Chasing bears with dogs showed some success in keeping them away longer.\n- **Electric fencing for crops**: Mixed results with some fence designs deterring black bears while others were less effective.\n\n**Less Effective Actions:**\n- **Translocation**: Multiple studies showed poor outcomes - almost half of translocated \"nuisance\" black bears returned to capture locations, survival rates were lower for translocated grizzly bears compared to non-translocated ones, and fewer than half of translocated black bears survived after one year.\n- **Enforcement of bear-proof garbage requirements**: One study found that issuing enforcement notices requiring appropriate dumpster use did not reduce garbage accessibility to black bears.\n\nThe research indicates that prevention through physical barriers and diversionary feeding tend to be more successful than reactive measures like translocation.",
