    "relevant_summary": "Based on available evidence, several strategies have been tested for reducing bear-human conflict. Diversionary feeding has shown effectiveness, with two studies (in USA and Slovenia) demonstrating that providing alternative food sources reduced nuisance behavior by black bears, though 22-63% of brown bear annual diet comprised the provided diversionary food. Conditioned taste aversion (using illness-inducing substances) successfully caused black bears to avoid treated foods. Translocation strategies showed mixed results: while black bears translocated further distances, as younger individuals, or across geographic barriers were less likely to return to capture sites, survival rates were low with fewer than half surviving one year post-translocation, and most returned to original areas. Electric fencing proved highly effective, with 8 out of 10 studies demonstrating reduced livestock predation or prevented carnivore entry to enclosures, including cases in Canada and the USA. Various deterrent methods showed effectiveness - pepper spray repelled black bears and grizzly bears, rubber bullets and other deterrents repelled bears, and hikers wearing bear bells were approached less often by grizzly bears. However, some deterrents had limited success, with noise and pain deterrents failing to prevent black bears from returning to urban areas in two of four studies. Enforcement notices requiring bear-proof dumpster use did not reduce garbage accessibility to black bears.",

Additionally, amending the soil with manures and agricultural composts increases carbon levels, with four studies confirming higher carbon when these amendments are applied. Using cover crops grown as green manures also results in higher soil organic carbon. Regarding reducing bat fatalities at wind turbines, five of six studies found that preventing turbine blades from turning at low wind speeds (feathering) reduced bat fatalities, while ten of twelve studies confirm that increasing the wind speed at which turbines become operational (cut-in speed) results in fewer bat fatalities. Two studies also found that automatically reducing turbine blade rotation when bat activity is high successfully reduced fatalities.",
