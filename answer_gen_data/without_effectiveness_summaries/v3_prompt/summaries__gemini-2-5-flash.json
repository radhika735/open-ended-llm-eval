Studies showed an increase in soil organic matter or carbon when nitrogen or phosphorus fertilizer was applied, and higher carbon levels were found when NPK fertilizers were applied with straw. No-tillage or reduced tillage systems demonstrated higher soil organic carbon compared to conventionally tilled soil, and no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application can increase soil organic carbon. Excluding grazing animals also led to increased soil carbon. Effective interventions for reducing bat fatalities at wind turbines involve preventing turbine blades from turning at low wind speeds (feathering), slowing the rotation of turbine blades at low wind speeds, and increasing the wind speed at which turbines become operational ('cut-in speed'). Many studies found that feathering, or feathering combined with increasing cut-in speed, resulted in fewer bat fatalities, while slowing blade rotation also reduced fatalities.

One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon.
