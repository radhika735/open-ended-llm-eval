    "relevant_summary": "For increasing soil organic carbon on loamy soils, several interventions have been shown to be effective. Amending soil with formulated chemical compounds (e.g., nitrogen or phosphorus fertilizer) generally increased soil organic carbon and organic matter according to five of six studies, particularly when fertilizer was combined with organic materials like straw or manure. Changing tillage practices to reduce or eliminate tillage resulted in consistently higher soil organic carbon compared with conventional tillage across twelve studies from multiple continents, with additional benefits to soil structure and organism diversity. Reducing grazing intensity by excluding grazing animals or reducing grazing time was shown to increase soil carbon and nitrogen, and decrease soil compaction and sediment erosion. Converting to organic farming increased soil carbon in orchards and enhanced soil organism diversity, although effects on yield were mixed. Using crop rotation, particularly with legumes and forage crops, increased soil organic carbon and organic matter in multiple replicated and controlled trials.\n\nFor reducing bat fatalities at wind turbines, the most effective interventions were: preventing turbine blades from turning at low wind speeds ('feathering'), which reduced bat fatalities across five of six studies; increasing the wind speed at which turbines become operational ('cut-in speed'), which resulted in fewer bat deaths in ten of twelve studies; slowing the rotation of turbine blades at low wind speeds, which reduced fatalities in one controlled Canadian study; and automatically reducing blade rotation when bat activity is high, which reduced bat fatalities in studies from Germany and the USA. Use of ultrasonic deterrents to keep bats away showed mixed results, with some reductions in fatalities and some studies finding no significant effect.",
