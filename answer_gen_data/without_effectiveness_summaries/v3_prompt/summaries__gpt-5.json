Conditioned taste aversion, where food was laced with illness-inducing substances, led to avoidance by black bears in USA studies. Preventing access to attractants using electric shock devices stopped American black bears from accessing or damaging bird feeders in a replicated, controlled USA study. Scaring/deterrence showed mixed outcomes: two of four USA studies found noise/pain deterrents deterred black bears from seeking food at human-occupied sites, while two did not; chasing nuisance black bears with dogs in USA/Canada caused them to stay away longer in some studies; chemical/acoustic repellents did not deter polar bears from baits in most cases; an electric fence prevented polar bear entry to a compound. Electric fencing to protect resources deterred mammals in nine of 11 studies across multiple countries, with some fence designs deterring black bears, though results were mixed in two studies. Translocation frequently underperformed: multiple studies in the USA and Canada reported brown/grizzly or black bears often returned to capture locations and/or continued to cause nuisance; one USA study found nearly half of translocated nuisance black bears returned, while a review found lower return rates when moved as younger bears, farther, or across barriers; survival of translocated grizzly and black bears was lower than non\u2011translocated in some USA studies. Issuing enforcement notices to require appropriate dumpster use did not reduce garbage accessibility to black bears in a replicated, controlled, before\u2011and\u2011after USA study.
