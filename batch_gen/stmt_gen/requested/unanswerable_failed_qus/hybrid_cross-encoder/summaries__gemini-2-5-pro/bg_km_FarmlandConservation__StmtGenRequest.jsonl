Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: How do national-level agricultural subsidy policies influence the uptake of biodiversity-friendly farming practices across Europe?\nanswer: Agri-environment schemes that pay farmers for conservation measures have shown varied effects on European wildlife. For birds, while twenty-four studies found increases in population sizes or densities on scheme sites (700), and twenty-two studies showed similar positive trends (172), other studies found negative or no effects (700, 172). However, specially-designed schemes have led to population increases for cirl buntings, corncrakes and Eurasian thick-knees (172). The impact on wild bees is also mixed, with some European trials showing enhanced diversity and abundance (24), while others, including landscape-scale studies in the UK, found no such enhancements (24).\n\nFor butterflies and moths, the evidence is more consistently positive. Twelve of fifteen studies in the UK, Switzerland, and Sweden reported higher species richness or diversity on lands in agri-environment schemes, and seventeen of nineteen studies found higher abundance (3915). However, some studies noted similar or lower abundance compared to conventionally managed or unmanaged lands (3915). Specific practices like undersowing spring cereals with legumes have shown higher butterfly richness in some contexts (3926) but not others (3926).\n\nEffects on other wildlife are also variable. Payments to farmers in Denmark and Sweden helped create amphibian breeding habitat and increase populations (818), and managed ditches in the Netherlands had higher amphibian species numbers (818). For mammals, agri-environment schemes were associated with increased brown hare density in one UK region but not another and had no effect on Irish hare numbers in Northern Ireland (2387). Small mammal abundance did increase in scheme-managed field margins in the UK (2387). Conversely, studies on bats in the UK found that agri-environment schemes did not lead to significant increases in bat activity, with one study even recording lower activity (962).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Several methods for increasing invertebrate diversity have been studied. Converting to organic farming may lead to a greater species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths on arable farms (3907). Reducing field size can also increase the abundance of butterflies and moths, and in some cases, the species richness (3974). Providing buffer strips alongside water courses has been shown to have a positive influence on invertebrate diversity and abundance (120). Finally, planting field margins with a diverse mix of plant species has been found to increase the activity of certain bat species, which prey on insects (1941).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

However, several studies have investigated the effects of reducing or changing fertilizer types on invertebrates.\n\nFive studies found positive effects of reducing or stopping fertilizer applications on invertebrates, while four studies found that reducing or stopping fertilizer inputs had no, or no consistent, effects on some invertebrates (139). Conversely, two studies from the UK found that plots where fertilizer inputs were not reduced tended to have higher earthworm biomass or abundance (139). In permanent grasslands, six studies found that stopping fertilizer inputs resulted in a higher abundance or species richness of some or all invertebrates studied, and one review found that densities of some invertebrates were higher in unfertilized plots (694). However, another review found no clear effect of reducing fertilizer inputs on the density of soil-dwelling invertebrates, and one study found lower invertebrate abundance on plots with reduced fertilizer inputs, although the differences were not significant (694).\n\nWhen comparing fertilizer types, one study found fewer nematodes and another found fewer mites in plots with organic fertilizer compared to inorganic fertilizer (1366). However, the same study noted that organic fertilizer plots had more microbial biomass (1366).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
