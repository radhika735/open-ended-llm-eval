While habitat restoration efforts for coastal wetlands show positive results for bird species use (action 367), and legal habitat protection has demonstrated benefits for marine mammal populations including Mediterranean monk seals (action 2915), there are no studies found that directly evaluate creating artificial habitats for marine mammals (action 2921). Similarly, there are no studies evaluating the effects of leaving anthropogenic structures in place after decommissioning on marine mammal populations (action 2922). The evidence base for offsetting habitat loss through restoration or creation elsewhere is limited to invertebrate species (action 2265). This lack of comparative research means conclusions cannot be drawn about which approach would be more effective for seal conservation.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
