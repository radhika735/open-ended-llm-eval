A controlled, replicated, before-and-after study in Indonesia found that using nets to keep primates out of fruit trees reduced crop-raiding by orangutans (Action 1442). Other proposed methods include installing mechanical barriers (Action 1436), using unpalatable buffer crops (Action 1438), changing to less palatable crops (Action 1439), compensating farmers for losses (Action 1428), paying farmers for deterrent costs (Action 1429), and providing sacrificial crop rows (Action 1427). However, all other interventions lack quantitative evidence for their effectiveness or cost-effectiveness, with systematic searches finding no studies that directly tested these actions.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: How does the success rate of primate reintroduction programs vary between different continents?\nanswer: Evidence from primate reintroduction programs shows considerable geographic variation in success rates across continents:\n\n**South America (Brazil, French Guiana):** Studies show mixed results with relatively low survival rates - most golden lion tamarins in Brazil did not survive over 1-7 years despite reintroduction efforts, and a controlled study in French Guiana found more squirrel monkeys died or were returned to captivity compared to wild-born individuals.\n\n**Africa (Tanzania, Gambia, Gabon, Republic of Congo, Guinea, Senegal):** Generally shows higher success rates with populations increasing over time in Tanzania (16 years), Gambia (25 years), and most chimpanzees surviving 1-5 years across multiple countries. However, some failures were documented including a chimpanzee in Uganda that repeatedly returned to human settlements.\n\n**Madagascar:** Shows variable outcomes with some successes (all lemurs surviving over 30 months, diet overlap with wild populations) but also significant failures (most black-and-white ruffed lemurs not surviving over 5 years).\n\n**Asia (Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam):** Mixed results with some notable failures including a population decline of orangutans over 33 years in Malaysia, declining gibbon populations over 3 years in Thailand, and most lorises assumed dead within one year in Vietnam/Indonesia.\n\n**Central America (Belize):** Limited evidence shows positive outcomes with primate population increases over 5 years.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

While searches identified related actions such as establishing riparian buffers to reduce pollutants reaching rivers and reducing garbage/solid waste to avoid primate injuries, none of these actions provided evidence specifically about plastic pollution effects on primates in river ecosystems.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
