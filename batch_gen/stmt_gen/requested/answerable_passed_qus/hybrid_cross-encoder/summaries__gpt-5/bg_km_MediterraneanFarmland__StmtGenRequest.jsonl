Several studies reported reduced water loss via drainage, runoff, or evaporation under cover crops, with one study reporting higher drainage losses in some comparisons (1357). Cover crops reduced herbicide leaching in one study (1357), and multiple studies reported reduced nitrate leaching; one study also noted less ammonium and dissolved carbon but more phosphorus in runoff, and less suspended sediment in runoff in some comparisons (1357), with reduced nitrate leaching also reported elsewhere (898). Soil structure and nutrient retention improved under cover crops in randomized, replicated studies, with increases in soil carbon and, in several studies, increased nitrogen and carbon; some European studies found no marked change in soil organic matter (898). For crop production, replicated, controlled studies from Spain, Italy, France, and Israel reported lower yields in some comparisons, higher yields in some comparisons, inconsistent differences in others, and no differences in several cases; crop quality was often unchanged (1351). Studies also found that legume winter cover crops were associated with higher cash crop yields than non-legumes in Italy and Spain (and in the USA) (1351).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

For soil nutrients, some experiments reported higher soil nitrogen, ammonium, phosphorus and potassium under organic fertilization, though several studies found similar levels, and one study observed lower nitrate with organic inputs; soil pH responses were mixed (higher, lower, or similar depending on study) [1366]. Soil biological responses included higher microbial biomass in some comparisons, but some studies found fewer bacteria, nematodes or mites under organic fertilization [1366]. Soil structure sometimes improved, with greater aggregation in some trials, though others found no difference [1366]. Greenhouse gas outcomes were mixed: some studies recorded higher CO2 emissions with organic fertilizers, similar or greater soil CH4 uptake in some cases, and similar or lower N2O emissions in others; effects varied with organic input type (e.g., solid organic fertilizers associated with lower N2O than inorganic, liquid/slurry sometimes increasing CH4 emissions compared with manure) [1366]. For crop production, replicated trials in Mediterranean countries found yields that were sometimes higher with organic fertilizers, sometimes lower, and sometimes similar to inorganic fertilizers; in one Spanish study, alfalfa yield was higher with organic fertilizer in one of two comparisons [1350].

One replicated site comparison reported more weeds in orchards adjacent to restored riparian habitats than those next to remnant habitats, with older restored sites associated with more weeds than younger restored sites (1402). Soil water amounts were similar between restored and remnant riparian habitats (1388).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Adding pig slurry increased crop yields in some comparisons across six replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Spain; two studies found similar yields between digested and untreated slurry, while one study reported lower yields with less slurry than more and another found similar yields across amounts [1349]. Adding manure increased maize yields in two of three comparisons in one replicated, randomized, controlled study from Greece, while another replicated, randomized, controlled study from Italy found similar nectarine yields with or without manure [1347].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Replicated studies from Italy, Spain, and Syria found more organic matter with reduced tillage in some or all comparisons, with two studies finding similar amounts compared to conventional tillage (1371). Replicated studies from Italy, Spain, and the USA found more organic matter with no tillage in some or all comparisons; one randomized study from Portugal found less under no tillage in some comparisons, one study from Spain found mixed results, and three studies from Italy and Spain found similar amounts with or without tillage (1369). Direct comparisons in Spain found more organic matter under no tillage than reduced tillage in some or all comparisons, while other studies found similar amounts; no studies found less organic matter under no tillage than reduced tillage (1370). Across broader evidence including Europe and Morocco, eight studies found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage, while one randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon under conventional tillage, and other studies reported higher soil organic carbon under no-tillage or reduced tillage than conventional (906).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the documented trade-offs of growing cover crops in arable fields regarding crop yield and water availability in Mediterranean climates?\nanswer: Replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Spain reported mixed effects on water use: one found cover crops used more water than bare fallows, while another found no difference [1357]. Controlled studies, including from France, Israel, and Spain, found that plots with cover crops lost less water through drainage, runoff, or evaporation in some or all comparisons, though one replicated, randomized, controlled study from Spain found greater drainage losses with winter cover crops in some comparisons [1357]. For crop yields, six replicated, controlled studies (five randomized) from Spain and the USA found lower cash crop yields with winter cover crops in some comparisons; three replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Italy and the USA found higher yields in some comparisons; seven controlled studies (six replicated, four randomized) from France, Israel, Spain, and the USA found no yield differences; and eight replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Italy and the USA reported inconsistent yield differences (sometimes higher, sometimes lower) [1351].

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: How does planting flowers compare to planting hedgerows for supporting pollinators on Mediterranean farmland?\nanswer: Planting flowers: A replicated, controlled study from Spain found more pollinators on coriander flowers next to planted flower strips than next to unplanted field margins [1406, 2468]. Replicated studies from Spain and Italy reported that some planted flower species were more attractive to pollinators than others, and that planting more flower species sometimes increased pollinator numbers and sometimes decreased them; in Italy, bee numbers increased over time with three or six flower species but decreased with nine species [1406, 2468]. Planting hedgerows: Replicated, paired site comparisons from the USA found higher crop visitation rates by native bees, but not by honey bees or syrphid flies, next to planted hedgerows compared to unplanted edges; another study found no difference in bee visitation next to planted edges [1407, 2515]. Multiple replicated studies from the USA found more bee species (and in some cases more syrphid fly species or individuals) in fields with hedgerows or within hedgerows than in fields or edges without hedgerows; one study found fewer ground-nesting bees in planted hedgerows than in unplanted edges [1407, 2515]. Implementation findings for hedgerows indicated more bee (and sometimes syrphid fly) species in older than younger hedgerows, and in old hedgerows more bee species on native than non-native plants [1407, 2515].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
