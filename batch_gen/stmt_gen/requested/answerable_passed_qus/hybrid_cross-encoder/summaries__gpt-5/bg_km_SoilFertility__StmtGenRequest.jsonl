[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: How do the effects of growing cover crops between crop rows compare to growing them when a field is empty?\nanswer: Between crop rows in perennial systems (orchards/vineyards), ground cover generally produced similar grape yields in several trials, though some trials reported lower yields; effects on other perennial crops were mixed, with higher chestnut yields under resident vegetation but lower avocado yields under seeded grasses/legumes (ID: 1352). In these inter-row settings, biodiversity responses included more birds and higher bird diversity with resident vegetation versus bare, tilled row-middles, and more mushrooms and mushroom species with cover crops without tillage (ID: 2333; ID: 1413). In arable systems when fields were empty (winter/off-season), cover crops sometimes reduced weed numbers and weed species richness, sometimes increased weeds, and sometimes had no effect compared to no cover or winter fallow; weed community composition also differed (ID: 1394). Off-season cover crops produced mixed pest and disease outcomes compared to winter fallow or no cover: lettuces were less severely diseased in some comparisons, broccoli and tomato seedling disease was often similar, and tomato damage differences were inconsistent; numbers of other pests (e.g., mites, leafminers, nematodes) and soil fungi also showed mixed or no consistent differences (ID: 1394). Within arable crops using living mulches between crop rows, some comparisons found fewer aphids but also fewer parasitized aphids relative to no cover (ID: 1394).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the benefits and drawbacks of different tillage practices on sandy loam soils in Europe?\nanswer: Across studies including Europe and soils such as sandy loam, reduced or no-tillage often increased soil organic carbon compared to conventional tillage, with several studies and reviews reporting higher carbon under no/reduced tillage, though one randomized, replicated trial in Spain found greater carbon under conventional tillage and one Canadian trial found no effect (906). Reduced tillage frequently maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure, with some studies finding higher nutrient retention; however, one controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till (while conventionally tilled soil lost more) and effects on soil nitrogen were mixed (906). For erosion, multiple replicated trials (including in Europe) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage, but no-tillage increased soil loss when crop cover was absent; delaying ploughing until spring in Denmark and Norway reduced soil loss and nitrate leaching (906, 712). Regarding soil water and drought-related properties, conventional ploughing and sub-soiling decreased soil crack size and increased infiltration and water content in replicated European and Indian trials (906). Compaction responses were mixed: some trials found reduced compaction under controlled traffic and reduced tillage, while others found higher compaction under reduced tillage (906). Yield responses varied: one Canadian study reported lower yields under minimum/no-tillage, a U.S. study found higher yields with subsoiling, and a Portuguese study found no yield effect of tillage treatment (906).
