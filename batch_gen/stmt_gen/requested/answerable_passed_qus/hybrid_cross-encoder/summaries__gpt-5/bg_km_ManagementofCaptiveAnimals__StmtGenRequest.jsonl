A replicated before\u2011and\u2011after study in Australia found increased breeding success when a pre\u2011breeding cooling period was provided in combination with other husbandry changes (females allowed to gain weight, sexes separated outside breeding season, mate choice, and recorded mating calls) [1864]. Two replicated before\u2011and\u2011after studies in Germany and Austria found that simulating wet and dry seasons (and, in Austria, moving animals to an enclosure with more egg\u2011laying sites and flowing water) stimulated breeding and egg deposition; in Germany, no toadlets survived past 142 days [1872]. A review and replicated studies reported that reproductive success in captivity depended on temperature or a simulated wet and dry season in some cases [835]. No evidence was captured on using sound recordings of rain and/or thunderstorms to simulate rainfall [1867]. No evidence was captured for allowing temperate species to hibernate [1868], for providing dormancy during simulated drought in highly seasonal species [1869], or for varying water flow/speed for torrent\u2011breeding species [1870]. One replicated study in the UK found no difference in clutch size with a UV lighting boost compared to background levels, but UV\u2011boosted frogs had higher fungal loads [1865].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: In a captive breeding program for Australian frogs, what are the most effective interventions to stimulate successful breeding?\nanswer: Evidence from reviews and replicated studies reports that hormone treatments can stimulate breeding by inducing sperm release in males and, with mixed outcomes, egg production in females; sperm quantity and viability depend on hormone type, dose, and dosing frequency, and eggs induced by hormones have been raised successfully to tadpoles or froglets in several cases [883]. Providing natural substrates (e.g., varied substrates) and enclosure furniture such as rotting logs and hollow bamboo pipes promoted egg laying; in one Australian study these were combined with temporary enclosure flooding, sex\u2011ratio manipulation, and playing recorded mating calls when breeding occurred [1874, 1876]. Allowing female mate choice was associated with breeding only after introducing egg\u2011bearing females, manipulating sex ratios, playing recorded calls, moving frogs to indoor enclosures permitting temporary flooding with organic substrates, and, in another Australian before\u2011and\u2011after study, increased clutch size when female choice was provided alongside recorded calls, separating sexes outside the breeding period, and allowing females to gain weight before breeding [1882]. Across captive frog programs, reproductive success depended on temperature or simulating wet and dry seasons; breeding began after adding more calling, perching, and laying sites together with simulated wet/dry seasons, and development was affected by parental care, density, and temperature [835, 1876].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

In lemurs, a fruit-free diet was associated with lower aggression and reduced self-directed behaviour [1329]. No studies were found that directly tested the effects of seasonally modifying ingredients/nutrient composition to reflect natural variability in primate diets [1336].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Supplementing an animal-protein diet with taurine increased plasma taurine levels in maned wolves [1908]. Scattering food around the enclosure increased locomotion, and maned wolves spent more time in the section with scattered food than in a section with food on a tray [1921]. Hiding food around the enclosure increased exploring and foraging behaviours in a study that included maned wolves among other carnivores [1915].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
