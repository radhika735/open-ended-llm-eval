Effects on combined macroalgae and invertebrate richness/diversity were mixed and depended on site and the presence/size of grooves, small ridges, or ledges on surfaces [3472]. One study in Australia reported increased mobile invertebrate species richness on treated surfaces [3472]. For fishes, two of three Australian studies found no increase in species richness, while one found mixed effects depending on surface features and site [3472]. For abundance, one Australian study found no increase in combined macroalgae and invertebrates, and another found mixed effects depending on surface micro\u2011features [3472]. Invertebrate abundance responses were mixed; findings included increased non\u2011mobile invertebrate and oyster recruit abundance and decreased barnacle abundance in one study, and increased oyster and mobile invertebrate abundance in another [3472]. Fish abundance generally did not increase in two of three Australian studies, and in one study was similar regardless of groove/ridge size [3472]. Survival of transplanted invertebrates (including oysters) varied with species, site, and microhabitat features; oyster survival was higher in grooves than on ridges in one study, and survival in grooves/ledges varied by site in another [3472]. A behavioral study in Australia found no increase in time fishes interacted with surfaces or number of bites after transplanting oysters and/or coralline algae, though benthic fishes took more bites from surfaces with transplanted oysters than from those with algae plus oysters; these results held regardless of grooves/ridges [3472].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Creating small adjoining cavities (\u2018swimthroughs\u2019 \u2264100 mm) had mixed effects on juvenile fish community composition, richness and abundance depending on site, month and development stage, but supported six species absent from structures without swimthroughs and were used by adult and juvenile fishes [3436]. Creating hole habitats (>50 mm), often combined with grooves, pits and environmentally-sensitive material, altered mobile invertebrate and fish community composition and supported fish species absent from plain surfaces; fish abundances showed mixed or no increases depending on study [3434]. Creating groove habitats (1\u201350 mm), often with other features, altered community composition and supported fish species absent from plain surfaces; fish abundances showed mixed effects [3448]. Creating pit habitats (1\u201350 mm), with other features, altered community composition and supported fish species absent from plain surfaces; fish abundances showed mixed effects [3455]. Creating long flexible habitats (>50 mm) had mixed effects on fish species richness and fish/seahorse abundance and were used by seahorses [3451]. Creating short flexible habitats (1\u201350 mm) had mixed effects on seahorse abundance [3450]. Using environmentally-sensitive material (e.g., ECOncrete or rock), often alongside added habitat features, supported fish species absent from standard surfaces and had mixed effects on fish abundance depending on species [3470]. Transplanting or seeding organisms (e.g., oysters) onto structures increased combined invertebrate and fish species richness and diversity and altered community composition; overall combined abundance did not increase, with effects varying among species [3471]. Managing or restricting harvesting around structures was associated with higher fish species richness, different fish community composition including species absent from unrestricted sites, and higher seabream abundance; total fish abundance responses varied and access restrictions did not fully prevent harvesting [3457]. Creating artificial reefs of different 3\u2011D structure/material often showed no differences in combined mobile invertebrate and fish richness or abundance between designs/materials [2259]. For several actions on subtidal structures\u2014creating large/small ridges or ledges, crevice habitats, large protrusions, and reducing slope\u2014no studies were found evaluating effects on biodiversity [3445; 3444; 3454; 3443; 3442].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Creating pit habitats also shows broad support: several studies found altered combined macroalgae\u2013invertebrate composition and many reported increases in richness/diversity, though responses of abundance were mixed and context dependent [3475]. Creating grooves yielded mixed outcomes: some studies recorded higher richness/diversity and increased combined abundance (often when combined with pits), while others found no change in community composition or richness [3473]. Creating hole habitats (>50 mm) increased combined macroalgae\u2013invertebrate richness/diversity in all three studies that tested it (typically alongside pools or other microhabitats) and altered community composition when combined with grooves/ridges and modified materials; effects on abundance were mixed or null [3467].

Transplanting or seeding organisms (typically oysters) produced mixed effects on mobile invertebrate abundance, with at least one study reporting increases in oyster and mobile invertebrate abundance and others finding dependence on grooves/ridges and site (3472). Creating small ridges or ledges supported lower mobile invertebrate and oyster abundances than grooves in one study, and overall abundance effects were non-increasing or mixed in others (3464).

Small ridges or ledges (1\u201350 mm) often did not increase species richness or overall abundance; when present alongside other microhabitats outcomes were mixed, and ridges/ledges tended to support lower species richness and lower mobile invertebrate and oyster abundances than adjacent grooves, with fish richness and abundance similar to grooves (3464).

(2) Creating grooves (sometimes with pits) increased combined macroalgae\u2013invertebrate species richness and, in some cases, overall abundance; fish richness, abundance, and feeding bites increased when grooves were paired with pits; other studies found no increase in richness or abundance, and responses varied by site and configuration (3473). (3) Creating small protrusions increased combined macroalgae\u2013invertebrate species richness, but did not alter community composition in one study; effects on overall abundance were mixed and sometimes non-significant (3462). (4) Creating small ridges/ledges showed mixed outcomes: one Singapore study found no change in community composition or richness with ridges alone, while another study that combined ridges with grooves, protrusions, and pits reported increased richness but site- and configuration-dependent composition and abundance; studies elsewhere reported grooves between ledges often outperform ledges themselves (3464). (5) Combining grooves with small ridges/ledges (and sometimes holes or pits) altered community composition in some Singapore studies, supported species absent from plain concrete, increased species richness in several cases, and yielded mixed effects on overall and group-specific abundances depending on groove/ridge size, shore level, covers, and site; some studies detected no increase in overall abundance (3474).

Across these locations, created rock pools supported macroalgae, invertebrate, and/or fish species that were absent from adjacent structure surfaces, though one Australian study reported mixed community outcomes depending on pool depth, shore level, and site (3476). In Ireland, community composition varied with shore level and wave exposure, and wave\u2011sheltered pools infilled with sediment within two years (3476). Richness outcomes also varied across sites: most replicated controlled studies reported higher species richness/diversity in created pools than on flat surfaces, while several found similar richness, and one reported lower mobile invertebrate and fish richness compared to natural pools; effects sometimes varied by site, shore level, pool angle, and whether pools were tilted or horizontal (3476). Abundances and fish metrics showed mixed responses that depended on species group and site, indicating location\u2011dependent outcomes across the studied regions (3476).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

In contrast, long flexible habitats (>50 mm) supported macroalgae and non\u2011mobile invertebrate or fish species absent from controls, and altered non\u2011mobile invertebrate community composition (Action 3451). Long habitats yielded higher combined macroalgae and invertebrate biomass than controls, with deeper habitats supporting higher biomass; invertebrate abundance responses were mixed, including decreased mussel abundance on structure surfaces alongside higher biomass on the flexible habitats themselves (Action 3451). Fish species richness and fish/seahorse abundances showed mixed responses depending on species, prior presence, or survey week, and seahorses used the long habitats (Action 3451).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Creating groove habitats (1\u201350 mm) sometimes increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate richness/diversity, though several studies found no increase or mixed, site-dependent effects; grooves supported higher species richness than small ridges/ledges in some comparisons (3473). Creating small ridges or ledges (1\u201350 mm) did not generally increase combined richness and, in comparative studies, supported lower species richness than grooves; one study with multiple habitat types reported increased richness with mixed effects by size/arrangement and shore level (3464). Creating short flexible habitats (1\u201350 mm) decreased combined macroalgae, invertebrate and fish species richness during low tide in one study, with mixed effects on mobile invertebrates at high tide (3459). Using environmentally-sensitive materials showed mixed outcomes: ECOncrete with added grooves, small ledges and holes increased species richness and diversity in one study, while hemp-, shell-, or reduced-pH concrete alone did not increase combined richness; limestone-cement with pits, grooves, small ridges and texture had mixed, site-dependent effects (3469).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What biodiversity outcomes have been observed from interventions on intertidal artificial structures in Australian estuaries?\nanswer: In Australian estuaries, reducing the slope of intertidal artificial structures, alongside creating rock pools, increased combined macroalgae, invertebrate and fish species richness, but did not increase macroalgal, oyster or mobile invertebrate abundance on surfaces [3461]. Transplanting or seeding (e.g., oysters, coralline algae) supported species absent from untreated surfaces, produced mixed effects on combined macroalgae/invertebrate richness/diversity depending on site and surface features, increased mobile invertebrate species richness, and generally did not increase fish richness or abundance in two of three studies; fish interaction time did not increase, though benthic fishes took more bites from oyster-only transplants than from combined algae\u2013oyster transplants [3472]. Creating hole habitats (often with rock pools or grooves/ridges) supported species absent from controls, increased combined macroalgae/invertebrate richness/diversity, did not increase invertebrate abundance in one study, had shore- and site-dependent effects on limpet abundance, and was used by sea slugs, urchins and octopuses [3467]. Creating short flexible habitats altered community composition, decreased combined macroalgae\u2013invertebrate\u2013fish richness at low tide, did not increase combined mobile invertebrate and fish abundance at low tide, and had mixed effects on macroalgal and invertebrate abundances; fish biting rates did not increase [3459]. Creating pit habitats altered community composition in some studies, increased combined macroalgae/invertebrate richness/diversity in several studies but not others, increased limpet and periwinkle richness with effects varying by pit arrangement, and produced mixed invertebrate abundance responses including increases for some barnacles and mobile invertebrates [3475]. Evidence gaps remain: no studies were found on creating crevice habitats or on controlling/removing non-native or nuisance species on intertidal artificial structures [3437, 3439].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
