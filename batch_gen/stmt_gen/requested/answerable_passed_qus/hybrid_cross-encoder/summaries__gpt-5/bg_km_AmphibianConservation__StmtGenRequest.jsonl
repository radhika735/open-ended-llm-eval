Treating wild or pre-release amphibians with fungicide alongside pond drying reduced infection levels but did not eradicate chytridiomycosis in a before-and-after study on midwife toads in Mallorca [767, 766]. Heat treatment by raising enclosure or water temperature to 30\u201337\u00b0C for over 16 hours cured frogs and toads in 4/5 studies, though one study found 30\u201335\u00b0C for 36 hours did not cure northern leopard frogs [770]. Adding salt to a pond with chytrid was followed by a green and golden bell frog population remaining free of chytridiomycosis for at least six months in one study [762]. Probiotic approaches had mixed results: in three of four randomized, replicated, controlled studies, adding antifungal bacteria to amphibian skin did not reduce infection rate or death, while one study showed prevention of infection and death; adding antifungal bacteria to soil reduced infection in red-backed salamanders in one study; antimicrobial skin peptides did not significantly increase survival in one study; and three studies found antifungal bacteria reduced weight loss in infected amphibians [764].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Removing invasive Cuban tree frogs was followed by increases in squirrel tree frog and green tree frog abundance (822). Removing American bullfrogs significantly increased a population of California red\u2011legged frogs, eradication increased the range of leopard frogs, and red\u2011legged frogs were observed out in the open twice as frequently after removal (825). Predator control targeting mammals showed no significant effect on Hochstetter\u2019s frog when rats were controlled, but survival of Maud Island frogs was significantly higher in a predator\u2011proof enclosure, and 58% of translocated Hamilton\u2019s frogs survived their first year in a predator\u2011proof enclosure (839). Removing fish by catching increased abundance of salamanders or frogs and improved recruitment, survival and population growth rate of cascades frog in multiple studies, but had no significant effect on great crested newts in one UK case and did not increase green toad breeding success in Sweden, with fish persisting or being reintroduced (827).

Releasing captive-bred amphibians is another approach: one review found 41% of programmes showed breeding in the wild for multiple generations, 29% showed some breeding and 12% showed survival following release [871]; captive-bred frogs released as tadpoles, juveniles or adults established populations or stable breeding populations at 88\u2013100% of sites in several studies (with some failures), and sometimes colonized new sites [870]; captive-bred salamanders/newts released at various life-stages established stable breeding populations in one study [874]. Head-starting (rearing eggs/larvae to later stages before release) has established breeding populations or increased populations in several cases, though results are mixed; many studies report successful metamorphosis, seasonal survival and breeding after release [881].

Culverts/tunnels were used by amphibians in 15 of 24 studies (15\u201385% of individuals or 3\u201315 species, or 23\u2013100% of structures used), with usage influenced by factors such as diameter, length, lighting, substrate, water presence, and tunnel climate; many sites had barrier fencing guiding animals to entrances [884].

Barrier fencing with culverts decreased road deaths when fence length and material were effective [756]. Barriers at least 0.6 m high were required to prevent green frogs and leopard frogs from climbing over, though treefrogs and around 10% of common toads were recorded climbing over barriers during breeding migrations [756].\n- Design cautions: One-way tunnels with vertical entry chutes led to high mortality of common toads, and condensation deposits from steel culverts had very high metal concentrations [884].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Legal protection of amphibian species during development was reported as not effective at protecting populations in reviews from the Netherlands and UK [779]. The number of great crested newt mitigation licences issued in England and Wales increased over a 10\u2011year period to over 600 under the legal protection framework [779]. In South Africa, the number of permits issued for scientific and educational use of amphibians increased from 1987 to 1990 under permitting systems [785].

Itraconazole was effective at curing in six of eight studies; one study reported reduced infection levels and one mixed effects. Six studies found specific fungicides caused death or other negative side effects [882].\n- Adding antifungal skin bacteria did not reduce infection rate or death in three of four randomized, replicated, controlled studies; one study found prevention of infection and death. Adding antifungal bacteria to soil reduced infection rate in red-backed salamanders in one study. Treatment with antimicrobial skin peptides before or after infection did not significantly increase survival in one study. Three studies found adding antifungal skin bacteria reduced weight loss in infected amphibians [764].\n- Treating wild midwife toads with fungicide, along with pond drying, reduced infection levels but did not eradicate chytridiomycosis in a before-and-after study; this involved treatment in the wild or pre-release contexts [767].\n- Addition of salt to a pond where the chytrid fungus was present was followed by a population of green and golden bell frogs remaining free of chytridiomycosis for at least six months in one study [762].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: For road mitigation projects, what design factors are associated with the success or failure of tunnels and culverts for amphibian passage?\nanswer: Evidence from studies on amphibian road crossings reports that culvert/tunnel use and mortality outcomes are associated with multiple design and contextual factors: wider culverts were used more often (diameter effect), longer culverts were avoided, lighting had mixed effects, natural substrates were used more than artificial substrates, the presence of water had mixed effects, entrance location affected use in one study, and tunnel climate affected use in one study [884]. One study found culverts/tunnels decreased road deaths only when barrier fencing was also installed, and most culverts/tunnels assessed had barrier fencing to guide amphibians to entrances [884]. Certain designs were unsuitable: one-way tunnels with vertical entry chutes resulted in high mortality of common toads, and condensation deposits from steel culverts had very high metal concentrations [884]. Barrier fencing design influenced effectiveness: decreased deaths depended on fence length and material being effective; barriers at least 0.6 m high were required to prevent green frogs and leopard frogs climbing over; some species (treefrogs and 10% of common toads) climbed over fencing during breeding migrations [756]. Reported use rates varied widely (e.g., 15\u201385% of individuals, 3\u201315 species; some studies reported <10% use or no use), and in one case thousands of amphibians were still killed on the road [884].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
