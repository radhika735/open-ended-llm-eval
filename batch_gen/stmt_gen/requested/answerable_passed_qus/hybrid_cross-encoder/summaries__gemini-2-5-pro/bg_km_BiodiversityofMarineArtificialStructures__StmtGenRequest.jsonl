However, the effects on combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness and diversity were mixed, depending on the site and the physical characteristics of the structure's surface (3472). In one study, transplanting oysters increased mobile invertebrate species richness (3472). Conversely, transplanting oysters or coralline algae did not lead to an increase in fish species richness or abundance in two out of three studies (3472). Similarly, one study found no increase in the combined abundance of macroalgae and invertebrates after transplanting oysters (3472). The survival of invertebrates transplanted onto these structures varied based on the species, site, and the presence of features like grooves and ridges on the surfaces (3472). One study also noted that transplanting oysters did not increase the time fish spent interacting with the surfaces (3472).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

For subtidal structures, creating small swimthroughs (\u2264100 mm) has shown mixed effects on juvenile fish communities, with some studies finding no change in community composition or richness, while others noted the presence of species not found on structures without swimthroughs (3436). The impact on juvenile fish abundance was also species, site, and month-dependent (3436). However, these small swimthroughs were observed to be used by a variety of marine life, including juvenile spiny lobsters, sea firs, and both adult and juvenile fish (3436). For large swimthroughs (>100 mm) on subtidal structures, studies have reported an increase in overall fish species richness and abundance, although these effects varied with fish size, species, and time of year (3456). These larger habitats also supported fish species not present on unmodified structures and were used by juvenile spiny lobsters, groupers, sea firs, and adult fish (3456).

The effectiveness of this method is influenced by several factors. The combined species richness and diversity of macroalgae and invertebrates are affected by the specific site and the presence and size of grooves, small ridges, or ledges on the artificial surfaces (3472). While transplanting oysters can increase mobile invertebrate species richness, it has been found to not always increase fish species richness or abundance (3472).

However, one study in Australia showed mixed effects on community composition depending on the depth of the pool, the shore level and the site (3476). Another study in Ireland revealed that shore level and wave-exposure influenced community composition, and pools that were sheltered from waves filled with sediment within a two-year timeframe (3476). Nine out of twelve studies in Australia, the UK, Spain, and Malaysia indicated that the creation of rock pools led to a higher diversity and/or richness of combined macroalgae, invertebrate, and/or fish species compared to structure surfaces without pools (3476). In contrast, a study in Australia reported that adding short flexible habitats into the pools had mixed effects on the abundance of macroalgae, invertebrates and fish, with outcomes varying by species group and site (3476).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Long flexible habitats supported macroalgae, non-mobile invertebrates, and fish species that were not present on structures without these habitats (3451). Short flexible habitats showed mixed results on invertebrate community composition, depending on habitat density, length, and location, and in one study, they did not increase invertebrate species richness (3450). For invertebrates, long flexible habitats had varied effects on abundance depending on species, survey timing, and habitat characteristics, with one study noting a decrease in mussel abundance on the structure but an increase in biomass (mostly mussels) on the flexible habitats themselves (3451). Short flexible habitats also had mixed effects on invertebrate abundance, varying with survey week, species, habitat length, and location (3450). In terms of fish, long flexible habitats had inconsistent effects on fish and seahorse abundance and species richness, influenced by factors like the timing of habitat creation and survey week (3451). Short flexible habitats also showed mixed results on seahorse abundance, depending on the survey week (3450). Additionally, one study reported that seahorses used the long flexible habitats (3451).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What biodiversity outcomes have been observed from interventions on intertidal artificial structures in Australian estuaries?\nanswer: Interventions on intertidal artificial structures in Australian estuaries have shown varied biodiversity outcomes. Transplanting oysters has been found to support macroalgae, mobile invertebrates, non-mobile invertebrates, and fish species that were not present on surfaces without the transplanted oysters (3472). However, the effect of transplanting oysters on combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness and diversity is mixed, depending on the site and other physical characteristics of the structures (3472). While transplanting oysters was found to increase mobile invertebrate species richness, it did not increase fish species richness or abundance in most cases studied (3472). Creating hole habitats on these structures, in conjunction with other features like rock pools or grooves, has been shown to alter the overall community composition and support macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate species that were absent from surfaces without these features (3467). This creation of habitats also led to an increase in the combined macroalgae and invertebrate species diversity and richness (3467). However, creating hole habitats did not increase macroalgal or invertebrate abundance in some studies, though the holes were used by sea slugs, urchins, and octopuses (3467). In one study, reducing the slope of an intertidal artificial structure, along with creating rock pools, increased the combined macroalgae, invertebrate, and fish species richness on the structure (3461). However, reducing the slope did not lead to an increase in the abundance of macroalgae, oysters, or mobile invertebrates (3461).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

In contrast, another study revealed that the introduction of grooves and small ledges enhanced the richness of mobile invertebrate species (3474). However, a separate study indicated that creating grooves and small ridges had inconsistent impacts on the species richness of mobile and non-mobile invertebrates, with the effects varying based on the size of the grooves and ridges, as well as the specific location (3474). Furthermore, five out of seven replicated, randomized, and controlled studies reported that the creation of groove habitats and small protrusions, ridges, or ledges on intertidal artificial structures produced mixed effects on the abundance of mobile invertebrates. These effects were contingent upon various factors, including the depth and height of the grooves and ridges, the existence of large ledges or water-retaining and light-shading covers, the shore level, and the specific site (3474). Additionally, two studies observed that while the creation of grooves and small ridges or ledges boosted oyster abundance, it did not have the same effect on the abundance of mobile invertebrates (3474).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
