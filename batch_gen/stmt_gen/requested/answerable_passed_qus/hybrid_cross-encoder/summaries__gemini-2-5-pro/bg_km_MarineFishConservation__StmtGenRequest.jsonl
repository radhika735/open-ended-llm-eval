In terms of fish diversity, one study in the Caribbean Sea noted lower total fish species richness in areas closed to fishing compared to unprotected areas (2681), while a global review reported that one of 11 studies found higher fish species richness inside reserves (2680). \n\nRegarding fish abundance, a global review indicated that 10 of 11 studies found higher fish abundance within marine reserves (2680). In contrast, a study in the Pacific Ocean observed similar abundance levels of certain rockfish and lingcod between 'no-take' reserves and fished areas (2681). Another study in the Caribbean Sea found similar total fish biomass but lower total fish density in a restricted area compared to an unprotected one (2681). \n\nOther observed effects include increased survival for cod in one study (2681) and higher survival for blackspot snapper in another (2680). Additionally, some studies found that fish were of a larger average size and reached older ages within marine parks with fishing restrictions (2680).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

A review of 26 studies, many of which were conducted in European waters, found that 10 of 16 studies reported that square mesh codends reduced unwanted or non-marketable catches of various fish species when compared to diamond mesh codends (2714). However, four of these studies found no reduction in unwanted catches for certain species, and another study found that unwanted catch was dependent on mesh size as well as shape (2714). In terms of size selectivity, 6 of 14 studies found that square mesh codends improved size selectivity for several fish species, while 5 studies found no difference (2714). The effect of the mesh shape on size selectivity could also vary depending on the fish's body shape (2714). Additionally, there is evidence that the short-term survival of some fish species is higher after escaping through a square mesh codend (2714). One study in the English Channel discovered that a trawl net with a square mesh codend and square mesh escape panels was effective in reducing the amount of discarded finfish in comparison to a diamond mesh codend without panels (2724).

Another study in the Gulf of Maine found smaller but similar condition monkfish inside a closed area compared to an open one [2655]. Two studies in the Gulf of Maine and Bismark Sea noted a higher abundance of only one of seven fish species and lower abundance of monkfish in areas closed for six to eight years [2655]. A study in the Bismark Sea observed that six of seven fish species in a closed area had a lower flight response distance, making them more vulnerable to capture [2655]. Additionally, a combination of long-term closures and gear restrictions reduced unwanted cod catch [2655].\n\nFive studies investigated temporary fishery closures. One study in the Atlantic Ocean found no increase in spawning cod biomass, no change in survival, and no change in length composition compared to fished areas over nine years [2664]. However, tagged adult cod were found to spend nearly a third of their time inside a seasonally closed spawning area, affording them increased protection [2664]. One study in the North Sea reported that temporary closures had little effect on fishing effort for cod, but real-time closures reduced the annual amount of cod caught [2664]. In terms of commercial catch, one study in the Philippine Sea and Mediterranean Sea found that during a temporary closure of a grouper fishery, spear fishers' catch of other fish groups increased [2664].

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the observed effects of fitting deterrents, such as lights or electropositive materials, to fishing gear?\nanswer: Nine studies investigated the effects of electropositive deterrents on fishing gear (2696). Of these, three of four studies found that these deterrents reduced feeding attempts and bait consumption by some shark species (2696). Two of four studies also found that fishing gear with electropositive deterrents caught fewer unwanted fish, sharks, and rays (2696). However, two other studies and a global systematic review found that these deterrents had no effect on the catch of unwanted sharks and rays (2696). One study on visual deterrents found that gillnets with floating shark shapes attached caught fewer green turtles than unmodified nets (3553). Another study showed that shark-shaped and spherical deterrents had mixed effects on loggerhead turtle behaviour (3553). In two studies on the use of artificial lights, one found that shrimp trawl nets with lights caught fewer unwanted fish, but the lights did not improve size-selectivity for certain fish species on a sorting grid (2695).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the most effective spatial management actions for protecting spawning fish and their habitats?\nanswer: Protecting spawning fish from capture (2938) had no effect on Atlantic cod biomass, survival, or length over nine years in one study, though tagged cod and school sharks did use the closed areas (2938). Another study found that a temporary closure for grouper led to increased fishing pressure on other species (2938). Similarly, establishing temporary fishery closures (2664) showed no change in cod stock biomass, survival, or length composition in one study, though tagged cod did use the seasonally closed spawning area (2664). Real-time closures were found to be more effective at reducing cod catch than fixed temporary closures (2664).\n\nRestricting fishing in a marine protected area (2680) was found in a global review to result in higher fish abundance in 10 of 11 studies and larger fish in 5 of 11 studies (2680). For example, a study on blackspot snapper found higher survival and larger sizes within a marine park (2680). Prohibiting all fishing in a marine protected area (2681) led to increased cod survival in one study, and sharks were observed to use the protected areas, reducing their mortality risk (2681). However, another study found lower fish species richness in a protected area, and two other studies found similar fish abundance for some species when comparing protected and unprotected areas (2681). Designating a Marine Protected Area with some fishing restrictions (2239) was found to increase the number of lobsters and scallops in a global review (2239). Other studies noted increased numbers of sea cucumbers, hydrozoans, and sponges in a protected area (2239).\n\nNo studies were found that evaluated the effects of releasing fish that are carrying eggs or live young (2733).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: How does the effectiveness of no-take marine protected areas on fish communities differ between the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean?\nanswer: Studies in both the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean found that prohibiting all fishing in a protected area resulted in a different fish community composition compared to fished areas (2682). In both regions, studies also found higher fish species richness and abundance in no-take marine protected areas, although some studies found similar levels to fished areas (2682). The effect on fish abundance can vary between species and groups in both the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean (2682, 2674).\n\nIn terms of fish size, studies in both the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea have found that no-take protected areas host larger fish compared to fished areas (2682). Specifically in the Indian Ocean, a study on zoned marine protected areas found larger fish in the no-take zones compared to partially fished zones (2674). Another study in the Indian Ocean noted that the stock biomass of reef fish was highest in enforced protected areas that were closed to all fishing (2682).\n\nA study in the Mediterranean Sea found a higher number of eggs from commercially targeted fish species within a non-fished reserve (2682), and also that commercial fish catch rates were highest closest to a no-take reserve (2682). In the Indian Ocean, one study observed higher fish grazing rates in non-fished areas (2682). Another study in the Indian Ocean found that most individuals of five tagged fish species stayed within a marine reserve zone closed to fishing over a nine-year period (2682).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
