Similarly, seven studies in bogs and fens in the UK, Finland, and Sweden reported that cutting trees and rewetting the peat increased the cover of at least one group of herbs, including cottongrasses and sedges (1732). Two replicated, paired, controlled studies in rich fens in Sweden noted that simply cutting trees increased total plant species richness (1731). In comparison, two replicated, paired, controlled studies in the same area found that cutting trees and rewetting also increased plant species richness, while two other replicated studies in Finnish fens showed no effect on total plant species richness or diversity (1732).\n\nWhen it comes to moss cover, one study on simply cutting trees in UK bogs reported a reduction in forest-characteristic mosses (1731). Another study in a Swedish fen found a decrease in Sphagnum moss cover after tree removal, while a different study in partly rewetted rich fens showed an increase in Sphagnum cover (1731). For cutting trees and rewetting, two studies in Sweden and Finland found that this intervention increased Sphagnum cover (1732). Three studies in the UK and Finland observed that this combination of actions reduced the cover of non-Sphagnum or forest-characteristic mosses (1732). Two before-and-after studies in Finland and Sweden indicated that cutting trees and rewetting increased the abundance of wetland-characteristic plants (1732).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
