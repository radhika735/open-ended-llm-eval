Additionally, a study in Hong Kong noted that tree guards led to increased tree height after 37 months, but this effect was not observed at 44 months (1268). In Panama, a replicated, controlled study demonstrated that shading improved the survival rate of planted native tree seedlings (1269). One study in a coastal swamp in Brazil indicated that adding manure to plots with planted tree seedlings had varied effects on survival and growth over three years, depending on the tree species and the amount of manure used (3311). Another study reports that the impact of soaking black willow cuttings before planting on their survival depended on the post-planting water regime; however, all cuttings soaked for 15 days died within 42 days of planting (3361). Seven replicated studies in peat swamp forests in Southeast Asia and bogs in Canada have shown that a majority of planted trees and shrubs survived over periods ranging from 10 weeks to 13 years (1820). Two studies in Canadian bogs reported conflicting results regarding fertilizer use: one found that it increased the survival of two tree species, while the other found it had no effect on three species and reduced the survival of one (1826). In the UK, Germany, and Canada, five studies in bogs indicated that fertilizer generally enhanced the growth of planted vegetation, including trees. However, in some cases, it had no impact on growth (1826). Another study in the Netherlands showed that liming typically lowered the survival of planted fen herbs after two growing seasons (1825).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

However, a study in Colombia found that deforestation rates in community-managed forests did not differ from those in forests not managed by local communities or in uninhabited national parks (1152). One study in Belize found that black howler monkey populations increased by 138% over 13 years when local communities received monetary benefits, alongside other interventions (1509). In the Republic of Congo, a study found that most central chimpanzees reintroduced to an area where local communities received monetary benefits, alongside other interventions, survived over five years (1509). Conversely, a study in Rwanda, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo found that mountain gorilla numbers declined by 28% over 41 years despite development projects in nearby communities and other interventions (1509). In India, a community-based restoration program in a coastal wetland led to an increase in the area of high-quality mangrove forest and a decrease in degraded mangrove forest (3390). In Senegal, a switch from authoritarian protection to community-based management in a wetland National Park resulted in fewer fines for illegal activities (3390).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Three of these studies discovered that thinning reduced the abundance and species richness of epiphytic plants [1212]. Additionally, three studies reported varied effects, which were dependent on the specific thinning method used and the plant species in question [1212].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Two studies in Spain found that thinning increased plant species richness (1234). One in Canada found that it increased the cover of aspen saplings (1234). One study in the USA found thinning decreased plant biomass and one in Israel found it decreased mortality of pine seedlings (1234). One paired-site study in Canada found that logging after wildfire decreased species richness and diversity of mosses (1234). There is no evidence for the effects of planting trees after wildfire on forests (1235).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
