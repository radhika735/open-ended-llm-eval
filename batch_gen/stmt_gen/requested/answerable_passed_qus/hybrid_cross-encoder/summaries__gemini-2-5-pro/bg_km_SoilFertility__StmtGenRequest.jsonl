In contrast, two other studies found there were fewer aphids in plots with cover crops between broccoli plants compared to those without (1394). Where cover crops are grown in winter, some studies found they can lead to less severely diseased lettuces (1394), and less water was lost through drainage, runoff or evaporation (1357). However, growing cover crops in winter can also lead to lower cash crop yields (1351). Four studies found that less nitrate was leached from soils with winter cover crops compared to soils without them (1357).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Reduced tillage has also been found to decrease soil compaction in some studies, leading to reduced water runoff [906]. Furthermore, it has been shown to lower soil loss and runoff compared to conventional ploughing [906]. Twelve studies noted higher soil organic carbon under no-tillage or reduced tillage systems [906], and eight studies observed maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure [906].\n\nDrawbacks and mixed results for reduced tillage were also reported. Three replicated trials found higher soil compaction under reduced tillage [906]. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss when there was no crop cover [906]. While some studies showed benefits, others found mixed effects on microbe diversity, no effect on earthworm or microbe activity, or mixed effects on soil nitrogen levels [906]. One trial in Spain even found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil [906]. In terms of yield, one Canadian study found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage, while a Portuguese study found no effect from the tillage treatment [906].\n\nConventional ploughing and sub-soiling were found in three trials in Europe and India to increase the soil's ability to absorb water and its water content [906].\n\nRelated practices on sandy loam soils include the use of cover crops and mulch. Cover crops have been found to increase bacterial numbers and activity in Spain and reduce erosion in France [897]. Adding mulch has been shown in European studies to increase soil animal and fungal numbers, diversity, and activity [887], and to reduce soil erosion and runoff [887].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

A review noted that this practice reduced water runoff and soil erosion, while also increasing water storage [907]. However, a replicated site comparison in Canada found mixed effects on soil physical properties [907]. Two randomized, replicated trials in Australia and China observed higher soil organic carbon and nitrogen when residues were retained, with one trial showing this effect only when fertilizer was also applied [907]. These trials also reported higher yields, though one trial specified this outcome was only achieved in combination with fertilizer application and no-tillage [907].\n\nAmending soil with fresh plant material or crop remains was found to increase microbial biomass in one randomized, replicated experiment in Belgium [910]. A study from India showed improved soil structure from incorporating straw [910]. However, a before-and-after trial in the UK found that incorporating straw did not improve compacted, anaerobic soils [910]. On the topic of erosion, one randomized, replicated study from Canada and India found that straw addition reduced soil loss, while another reported mixed effects depending on the soil type [910]. In terms of nutrient loss, four replicated studies from the UK, USA, and Belgium reported higher soil nitrogen levels when compost or straw was applied, but the results were mixed when processed wastes were added [910].

According to one experiment, using high rates of cotton gin compost and poultry manure enhanced soil structure and decreased soil loss, but it also raised nutrient loss (891). When molasses were introduced, another trial revealed enhanced nutrient retention and higher barley crop yields (891).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

For instance, some studies found that growing winter cover crops in arable fields led to lower cash crop yields, while others reported higher or inconsistent yields (1351). One study even found inconsistent differences in cash crop yields with summer cover crops (1351). In terms of crop quality, some studies in the USA found differences in tomato quality with winter cover crops, while another found inconsistent differences in cash crop quality (1351). The use of legumes as winter cover crops was found to result in higher cash crop yields compared to non-legumes (1351). In orchards and vineyards, seeding grass between vine rows was found in some US studies to lower grape yields, while other studies found similar yields (1352). One study in the USA found that forgoing tillage between vine rows could result in higher grape yields and heavier clusters in some cases (1352). Regarding soil amendments, adding compost to the soil in the USA has led to higher, inconsistent, or similar crop yields in different studies (1346). One US study also found that adding fertilizer to compost did not lead to a difference in crop yields (1346).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Controlling farm traffic might also have an impact on soil biodiversity. One study in Poland indicated that controlled traffic resulted in higher numbers and bacterial activity [899]. However, another study in Denmark found that microbial biomass was higher when farm traffic was not controlled [899]. Additionally, converting to organic farming has been shown to increase the number, diversity, and activity of soil organisms [895].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
