In terms of soil health, the presence of winter cover crops was found to increase soil organic matter in most comparisons (1345). The amount of nitrogen in the soil was also found to be higher with cover crops in some comparisons, with legumes being a particularly effective choice (1345). However, some studies found inconsistent differences in nitrogen levels (1345). One study found that cover crops increased soil potassium (1345), while another noted no change in phosphorus levels (1345). The use of cover crops was also found to reduce soil erosion and increase soil aggregation (1345). In terms of soil life, the presence of cover crops was associated with an increase in microbial biomass, nematodes, earthworms, and beneficial fungi in some or all comparisons (1345). The effects on greenhouse gas emissions were mixed. While some studies found that cover crops led to greater carbon accumulation in the soil, others reported increased carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions, with some studies finding no significant difference for either gas (1345). For implementation, long-term use of cover crops was found to result in higher soil quality (1345).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

A study in the USA found similar numbers of bees and bee species in restored and remnant sites, although the bee communities were different [1408]. Using no-tillage in arable fields was found to increase pollinator numbers in a US study when compared to deep tillage [1405]. Additionally, planting flower strips has been shown to be effective. A study in Spain noted more pollinators on coriander flowers adjacent to planted flower strips [1406]. In the USA, more wild bee species and individuals were found in planted flower strips compared to unplanted ones [1406]. The choice of flower species is important, as some have been found to be more attractive to pollinators than others [1406]. There are mixed results on the ideal number of flower species to plant; some studies in Italy and Spain found more pollinators with more species, while others found the opposite [1406].

Specifically, studies have found that hedgerows can lead to reduced soil erosion and higher levels of soil organic matter [744]. The diversity of soil animals has also been observed to be higher near hedgerows [744]. Furthermore, incorporating woody species into these hedgerows can enhance various factors that contribute to soil fertility [744].\n\nAnother alternative is the use of compost. One study conducted in Italy indicated that plots fertilized with compost had more organic matter, nutrients, and microbial biomass when compared to plots where manure was used [1366].\n\nThe practice of excluding grazers has shown varied results on soil fertility. For instance, a study in Spain revealed that ungrazed sites had less soil carbon compared to sites grazed by cows and sheep [1375]. Similarly, other studies have reported less nitrogen in the soil of ungrazed areas [1375]. On the other hand, one study found that excluding goats and sheep led to a higher number of nematodes and more diverse nematode communities [1375]. Additionally, a study in a shrubland environment in Spain noted that in untilled soils, grazed areas had less carbon and nitrogen than ungrazed areas, but no difference was observed in tilled soils [1375].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Regarding the variety of weeds, one replicated, randomized, controlled study in Spain discovered fewer weed species in no-tillage plots (1398), whereas two replicated, controlled studies from Italy and Spain found comparable numbers of weed species between the two tillage systems (1398). A broader review of European studies (not exclusively Mediterranean) on reducing tillage compared to conventional methods also showed varied results. Some studies found that reducing tillage led to an increase in the numbers of certain weeds and/or weed species (126). In contrast, other studies reported that reducing tillage had no-effects or no consistent effects on the number of some weed species (126). It was also noted in two studies that the type of crop being grown affected the number of weeds found under different tillage systems (126).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Soil erosion and runoff were found to be reduced with no-tillage in seven trials, but two trials showed increased soil loss when there was no crop cover (906). Conventional ploughing was found to increase the soil's ability to absorb water and its water content (906). In terms of pest numbers, studies have found more weeds in fields with reduced tillage (1399), though the number of weed species may be similar (1399).

Three replicated, controlled studies in Italy, Spain, and the USA found no differences in cash crop quality between plots with or without winter cover crops (1351). One controlled study in the USA found some differences in tomato quality with winter cover crops, and another US study found inconsistent differences in cash crop quality (1351). In terms of yield, which can be an indicator of quality, results were also mixed. Six studies in Spain and the USA found lower cash crop yields with winter cover crops, while three studies in Italy and the USA found higher yields (1351). There is no evidence available to assess the effectiveness of leaving unharvested cereal headlands within arable fields on crop quality (206).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

In Mediterranean countries, a meta-analysis found that soils in no-tillage systems had more organic matter (1369), and a study in Spain found that no-tillage resulted in higher yields for legumes (1358). Reduced tillage has also been found to increase soil organic matter in Mediterranean countries (1371). One study in the USA found more earthworms in fields with fewer passes of the plough (1371). Additionally, managing the agricultural landscape to enhance floral resources through agri-environment agreements has been shown to be positively correlated with the abundance of long-tongued bumblebees (362).

Further supporting this, fourteen replicated studies in Italy, Spain, and the USA indicated that soils without tillage, in some or all comparisons, had more organic matter (1369). When specifically comparing no-tillage to reduced tillage in Spain, three replicated, randomized, controlled studies showed increased organic matter in no-tillage soils, while three other similar studies found no significant difference (1370). No studies in this comparison found less organic matter with no-tillage (1370).\n\nEight studies, including some in Morocco, observed that reduced tillage either maintained or increased soil organic matter (906). Additionally, twelve studies in various locations, including Spain, found higher soil organic carbon under no-tillage or reduced tillage systems compared to conventional tillage (906). One study in Spain also highlighted that soils that had not been tilled for a longer duration had more organic matter in one comparison (1369).\n\nHowever, some studies present contrasting findings. One replicated, randomized, controlled study in Portugal reported less organic matter in soils without tillage in some comparisons (1369), and another in Spain showed mixed results (1369).

In Italy and Spain, studies showed mixed results regarding the number of flower species planted and the corresponding number of pollinators (1406, 2468), with one study in Italy noting a decrease in bee numbers over time in areas with nine flower species planted (1406, 2468). Research in Spain indicated that tillage had varied effects on the emergence of planted flowers (1414).\n\nRegarding hedgerows, a study in the USA observed that fields with planted hedgerows had higher seed-set in canola plants due to native bee visitations, but not from honey bees or syrphid flies (1407). Another US study found more native bee species in fields with hedgerows, and in some cases, more syrphid fly species were also found in the hedgerows themselves (1407, 2515). However, another study from the USA reported fewer ground-nesting bees in planted hedgerows (1407, 2515). The age of the hedgerow appears to be a factor, with older hedgerows hosting more bee and syrphid fly species (1407, 2515).
