[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: How do different management approaches for uncropped arable field margins in Europe, such as sowing mixes versus natural regeneration, compare in their benefits for bumblebees?\nanswer: Five replicated trials in Europe showed that sowing uncropped arable field margins with an agricultural nectar and pollen mix, particularly those containing perennial leguminous flowering plants, attracted significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated margins (18). Similarly, five replicated trials in the UK indicated that margins sown with native wild flower seed mixes supported a higher abundance of foraging bumblebees compared to naturally regenerated uncropped margins (19). One small trial, however, recorded the same number of bee species on both wildflower sown and naturally regenerated strips (19).\n\nThree replicated trials found that a mix of agricultural forage plants attracted a greater number of bumblebees than a perennial wildflower mix, at least in the first year (18). Conversely, one small replicated trial showed that common long-tongued bumblebee species strongly preferred perennial wildflower seed mixes over a mix of annual forage plants (19). Perennial leguminous herbs in wildflower seed mixtures were noted as important forage sources for bumblebees, especially long-tongued species (19).\n\nRegarding naturally regenerated margins, four replicated trials in the UK found more bumblebees foraging on these compared to cropped margins (20). However, the value of these margins for bees was not consistent from year to year and often relied on thistle species considered to be pernicious weeds (20). A small replicated trial found that neither the abundance nor diversity of bumblebees was higher on naturally regenerated margins than on cropped margins (20).\n\nFinally, three trials in the UK found that margins sown with agricultural legume plants degraded in their value to bumblebees and would require re-sowing every few years (18). For all three management approaches\u2014sowing with agricultural mixes, sowing with wildflower mixes, and natural regeneration\u2014no evidence was captured on the effects on solitary bees (18, 19, 20).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

One study on green infrastructure found that while green roofs had lower butterfly species richness and abundance than urban parks, butterfly abundance was higher on older, larger green roofs with more nectar plant species (3837).\n\nAlong infrastructure corridors, several actions have been shown to benefit insect populations. Restoring or maintaining species-rich grassland along road and railway verges, particularly by sowing native wildflowers, can lead to a higher species richness and diversity of butterflies and moths (3854). Similarly, stopping the use of herbicides on pavements and road verges and restoring roadside prairies has been found to increase butterfly species richness and abundance (3899).

One trial found that over four years of artificial rearing, the weight of *Bombus terrestris* queens gradually decreased (50). Efforts to rear declining North American bumblebee species have had mixed results; while some species were successfully reared to adults, in other cases, larvae died before reaching adulthood (50). The reproductive success of captive colonies is influenced by their pollen diet, with freshly frozen pollen and pollen with higher protein content yielding better results (50). Artificial light regimes and specific hibernation conditions, such as temperature and duration, have been shown to affect egg-laying and colony formation, although hibernation can sometimes result in smaller colonies (50).\n\nWhen laboratory-reared colonies were reintroduced to the wild, the outcomes were inconsistent (52). In some trials, the number of new queens produced was very low or zero, while other trials reported good production of new queens (52). A significant challenge in reintroduction is social parasitism by cuckoo bees, with rates varying from 0% to as high as 79% in different trials (52). The success of supplementary feeding for colonies in the field has also been inconsistent, with one study showing improved reproductive success and another finding no increase in colony productivity (52).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

There are also risks associated with feeding bees artificial diets. One replicated trial showed high larval mortality in Osmia cornuta when they were reared on artificial pollen-based diets, which included pollen collected by honey bees. Another trial found that Megachile rotundata either died or had low pre-pupal weight when reared on synthetic pollen substitutes (54). However, M. rotundata could be successfully reared on an artificial diet that was based on honey bee-collected pollen (54). In times of pollen scarcity, stingless bees (Scaptotrigona postica) can be fed pollen substitutes such as brewer's yeast or a mixture with 25% pollen collected by honey bees (33). To avoid damaging the brood during honey extraction, a wooden hive with separate, different-shaped honey and brood chambers can be used (33). Additionally, brood growth in traditional log hives was found to be higher than in box hives with internal volumes exceeding 14 litres, leading to a recommendation for smaller box hives (33).\"}\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

One replicated controlled trial in the UK showed that planted perennial leguminous herbs were more attractive to bumblebees in landscapes with a greater proportion of arable farming (17). Four replicated trials showed that field margins sown with perennial leguminous flowering plants attract significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated, grassy or cropped field margins (18). Three replicated trials showed that a mix of agricultural forage plants including legumes attracts greater numbers of bumblebees than a perennial wildflower mix, at least in the first year (18). Three trials in the UK found evidence that margins sown with agricultural legume plants degrade in their value to bumblebees and would need to be re-sown every few years (18). One trial showed that planted patches of bigleaf lupine in commercial apple orchards significantly enhanced the reproductive success of blue orchard mason bees (17). However, one trial in the Netherlands showed that bee numbers and species richness are not higher in farmland 50-1,500 m away from planted flower patches (17).

We have captured no evidence for the effect of creating areas of bare ground on bee populations or communities on a larger scale (13). Ten studies (nine replicated trials and a review of studies) from Germany, Poland and the UK of solitary bee nest boxes all showed the nest boxes were readily used by bees (80). Two replicated studies found the local population size or number of emerging red mason bees increased when nest boxes were provided (80). One replicated trial in Germany showed that the number of occupied solitary bee nests almost doubled over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site (80). A replicated study from Poland found the highest production of red mason bees per nest was from nesting materials of reed stems or wood (80). Eleven replicated trials of bumblebee nest boxes have shown that several different types of nest box are acceptable to bumblebees, including wooden or brick and tile boxes at the ground surface, underground tin, wooden or terracotta boxes and boxes attached to trees (48). However, three replicated trials since 1989 in the UK have shown very low uptake rates (0-2.5%) of various nest box designs (not including underground nest boxes), while seven trials in previous decades in the UK, USA or Canada, and one recent trial in the USA, showed overall uptake rates between 10% and 48% (48). Two replicated trials that tested bumblebee nest boxes both found very low uptake, 2% or less (80). Nest boxes entirely buried 5-10 cm underground, with a 30-80 cm long entrance pipe, are generally the most effective type for bumblebees, with seven replicated trials in the USA, Canada or the UK having found between 6% and 58% occupancy (48).

The number of occupied nests for Osmia bees in the USA can double over a three-year period with continuous nest box provision (47). However, in California, introduced European earwigs and leafcutter bees have been observed using these boxes, sometimes more frequently than native bees (47). Studies conducted in Europe have identified additional factors influencing the success of artificial nests. For instance, it is recommended that nest boxes be positioned within 150 to 600 meters of foraging resources (47, 80). The choice of nesting material is also crucial, with one study indicating that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes yield more bees compared to other designs. Another study found that reed stems or wood resulted in higher bee production (47, 80).

There was no evidence found on interventions to conserve bees on upland heath or moorland (9). In relation to grassland, three small trials found that restored species-rich grasslands had similar flower-visiting insect communities to paired ancient species-rich grasslands (8). In addition, one replicated controlled trial in Scotland showed that species-rich grassland managed under agri-environment schemes attracted more nest-searching queen bumblebees but fewer foraging queens in the spring than unmanaged grassland (8). When restoring habitat along watercourses, one replicated, paired site comparison from the USA found similar numbers of bees and bee species, but different bee communities, in restored and remnant sites (1408). In the same study, bee visitation rates to native flowers did not differ between restored and remnant sites (1408). No evidence was found for the effects of conserving old buildings and structures suitable for nesting wild bees (4).

Four replicated trials in Europe showed enhanced diversity and/or abundance of foraging wild bees on land managed under various European agri-environment schemes compared to conventionally-managed fields (24). In contrast, four other replicated trials in Europe found no enhancement in the number of bees or bee species on land managed under agri-environment schemes (24). On a wider landscape scale, two replicated trials in the UK found that bumblebee populations were not enhanced on farmland managed under agri-environment schemes (24).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What factors are known to influence the occupancy and productivity of artificial nest sites provided for solitary bees?\nanswer: Several factors are known to influence the occupancy and productivity of artificial nest sites for solitary bees. The location of nest boxes is important, and they should be placed within the foraging range of the bees, which for some European species is between 150 to 600 meters from resources (47, 80). The design and material of the nest site also play a significant role. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in cut hollow stems, tubes, or blocks of wood with drilled holes (47). In terms of productivity, one trial found that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees than other designs, while plastic-lined holes or tubes were less productive due to issues with parasitism and mould (47). Another small trial noted that cardboard straws within drilled wooden holes were more productive for a specific bee species than grooved wooden boards (47). A study in Poland also found that reed stems or wood resulted in the highest production for red mason bees (80).\n\nThe presence of parasites, predators, and mould can negatively impact productivity, with studies recording mortality rates ranging from 13% to 56% (47). One trial specifically showed that excluding ants from nesting sites increased the production of offspring (46). Additionally, introduced species, such as European earwigs and certain leafcutter bees, may occupy the nest boxes, in some cases more commonly than native bees (47).\n\nDespite these challenges, repeated provision of nest boxes at a site can lead to an increase in the number of occupied nests over time, with some studies showing numbers doubling over three years (47, 80). One trial found that the estimated number of foraging bees increased in fields with nest boxes compared to those without (47). While many trials have shown successful occupation, one trial in a temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using the provided nest boxes (47), and another small trial in the UK found that soil-filled nest boxes were not occupied by the target mining bee species (47). Occupancy rates, when reported, have been noted to be between 1% and 26% of the available cavities (80).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What unintended negative consequences or limitations have been identified when providing artificial nest boxes for bees?\nanswer: Several unintended negative consequences and limitations have been identified with the provision of artificial nest boxes for bees. Parasitism and predation are potential negative consequences of providing artificial nest boxes (47). Mortality rates from these causes have been measured at between 13% and 56% (47). Additionally, some nest box designs, such as those with plastic-lined holes or plastic/paper tubes, have been found to be less productive due to issues with parasitism or mould (47). Another unintended consequence is the occupation of nest boxes by non-native species, which in some cases, used the boxes more commonly than native bees (47).\n\nA significant limitation is the low uptake or occupancy rate of the nest boxes (48, 80). For bumblebees, very low uptake rates of 0-2.5% have been recorded in several UK trials (48, 80). Similarly, some trials for solitary bees have shown no occupancy at all (47). Furthermore, for bumblebees, there is no evidence to suggest that providing nest boxes has a positive effect on their populations (48). Commonly marketed wooden surface or above-ground nest boxes are not the most effective designs for bumblebees and have resulted in occupancy rates as low as 0-1.5% in some UK studies (48).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

However, wooden surface or above-ground nest boxes are not the most effective design [48]. While some studies have shown 10-40% occupancy for these types of boxes [48], more recent trials have found very low occupancy rates of 0-2.5% [48] and 2% or less [80]. Nest boxes that are entirely buried 5-10 cm underground, with a 30-80 cm long entrance pipe, are generally the most effective, with studies finding occupancy rates between 6% and 58% [48]. Despite this, there is no evidence for the effects of providing nest boxes on bumblebee populations [48].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: How does sowing agricultural forage plants on field margins compare to sowing native wildflower mixes in terms of benefits for bumblebees?\nanswer: Three replicated trials found that a mix of agricultural forage plants, including legumes, attracts a higher number of bumblebees than a perennial wildflower mix in the first year (18). However, one small replicated trial indicated that common long-tongued bumblebee species showed a strong preference for perennial wildflower seed mixes over annual forage plant mixes (19). Five replicated trials in the UK demonstrated that uncropped field margins sown with wildflowers supported a greater abundance of foraging bumblebees, and in three of those trials, a higher species richness, when compared to cropped field edges, grassy margins, or naturally regenerated uncropped margins (19). The value of margins with agricultural legume plants to bumblebees has been found to degrade, requiring them to be re-sown every few years (18). For both types of mixes, perennial leguminous herbs have been shown to be important forage sources for bumblebees, particularly for long-tongued species (18, 19). Generally, 41 studies found that flower strips positively influenced invertebrate numbers, increasing abundance, species richness, or both (442).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What factors, such as diet and social parasitism, have been shown to affect the success of captive-rearing and reintroducing bumblebee colonies?\nanswer: The pollen diet of captively reared bumblebees has been shown to influence reproductive success (50). In one trial, colonies fed on freshly frozen pollen produced larger queens that survived better and produced larger colonies than those fed on dried, frozen pollen (50). Additionally, two replicated trials demonstrated that Bombus terrestris workers can produce more offspring when fed types of pollen with a higher protein content (50). For colonies placed in the field, one trial in Canada found that supplementary feeding improved the reproductive success of captive-reared colonies but did not reduce their parasite load, while another trial in the USA found no increase in colony productivity with supplementary feeding (52). Rates of social parasitism by cuckoo bees in colonies released to the wild are variable, with two replicated trials in Canada and the UK finding high rates of 25-66% and 79% respectively (52). The UK trial showed that parasitism was reduced by placing colonies in landscapes with intermediate rather than very high nectar and pollen availability, and late, rather than early in the season (52). Five other replicated trials reported no social parasites (52).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
