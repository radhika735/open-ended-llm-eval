In France, one replicated, randomized, controlled study found that removing topsoil before sowing seeds increased plant community similarity to that of an intact steppe and also increased plant species richness [3415]. A replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK also found that removing topsoil before planting seedlings led to a higher cover of the planted species [3415]. Two replicated, controlled studies in the USA found that removing topsoil before planting or sowing increased the survival of seedlings and plants [3415].\n\nFor soil disturbance, one of two replicated, controlled studies in the UK and Germany found that disturbing the soil before sowing seeds increased plant and seedling species richness, while the other study found no change [3413]. A study in the USA found that disturbing the soil before sowing forb seeds increased the cover of forb species [3413]. Four of five replicated, controlled studies found that disturbing the soil before sowing seeds increased plant emergence in most cases compared to sowing alone [3413]. One of two replicated, controlled studies found that disturbing the soil before sowing increased the survival of seedlings [3413].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
