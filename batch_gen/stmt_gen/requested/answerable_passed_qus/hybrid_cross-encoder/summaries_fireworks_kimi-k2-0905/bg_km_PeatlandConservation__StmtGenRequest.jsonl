[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: To restore peatlands afforested for commercial forestry, how does simply cutting the trees compare to cutting trees and also rewetting the peat?\nanswer: When restoring peatlands afforested for commercial forestry, cutting trees and rewetting peat (Action 1732) shows more comprehensive restoration outcomes compared to only cutting trees (Action 1731). The combined approach increases abundance of wetland-characteristic plants (Action 1732), while tree removal alone only increases cover of some herb species like cottongrasses and sedges (Action 1731). Sphagnum moss responses differ significantly - the combined intervention increases Sphagnum cover (Action 1732), whereas tree removal alone decreases Sphagnum cover over three years (Action 1731). Both approaches increase plant species richness, though one study found the effect is smaller when trees are removed from rewetted plots compared to drained plots (Action 1731). Action 1756 (rewetting alone) demonstrates that water table management is crucial for peatland restoration, showing increased Sphagnum moss cover, reduced tree/shrub cover, and increased herb cover including sedges and cottongrasses.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

The main management approaches include: restricting pedestrian access to peatlands (Action IDs: 1751, 3022), physically excluding pedestrians from peatlands (Action IDs: 1752, 3023), installing boardwalks or paths to prevent trampling (Action IDs: 1753, 3024), wearing snowshoes to prevent trampling (Action ID: 1754), restricting vehicle use on peatlands (Action ID: 1749), adopting ecotourism principles or creating ecotourism sites (Action IDs: 1755, 3025), reducing visitor group size (Action ID: 312), and re-routing paths to reduce habitat disturbance (Action ID: 1619). However, systematic searches found no studies that have directly evaluated the effectiveness of these actions specifically for peatland vegetation, with the exception of one study on path re-routing that found closing paths increased plant species numbers but did not alter shrub cover in an Australian alpine shrubland (Action ID: 1619).

Tree and shrub cover typically decreases or shows no effect in 10 of 13 studies (1756). Overall plant species richness and diversity may increase, though results are mixed with some studies showing no effect or reduced diversity (1756, 1732).

The evidence shows mixed but generally limited effects: most studies found no effect on herb cover including cottongrass and sedges, no consistent effect on Sphagnum moss cover, and no effect on shrub cover in many cases, though some studies showed increased shrub cover. One study found that livestock exclusion increased vegetation biomass but effects varied between wetter and drier areas of bogs.\n\nReducing Grazing Intensity (Action ID 1735): Only one study evaluated this approach specifically in bogs. This study found that lower grazing intensity was associated with greater total vegetation cover, greater shrub cover, greater cottongrass cover (for one species), and higher vegetation biomass.\n\nThe key comparison suggests that reducing grazing intensity shows more consistent positive effects on vegetation cover and biomass based on limited evidence, while complete livestock exclusion shows more variable results with many studies finding no significant effects on key peatland vegetation components.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Cutting/mowing typically increases plant species richness and moss/bryophyte cover while reducing herb cover and abundance of reeds, sedges, and purple moor grass. Annual mowing regimes are particularly effective at altering plant community composition and increasing fen-characteristic plants. In contrast, grazing effects are more variable - it can increase cover of some herb groups like cottongrasses and sedges, but may reduce Sphagnum moss cover. One comparative study found that grazed fen meadows contained fewer plant species and fewer fen-characteristic species than mown meadows.

This intervention showed variable effects on vegetation - typically no effect on cottongrass, sedge, herb or moss cover, though one study reported increased rush cover and another found increased shrub cover. Some studies found increased shrub biomass and total vegetation when livestock were excluded. Reducing grazing intensity (Action ID 1735) was evaluated in one study, which found greater total vegetation, shrub cover and cottongrass cover at lower grazing intensities. Other proposed strategies include using barriers to keep livestock off ungrazed peatlands (Action ID 1733), limiting livestock density on farmland near peatlands (Action ID 1786), and changing the timing or season of grazing (Action ID 1737), though these latter approaches have not yet been evaluated in scientific studies.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

However, some studies found no effect on vegetation cover, and one study reported that oil palm fruit mulch reduced survival of planted peat swamp tree seedlings.\n\nFor inorganic fertilizers, benefits include increased vegetation cover, plant species richness, herb and shrub growth (especially with phosphorus), increased survival of some planted tree species, and increased growth of planted mosses, herbs, and trees. However, fertilizers also showed harms including reduced survival of some tree species, no effect on growth for some species or in some conditions, and the benefits often depend on the specific chemical composition with phosphorus showing more effects than nitrogen or potassium.\n\nFresh peat amendment showed mixed results with higher cover of sown plant species compared to original bog surface, but fertilization could cancel out this beneficial effect.

Direct planting of mosses (Action 1818) showed survival rates where 47 out of 50 Sphagnum-dominated sods survived for one year in a Lithuanian bog, with five before-and-after studies reporting increased moss cover after planting in at least some cases, including one study showing planted moss spread beyond the introduction site. In contrast, spreading moss fragments on the surface (Action 1821) involved thirteen studies across bogs and fens, with eleven studies showing Sphagnum moss presence after 1-4 growing seasons, though cover ranged from negligible to greater than 90%, and six controlled studies finding higher Sphagnum cover in sown versus unsown plots, with survival often requiring additional interventions like mulching. The moss layer transfer technique (Action 1804) represents a specific restoration approach using multiple interventions that showed development of bog-characteristic plant communities within 11 years and greater moss cover than unrestored areas after 4-8 years.

Mowing increased total moss or bryophyte cover in four studies from Belgium, Switzerland and Czech Republic. Eight studies in fens and fen meadows across the UK, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Czech Republic and Poland found that mowing increased plant species richness compared to no mowing or grazing. Mowing reduced cover of problematic herbs including bindweed, reeds, sedges, purple moor grass and grass-like plants overall, and reduced shrub cover in some cases.\n\nMowing trade-offs: Some studies found mixed effects on vegetation biomass and structure. Three studies reported that single mowing events had no effect on vegetation height, and two studies found single mows had no effect on bryophyte cover or plant species richness.\n\nGrazing benefits: Two UK studies reported that grazing with cattle or horses increased cover of some herb groups (cottongrasses, sedges or all grass-like plants) and reduced purple moor grass cover in some cases. One UK study found that plant species richness increased after grazing was reinstated. Grazing reduced shrub cover in one UK study.\n\nGrazing trade-offs: One replicated, paired, site comparison study in Germany found that grazed fen meadows contained fewer fen-characteristic plant species and fewer plant species overall than mown meadows. The overall plant community composition differed between grazed and mown fen meadows. Grazing reduced Sphagnum moss cover in one UK study and typically had no effect on shrub cover in another UK study.

Cutting/mowing has mixed effects on plant community composition, with some studies finding no significant changes while others report shifts toward target fen communities. For characteristic plants, mowing has been shown to increase cover of fen-characteristic species in several studies from Switzerland, Germany, the Czech Republic, and Poland. Vegetation cover responses vary: four studies in Belgium, Switzerland, and the Czech Republic found mowing increased total moss or bryophyte cover, while studies in Sweden showed mixed effects on Sphagnum moss cover. Cutting problematic herbaceous plants typically increased Sphagnum moss cover while reducing purple moor grass cover. For large tree/shrub management, cutting and removal has been shown to alter plant community composition toward more open fen conditions, with studies in Sweden and the USA reporting increased species richness and cover of fen-characteristic plants. Physical removal of problematic plants such as moss carpets had mixed effects on herb cover and typically reduced total bryophyte and Sphagnum cover in the short term, though effects varied depending on drainage conditions. Tree removal from forest plantations increased herb cover including cottongrasses and sedges, while reducing forest-characteristic moss cover. The timing of cutting/mowing matters: summer mowing increased plant species richness more than spring or autumn mowing in UK fen meadows. Overall plant species richness typically increased with regular mowing regimes across 8 studies from various European fens.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the alternatives to completely removing livestock from degraded agricultural peatlands, and how do their effects compare?\nanswer: Alternatives to completely removing livestock from degraded agricultural peatlands include reducing grazing intensity, changing livestock type, limiting livestock density near peatlands, and changing the season/timing of grazing (1735, 1736, 1786, 1737). The only alternative with direct evidence is reducing grazing intensity, which showed greater total vegetation and shrub cover compared to higher intensity grazing, with cottongrass responses varying by species, and higher vegetation biomass where grazing intensity was lower (1735). Changing livestock type, limiting livestock density near peatlands, and changing grazing timing have no direct evaluation studies, so their effectiveness remains unassessed (1736, 1786, 1737). Complete livestock exclusion typically had no effect on herb, moss, or shrub cover in most studies, with effects varying by site conditions - some showing increased shrub cover in drier areas or favoring dry moorland plants (1734). These findings suggest that moderate grazing intensity reduction may be a viable alternative to complete exclusion, though more research is needed on other livestock management modifications.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: When harvesting wild biological resources from peatlands, how do different strategies for reducing impact compare in their evidence base?\nanswer: Among various strategies for reducing impact when harvesting wild biological resources from peatlands, there is very limited evidence available. Only one strategy has been studied: reducing harvest intensity (Action ID 1744). This approach showed some positive results - a replicated, controlled study in a New Zealand bog found that Sphagnum moss cover was higher three years after harvesting when some Sphagnum was left in plots compared to complete harvesting.\n\nThe following strategies have no supporting evidence because no studies have evaluated their effects on peatland vegetation: using low impact harvesting techniques (Action ID 1745), reducing harvest frequency (Action ID 1743), using low impact vehicles for harvesting (Action ID 1746), implementing mosaic management when harvesting (Action ID 1747), allowing sustainable use of peatlands (Action ID 1801), and restricting vehicle use on peatlands (Action ID 1749).\n\nThe lack of evidence for most strategies means their effectiveness cannot be assessed based on current research.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: To restore a bog after peat extraction, which vegetation introduction techniques are most effective at establishing Sphagnum moss cover?\nanswer: Multiple vegetation introduction techniques have shown effectiveness for establishing Sphagnum moss cover in restored bogs after peat extraction. Direct planting of Sphagnum mosses (action 1818) has demonstrated success across multiple studies, with Sphagnum cover ranging from negligible to >90% after 1-4 growing seasons, and six controlled studies showing higher cover in planted versus unplanted plots.\n\nThe moss layer transfer technique (action 1804) proved effective in Canadian bogs, with restored areas developing greater moss cover (including Sphagnum) than unrestored areas after 4-8 years, and vegetation becoming more similar to local natural bogs.\n\nAdding moss fragments to the peatland surface (action 1821) showed variable results, with Sphagnum present in sown plots across multiple studies, though survival was sometimes dependent on additional interventions.\n\nReplacing blocks of vegetation after extraction (action 1738) helped maintain Sphagnum cover similar to undisturbed fens, though one study noted Sphagnum cover declined in translocated bog blocks.\n\nSupporting techniques enhanced Sphagnum establishment: covering with organic mulch after planting (action 1828) increased Sphagnum cover in six studies across Canada, the USA, and Sweden; reprofiling basins before planting (action 1833) improved Sphagnum survival and cover compared to raised plots; and removing competing vegetation (action 1840) enabled Sphagnum survival where it otherwise failed.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
