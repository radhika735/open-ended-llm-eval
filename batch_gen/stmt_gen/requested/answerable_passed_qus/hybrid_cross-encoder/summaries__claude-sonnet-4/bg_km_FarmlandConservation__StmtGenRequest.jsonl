For leaving uncut strips of rye grass: Two reviews and two replicated controlled trials from the UK found that leaving uncut strips of rye grass on silage fields resulted in benefits to birds including increased numbers (Action 132). Seed-eating birds preferred rye grass cut once only, while insect-eating birds showed more variable results with some preferring plots cut two or more times (Action 132). Two reviews and replicated controlled studies found that seed-eating birds were more abundant on uncut plots than on cut plots (Action 224). One study found higher ground beetle species diversity in uncut plots by the third year of the experiment (Action 132). For raising mowing height: A review from the UK found that raising mowing height may have increased productivity of Eurasian skylarks, but not sufficiently to maintain the local population (Action 222). A randomized, replicated and controlled study from the UK found that no more foraging birds were attracted to plots with raised mowing heights, compared to plots with shorter grass (Action 222). Studies found raised cutting heights were less damaging to amphibians and invertebrates, but had no effect on numbers of foraging birds or invertebrates in another trial (Action 138). One study found that northern lapwing and common starling chicks had greater foraging success in shorter grass (Action 138). The evidence suggests uncut strips provide clearer benefits for seed-eating birds, while raising mowing height shows mixed and less consistent results for wildlife benefits in UK grasslands.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: In European agricultural landscapes, what management techniques are available to restore or create species-rich wet meadows?\nanswer: Based on the evidence from European studies, several management techniques are available to restore or create species-rich wet meadows in agricultural landscapes. From studies across France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Switzerland and the UK, successful restoration techniques include topsoil removal, introduction of target plant species, raising water levels, grazing, mowing, or combinations of topsoil removal with target plant species introduction plus livestock exclusion (Action 119). Water level management is particularly important, with raising water levels in ditches or grassland showing positive effects on bird numbers, plant species that favour wet conditions, and invertebrate numbers in agricultural landscapes, though some studies found net loss of plant species (Action 121). Active water level management, including controlled flooding and water fluctuation, can generate plant communities characteristic of wetter conditions and increase wetland-characteristic species abundance (Action 3038).\n\nTraditional water meadow maintenance involves specific management regimes including grazing and mowing. Mowing once per year in autumn or light grazing with cattle or horses produces similar butterfly species richness (Action 3971). Grazing management shows mixed impacts, with some studies finding benefits for certain species but reduced productivity for others. Studies indicate that cutting in June maintained relatively stable vegetation, while mowing effects on plant species richness were variable (Action 696). For general grassland restoration, effective techniques include grazing, introducing plant species, hay spreading and mowing, with positive restoration signs typically visible within 5-10 years (Action 133).\n\nManagement intensity reduction through several interventions shows benefits, with 22 studies finding positive effects on wildlife groups including plants, invertebrates and birds, though results can be variable depending on the specific interventions applied (Action 69). The timing and type of management is crucial, with species-rich grasslands showing different responses to mowing versus grazing regimes depending on the target species and local conditions (Action 3908).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

For set-aside areas, 34 studies found that 20 showed benefits to or higher use by all wildlife groups considered, while 12 found some species or groups used set-aside more than crops but others did not, and two studies found no effect (Action 156). A systematic review found significantly higher densities of farmland birds on fields removed from production and under set-aside designation than on conventionally farmed fields in both winter and summer (Action 156). Set-aside areas also showed higher species richness of bees nesting or foraging when annually mown and left to naturally regenerate for two years or more (Action 7). However, set-aside did not enhance small mammal numbers relative to cropland or brown hare numbers relative to farms without set-aside areas (Action 2377).\n\nFor converting arable land to permanent grassland, the evidence shows limited benefits for some wildlife groups but not others. All seven studies looking at the effects of reverting arable land to grassland found no clear benefit to wildlife, including UK birds in winter and summer, wading birds in Denmark, grey partridges, brown hares in the UK, and plants in the Czech Republic (Action 561). One controlled before-and-after study showed that grey partridge numbers fell significantly following the reversion of arable fields to grassland (Action 561, Action 210). However, for butterflies and moths, restored grasslands showed more positive outcomes, with created grasslands having greater species richness of butterflies, burnet moths and all moths than conventionally managed grassland or cultivated farms, and higher abundance of moths than conventional grassland (Action 3929).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are some alternatives to direct predator control for improving the breeding success of ground-nesting birds on farmland?\nanswer: Several alternatives to direct predator control exist for improving the breeding success of ground-nesting birds on farmland. Leaving cultivated, uncropped margins or plots (including lapwing plots) provides benefits to target farmland bird species, with studies finding increased northern lapwing hatching success and Eurasian skylark nesting success (Action 562). Creating specific skylark plots has shown positive effects, with all studies finding increases in skylark population size, breeding density, duration or success relative to fields without plots (Action 540). Providing set-aside areas in farmland shows benefits, with studies finding higher nest survival or productivity on set-aside than control fields for skylarks (Action 156). Physical protection of individual nests through exclosures offers benefits, with protected nests having higher average daily survival rates than unprotected nests for common redshank and northern lapwing, and higher hatching rates for southern dunlin (Action 108). Protecting nests from livestock trampling through fencing around individual nests has been successful (Action 237). Reducing tillage practices benefits ground-nesting birds, with studies finding higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying dates and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields (Action 126). Providing supplementary food increases farmland bird abundance, breeding population size, body mass, hatching, nestling growth and fledging rates (Action 648). Planting cereals in wide-spaced rows offers benefits over conventional wheat for Eurasian skylarks, though one study found fewer skylark nests than in control fields (Action 216).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: For the benefit of farmland birds, what is the comparative evidence for sowing crops in spring versus leaving stubbles overwinter?\nanswer: The evidence shows benefits for farmland birds from both spring sowing and overwinter stubbles, with some specific comparative findings. For overwinter stubbles, eighteen studies found evidence that leaving overwinter stubbles provides benefits to farmland birds, including higher densities of farmland birds in winter, increased grey partridge productivity, and increased cirl bunting population size (Action 695). Eight studies found that at least some species or groups of farmland birds were positively associated with overwinter stubbles, with seed-eating birds in particular being more abundant on stubbles (Action 203). However, some studies found that only certain species benefited - one study found that only Eurasian skylark and Eurasian linnet benefited out of 23 farmland bird species tested, while another found only grey partridge and tree sparrow showed positive population responses (Action 695). For spring sowing, a replicated controlled study from Sweden found more bird species on areas with spring sown cereals compared with winter cereals, and a UK study found several species bred in the study site for the first time after spring sowing began (Action 207). Three studies found population increases after spring sowing began or higher populations on sites with spring-sown cereals compared to sites with winter cereals (Action 207). Five studies found that planting crops in spring rather than autumn resulted in higher numbers of farmland birds (Action 137). However, a replicated study found that winter and spring sown crops were used for different broods by Eurasian skylarks, and hatching success was lower on spring-sown crops than autumn sown (Actions 137, 207). The evidence suggests both practices provide different types of benefits to farmland birds, with overwinter stubbles particularly benefiting seed-eating birds during winter, while spring sowing appears to support breeding bird communities.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What is the evidence base for the effectiveness of providing artificial nest sites, such as boxes for birds and bees, on European farmland?\nanswer: The evidence base for artificial nest sites on European farmland shows mixed effectiveness depending on the species and design. For solitary bees, 30 replicated trials across 10 countries including Europe found that 29 showed occupancy by bees (Action 47). Many species of solitary bee readily nest in boxes, including endangered species on German farmland, with one study in Germany showing the number of occupied solitary bee nests almost doubled over three years with repeated provision (Action 47). German experiments found four medium to large European solitary bee species have foraging ranges of 150-600m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources (Action 47). For birds, studies from the Netherlands and UK found increases in Eurasian kestrel clutches and breeding tree sparrows following nest box provision (Action 155). Eight studies from Finland, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and UK found nest boxes in agricultural habitats were occupied by various species including Eurasian kestrel, long-eared owl, starlings, tits, tree sparrow, stock dove, jackdaw, Eurasian wryneck and Eurasian hoopoe (Action 155). Swedish studies showed nest success was related to pasture availability and higher positioning (Action 155). For bumblebees, three UK trials since 1989 showed very low uptake rates of 0-2.5% for various designs, though earlier trials in USA/Canada showed 10-48% uptake (Action 48). Underground nest boxes buried 5-10cm with 30-80cm entrance pipes showed 6-58% occupancy in USA, Canada and UK trials (Action 48). European rollers in Spain showed increasing nest box use over time with varying success between habitats (Action 494).

Six studies saw positive signs of restoration in less than five years, while 11 studies found positive changes within 10 years (Action 133). Two studies found restoration took more than 10 years, and six studies found limited or slow changes in plant communities following restoration (Action 133). \n\nMore specifically, prairies restored 5-10 years ago by seeding with native species, mowing, and weeding or applying herbicide had greater abundance of certain butterfly species than prairies restored 1-2 years ago, and similar abundance to remnant prairies (Action 3943). Grasslands restored from bare soil by seeding developed butterfly communities that were increasingly similar to existing high-quality grasslands over the first 10 years after establishment (Action 3929). Studies found that 4-5-year-old created grasslands had greater species richness of butterflies, burnet moths and all moths than conventionally managed grassland (Action 3929).\n\nHowever, some differences persist over longer periods - two studies found differences in vegetation between restored and existing species-rich grasslands nine or 60 years after restoration (Action 133). The species richness of butterflies on restored grasslands remained similar over time since restoration, showing stability once established (Action 3955).

For birds, 24 out of 26 studies from four European countries found increases in population size, density or more favourable population trends of some or all birds studied on sites with agri-environment schemes compared to non-scheme sites, though 11 studies found negative or no effects (Action 700). Three reviews from the UK reported population increases of three species (cirl buntings, corncrakes and Eurasian thick-knees) after introduction of specially-designed agri-environment schemes (Action 172). For plants, 7 out of 11 studies from five European countries found agri-environment schemes maintained or had little or no effect on plants, plant diversity or species richness, while three studies found increases in plant species richness and two found decreases (Action 700). For invertebrates, 6 out of 10 studies from three European countries showed agri-environment schemes maintained or had little or no effect on some invertebrates in terms of diversity, abundance, species richness or bee colony growth, while five studies found increases in abundance or species richness of some invertebrates (Action 700). Specifically for wild bees, four replicated trials in Europe showed enhanced diversity and/or abundance of foraging wild bees on land managed under various European agri-environment schemes, but four other replicated trials found that the number of bees and/or bee species was not enhanced (Action 24). For amphibians, one replicated study in the Netherlands found that ditches managed under agri-environment schemes had higher numbers of amphibian species and higher abundance than conventionally managed ditches (Action 818).

The study found that eight years after management, heather moorland subject to flailing to simulate burning had more plant species than control unflailed plots, but fewer plant species than burned plots (Action 151). Additionally, heather moorland subject to a single burn had more plant species eight years after the management than control unburned plots (Action 152). This indicates that controlled burning was more effective than swiping for increasing plant species diversity in heather moorland. A systematic review of five studies from the UK found that prescribed burning did not alter species diversity, though a before and after study found that prescribed burning initially decreased the cover of most plant species, but their cover subsequently increased (Action 1625).

Eleven studies found that undersowing spring cereals benefited some birds, plants, insects, spiders and earthworms (Action 136). These benefits included increases in barnacle goose abundance, densities of singing Eurasian skylark and nesting dunnock, arthropod abundance and species richness, and bumblebee, butterfly, earthworm, ground beetle, spider or springtail abundances (Action 136). For butterflies specifically, spring barley undersown with a mix of grasses and legumes had higher species richness and abundance of butterflies than extensively or conventionally managed grassland (Action 3926). Studies found higher densities of some study species on undersown fields or margins compared with other fields, or that use of fields increased after they were undersown (Action 208). However, some studies showed mixed results, with five studies finding that undersowing spring cereals did not benefit invertebrates, plants, grey partridge population indicators, or nesting densities of two out of three farmland bird species (Action 136).

Stone curlew breeding population sizes increased, and northern lapwing, Eurasian skylark, grey partridge and yellow wagtail were found to breed in lapwing plots (Action 562). Bird nesting success was higher in fallow fields or lapwing plots than in crops (Action 213). For butterflies and moths, farms with agri-environment schemes including uncropped cultivated margins showed higher abundance of butterflies and micro-moths compared to conventional farms (Action 3923). However, several drawbacks were identified. Pernicious weeds were more commonly found on uncropped cultivated margins than conservation or conventional headlands (Action 562). The proportion of young grey partridges in the population was lower in areas with a high proportion of uncropped cultivated margins and plots (Action 562). Fewer seed-eating birds were found on fallow plots for ground-nesting birds in two out of three UK regions (Action 562).

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What factors influence the occupancy and success rates of nest boxes provided for birds on farmland?\nanswer: Several factors influence the occupancy and success rates of nest boxes for birds on farmland. Nest box design affects use, productivity and usurpation rates, with thirteen studies finding that these varied with different designs (action 498). The position and orientation of nest boxes is also important, with fourteen studies finding different occupation or success rates depending on positioning (action 498). Specifically, nest boxes positioned higher above the ground had higher occupancy, numbers of eggs and numbers of hatched young (action 155). The surrounding habitat influences success, with nest success in boxes being related to the amount of pasture available (action 155). Tree sparrows showed a preference for nest boxes in wetland habitat compared to those in farmland sites (action 155). Nest box maintenance affects occupancy, as five studies found that various songbirds preferentially nested in cleaned nest boxes compared to used ones, though some studies found birds showed preference for uncleaned boxes and there were no differences in success or parasitism levels between cleaned and uncleaned boxes (action 499). Predation is a significant factor, with predation rates being lower for relocated nest boxes compared to controls (action 420), and nest boxes or nesting 'tubs' showing lower predation or higher nesting success than natural nests (action 402). Predator deterrents such as metal cones with 7.6 cm overhang and increased distance between entrance hole and roof from 30 to 60 cm can prevent raccoons from entering nest boxes (action 402). Nest box density may also play a role, with one study finding more nesting attempts in areas with more nest boxes, though another study found no differences in behaviour or productivity between areas with high or low densities of nest boxes (action 498).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

However, the study found that burned plots had more plant species than swiped plots, indicating that controlled burning was more effective than swiping for increasing plant species richness on heather moorland (Action 151). The swiping treatment was designed to simulate burning effects but produced fewer plant species than actual burning (Action 151).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What is the comparative effectiveness of providing supplementary food versus planting wild bird seed mixtures for supporting farmland birds over winter?\nanswer: Studies show that both supplementary feeding and wild bird seed mixtures provide benefits for farmland birds, but they have different effectiveness patterns. For supplementary feeding, nine studies from France, Sweden and the UK found that provision of supplementary food increased farmland bird abundance, breeding population size, density, body mass, hatching, nestling growth and fledging rates, and increased overwinter survival of a declining house sparrow population (Action 648). Four studies found that farmland songbirds used supplementary food when provided, including the majority of targeted species such as tree sparrow, yellowhammer and corn bunting (Action 648). However, five studies found that supplementary food had no clear effect on farmland bird breeding abundance, territory size or territory density, or overwinter survival of three stable house sparrow populations (Action 648).\n\nFor wild bird seed mixtures, fourteen studies from the UK found that fields sown with wild bird cover mix had higher abundance, density, species diversity and species richness of birds than other farmland habitats (Action 594). Six studies found that birds showed a preference for wild bird cover and used it significantly more than other habitats (Action 594). All seven studies that investigated species richness or diversity found that fields or farms with wild bird cover had higher bird diversity than those without (Action 187). Thirty-two out of 33 studies from the UK and North America found that bird densities, abundances, nesting densities or use of wild bird cover was higher than in other habitats or management regimes (Action 187). Six studies found that mixtures including kale or a mixture of kale and other species attracted the largest number of bird species or highest bird abundance (Action 594).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What is the extent of the evidence for the effectiveness of managing or planting new hedgerows to benefit wildlife on farmland?\nanswer: The evidence for hedgerow management and planting to benefit wildlife on farmland varies significantly by taxa and shows mixed results. For general wildlife management, ten studies from Switzerland and the UK found that managing hedges for wildlife resulted in increased berry yields, species diversity or richness of plants and invertebrates and diversity or abundance of farmland birds (action 116). However, five studies from the UK found that hedge management did not affect plant species richness, numbers of bumblebee queens or farmland birds, and two replicated studies showed mixed or adverse effects (action 116).\n\nFor birds specifically, seven studies from the UK and Switzerland found that some species increased in relation to managed hedges or were more likely to be found in managed hedges compared to other habitats, though four studies found that some species declined or showed no response to wildlife-friendly management (action 177). One study found no difference in species richness between wildlife-friendly hedge management and control sites (action 177).\n\nFor butterflies and moths, seven studies showed positive effects of planting new hedges, with three of four site comparison studies finding that established hedgerows had higher species richness than in-field beetle banks, crops or pasture (action 3976). Five of six studies found that butterfly and moth abundance was higher along hedgerows than in alternative habitats (action 3976).\n\nFor mammals, three studies evaluated planting or maintaining hedgerows, with mixed results - one study found higher brown hare density in arable sites but not grassland sites, while another found no increase in Irish hare numbers (action 2383). A UK study found that establishing hedgerows increased small mammal abundance (action 2383). However, no studies were found evaluating the effects on mammals of managing existing hedgerows (action 2382).\n\nFor bats, limited evidence from two UK studies showed that hedges trimmed three or more years prior had more species and higher activity levels than recently trimmed hedges (action 1943). For reptiles, one study in Madagascar found that reptile communities in cultivated areas with hedges were more similar to forest communities than areas without hedges (action 3519).\n\nEvidence gaps exist for several taxa, with no studies found for bats and hedge planting (action 1942) or amphibians and hedge maintenance (action 790).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: How do farm-level agri-environment scheme options scale up to benefit biodiversity at the landscape level?\nanswer: Farm-level agri-environment scheme options show mixed evidence for scaling up to landscape-level biodiversity benefits. Five studies monitoring the Swiss Ecological Compensation Areas scheme at a landscape scale found mixed effects, with one study finding increases in numbers of birds of some species, two finding no effect on bird species numbers or population densities, and three studies finding mixed effects with some species or groups increasing and others decreasing (Action 145). For bees specifically, landscape-scale effects show some promise, with one large replicated controlled trial demonstrating that the average abundance of long-tongued bumblebees on field margins was positively correlated with the number of pollen and nectar agri-environment agreements in a 10 km grid square (Action 21). However, two replicated trials in the UK found that bumblebee populations were not enhanced on farmland managed under agri-environment schemes at the landscape scale (Action 24). For butterflies and moths, evidence suggests landscape benefits may occur, with studies showing that species richness of butterflies was higher in landscapes with a greater proportion of land managed under agri-environment schemes, and that abundance of butterflies was higher on farms or in landscapes with a higher proportion of land managed under agri-environment schemes (Action 3915). However, a UK study found that agri-environment scheme prescriptions had a local but not a landscape-scale effect on bee numbers (Action 700). The effectiveness appears to depend on proper siting, as one study from the Netherlands found that many agri-environment scheme farms were sited in areas where they were unlikely to be effective (Action 172).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What is the extent of evidence for controlling mammal populations, such as deer, squirrels, and mink, to benefit farmland wildlife in the UK?\nanswer: The evidence for controlling mammal populations to benefit farmland wildlife in the UK is very limited. For managing wild deer numbers, no evidence was captured for effects on farmland wildlife (Action 111). Similarly, for controlling grey squirrels, no evidence was captured for effects on farmland wildlife (Action 106). \n\nFor mink control, there is some evidence from systematic reviews showing that trapping appears to be an effective method of reducing American mink populations, though firm conclusions could not be made due to limitations in experimental design. A large-scale trapping programme in the UK demonstrated that American mink have been successfully eradicated over a large area and this may have been associated with some localized water vole expansions (Action 107).\n\nThe most evidence exists for controlling predatory mammals and birds (foxes, crows, stoats and weasels). Nine individual studies from France and the UK found that three studies showed controlling predatory mammals or birds increased the abundance or population size of some birds. One UK study found numbers of nationally declining songbirds increased on a site where predators were controlled, but there was no overall difference in bird abundance, species richness or diversity between predator control and no-control sites. Five UK studies found some evidence for increased productivity, nest or reproductive success or survival of birds following bird or mammal predator control. A global systematic review including evidence from European farmland found that reproductive success of birds increased with predator removal (Action 699).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: For improving invertebrate biodiversity in UK grasslands, what is the comparative evidence between reducing management intensity versus restoring species-rich semi-natural grassland?\nanswer: Based on the action documents, both approaches show evidence for improving invertebrate biodiversity in UK grasslands, but with different patterns of effectiveness. For reducing management intensity, action 69 found that 16 studies showed benefits to some or all invertebrates, while action 3958 found that 6 of 10 studies demonstrated that less intensively managed grasslands had higher butterfly and moth species richness than conventionally managed grasslands, and 3 of 4 studies showed higher abundance of butterflies, micro-moths and declining macro-moths in low-input grasslands. Action 704 reported that 15 studies found benefits to invertebrates from reducing grazing intensity, with 6 studies showing increased invertebrate diversity and abundance from excluding or delaying summer grazing. For restoring species-rich semi-natural grassland, action 133 found that 20 studies showed restoration resulted in higher pollinating insect density and diversity than other grassland types, or that restored grasslands had similar abundance and species richness of insects to old traditionally managed sites. However, action 3955 presented mixed results for butterflies and moths, with some studies showing restored grasslands had lower species richness and abundance than continuously managed grasslands, while others found similar or higher abundance. Action 133 also noted that restoration effectiveness varied with time, with 6 studies showing positive signs within 5 years, 11 studies within 10 years, and some requiring more than 10 years. The evidence suggests both approaches can be effective, but reducing management intensity appears to show more consistent positive results for invertebrates, while restoration outcomes are more variable and may depend on specific implementation methods and timeframes.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: In the Netherlands, what are the most effective management strategies for increasing wading bird populations on wet grasslands?\nanswer: Based on studies from the Netherlands, several management strategies have proven effective for increasing wading bird populations on wet grasslands. Maintaining traditional water meadows resulted in increased population size or number of territories of northern lapwing, common redshank and black-tailed godwit (Action 696). Raising water levels in ditches or grassland was associated with increased bird numbers and breeding bird numbers, with studies showing this technique resulted in more rapid establishment of species typical of wet grassland (Action 121). \n\nImplementing 'mosaic management', a Dutch agri-environment option, showed that northern lapwing population trends changed from decreases to increases following introduction of this management approach, and black-tailed godwit had higher productivity under mosaic management due to higher nest survival with nests less likely to be trampled by livestock or destroyed by mowing (Action 130). Creating or restoring traditional water meadows through techniques including topsoil removal, introduction of target plant species, raising water levels, grazing, and mowing were successful in restoring wet meadow plant communities (Action 119).\n\nAdditional effective strategies include delaying mowing or first grazing dates, which resulted in increased breeding wading bird densities (Action 131). Creating scrapes and pools in wetlands and wet grasslands showed that northern lapwing chicks foraged in newly created wet features and chick condition was higher in sites with a large number of footdrains (Action 359). Providing short grass for waders was beneficial, as northern lapwings spent more time foraging on short swards compared to longer grass (Action 221). Direct payments per clutch for farmland birds showed slightly higher breeding densities of wading birds and higher hatching success of northern lapwing and black-tailed godwit on farms with payment schemes (Action 146). Finally, protecting individual nests through exclosures showed that protected nests had higher average daily survival rates than unprotected nests for both common redshank and northern lapwing (Action 108).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the documented benefits and limitations of creating uncropped plots in arable fields for wildlife?\nanswer: Based on nineteen individual studies, leaving uncropped, cultivated margins or plots on farmland provides documented benefits to multiple wildlife groups. For birds, benefits include increased stone curlew breeding population size, northern lapwing hatching success, and Eurasian skylark nesting success (Action 562). Skylark plots specifically showed positive effects in all four studies from the UK and Switzerland, with increases in skylark population size, breeding density, duration or success, and lower likelihood of territory abandonment (Action 540). Northern lapwing, Eurasian skylark, grey partridge and yellow wagtail have been documented breeding in lapwing plots (Action 562).\n\nFor invertebrates, uncropped plots provide increased species richness and abundance of spiders, abundance of ground-dwelling invertebrates and ground beetles, and increased species richness of bumblebees (Action 562). Five replicated trials in the UK showed that uncropped field margins sown with wild flowers support higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees than cropped field edges, grassy margins, or naturally regenerated uncropped margins (Action 19). Four replicated trials found more bumblebees foraging on uncropped field margins than on cropped margins (Action 20).\n\nFor plants, benefits include increased species richness of plants and the establishment, abundance or species richness of rare arable plant species (Action 562). Skylark plots showed benefits to plants and invertebrates in three UK studies (Action 540).\n\nHowever, documented limitations exist. Two studies found that leaving uncropped plots had no effect on 11 out of 12 farmland bird species or ground beetles (Action 562). Fewer seed-eating birds were found on fallow plots for ground-nesting birds in two out of three regions (Action 562). The proportion of young grey partridges in the population was lower in areas with a high proportion of uncropped cultivated margins and plots (Action 562). Pernicious weeds were more commonly found on uncropped cultivated margins than conservation or conventional headlands (Action 562). For naturally regenerated margins, the value for bees was based on thistle species considered pernicious weeds requiring control, and the value was not consistent from year to year (Action 20).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
