[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What actions can be taken to mitigate the impacts of roads on amphibian populations?\nanswer: Several actions can be taken to mitigate the impacts of roads on amphibian populations. Closing roads during seasonal amphibian migration has been found effective, with two studies in Germany showing that large numbers of amphibians were protected from death during breeding migrations at road closure sites and at road closure sites with assisted crossings and barrier fences (Action 842). Installing barrier fencing along roads is another effective measure, with seven of eight studies in Germany, Canada and the USA finding that barrier fencing with culverts decreased amphibian road deaths, provided that the fence length and material were effective. However, barriers must be at least 0.6 m high to prevent some species from climbing over (Action 756). Installing culverts or tunnels as road crossings has shown significant success, with six of seven studies in Canada, Germany, Italy, Hungary and the USA finding that installing culverts or tunnels significantly decreased amphibian road deaths, though this was most effective when barrier fencing was also installed. Fifteen of 24 studies found that culverts/tunnels were used by amphibians, with usage rates of 15-85% of amphibians or 3-15 species (Action 884). Restoring habitat connectivity can also be effective, as demonstrated by one study in Italy where raising a road on a viaduct to restore connectivity between two wetlands significantly decreased deaths of migrating amphibians (Action 840). Warning signage for motorists has been tested but showed limited effectiveness, with one study in the UK finding that despite warning signs and human assistance, over 500 toads were still killed on some roads (Action 841).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: How do different partial harvesting methods in USA forests compare to clearcutting in their impact on salamander populations?\nanswer: Based on studies in USA forests, different partial harvesting methods show varied impacts on salamander populations compared to clearcutting. A meta-analysis of 24 studies in North America found that partial harvest methods (including harvesting groups or individual trees, thinning and shelterwood harvesting) resulted in smaller reductions in salamander populations than clearcutting (Action 844, 851, 852). \n\nSpecifically, three studies in the USA found that compared to clearcutting, shelterwood harvesting resulted in higher, similar or initially higher and then similar salamander abundance (Action 851). However, three studies found that compared to clearcutting, harvesting trees in small groups did not result in higher amphibian or salamander abundance (Action 844). For leave-tree harvesting, two studies in the USA found that compared to clearcutting, leaving a low density of trees during harvest did not result in higher salamander abundance (Action 846).\n\nRegarding thinning, four studies in the USA compared amphibians in thinned to clearcut forest and found either higher amphibian abundance (apart from ensatina salamanders), a less negative overall response, or mixed effects on abundance depending on species, life stage and time since harvest (Action 852). One study found that emigrating salamanders used thinned forest significantly more than clearcuts (Action 852).\n\nWhen compared to unharvested areas, all partial harvesting methods showed negative impacts: harvesting trees in small groups significantly decreased salamander abundance and changed species composition (Action 844), shelterwood harvesting decreased salamander abundance and changed species composition in two of three studies (Action 851), and leave-tree harvesting decreased salamander abundance and changed species composition (Action 846). Thinning showed mixed effects depending on amphibian species and time since harvest (Action 852).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

For release programs of captive-bred or head-started amphibians, one review found that 41% of programs showed evidence of breeding in the wild for multiple generations, while 29% showed some evidence of breeding and 12% showed evidence of survival following release (Action 871). For head-started amphibians specifically, six of 10 studies found that released head-started tadpoles, metamorphs or juveniles established breeding populations or increased frog or toad populations, while two studies found mixed results with breeding populations established in 12 of 17 studies reviewed or at two of four sites (Action 881).

Adding salt to ponds has shown promise, with one study in Australia finding that a population of green and golden bell frogs remained free of chytridiomycosis for at least six months following salt addition to a pond containing the chytrid fungus (Action 762). Removing the chytrid fungus from ponds through pond drying and fungicidal treatment has been tested, though one study in Mallorca found this approach reduced infection levels but did not eradicate chytridiomycosis (Action 766). Equipment sterilization when moving between amphibian sites is recommended to prevent disease spread, though no direct evidence exists for its effectiveness on disease transmission between populations, and studies show that while Virkon S disinfectant does not affect amphibian survival, bleach significantly reduces survival of tadpoles (Action 768). The use of gloves when handling amphibians is practiced to prevent disease spread, though latex, vinyl, and nitrile gloves have been found to cause deaths in various tadpole species (Action 769). Other proposed environmental approaches include using zooplankton to remove chytrid zoospores and preventing heavy usage or excluding wildfowl from aquatic habitat, though no evidence exists yet for the effectiveness of these methods (Actions 800, 799).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

For species protection laws, three reviews in the Netherlands and UK found that legal protection of amphibian species was not effective at protecting populations during development (Action 779). However, the number of great crested newt mitigation licences issued over 10 years increased to over 600 in England and Wales (Action 779). One replicated site comparison study in the UK found that populations of natterjack toads were better protected at sites with a statutory level of habitat protection than those outside protected areas, though a before-and-after study showed that a common frog population increased but common toads decreased following pond protection during development (Action 820).\n\nFor trade regulation, one review found that legislation to reduce trade in two frog species resulted in recovery of over-exploited populations (Action 785, Action 824). Additionally, one study in South Africa found that the number of permits issued for scientific and educational use of amphibians increased from 1987 to 1990 (Action 785).\n\nRegarding financial incentive schemes, three studies in Denmark, Sweden and Taiwan found that payments to farmers created amphibian breeding habitat or increased frog or toad populations, though a second study in Taiwan found that payments did not maintain green tree frog habitat (Action 818). One replicated site comparison study in the Netherlands found that ditches managed under agri-environment schemes had higher numbers of amphibian species and higher abundance than those managed conventionally (Action 818).\n\nFor mitigation requirements, studies from the USA showed limited effectiveness, with four studies reporting that requiring mitigation of impacts to wetlands did not prevent loss of wetland area, as the total area restored/created was less than the area destroyed (Action 3386).

Antifungal treatments show the most promise, with twelve of 16 studies finding that antifungal treatment cured or increased survival of amphibians with chytridiomycosis, though four studies found treatments did not cure but reduced infection levels (Action 882). Itraconazole specifically was effective, with six of eight studies finding it cured amphibians of chytridiomycosis, one study finding it reduced infection levels, and one showing mixed effects (Action 882). However, six studies found that specific fungicides caused death or other negative side effects in amphibians (Action 882). \n\nTemperature treatment is another effective option, with four of five studies finding that increasing enclosure or water temperature to 30-37\u00b0C for over 16 hours cured frogs and toads of chytridiomycosis, though one study found heat treatment at 30-35\u00b0C for 36 hours did not cure northern leopard frogs (Action 770).\n\nAntibacterial treatments have shown mixed results. Two studies found that treatment with chloramphenicol antibiotic ointment or solution cured green tree frogs and one Archey's frog of chytridiomycosis, while one study found that trimethoprim-sulfadiazine increased survival time but did not cure blue-and-yellow poison dart frogs (Action 763).\n\nAntifungal skin bacteria or peptides show limited effectiveness, with three of four studies finding that adding antifungal bacteria to amphibian skin did not reduce infection rate or death, though one study found it prevented infection and death, and three studies found it reduced weight loss in infected amphibians (Action 764).

For wetland restoration, ten site comparison studies in Canada and the USA found that amphibian abundance, numbers of species and species composition were generally similar between restored and natural wetlands, with eight studies showing similar outcomes and only two finding lower species numbers or different composition in restored wetlands (Action ID: 879). Seven of nine studies in Canada, Taiwan and the USA found that wetland restoration increased numbers of amphibian species, with breeding populations establishing in some cases (Action ID: 879). One global review found that in 89% of cases, restored and created wetlands had similar or higher amphibian abundance or numbers of species compared to natural wetlands (Action ID: 879).\n\nFor wetland creation, five site comparison studies in the USA found that created wetlands had similar numbers of amphibian species, amphibian abundance or communities compared to natural wetlands, though two studies found that created wetlands had fewer amphibian species or lower abundance and different communities compared to natural wetlands (Action ID: 880). Five studies in Kenya and the USA investigating colonization of created wetlands found that four to 15 amphibian species used or colonized the new wetlands (Action ID: 880). A global review and site comparison studies found that numbers of amphibian species and abundance was higher or similar in created wetlands, with higher outcomes in 54% of studies and similar outcomes in 35% of studies reviewed compared to natural wetlands (Action ID: 880).\n\nWhen considering both approaches together, one global review and studies in the USA found that created, restored, enhanced and natural wetlands had similar combined reptile and amphibian species richness (Action ID: 3755).

Fish removal using rotenone shows stronger evidence: three studies in Sweden, the UK and USA found that eliminating fish using rotenone increased numbers of amphibian species, abundance and recruitment or newt populations, and one review found that fish control including rotenone increased breeding success for four amphibian species (Action 828). However, two studies found that when rotenone was applied, many frogs died and some newts showed negative effects (Action 828). Invasive amphibian removal shows positive evidence: one study in the USA found that removing American bullfrogs significantly increased California red-legged frog populations and increased their range with leopard frogs (Action 825), and one study found that removing invasive Cuban tree frogs increased abundance of squirrel tree frogs and green tree frogs (Action 822).

For Mallorcan midwife toads, three studies in Mallorca found that captive-bred midwife toads released as tadpoles, toadlets or adults established breeding populations at 38%, 80% or 100% of sites (Action 873). In contrast, for green and golden bell frogs in Australia, one review and two before-and-after studies found that captive-bred green and golden bell frogs released mainly as tadpoles did not establish breeding populations, or only established stable breeding populations following one of four release programmes (Action 872). Additionally, only a small proportion of captive-bred green and golden bell frogs released as tadpoles survived at least 13 months after release (Action 872). The captive breeding itself was successful for Mallorcan midwife toads, with two replicated studies in the UK finding that toads produced eggs that were raised to metamorphs or toadlets successfully in captivity, with survival to metamorphosis reaching 85% (Action 837). However, both species experienced some concerns in captive breeding programs, with Mallorcan midwife toads bred in captivity for nine or more generations showing slower tadpole development, reduction in one predator defence trait and decreased genetic diversity (Action 837), while reintroduced populations maintained predator defences but had reduced genetic diversity (Action 873).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: In Australian captive breeding programs, how do artificial fertilization and hormone treatments compare in their success and challenges for frogs?\nanswer: In Australian captive frog breeding programs, hormone treatments and artificial fertilization show distinct patterns of success and challenges. Hormone treatment to induce sperm and egg release shows mixed effectiveness, with studies finding that hormone treatment of female amphibians had varying results, with 30-71% of females producing viable eggs following treatment, and egg production depending on the combination, amount or number of doses of hormones (Action 883). The success of hormone treatment varies significantly by species and hormone combinations, with some studies showing successful breeding in captivity while others show no breeding results (Action 883). For artificial fertilization, Australian studies demonstrate that success depends on the type and number of hormone doses used to stimulate egg production, with one study showing 55% of eggs were artificially fertilized, but the fertilized eggs soon died (Action 834). This indicates a critical challenge where artificial fertilization can achieve fertilization but faces significant mortality issues in early development. The broader context of Australian frog captive breeding shows that overall success varies, with studies finding that some species or 17-50% of captive populations reproduce successfully in captivity, while other species prove difficult to maintain or raise to adults (Action 835). Specific to Australian programs, captive-bred green and golden bell frogs released mainly as tadpoles did not establish breeding populations, or only established stable breeding populations following one of four release programmes (Action 872), suggesting ongoing challenges in both breeding and post-breeding survival.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Translocation of amphibians has shown success, with 35 of 54 (65%) amphibian translocations resulting in established breeding populations or substantial recruitment to the adult population, according to global reviews (Action 854). Translocations of over 1,000 animals were found to be more successful, though success was not related to whether animals were wild or captive-sourced, life-stage, continent, or reason for translocation (Action 854).\n\nRelease of captive-bred amphibians is another technique, with 41% of release programmes showing evidence of breeding in the wild for multiple generations, 29% showing some evidence of breeding, and 12% showing evidence of survival following release (Action 871). Captive-bred frogs released as tadpoles, juveniles or adults established populations or stable breeding populations at 88-100% of sites in some studies, and in some cases colonized new sites (Action 870).\n\nHead-starting amphibians involves raising them from eggs in captivity before release. Six of 10 studies found that released head-started tadpoles, metamorphs or juveniles established breeding populations or increased existing populations (Action 881). Head-started amphibians showed greater survival to metamorphosis and larger size at metamorphosis compared to wild animals (Action 881).\n\nSupporting captive breeding techniques include hormone treatment to induce sperm and egg release, which resulted in successful breeding in captivity in nine of 10 studies for males and had mixed results for females (Action 883). Artificial fertilization can also be used, though success depends on the type and number of hormone doses used to stimulate egg production (Action 834).

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: To protect migrating amphibians, how do physical interventions like tunnels and barrier fences compare to closing roads during migration seasons?\nanswer: Road closures during seasonal amphibian migration have demonstrated effectiveness, with two studies in Germany finding that large numbers of amphibians were protected from death during breeding migrations at road closure sites and at road closure sites with assisted crossings and barrier fences (Action 842). Physical interventions show mixed effectiveness depending on implementation. Barrier fencing with culverts decreased amphibian road deaths in seven of eight studies across Germany, Canada and the USA, though effectiveness depends on fence length and material (Action 756). However, barriers have limitations - they must be at least 0.6 m high to prevent green frogs and leopard frogs from climbing over, and treefrogs and 10% of common toads still climbed over barrier fencing during breeding migrations (Action 756). Culverts and tunnels show variable success rates. Six of seven studies found that installing culverts or tunnels significantly decreased amphibian road deaths, though in one study this was only effective when barrier fencing was also installed (Action 884). Fifteen of 24 studies found that culverts/tunnels were used by 15-85% of amphibians or 3-15 species, with 23-100% of culverts or tunnels being used by amphibians. However, five studies found that culverts were used by less than 10% of amphibians or were not used at all (Action 884). The effectiveness of tunnels/culverts was affected by various design factors including diameter (wider culverts used more), length (long culverts avoided), lighting (mixed effects), substrate (natural substrates used more), and presence of water (mixed effects) (Action 884). Despite physical interventions, one study noted that thousands of amphibians were still killed on roads even with tunnel systems in place (Action 884).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

For natterjack toads, five before-and-after studies in the UK and Denmark found that pond creation, along with other interventions, significantly increased natterjack toad populations, or maintained or increased populations at 75% of sites (Action 866). Additionally, created ponds had lower natterjack toad tadpole mortality from desiccation compared to natural ponds, but higher mortality from predation by invertebrates (Action 866). For green toads, two before-and-after studies in Denmark found that pond creation significantly increased green toad populations, while a replicated study in Sweden found that green toads used 59% and reproduced in 41% of created ponds (Action 864). For toads in general, studies in Germany, the UK and USA found that translocated and naturally colonizing toads established breeding populations in created ponds, or in one case 33% of created ponds (Action 868). European studies found that common toads naturally colonized 29-100% of created ponds, while midwife toads reproduced in 16% of created ponds in Switzerland (Action 868). Pond restoration studies across multiple European countries found that restoration and creation increased numbers of amphibian species, maintained or increased populations, or increased pond occupancy and ponds with breeding success, with restored and created ponds being colonized by 1-7 species and 6-65% of ponds colonized with 35% used for breeding (Action 878).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Patch retention harvesting involves retaining patches of trees rather than removing all vegetation. For amphibians, one study in Canada found that released red-legged frogs did not show significant movement towards retained tree patches, but large patches were selected more and moved out of less than small patches (Action 847). \n\nThinning trees within forests represents another alternative. Five studies in the USA found mixed effects on amphibian abundance depending on species and time since harvest. Two found mixed effects of thinning on abundance, one found that amphibian abundance increased except for ensatina salamanders, one found a negative overall response, and one found that thinning did not affect abundance. A meta-analysis of 24 studies in North America found that partial harvest including thinning decreased salamander populations. When compared to clearcutting, four studies found that two showed higher amphibian abundance in thinned forest, and two found mixed effects on abundance depending on species, life stage and time since harvest. The meta-analysis found that partial harvest resulted in smaller reductions in salamander populations than clearcutting (Action 852).\n\nShelterwood harvesting represents a third alternative. Three studies in the USA found that compared to clearcutting, shelterwood harvesting resulted in higher, similar or initially higher and then similar salamander abundance. The same meta-analysis found that partial harvest including shelterwood harvesting resulted in smaller reductions in salamander populations than clearcutting. However, two of three studies found that compared to no harvesting, shelterwood harvesting decreased salamander abundance and changed species composition (Action 851).\n\nOne study found that high volumes of pre-existing downed wood prevented declines in amphibian populations following thinning (Action 852).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Head-starting programs showed positive outcomes, with six of 10 studies finding that released head-started tadpoles, metamorphs or juveniles established breeding frog populations or increased populations of frogs or toads (action 881). Two of three studies found that captive-bred toads released as tadpoles, juveniles or metamorphs established populations, in one case at 70% of sites (action 875). For natterjack toads specifically, three studies found that translocated eggs, tadpoles, juveniles or adults established breeding populations at one site or in 30-70% of cases (action 859).\n\nPotential negative impacts include high mortality rates and low survival following release. Studies found that survival of released captive-bred Puerto Rican crested toads was low and that 25% were predated within two days of release (action 875). Some programs showed limited success, with one study finding that captive-bred and head-started toads did not establish populations (action 875), and two studies found that head-started metamorphs or adults did not prevent a frog population decline or establish a breeding toad population (action 881).

Creating refuges through adding coarse woody debris has mixed results - two studies in the USA and Indonesia found that adding coarse woody debris to forest floors had no effect on the number of amphibian species or overall abundance but had mixed effects on abundance of individual species, while one study in Australia found that restoration including reintroducing coarse woody debris to the forest floor increased frog species (Action 772). One UK study found that creating refugia for great crested newts, along with other interventions, maintained four populations, and two studies found that artificial refugia were used by translocated Hamilton's frogs and hellbenders, although few were used for breeding (Action 772). For captive breeding situations, providing particular enclosure furniture for calling sites, breeding areas or egg laying sites has proven effective, with one study in Fiji finding that adding rotting logs and hollow bamboo pipes promoted egg laying in frogs, and one study in Austria finding that captive frogs started breeding when housed in enclosures with more calling, perching and laying sites (Action 1876). Additionally, providing natural substrate for species which do not breed in water has been beneficial, with two studies finding that adding a variety of substrates to enclosures promoted egg laying in frogs (Action 1874).

Diameter affects tunnel use, with wider culverts used more according to three of six studies (Action 884). Length is important, with long culverts avoided according to one of two studies (Action 884). Lighting affects tunnel use in all three studies that examined it, though with mixed effects (Action 884). Substrate choice is crucial, with natural substrates used more than artificial ones according to three of six studies (Action 884). The presence of water in tunnels shows mixed effects, with two of three studies finding varied results (Action 884). Entrance location affects use according to one study, and tunnel climate affects use according to one study (Action 884). The majority of successful culverts/tunnels had barrier fencing to guide amphibians to entrances, and this fencing needs to be at least 0.6 m high to prevent frogs from climbing over, though some species like treefrogs and 10% of common toads can still climb over barrier fencing during breeding migrations (Actions 884, 756). Certain designs should be avoided - one-way tunnels with vertical entry chutes resulted in high mortality of common toads, and condensation deposits from steel culverts had very high metal concentrations (Action 884). Culverts with flowing water can be used by amphibians, though results vary by species, with some salamanders rarely using them while others use them the same amount as dry culverts (Action 884). Installing ledges in culverts can increase use - under-road culverts with ledges were used more than culverts without ledges by mammal species, and ledges with access ramps were used more often than those without (Action 2523).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Furthermore, no studies were found that evaluated the effects of maintaining, restoring or creating habitat connectivity on farmland for mammals (action 2381), and no studies were found that evaluated the effects of restoring or creating linear habitat features/green corridors on bat populations (action 2035). No evidence was found specifically related to hedgerows for amphibian habitat connectivity.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Temperature treatment shows high success rates, with four of five studies finding that increasing enclosure or water temperature to 30-37\u00b0C for over 16 hours cured frogs and toads of chytridiomycosis (Action 770). Antifungal treatment is also highly effective, with twelve of 16 studies finding that antifungal treatment cured or increased survival of amphibians with chytridiomycosis, and six of eight studies testing itraconazole specifically found it effective at curing amphibians (Action 882). Antibacterial treatment shows mixed results, with chloramphenicol antibiotic treatments curing some species but trimethoprim-sulfadiazine only increasing survival time without curing blue-and-yellow poison dart frogs (Action 763). The least beneficial strategies include immunization, which showed no significant reduction in infection rate or mortality in mountain yellow-legged frogs when vaccinated with formalin-killed chytrid fungus (Action 765), and antifungal skin bacteria or peptides, where three of four studies found no reduction in infection rate or death when adding antifungal bacteria to amphibian skin (Action 764). However, antifungal treatments carry risks, as six studies found that specific fungicides caused death or other negative side effects in amphibians (Action 882).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the general outcomes of releasing captive-bred toads, including species like the Mallorcan midwife toad?\nanswer: Studies on releasing captive-bred toads show varied but generally positive outcomes for establishing breeding populations. For Mallorcan midwife toads specifically, three studies found that captive-bred individuals released as tadpoles, toadlets or adults established breeding populations at 38%, 80% or 100% of sites respectively (Action 873). However, one study found that while predator defences were maintained, genetic diversity was reduced in captive-bred reintroduced populations, and toads bred in captivity for nine or more generations showed slower tadpole development, reduction in predator defence traits and decreased genetic diversity (Actions 873, 837).\n\nFor other toad species, two of three studies found that captive-bred toads released as tadpoles, juveniles or metamorphs established populations, with success rates of 70% at some sites (Action 875). However, outcomes varied significantly by species - studies of Puerto Rican crested toads found low survival rates with 25% predated within two days of release (Action 875). Head-starting programs showed more positive results, with six of 10 studies finding that released head-started tadpoles, metamorphs or juveniles established breeding populations or increased existing populations (Action 881).\n\nCaptive breeding success rates also varied by species and conditions. Ten studies found that various toad species produced eggs successfully in captivity, with eight successfully raising captive-bred toads to tadpoles, toadlets or adults, though two found that most toads died after hatching or metamorphosis (Action 848). For harlequin toads, breeding success was more challenging, with only three of five studies achieving reproduction in captivity (Action 836). Environmental factors significantly affected outcomes, with reproductive success influenced by tank humidity and outdoor enclosures showing higher success rates than indoor tanks (Action 848).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: For road mitigation projects, what design factors are associated with the success or failure of tunnels and culverts for amphibian passage?\nanswer: Based on studies of road mitigation projects, several design factors are associated with the success or failure of tunnels and culverts for amphibian passage. Diameter significantly affects usage, with wider culverts used more in three of six studies (Action 884). Length impacts effectiveness, with long culverts avoided in one of two studies (Action 884). Lighting shows mixed effects across all three studies examining this factor (Action 884). Substrate type influences usage, with natural substrates used more than artificial ones in three of six studies (Action 884). The presence of water has mixed effects in two of three studies (Action 884). Entrance location affects usage patterns in one study, and tunnel climate influences usage in one study (Action 884). \n\nBarrier fencing is crucial for guiding amphibians to entrances, as the majority of effective culverts/tunnels had barrier fencing, and one study found decreased road deaths only when barrier fencing was also installed (Action 884). Barriers must be at least 0.6 m high to prevent green frogs and leopard frogs from climbing over (Action 756). However, some amphibians like treefrogs and 10% of common toads can still climb over barrier fencing during breeding migrations (Action 756).\n\nCertain design features result in failure: one-way tunnels with vertical entry chutes resulted in high mortality of common toads, and condensation deposits from steel culverts had very high metal concentrations (Action 884). Studies of culverts with flowing water show mixed results, with some being used by amphibians and others rarely used or not used at all (Action 884). Despite mitigation efforts, one study found that thousands of amphibians were still killed on roads even with culverts installed (Action 884).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
