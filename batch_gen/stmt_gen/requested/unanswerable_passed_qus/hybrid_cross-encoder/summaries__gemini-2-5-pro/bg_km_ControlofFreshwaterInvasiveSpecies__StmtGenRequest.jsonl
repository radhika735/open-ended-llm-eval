Additionally, a before-and-after study in France showed a significant reduction in the number of recorded adults and juveniles after removing juveniles by trapping as part of a combination treatment (1046). Another replicated, before-and-after study in the USA demonstrated that the removal of American bullfrogs led to a significant increase in the population of California red-legged frogs (825).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Another study in the USA also found that rotenone successfully eradicated black bullheads, although one of the two ponds studied required a second dose (1050).

In contrast, one replicated study in Belgium reported very low catchability of adult bullfrogs using a double fyke net over a 24-hour period [1045]. A small study in the USA, however, found that adult bullfrogs can be captured overnight using a single floating trap [1045]. Another replicated, controlled study in the USA observed that bullfrog populations quickly recovered after intensive removal of adults [1045]. Additionally, a before-and-after study in France showed a significant reduction in the number of adult and juvenile bullfrogs when shooting of metamorphosed individuals was part of a combined treatment approach before reproduction [1045].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
