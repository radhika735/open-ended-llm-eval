One study in Italy indicated that restoring connectivity between two wetlands by raising a road on a viaduct led to a significant decrease in the deaths of migrating amphibians (840). Additionally, a study in Australia found that retaining native vegetation corridors successfully maintained populations of eight out of 13 frog species over a 20-year period (853). A global review of wetland restoration showed that in 89% of cases, restored and created wetlands had amphibian abundance or species numbers similar to or higher than natural wetlands (879). Furthermore, seven of nine studies in Canada, Taiwan, and the USA reported that wetland restoration increased the number of amphibian species, with breeding populations establishing in some instances (879).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

One study on connectivity for reptiles found that in an area with hedges connecting different habitat types there were more unique reptile species and reptile communities were more similar across the different habitat types than in an area with no hedges [3663]. However, another study found that forest fragments connected by corridors and isolated forest fragments had similar reptile species richness, reptile species composition and abundance of reptiles [3663].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What is the impact of reducing tillage on farmland for local amphibian populations?\nanswer: There is no evidence for the effects of reduced tillage on amphibian populations (789). However, studies have looked at the impact on other wildlife. In Europe, 34 studies found some positive effects of reduced tillage on earthworms, some invertebrates, weeds, or farmland birds, such as increased biomass, species richness, or abundance (126). One review noted that tillage had negative effects on invertebrate numbers, and no-till systems had more invertebrate bird food resources (126). Conversely, 26 studies in Europe reported that reducing tillage had negative, no, or inconsistent effects on the abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates, earthworms, plants, mammals, and birds (126). In North America, Canada, and the UK, four controlled studies and two reviews found that some or all bird groups had higher species richness or diversity on reduced-tillage fields, while two other studies and a review found lower or no difference in diversity for some measures (211). Some bird species were found at higher densities on reduced-tillage fields, while others were found at similar or lower densities (211).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What is the most cost-effective method for creating new ponds for great crested newts?\nanswer: Several studies have investigated the effectiveness of creating new ponds for great crested newts, but none have explicitly mentioned the cost-effectiveness of these methods. In Germany and the UK, three before-and-after studies, two of which were replicated, found that great crested newts, whether naturally colonizing, captive-bred, or translocated, established breeding populations in 57\u201375% of the created ponds or sites (863). Additionally, three replicated before-and-after studies in the UK showed that up to 88% of created ponds were colonized by translocated or small numbers of naturally colonizing great crested newts (863). For head-started great crested newts, one replicated before-and-after study in the UK found that they reproduced in 38% of the created ponds (863). However, a systematic review in the UK found no conclusive evidence that mitigation efforts, which often include pond creation, lead to self-sustaining populations (863). When considering salamanders and newts more broadly, three before-and-after studies in France, Germany, and the USA, two of which were replicated, found that naturally colonizing alpine newts, captive-bred smooth newts, or translocated spotted salamanders established stable breeding populations in 20\u2013100% of created ponds (867). In terms of specific reproductive success, two replicated, before-and-after studies in France and China found that alpine newts or Chinhai salamanders reproduced in 60\u2013100% of created ponds (867). A small, replicated, before-and-after study in the USA found that translocated spotted salamanders reproduced in created ponds, but tiger salamanders did not (867). As a related management technique, one before-and-after study in the USA found that draining ponds to eliminate fish increased the number of amphibian species (826). Furthermore, a replicated, before-and-after study in Estonia showed that pond restoration, which sometimes included drying to eliminate fish, and pond creation led to an increase in the numbers of species and breeding populations of common spadefoot toads and great crested newts when compared to no management (826). Finally, three studies in the UK and USA, one of which was a review, found that drying ponds to eliminate fish, sometimes in conjunction with other management activities, increased the breeding success of frog or newt species (826).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
