A laboratory study found that pollen from genetically modified maize that produces a pesticide did not harm the survival or growth of eastern tiger swallowtail or spicebush swallowtail caterpillars when compared to non-genetically modified maize [3895].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
