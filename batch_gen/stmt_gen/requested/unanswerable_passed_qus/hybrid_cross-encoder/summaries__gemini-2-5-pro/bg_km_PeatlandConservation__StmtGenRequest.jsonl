One study on a bog in the UK found that lower grazing intensity resulted in greater total vegetation, shrub cover, and vegetation biomass (1735). Another study found that excluding sheep from a bog in the UK led to an increase in total vegetation, shrub, and bryophyte biomass (1734). However, in the same study, excluding sheep had no effect on the plant community in wetter areas, while in drier areas, it favored dry moorland plants (1734). Additionally, five studies found that excluding livestock did not affect Sphagnum moss cover (1734).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

However, no studies were found that assessed the effects of controlling wild herbivore populations on peatland vegetation (1861). Additionally, no evidence was found regarding the effects of introducing beavers to impede water flow in forest watercourses (1187).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the long-term effects (over 30 years) of using prescribed fire to control problematic plants on bog vegetation composition?\nanswer: One replicated, paired, controlled study in a bog in the UK found that burning increased cottongrass cover after 8-18 years (1774). Another study in the same bog found that cottongrass cover was similar in plots burned every 10 or 20 years (1774). Three replicated, paired studies in a bog in the UK found that heather cover was lower in plots burned more often (1774). In the same bog, it was found that moss cover, including Sphagnum, was higher in plots that were burned more often (1774). One replicated, paired, controlled study in a bog in the UK found that plots burned more frequently contained more biomass of grass-like plants, but less total vegetation, shrub and bryophyte biomass (1774). One replicated, controlled study in a bog in the UK found that burning reduced or limited plant species richness (1774). However, a replicated, controlled study in a bog in New Zealand found that burning increased plant species richness or diversity (1763).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
