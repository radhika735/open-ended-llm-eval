In 17 of 19 studies, the abundance of butterflies and moths was also higher (3915). Increasing the proportion of natural or semi-natural habitat on farmland was found to increase butterfly and moth species richness in nine of eleven studies, and increase their abundance in six replicated studies (3910). Planting wild bird seed or cover mixture was found to increase the abundance and species richness of butterflies (594). Providing buffer strips with restrictions on fertilizer and pesticide use was found to increase the abundance of moths in one study (3894).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Two replicated, randomized field studies in Argentina and the USA found that stocking with grass carp reduced the biomass or abundance of parrot\u2019s feather, but one replicated, controlled laboratory study in Portugal found that grass carp did not reduce the biomass or cover of parrot\u2019s feather [1599].

In Germany, a study found that managed orchards had a lower abundance of butterflies and burnet moths than abandoned orchards (3917). Another study in the USA found that vineyards managed to encourage native plants, and where insecticide was rarely used, had a greater abundance of butterflies than conventionally managed vineyards (3919).

Another replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that the survival of monarch butterfly caterpillars was similar on common milkweed planted in gardens and meadows (3842). A third study found that monarch butterfly adults used common milkweed planted in gardens more than milkweed planted in meadows (3842). Two replicated studies found that using cages or water and chemicals to exclude vertebrate or terrestrial predators (mainly ants) did not increase the survival of monarch caterpillars (3889).
