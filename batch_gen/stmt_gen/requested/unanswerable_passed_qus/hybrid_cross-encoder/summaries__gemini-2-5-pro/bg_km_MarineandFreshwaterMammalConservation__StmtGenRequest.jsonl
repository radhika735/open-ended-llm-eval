One before-and-after study in the North Atlantic Ocean found that setting vessel speed limits during specific periods in key habitats resulted in fewer North Atlantic right whale deaths caused by collisions [2777]. A similar study on manatees in the Indian River estuarine system found fewer deaths after speed limits were set and enforced in all areas [2777]. There were no studies found that evaluated the effects of diverting shipping routes or using on-board observers to prevent collisions [2754, 2755].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

No studies were found that evaluated the effects of creating a marine protected area or setting levels of legal protection where natural climate refugia occur to further promote the persistence and recovery of species facing climate change [2222]. Additionally, no studies were found that evaluated the effects of establishing a network of legally protected areas on marine and freshwater mammal populations [2913].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
