The available evidence on education for marine and freshwater mammals showed only changes in participant intentions and behaviors\u2014such as increased willingness to support marine conservation or to cut fishing nets to save entangled dolphins, including in Peru\u2014and reported no population or health outcomes (community response: 0 studies; population response: 0 studies) (action 2935). Additional education programme evidence concerned terrestrial carnivores in South Africa and household outreach on garbage and bears in the USA, not dolphins or plastic ingestion outcomes (action 2423). A review from North America stated education alone was not sufficient to change behavior without complementary measures, and did not provide outcomes for dolphins or plastic ingestion (action 162).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
