Similarly, no studies have been found that evaluated the effects of placing signs to deter gathering of shrubland species (Action ID: 1613). Additionally, no studies have been found that evaluated the effects of legally protecting habitat around shrubland on shrublands (Action ID: 1675). The systematic journal and report searches have been unable to assess whether these legal protection actions are effective or have any harmful impacts due to the absence of direct evaluation studies.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

The action database contains information about heathland restoration (action 3946), which shows evidence that heathland restoration can affect butterfly and moth communities, with restored moorland supporting moth communities more similar to established heather moorland than degraded moorland. Related soil fauna studies focus on agricultural contexts, where no-tillage practices increase earthworm numbers compared to conventional tillage (action 2306), and reduced tillage sometimes increases earthworm populations (action 2307). However, these studies examine earthworm responses to management practices rather than active introduction of non-native earthworm species. The database also contains actions related to preventing non-native species introductions (actions 2156, 2157) but no studies evaluating deliberate earthworm introductions for soil improvement purposes in any habitat type.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
