Action 729 reports that six studies from Canada and the USA examined predator numbers in adjacent crops, with a review finding that predators increased in adjacent crops, though one study found effects varied with time and another found no effect. Four studies and a review found more invertebrate predators on beetle banks than in surrounding crops, including soybean crops which were specifically mentioned among the crops studied (barley, field bean, maize, oats, pea, radish, rapeseed, soybean, wheat and pasture). However, two studies found small or slow movements of predators from banks to crops, and one study found greater beetle activity in fields but this did not improve pest predation. The economic analysis indicated that beetle banks could make economic savings if they prevented pests from reaching a spray threshold or causing 5% yield loss. Studies also showed that certain grass species used in beetle banks held higher numbers of predatory invertebrates than others, suggesting design considerations affect effectiveness.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Action 238 found that fewer birds collided with deer fence marked with orange netting than with unmarked sections, based on a randomised, replicated and controlled study from the UK. However, Action 706 indicates that there is no evidence captured for the effects of marking fencing to avoid bird mortality specifically on farmland wildlife. For avoiding lead shot, Action 100 states that no evidence has been captured for the effects of avoiding the use of lead shot on farmland wildlife. While there is some evidence for marking effectiveness in related contexts, such as Action 265 which found that marking power lines led to significant reductions in collision rates in multiple studies, the specific farmland context lacks comprehensive evidence for both approaches.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
