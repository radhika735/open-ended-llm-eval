Fifty studies found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased forb species richness in 71% of cases and increased the cover or density of forb species in three of four studies. Sowing seeds at a higher density can improve success rates, with one study showing increased forb species richness and another showing increased forb cover (Action 3405). Disturbing soil before seeding/planting enhances establishment success, with studies showing increased forb species richness in most cases compared to harrowing and increased forb cover (Action 3413). Five studies found that disturbing soil before sowing seeds increased plant emergence in most cases compared to sowing alone. Applying herbicide before seeding can improve results, with one study finding increased sown species richness and improved cover of sown grass species (Action 3418). However, this method showed mixed effects on native forb species. Planting grassland plants (transplants) showed promising results with one study finding increased species richness of forbs in 83% of cases, though this method may be more labor-intensive than seeding (Action 3399).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
