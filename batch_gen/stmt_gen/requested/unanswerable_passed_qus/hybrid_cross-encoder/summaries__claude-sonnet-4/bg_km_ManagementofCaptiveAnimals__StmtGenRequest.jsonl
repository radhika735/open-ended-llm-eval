The action documents show that simulating rainfall using sound recordings of rain and/or thunderstorms has no captured evidence for its effects (action 1867). Similarly, allowing temperate amphibians to hibernate has no captured evidence for its effects (action 1868). However, the documents do show that varying artificial rainfall to simulate seasonal changes (rather than sound recordings) has evidence of effectiveness - two studies in Germany and Austria found that simulating a wet and dry season stimulated breeding and egg deposition (action 1872). Additionally, one review and four studies found that reproductive success of frogs in captivity depended on temperature or a simulated wet and dry season (action 835).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

The searches conducted returned actions related to carnivore feeding practices (such as providing bones, hides, or partial carcasses), diet supplementation, and general health monitoring with permanent veterinary care, but none contained specific dental care protocols, oral examination procedures, teeth cleaning methods, or dental hygiene management recommendations for captive carnivores.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
