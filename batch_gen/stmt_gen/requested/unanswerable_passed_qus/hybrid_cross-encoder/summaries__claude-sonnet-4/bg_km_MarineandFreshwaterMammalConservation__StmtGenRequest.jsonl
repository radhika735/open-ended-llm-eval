Action 2912 identifies that legally protecting areas where climate change impacts are predicted to be less severe has not been evaluated in any studies for marine and freshwater mammal populations. Similarly, action 2222 shows that creating marine protected areas or setting legal protection levels where natural climate refugia occur to promote species persistence and recovery facing climate change has not been evaluated in any studies. Action 2913 indicates that establishing networks of legally protected areas also lacks direct evaluation studies for marine and freshwater mammal populations. However, action 2915 provides some evidence on the effectiveness of legally protecting habitat for marine and freshwater mammals, showing that four studies found varied results: one study in the North Atlantic Ocean found Mediterranean monk seal populations increased during eight years after legal protection, while a North Sea study found bottlenose dolphin populations remained similar in size before and after protection. Additionally, a South Pacific Ocean study found higher survival rates for Hector's dolphins after coastal legal protection, and a Port River estuary study showed reduced human-caused strandings of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins after legal protection was established.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: Which type of public education campaign is most successful at reducing plastic litter ingestion by river dolphins in South America?\nanswer: The action documents do not contain specific information about public education campaigns targeting plastic litter ingestion by river dolphins in South America. The search revealed limited relevant evidence: Action 2935 found that educational whale-watching tours in the South Pacific Ocean (Peru) resulted in participants being more willing to cut their fishing nets to save entangled dolphins, but this specifically addressed entanglement rather than plastic ingestion. Action 2895 found no studies that evaluated the effects of removing litter from marine and freshwater environments on marine and freshwater mammal populations. Action 2932 mentioned Amazon river dolphins in captivity but found that most captive-born Amazon river dolphins did not survive in captivity (USA, China, Indonesia and Venezuela). The multimedia campaign evidence from Action 1571 showed successful conservation education programs for various primate species in different countries, but did not specifically address marine mammals or plastic pollution. Action 3682 demonstrated that education and awareness campaigns could be effective for reptile conservation, with examples showing reduced killing and increased survival rates, but again did not address marine mammals or plastic pollution specifically.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
