Action ID 887 shows that adding mulch increased soil organic matter, improved soil structure, increased soil moisture, and reduced soil erosion across multiple replicated trials in various soil types. Action ID 897 demonstrates that growing cover crops can increase soil organic matter. Action ID 898 found increased soil organic carbon when cover crops were used. Action ID 1345 reports that 10 out of 12 studies found more organic matter in soils with winter cover crops compared to soils without them. However, none of the action documents included economic data comparing costs between these methods. Without cost information, it is not possible to determine which method is more cost-effective.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the main social barriers preventing farmers from adopting crop rotation in Canada?\nanswer: Based on the available evidence from action documents, there is limited specific information about social barriers preventing Canadian farmers from adopting crop rotation practices. The documents primarily focus on the agronomic and environmental benefits of crop rotation rather than social barriers to adoption. Studies from Canada (action IDs 719, 857, 1368, 1354, 1383) demonstrate that crop rotation can provide benefits including increased crop yields in some years, higher crop quality (more protein in wheat), reduced pest populations, improved soil organic matter and carbon, enhanced microbial diversity, and increased profit. However, these studies do not address the social, cultural, or knowledge-related barriers that may prevent adoption. While some documents mention education programs and knowledge exchange in other agricultural contexts, none specifically examine the social factors limiting Canadian farmers' adoption of crop rotation practices.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
