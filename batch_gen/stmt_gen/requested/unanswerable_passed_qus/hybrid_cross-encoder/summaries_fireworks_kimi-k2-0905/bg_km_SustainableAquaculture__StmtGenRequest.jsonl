Additionally, preventing biofouling through regular cleaning and maintenance of culture systems (Action 2162), and sourcing fish stock from disease-free hatcheries (Action 2159) are recommended practices. However, it should be noted that most of these interventions lack specific studies evaluating their effects on tilapia specifically, with many studies stating 'we found no studies' that directly evaluated the effectiveness of these interventions.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Vaccinations against specific diseases have been shown in multiple controlled studies from Iceland, Norway, Australia, and Canada to increase survival rates post-exposure to various disease-causing bacteria including Aeromonas salmonicida spp.achromogenes, Yersinia ruckeri, marine flexibacteriosis, bacterial kidney disease, and infectious salmon anaemia. In contrast, altering cage size has only limited evidence showing reduced levels of amoebic gill disease in larger versus smaller cages in one replicated study from Australia.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the international regulations for the use of genetically modified ingredients in salmon feed?\nanswer: Based on the available action documents, research has been conducted on the use of genetically modified ingredients in salmon feed. Three controlled, replicated (two randomised) studies in Norway found no difference in growth rate of Atlantic salmon that were fed diets containing either GM or non-GM soybeans. One randomised, replicated, controlled study in Norway found no differences in fish fed diets containing either GM or non-GM soybeans on the histology of the fish. The action documents indicate that plant-based protein sources, which may include GM ingredients, are being used as alternative protein sources in salmon feed, though they note that six studies (four replicated, controlled) in Norway, Scotland and the USA found that inclusion of plant-based proteins within feed led to decreased growth rates in salmon compared to fish meal diets. However, the action documents do not contain specific information about international regulatory frameworks or approval processes for GM ingredients in salmon feed.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
