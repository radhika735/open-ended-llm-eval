The conservation evidence base contains no studies that have directly tested genetically modifying crops to reduce primate crop raiding. However, related non-GMO approaches have been explored: Action 1439 documents that changing to crops less palatable to primates has not been studied for effectiveness, and Action 1438 shows that using unpalatable buffer crops also lacks evidence for its effects on primate populations. The only genetic modification study found (Action 3895) examined GMO crops producing pesticide to replace conventional pesticides, but this focused on butterflies and moths rather than primates, and found no negative effects on caterpillar survival or growth. Alternative deterrent methods show mixed results - Action 2492 found that chili-based deterrents repelled elephants in five of seven studies, though this species-specific evidence may not translate to primate deterrence. The systematic searches conducted for these actions found no quantitative studies assessing crop palatability modification strategies for primate conservation.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
