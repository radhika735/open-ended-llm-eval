Organic farming compared to conventional farming demonstrates mixed results: five of nine studies found no difference in overall bat activity, while four studies found higher activity on organic farms, including higher feeding activity and species-specific benefits for Brazilian free-tailed bats and Myotis species over water habitats (action 961). Field size matters, with one study finding higher activity for six of seven bat species in landscapes with smaller fields compared to larger fields (action 1939). Hedgerow management shows benefits when trimming is less frequent: hedges trimmed \u22653 years prior had more bat species and higher activity for two of eight species compared to recently trimmed hedges (action 1943). Creating tree plantations on agricultural land showed no difference in species richness, with two of three studies finding no difference in bat activity, though plantations next to remnant vegetation had higher activity than isolated plantations (action 958). Agri-environment schemes showed no significant benefits, with two of three studies finding no difference in overall bat activity compared to conventional farms, and one study finding lower activity on scheme farms (action 962). Creating artificial water sources such as farm ponds and reservoirs can increase bat activity compared to surrounding habitats (action 959). Riparian buffers showed no effect on pipistrelle activity in one study (action 2284). No significant difference was found for pipistrelle activity between species-rich grassland created on agri-environment scheme farms and conventional farm fields (action 2051).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Benefits include increased occupancy over time, with nine studies finding bat box use increased 2-10 times up to 10 years after installation (Action ID: 1024). However, there are significant limitations and negative impacts. Common pipistrelle bats used heated bat boxes at only one of seven sites, and none were used by maternity colonies (Action ID: 2052). Displaced bats often fail to use provided alternatives - two studies found bats displaced from buildings did not use any of 43 bat houses of four different designs or 12 heated bat boxes of one design (Action ID: 1024). When alternative roosts are created within developments, two studies found bats did not use any of the alternative roosts provided in bat houses or purpose-built bat walls after exclusion from buildings, and a UK review found new bat boxes/lofts built to replace destroyed roosts were four times less likely to be used by returning bats than roosts retained during development (Action ID: 949). Success rates vary considerably, with 22 studies finding bats occupying less than half of bat boxes provided (0-49%) while nine studies found bats occupying more than half (54-100%) (Action ID: 1024).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Creating alternative bat roosts within developments has been attempted in eleven studies, with mixed results - while some bats used purpose-built roosts after original roosts were destroyed, new bat boxes/lofts were four times less likely to be used by returning bats than retained roosts (Action 949). Relocating access points to bat roosts within developments showed variable outcomes, with fewer bats using relocated access points in some cases (Action 946). Legal protection during development has been implemented, though one review found that 68% of roosts were still destroyed despite licensing requirements (Action 1935). Excluding bats from roosts during building work did not change roost switching frequency or foraging behavior of soprano pipistrelle colonies (Action 1930).

Two studies across Ireland and France found that bat species used overpasses but up to three-quarters of bats still crossed at traffic height or at other nearby locations. Bat gantries/bat bridges show poor effectiveness - two UK studies found fewer bats used gantries than crossed roads at traffic height, with one gantry not used at all (Action ID 978).

For foraging habitat, creating or restoring bat foraging habitat in urban areas has shown positive results, with studies finding greater bat activity over biodiversity green roofs compared to conventional unvegetated roofs (Action 954). Protecting brownfield or ex-industrial sites can also provide habitat, with one study recording five bat species within a protected urban wildlife refuge on an abandoned manufacturing site (Action 953). For roosting habitat, multiple approaches are available. Providing bat boxes has been extensively studied, with 41 of 43 studies finding that bats used bat boxes installed in various urban settings including buildings, bridges, and urban areas (Action 1024). Studies have found that 72 bat species used bat boxes across Europe, North America and Asia. Creating artificial hollows and cracks in trees can provide natural roosting opportunities, with one study finding that eight of 16 artificial hollows cut into trees were used by roosting long-eared bats (Action 2047). Retaining veteran and standing dead trees as natural roosting sites is also recommended, though this approach lacks direct study evidence (Action 993). Additional urban habitat protection measures include increasing semi-natural habitat within gardens (Action 1933) and protecting greenfield sites or undeveloped land in urban areas (Action 1934), though these actions also lack direct evaluation studies.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Temperature management is also important, with studies showing more bats in artificial roosts after modifications to reduce internal temperatures (2052) and heated boxes generally having lower occupancy rates (2052).
