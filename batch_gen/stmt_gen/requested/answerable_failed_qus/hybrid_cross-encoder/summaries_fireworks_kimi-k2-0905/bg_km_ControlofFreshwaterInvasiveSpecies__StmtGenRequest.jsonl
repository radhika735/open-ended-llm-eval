Biological control using co-evolved, host-specific herbivores shows promise, with studies demonstrating that flea beetles caused heavy feeding destruction to water primrose seedlings and significantly reduced plant abundance when introduced to ponds. Physical removal through hand-pulling was found to eradicate smaller populations when done from pond margins, though hand pulling combined with raking failed to reduce abundance in larger populations. Other non-chemical methods including flame treatment, use of bottom mats, environmental control (shading, altered flow, dredging), and bank excavation have been proposed, but no evidence was found documenting their effectiveness. Similarly, biological control using fungal-based herbicides lacks supporting evidence for its use.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

For Asian clams, a controlled laboratory study in the USA found that 100% mortality occurred when clams were exposed to high salinities ranging from 18-34\u2030 (action ID: 1115). Additionally, temperatures of 36\u00b0C or higher killed Asian clams within four days in controlled laboratory conditions (action ID: 1116). For Ponto-Caspian gammarids, a UK laboratory study demonstrated that heating water to temperatures above 36\u00b0C killed all shrimps after 15 minutes exposure, while temperatures exceeding 43\u00b0C caused immediate death (action ID: 1092). Regarding salinity control for gammarids, mixed results were observed: one replicated laboratory study (one controlled) in Canada and the UK found that increasing salinity levels killed the majority of invasive shrimp within five hours, while another study found that increased salinity did not kill invasive killer shrimp (action ID: 1091).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

A replicated study from 1999-2000 in shallow interconnected ponds in a nature reserve in Belgium found that double fyke nets could be used to significantly reduce the population of brown bullhead measuring over 8cm. Other potential alternatives include draining invaded waterbodies, combined netting and electrofishing approaches, trapping using sound or pheromonal lures, biological control using native predators, and environmental modifications such as changing pH or salinity.

Lightproof barriers also showed effectiveness, with five before-and-after studies in the UK finding that covering Crassula helmsii with black sheeting or carpet strips eradicated or severely reduced the plant's coverage, though recolonization occurred at two sites (Action ID: 1294).

One UK study found both glyphosate and 2,4-D Amine killed all skunk cabbage plants in test areas, while another UK study showed that 2,4-D amine at 9 litres/ha successfully eradicated skunk cabbage, but glyphosate only achieved limited reduction in plant growth (Action ID: 1102).

Chemical treatments have shown effectiveness, with studies demonstrating that biocides including chlorine, potassium, and copper can kill Asian clams. Higher concentrations of chlorine and bromine delivered at elevated temperatures reduce the time required for effectiveness. BioBullets, which are fat-coated particles, have been shown to kill 100% of Asian clams within pipes in irrigation systems. Physical methods include mechanical removal and regular cleaning of industrial pipes, with studies showing this approach to be effective for permanent removal or reduction of clam populations. The addition of sand filters has also proven effective for reducing Asian clam numbers. Temperature modification is another viable approach, with laboratory studies indicating that water temperatures of 36\u00b0C or higher kill Asian clams within four days.

For skunk cabbage, herbicide choice is critical - studies show conflicting results with glyphosate (Action 1102), with one UK study finding complete kill and another finding limited growth reduction only, while 2,4-D amine consistently achieved eradication at 9 litres/ha. For water primrose, multiple success factors emerge: herbicide selection matters, with triclopyr TEA achieving 100% kill of young plants at 0.25% concentration, glyphosate achieving 97% mortality when mixed with non-oil based sticking agents and 100% mortality with TopFilm, and halosulfuron-methyl providing significant coverage reduction without harming rice plants (Action 1139). Application method affects outcomes, as glyphosate with Cygnet-Plus plus mechanical removal achieved only 75% kill, while combination approaches using herbicide, physical removal, native plant promotion and mulching reduced Peruvian primrose-willow coverage by 85-90% (Action 1140).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

For Ponto-Caspian gammarids, chemical treatments (iodine solution, acetic acid, Virkon S, sodium hypochlorite) can kill invasive killer shrimp in freshwater, though these are considered impractical for field use.

Evidence indicates that trapping with food bait (tinned meat) is more effective than using pheromones or unbaited traps, with over half of all crayfish caught in food-baited traps (Action 1029). Creating physical barriers using concrete dams specifically designed with features to prevent crayfish from crawling over them has been shown to effectively contain population spread upstream in Spain (Action 1037). Combining trapping with predator encouragement has demonstrated significant population reductions - a Swiss study found that introducing predators combined with trapping significantly reduced crayfish populations, and an Italian study showed this combination was more effective than predation alone (Action 1031). Natural predation by eels has been shown to reduce crayfish populations in Italian studies, and pike also predate on red swamp crayfish according to French research (Action 1030). Sterilization of males through X-ray exposure reduced offspring production by 43% in laboratory studies (Action 1032).
