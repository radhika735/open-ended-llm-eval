Connected habitats were used more: common buckeye and variegated fritillary were more likely to move between connected patches, and grassland strips providing nectar or shelter were more likely to be used than strips with no resources (3934). Retaining connectivity helped population persistence in suboptimal sites: low-quality patches that were well connected were more likely to retain Alcon large blue populations than less connected patches (3832). Corridors facilitated colonization over longer distances: common buckeye were more likely to colonize farther-away patches when released on suitable habitat corridors than when released in unsuitable habitat (3832).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the benefits for butterflies and moths of reducing or eliminating chemical inputs on farmland?\nanswer: Across multiple study types and farm systems, reducing or eliminating fertilizers, pesticides or herbicides was associated with higher species richness and/or abundance of butterflies, moths or their caterpillars compared to conventional or more frequent chemical applications, though some studies reported similar values in certain contexts. Studies reported greater species richness in orchards, crop edges, farms, vineyards, replanted forest stands, coffee plantations and agricultural landscapes with reduced or no chemical inputs, and higher richness of specialist moths on unfertilized grassland, while some sites showed similar richness to conventional management (3897). On permanent grasslands, lower-input management and stopping chemical applications were linked to higher species richness of butterflies and moths, more specialist moths and species of conservation concern, and increases in large moth species richness after grazing was reduced and chemicals stopped (3958). Abundance responses included higher abundance of adult butterflies and moths, and caterpillars under reduced or no chemical inputs in several settings, with some studies reporting similar or mixed results (3897). On low-input or unfertilized, ungrazed grasslands managed with a single cut, abundance of butterflies, micro\u2011moths and declining macro\u2011moths was higher than on intensively managed grassland, and after reducing grazing and stopping chemicals, total abundance of large moths and several butterfly species increased (3958). In vineyards, fewer chemical inputs were linked to greater butterfly species richness in Spain and greater abundance in the USA, while one USA study found similar species richness where insecticide was rarely used (3919). In orchards, unmanaged or partially managed sites had higher richness and diversity of leaf\u2011eating arthropods (including caterpillars) than commercially managed sites, and managed orchards had lower abundance of butterflies and burnet moths than abandoned orchards (3917). Conversion to organic farming was associated in several studies with greater species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths than on conventional farms, sometimes varying with landscape context and time since conversion; a before\u2011and\u2011after study reported increases in large moth abundance and some butterfly species after conversion alongside other management changes (3907).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are some evidence-based alternatives to prescribed burning for managing disturbance in forests to benefit butterflies?\nanswer: Evidence-based, non-burning disturbance options in forests include: (1) Thinning trees: studies reported higher butterfly richness and/or abundance one to four years after thinning (often alongside mulching or nearby felling) compared to unmanaged woodland, though one study found similar richness/abundance and rarer fruit-feeding species were less frequent in thinned forest; partially-cleared plots had higher butterfly but lower moth richness than closed-canopy forest [3940]. (2) Coppicing woodland: multiple studies found higher abundance of butterflies generally and of species such as heath fritillary in recently coppiced stands; coppice age influenced communities and richness; some studies reported lower macro-moth richness/abundance than mature forest; fritillary populations were more likely to persist for up to 20 years in coppiced or young-plantation woodlands; increases were also reported after coppicing combined with scrub control, felling, and grazing [3939]. (3) Clearing or opening patches (including widening rides): cleared patches often had greater butterfly richness and abundance than unmanaged or closed-canopy forest, with larger patches performing better; benefits were shown for species such as chequered blue, woodland brown, high brown fritillary, and small pearl-bordered fritillary; some studies noted declines over three years post-clearing and lower macro-moth abundance in wider rides; a European review reported benefits for 19 of 67 species of conservation concern; selected pine clearance supported increases and survival of a translocated baton blue population [3938]. (4) Creating young plantations within mature woodland: larger areas of young plantations (or coppicing) were associated with higher persistence of pearl-bordered and small pearl-bordered fritillaries over 20 years compared to mature conifer (both species) and mature deciduous (pearl-bordered fritillary) woodland [3941]. (5) Forest restoration with structural interventions (coppicing, felling, ride management/widening): studies reported that populations of high brown fritillary, pearl-bordered fritillary, wood white and grizzled skipper stayed the same or increased; butterflies such as heath fritillary occupied greater areas post-restoration and were more likely to fly into restored than unrestored areas; high brown fritillary presence was maintained or higher, with associations to brash/bracken litter coverage after restoration [3936].

Under prescribed burning, some prairie specialists (including regal fritillary and arogos skipper) and several individual species were less abundant in burned prairies or pastures than in hayed prairies or grazed pastures, whereas generalist and migrant species (and purplish copper) were more abundant in burned than in hayed or grazed sites; other studies reported species increasing one or more years after burning, species decreasing five years after burning, and responses depending on site vegetation, indicating mixed effects on abundance (3882).

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the effects of reducing or ceasing pesticide and fertiliser use on butterfly and moth diversity?\nanswer: Across multiple contexts, reducing or ceasing pesticide and fertiliser inputs is associated with equal or higher diversity and often higher abundance of butterflies and moths. In UK waterbody margins with restrictions on fertiliser and pesticide use (plus restricted mowing/grazing), moth abundance increased while moth species richness was similar to conventional margins [3894]. On permanent grasslands managed with lower inputs (including reduced or stopped chemical applications), butterfly and moth species richness was often higher (though sometimes similar), and a UK before-and-after study reported increased large moth species richness after grazing reduction and stopping chemical applications; abundance of several groups also increased, with some species-specific decreases reported [3958]. Leaving arable headlands unsprayed increased butterfly species richness and often increased abundances of butterflies and caterpillars compared to sprayed headlands [3898]. Stopping herbicide use on pavements/road verges led to greater butterfly species richness and abundance in restored roadside prairies in the USA, while Canadian transmission lines without spraying/mowing had higher abundances of certain butterfly species but similar total richness and abundance [3899]. In gardens, not using insecticides and herbicides was associated with higher butterfly abundance, whereas not using fungicides and snail pellets was associated with lower butterfly abundance [3900]. Converting farms to organic management (which avoids synthetic pesticides and fertilisers) often increased butterfly and moth species richness and abundance compared to conventional farms, though several studies found similar richness or abundance, and increases were sometimes context-dependent (e.g., more evident in intensively managed landscapes or within a few years post-conversion) [3907].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the main alternatives to grazing for maintaining open grassland habitats, and how do their effects on butterfly communities compare?\nanswer: Evidence on non-grazing approaches most frequently covers mowing/haying, mechanical cutting, and rotational burning. Mechanical cutting of heathland or barrens can maintain open conditions and, in some cases, support higher or unchanged butterfly abundances compared to burning or previous burn-based management\u2014for example, Karner blue abundance was higher where pine barrens were mechanically cut than where they were rotationally burned or left as unburned refuges, and switching from rotational burning to unintensive cutting did not change abundance of five other species; in UK heathland, scrub cutting with other interventions coincided with increases of high brown fritillary and small pearl-bordered fritillary (3947). Changing mowing regimes shows mixed outcomes: haying increased prairie specialist butterflies but decreased generalist and migrant butterflies compared to burning; Karner blue abundance under mowing was similar to unmanaged or burned sites; season of mowing mattered for a moth, with August mowing reducing caterpillars while November mowing did not (3945). Across species-rich grasslands, comparisons of mowing/haying versus grazing or burning show variable responses: some studies found similar butterfly richness or abundance between mown and grazed sites, others found higher richness or abundance under grazing or under haying depending on region, species group, or time since management; in several cases, staggered mowing increased butterfly richness, while mowing reduced nocturnal moth richness compared to unmown grasslands (3908). Rotational burning produced diverse effects: butterfly richness was sometimes higher than on unmanaged or annually burned/mown sites but could be lower than unmanaged in some regions; abundance often peaked several years post-burn and was higher under burn-plus-graze than either alone in some studies, though certain taxa (e.g., grass-skippers) declined more strongly under rotational burning; species-specific responses varied, with regal fritillary often benefiting, especially several years after the last burn (3883). Overall, mowing/haying, mechanical cutting, and rotational burning are principal alternatives to grazing, with community and population responses varying by taxa, timing, and management combinations as documented in the cited studies (3947; 3945; 3908; 3883).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
