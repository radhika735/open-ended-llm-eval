Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What actions are available to a farmer in the USA to control weeds using natural methods?\nanswer: Evidence from action documents highlights several natural weed-control options relevant to arable systems: Growing cover crops or living mulches can influence weeds, with USA studies reporting more weeds in some comparisons, inconsistent effects in others, similar amounts in some cases, and shifts in weed community composition when cover crops are used [1394]. Using reduced tillage has often been associated with more weeds than conventional tillage in some or all comparisons across multiple countries including the USA, with one USA study also reporting different weed community composition under reduced tillage [1399]. Using no tillage shows mixed weed outcomes across studies including the USA, with some comparisons finding more weeds, others fewer, and some similar, and similar numbers of predatory mites in USA soils under no-till versus tilled systems [1397]. Additional non-chemical methods tested for weed control include cutting, infection with fungal pathogens against creeping thistle, using weevils to transmit rust pathogens to creeping thistle, and achieving long-term control via lenient grazing; breed-specific grazing differences were also noted (Hebridean sheep grazed more purple moor grass than Swaledale) [123].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What is the evidence for using habitat manipulation within crop fields to boost natural enemy numbers?\nanswer: Evidence from beetle banks shows that predators increased in adjacent crops in a review, with several studies reporting more invertebrate predators on beetle banks than in surrounding crops, though some studies reported variable or no effects and limited movement from banks into crops (729). Planting non-crop species that release chemicals attractive to natural enemies led to higher numbers of natural enemies in plots in three studies, with one laboratory-verified attractive plant, while one study found no effect on parasitism when the plant was not attractive (724). Flower strips planted within fields were associated with more natural enemies in fields in some comparisons in two replicated studies from the USA, and with more natural enemies (and, in one case, more species) in the strips themselves than on bare ground in replicated, controlled studies from Italy; some flower species were more attractive than others (1400; 2313). Intercropping increased ground beetle abundance in replicated, controlled, randomized studies from the Netherlands, Poland and the UK, and a review reported enhanced ground beetle numbers under intercropping relative to single crops (124).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Using chemicals that attract natural enemies increased parasitism in some studies, sometimes increased natural enemy abundance, and in some cases reduced pest numbers or crop damage; the set of crops studied included maize [754]. Creating beetle banks increased predator numbers in adjacent crops according to a review, produced the greatest pest reductions closest to the banks, and was associated with fewer pests in fields with beetle banks; potential economic savings were reported when banks prevented pests reaching spray thresholds; crops studied included maize [729].

Effects on pests were mixed, with some studies reporting decreases in pests in partially cut plots, others reporting increases in partially cut plots, and some finding more pests in uncut areas; the crops studied were alfalfa and meadow pasture (725). In coffee plantations, farms containing a native tree species together with a non-native species had higher butterfly diversity than farms with a single non-native tree species, similar diversity to farms with two non-native species, and similar butterfly species richness and abundance to farms with one or two non-native species (3920).

Planting nettle strips in arable field margins increased the number of aphid predator species, with some predator families (including green lacewings) found only on nettles, though predator abundance on nettle strips was lower than on crops in the small study (118). Using mixed pasture reduced weeds in two studies and, across five studies that measured pests, one found fewer pests and two found reductions in some pest groups or pasture mixes, while one found no effect and another found more pests (721).
