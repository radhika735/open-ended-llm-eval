Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the general outcomes and challenges associated with captive breeding programs for different amphibian groups like frogs, toads, and salamanders?\nanswer: Across frogs, many studies reported egg production in captivity, sometimes by captive\u2011bred females, with several cases of mixed success (some species or 17\u201350% of captive populations reproducing) and occasional failures; survival outcomes ranged from successful rearing to hatching, tadpoles, froglets, or adults, but included low froglet survival in some cases, and reproductive success depended on factors such as temperature and simulated wet/dry seasons, while development was affected by parental care, density, and temperature [835]. For salamanders, eggs were produced successfully in several studies, but success varied with tank habitat and was higher in semi\u2011natural than laboratory settings in some cases; some species produced eggs that did not hatch, one study reported 60% survival to hatching for Japanese giant salamanders, and larval development, body condition, and survival were influenced by water temperature, density, and rearing environment [838]. Hormone treatments commonly stimulated or increased sperm production and sometimes enabled successful captive breeding, but female responses were mixed (about 30\u201371% producing viable eggs depending on hormone regimes), and in some cases hormone\u2011induced breeding did not occur; eggs induced by hormones were sometimes raised to tadpoles or froglets, though two studies reported most toads died before or soon after hatching [883]. Using a surrogate species to refine husbandry promoted successful breeding of a critically endangered frog [1862]. Providing enclosure features (e.g., rotting logs, hollow bamboo, varied substrates) and simulating wet/dry seasons promoted breeding in captive frogs [1876], while altering enclosure lighting to add UV did not increase clutch size and was associated with greater fungal load [1865]. Cryopreservation showed that sperm viability after freezing varied by species, cryoprotectant, and storage/handling conditions, with some methods yielding higher viability, but overall viability could be low even though storage up to 58 weeks was possible [876].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: As an alternative to creating entirely new ponds, what actions can be taken to restore or enhance existing water bodies for amphibians?\nanswer: Evidence from action documents indicates several ways to restore or enhance existing water bodies for amphibians: Restoring existing ponds has been associated with increased species numbers, pond occupancy, breeding use, and maintained or increased populations in multiple studies, though effects varied by site and species [878]. Regulating or maintaining pond water levels has been linked to increased natterjack toad populations, maintained newt populations, successful breeding of dusky gopher frogs, and in some cases increased abundance and species numbers when ponds were seasonally drained [833]. Removing or controlling fish by periodically drying ponds has increased numbers of amphibian species and breeding success for several species in multiple studies [826]. Deepening, de-silting, or re-profiling ponds has been associated with establishment or increase of breeding populations and maintained or increased populations in several studies [817]. Reducing pond shading by removing tree canopy was part of restoration associated with establishment of breeding in translocated garlic toads, although one study found no increase in hatching success for spotted salamanders [758]. Excluding livestock or wild hogs by fencing has shown mixed effects overall but included increased pond use by breeding natterjack toads following restoration that included livestock exclusion [746]. Adding limestone to reduce acidification has produced varied outcomes, including temporary increases in breeding or higher larval/egg survival in some cases, but also high tadpole mortality or pond abandonment in others [748]. Managing surrounding vegetation and water quality through buffer approaches showed mixed results: planting riparian buffer strips along streams did not increase abundance or species numbers in one study [819]; retaining buffer strips during timber harvest had mixed to positive effects depending on species and buffer width [747]; and retaining or leaving unmown buffers around ponds increased numbers of frog species in one case, with mixed tadpole responses elsewhere [850]. Controlling invasive plants (e.g., swamp stonecrop, reed canarygrass) was associated with population increases or preferred egg-laying areas for some amphibians [823].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What is the evidence for the effectiveness of different direct treatments for amphibians infected with chytridiomycosis?\nanswer: Antifungal drugs: Across 16 studies, 12 reported cure or increased survival following antifungal treatment, while four reported no cure but reduced infection levels or mixed results; six studies noted mortality or other adverse effects from specific fungicides [882]. Itraconazole specifically was effective at curing infections in six of eight studies; one study found reduced infection levels and one found mixed effects [882]. Field or pre-release treatment: A before-and-after study treating wild midwife toads with fungicide alongside pond drying reduced infection levels but did not eradicate chytridiomycosis [767]. Probiotics/antimicrobial skin interventions: In four randomized, replicated, controlled studies, three found that adding antifungal bacteria to salamanders or frogs did not reduce infection rate or death, while one found prevention of infection and death; adding antifungal bacteria to soil reduced infection rate of red-backed salamanders in one study; antimicrobial skin peptides given before or after infection did not increase survival of common toads; three studies found adding antifungal skin bacteria reduced weight loss in infected amphibians [764]. Heat/temperature treatment: In five studies (four replicated, controlled), four found that raising enclosure or water temperature to 30\u201337\u00b0C for over 16 hours cured frogs and toads, whereas one found that 30\u201335\u00b0C for 36 hours did not cure northern leopard frogs [770].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the documented benefits and negative impacts of retaining habitat features like riparian buffers, coarse woody debris, and snags during timber harvesting?\nanswer: Riparian buffers: For amphibians, studies comparing clearcuts with and without buffers reported mixed effects on abundance depending on species and buffer width, with one study finding higher abundance with buffers; compared to unharvested forest, some studies found similar abundance and composition, others found lower numbers; wider buffers sometimes supported greater species numbers and abundance, though not consistently (747). No studies were found assessing effects of riparian buffers during harvest on mammals or on butterflies and moths (2652; 3872). Coarse woody debris (CWD): In amphibians, retaining CWD in clearcuts produced no significant abundance difference for most species but overall amphibian responses (population, physiological, behavioural) were more negative where debris was retained; removing CWD in standing forest did not reduce diversity or overall abundance but reduced species richness in one study; migrating amphibians used clearcuts with retained debris more, and juvenile survival was higher in debris piles than open areas and similar to unharvested forest (843). In mammals, retaining/adding CWD yielded mixed outcomes: one study found more small mammal species groups where debris was present, another found higher numbers for two of three shrew species with increased CWD, while other studies reported no increase in small mammal numbers or records (2647). Gathering debris into piles increased mammal species richness and, in some cases, increased vole counts and small mammal abundance (2653). In reptiles, leaving debris after logging generally produced no changes in richness or abundance, though one study found higher richness and abundance than where debris was cleared and burned (3632). For birds, removing woody debris reduced overall breeding bird abundance and diversity and lowered nest survival for black-chinned hummingbirds, though some species increased after removal (345). Snags/standing deadwood: For reptiles, increasing snags and woody debris had mixed or no effects on diversity and abundance (3631). For amphibians, leaving dead or wildlife trees during clearcutting did not increase salamander abundances compared to total clearcutting, did not prevent abundance declines or composition changes relative to unharvested plots, and reproductive metrics were similar or lower in harvested plots including those with retained dead/wildlife trees (845). Variable retention (retaining structural elements such as live trees/snags): bird responses were mixed, with nine species at higher densities and five at lower densities in variable-retention stands relative to controls (332).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: How effective are conservation actions such as legal protection, habitat creation, and translocation for great crested newt populations in the UK?\nanswer: Evidence from UK-focused action documents indicates mixed effectiveness. For translocation, four of six studies (including one review and one replicated study) in the UK found translocated great crested newts maintained or established breeding populations; however, populations were present one year after release in 37% of cases, one study reported breeding failed in 48% of ponds within three years, and a systematic review of 31 great crested newt studies found no conclusive evidence that mitigation including translocations resulted in self-sustaining populations; a UK review reported reproduction following 56% of translocations, sometimes alongside head-starting and/or habitat management [858]. For habitat creation, creating ponds led to breeding populations at 57\u201375% of created ponds or sites in studies from Germany and the UK; a UK systematic review concluded there was no conclusive evidence that mitigation, often including pond creation, produced self-sustaining populations; up to 88% of created ponds were colonized by translocated or naturally colonizing great crested newts, and head-started newts reproduced in 38% of created ponds [863]. For terrestrial habitat structures, one replicated before-and-after UK study found artificial hibernacula provided with other terrestrial habitat management maintained great crested newt populations; other replicated studies reported created hibernacula were used by common frog and smooth newts but not great crested newts, and four amphibian species were found close to hibernacula at two of three sites [759]. Regarding legal protection in the development context, three reviews (including a systematic review) in the Netherlands and UK found legal protection of amphibians was not effective at protecting populations during development, while two UK reviews reported that great crested newt mitigation licences issued over 10 years increased to over 600 in England and Wales [779].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the most beneficial actions for creating or restoring aquatic habitats for amphibians?\nanswer: Wetland restoration: In site comparisons, most studies found restored wetlands had amphibian abundance, species numbers, or communities similar to natural wetlands; some found lower numbers or different communities; a global review reported 89% of cases showed similar or higher abundance or species numbers in restored/created vs natural wetlands (879). Multiple studies found restoration increased numbers of amphibian species, with breeding populations establishing in some cases; effects varied among species and were influenced by wetland size, proximity to source ponds, and seasonality, but not wetland age; restored wetlands were colonized by 3\u20138 amphibian species, though one study found three target species did not recolonize (879). Pond restoration: Across before-and-after studies, restoration and creation often increased numbers of amphibian species, maintained or increased populations, increased pond occupancy, and increased the number of ponds with breeding success; some studies found no increase or mixed effects depending on species or site; colonization of restored/created ponds ranged from 6\u201365% of ponds, with 35% used for breeding in one set of studies (878). Wetland creation: Site comparisons commonly found similar amphibian species numbers or abundance to natural wetlands, though some studies reported fewer species or lower abundance; created wetlands were colonized or used by 4\u201315 amphibian species; numbers of species and abundance were affected by wetland design, vegetation, water levels, surrounding habitat, fish presence, and distance to source wetlands; a review and studies combining created and restored wetlands found species numbers and abundance higher or similar than natural wetlands in most cases (880). Pond creation: All studies reported amphibians used some or all created ponds; in comparisons with natural ponds, numbers of species or breeding species were often similar or higher, though species composition frequently differed and populations could be less stable; stable populations established in 50\u2013100% of created ponds in some studies; use occurred in 64\u2013100% and reproduction in 2\u201368% of created ponds depending on species; up to 15 species colonized and up to 10 reproduced; outcomes were influenced by pond age, permanence, vegetation cover, surrounding landscape, distance to existing ponds, and fish presence (869).
