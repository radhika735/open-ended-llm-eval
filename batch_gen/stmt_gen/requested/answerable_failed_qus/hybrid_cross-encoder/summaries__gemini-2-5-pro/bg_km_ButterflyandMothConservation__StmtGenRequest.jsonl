Six studies in Sweden, the UK, New Zealand, and Switzerland found that the abundance of butterflies and moths was higher on farms with a greater proportion of semi-natural habitat (3910). One study in the USA and Sweden reported that the abundance of four out of eight butterfly species was higher on farms surrounded by woodland (3910). Nine of eleven studies found that the species richness of butterflies and moths was higher on farms with more semi-natural habitat (3910). Three of four studies found that established hedgerows had a higher species richness of butterflies and moths (3976). One study in the UK found that gorse, oak, and blackthorn planted within hedgerows had more species of arthropods, including caterpillars, than hawthorn (3976). A UK study reported that providing advice to landowners led to over 3,000 ha of farmland being managed for the marsh fritillary butterfly (3846).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the alternative management strategies to prescribed burning for maintaining open grassland habitats for butterflies?\nanswer: Several alternative management strategies to prescribed burning for maintaining open grassland habitats for butterflies have been studied. One study found that the species richness of butterflies was similar on semi-natural grassland managed by light grazing or by annual mowing (3908). Another study found that grassland managed by sheep and cattle grazing had a higher species richness of butterflies than grassland mown annually (3908). Butterfly species richness was highest in grasslands where mowing was staggered throughout the year, with some areas left uncut (3908). In terms of abundance, five studies found that semi-natural grasslands had a similar abundance of butterflies when managed by extensive grazing compared to annual or occasional mowing (3908). However, some studies also found that grasslands managed by grazing had a higher abundance of butterflies than those managed by annual mowing (3908), while others found that haying resulted in a higher abundance of individual butterfly species than grazing (3908). Rotational grazing has also been explored as an alternative. Some studies found that rotational cattle and sheep-grazed grasslands had a greater species richness of butterflies and burnet moths than continuously grazed or patch-burned grassland (3965) and that rotational grazing, at high stocking densities, could also increase butterfly abundance (3965). Ceasing mowing to allow for early succession is another potential strategy. Some studies found that grasslands that had been abandoned for 3-13 years had a similar species richness of butterflies to managed grasslands, while meadows not cut all summer had a higher species richness of butterflies than those cut multiple times (3957). However, long-term abandonment of over 50 years could lead to lower species richness (3957). The impact of ceasing mowing on butterfly abundance is mixed, with some studies reporting lower abundance and others reporting higher abundance compared to mown grasslands (3957). Additionally, the management of surrounding habitats like hedgerows can benefit butterflies. Hedgerows with a more complex structure, with trees, or those cut less frequently (every 2-3 years) or laid/coppiced, were found to have a higher species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths (3975).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Four studies in the USA and the UK found that restoring connectivity between lupine, bracken, pastures, or prairie patches increased the abundance of Karner blue, high brown fritillary, small pearl-bordered fritillary, marsh fritillary, and regal fritillary butterflies (3934). Additionally, common buckeye and variegated fritillary butterflies were more likely to move between connected than unconnected habitat patches (3934). One study in Sweden reported that grassland strips with nectar or shelter were more likely to be used by butterflies than strips without resources (3934). In the Netherlands, low-quality habitat patches that were well-connected were more likely to retain Alcon large blue populations than less-connected patches (3832). Furthermore, a study in the USA found that common buckeye butterflies were more likely to colonize distant habitat patches when released on suitable habitat corridors compared to being released in unsuitable habitat (3832). However, one study in Estonia found that well-connected cleared patches within a woodland had a similar species richness of butterflies to isolated cleared patches (3832). No studies were found that evaluated the effects of protecting and connecting habitat along elevational gradients on butterflies and moths (3856).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: Which grassland management techniques in UK agricultural settings are most beneficial for increasing butterfly and moth abundance?\nanswer: In the UK, reducing management intensity on permanent grasslands can be beneficial. In some cases, less intensively managed grasslands have a higher species richness of butterflies and moths than conventionally managed grasslands (3958). One study found that after reducing grazing and stopping chemical applications, the abundance of large moths and five out of 23 butterfly species increased (3958). However, the abundance of two butterfly species decreased (3958). Changing the mowing regime can also have an impact. Mowing coastal grassland in August was found to reduce the abundance of Fisher's estuarine moth caterpillars, while mowing in November or not mowing did not (3945). Restoring arable land to permanent grassland is another beneficial technique. Studies in the UK have shown that this can lead to a higher species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths (3929). Grasslands established by sowing mixes of grasses, legumes, and other forbs had a higher abundance and richness of butterflies than those with grass-only mixes (3929). One study found that after reverting arable land to permanent grassland, the abundance of large moths and five butterfly species increased, while two butterfly species decreased (3929).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the benefits for butterflies and moths of reducing or eliminating chemical inputs on farmland?\nanswer: Reducing the use of fertilizers, pesticides, or herbicides can be beneficial for butterflies and moths. Eight studies found that areas with reduced or no chemical inputs, sometimes in combination with other agri-environment schemes, had a greater species richness of adult butterflies, moths, or caterpillars (3897). Similarly, six studies found that less intensively managed grasslands, which often involves reduced chemical use, had a higher species richness of butterflies and moths (3958). In some cases, even when overall species richness was similar, unfertilized grasslands supported a greater richness of specialist moths (3897). Low-input grasslands were also found to support more butterfly species whose caterpillars are specialized, feeding on a single host plant (3958).\n\nIn terms of population numbers, six studies observed that areas with less frequent or no chemical applications had a higher abundance of adult butterflies, moths, or caterpillars (3897). On permanent grasslands, reducing management intensity, which can include stopping chemical applications, led to an increase in the abundance of large moths in one study (3958), and higher abundance of butterflies, micro-moths, and declining macro-moths in three other studies (3958). However, some studies found no difference in species richness (3897, 3958) or abundance (3897) with reduced chemical inputs. Additionally, one study noted that while some moth species preferred less fertilized grasslands, a larger number of species preferred more heavily fertilized areas (3897).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Four studies in Finland and the USA discovered that thinning coniferous woodland, in some cases with additional management like mulching or prescribed burning, led to a higher abundance and species richness of butterflies (3940). Another study in the Czech Republic showed that forest plots that had been partially cleared had a higher species richness of butterflies, but a lower species richness of moths, than closed-canopy forests (3940). One study in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, however, found that a thinned forest had a similar abundance and diversity of fruit-feeding butterflies as a naturally regenerating, unmanaged forest, but that rarer species were caught less often in the thinned forest (3940).\n\nStudies have also examined the effects of different logging methods on butterfly and moth populations. A study in Brazil discovered that a forest that was managed with reduced-impact logging had a greater abundance of butterflies than a primary forest, as well as a similar diversity and species richness (3867). Another study in Brazil found that fruit-feeding butterflies were most abundant in forests with an intermediate intensity of reduced-impact logging (3867). In contrast, a study in the USA reported that forests where single tree selection harvesting was used had a lower species richness of moths than forests that were unharvested (3867).\n\nThe impact of encouraging natural regeneration in logged forests or former plantations has also been investigated. A study in Uganda showed that naturally regenerating forests had a similar abundance and species richness of butterflies to pristine forests, with both measures being highest 12 to 25 years after felling (3876). In Japan, a study found that moths were more abundant and had a greater species richness in naturally regenerating forests than in plantations (3876). However, a study in Ghana reported that a naturally regenerating forest had a lower species richness of butterflies than a primary forest (3876). In C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, a study found that a naturally regenerating forest had a similar abundance of fruit-feeding butterflies as a thinned forest, but that rarer species were found more often in the naturally regenerating one (3876).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

The seasonal removal of livestock can also be advantageous; one study showed that removing cattle during the summer resulted in a higher species richness of butterflies compared to grasslands that were grazed throughout the summer [3960]. When comparing grazing to mowing, the results are varied. One study found that grassland grazed by sheep and cattle had higher butterfly species richness than grassland mown annually in June [3908].

Prairies managed by haying showed a higher abundance of prairie specialist butterflies and a lower abundance of generalist and migrant butterflies when compared to prairies managed by burning (3945, 3882). Specifically, two prairie specialist species, the regal fritillary and arogos skipper, were found to be less abundant in prairies managed by burning than in those managed by haying or in grazed pastures (3882). The abundance of Karner blue butterflies on oak savannas managed by mowing was found to be similar to unmanaged savannas or those managed by burning (3945).\n\nPrescribed burning has shown mixed results. The abundance of Fender\u2019s blue butterfly caterpillars and eggs was higher in prairies one or more years after management by burning compared to grazed land (3882). Conversely, the abundance of regal fritillary adults was lower on prairies managed by burning than on unburned land (3882). One study found that pastures managed with patch-burning had a lower species richness of butterflies than rotationally grazed pastures but a higher richness than continuously grazed pastures (3882).\n\nUnder rotational burning regimes, the time since the last fire is a key factor. The abundance of prairie specialist butterflies was higher on prairies that had been burned more than one, two, or four years prior compared to those burned more recently (3883). The abundance of grassland and generalist butterflies peaked in the third year after a fire, while migrant butterflies were most abundant in the first year (3883). However, for some fritillary species, abundance was lower in prairies managed with rotational burning compared to prairies managed with only haying or grazing, or unmanaged prairies (3883). Combining rotational burning with grazing was found to create a different butterfly community composition than either management practice used alone (3883).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Planting wild bird seed or cover mixture has been shown to increase butterfly abundance (3930). In the UK, two studies found that plots sown with wild bird seed mixture had a higher abundance of butterflies than wheat crops or grassland (3930). Additionally, two UK studies on farms with wild bird seed plots, alongside other agri-environment scheme options, had a higher abundance of some butterflies and micro-moths than farms without these schemes (3930). One UK study also found that plots sown with lucerne and red clover had a higher abundance of butterflies than those with borage, chicory and sainfoin (3930). In the UK, one study found that undersowing spring barley with a mix of grasses and legumes resulted in a higher abundance of butterflies than extensively or conventionally managed grassland (3926). Leaving uncropped, cultivated margins is another option. One UK study found that fields with wider margins had a higher abundance of butterflies in one of two years, and another UK study found that farms with uncropped cultivated margins had a higher abundance of butterflies and micro-moths compared to conventionally managed farms (3923). However, a Swiss study found that farms with a larger area of in-field agri-environment scheme options, including uncropped, cultivated plots, had a similar abundance of butterflies to farms with a smaller area of these options (3923).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

In vineyards, one study in the USA and Spain found that grass strips between vine rows and vineyards with fewer chemicals had greater butterfly species richness (3919). Another study in the USA found that vineyards managed to encourage native plants with rare insecticide use had a greater abundance of butterflies than conventionally managed vineyards, though species richness was similar (3919). One study in Costa Rica found that coffee farms with a native and a non-native tree species had a higher diversity of butterflies than farms with a single non-native tree species, but similar diversity to farms with two non-native tree species.

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the effects of reducing or ceasing pesticide and fertiliser use on butterfly and moth diversity?\nanswer: Reducing management intensity on permanent grasslands, which can include reducing fertiliser and pesticide use, has shown varied effects on butterfly and moth diversity. Six out of ten studies indicated that less intensively managed grasslands had a higher species richness of butterflies and moths compared to conventionally managed grasslands [3958]. However, two of these studies only observed this difference in one of two years or regions [3958]. The remaining four studies found similar species richness between less intensively and conventionally managed grasslands, though one of these noted a higher number of specialist moth species and species of conservation concern in the less intensively managed areas [3958]. One study reported an increase in the species richness of large moths after the cessation of chemical applications and a reduction in grazing [3958]. In terms of population, three out of four studies found that low-input or unfertilized, ungrazed grasslands supported a higher abundance of butterflies, micro-moths, and declining macro-moths than intensively managed grasslands [3958]. In contrast, the abundance of caterpillars and all macro-moths was found to be similar in two of these studies [3958]. Another study found that moth abundance was similar in less intensively and more intensively managed grasslands [3958]. A study on margins near water bodies with restrictions on fertiliser and pesticide use found a similar species richness of moths to conventionally managed margins but a greater abundance of moths [3894]. Additionally, butterfly communities on low-input grasslands were found to have more specialist species [3958].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

One UK study found that mowing coastal grassland in August reduced the abundance of Fisher\u2019s estuarine moth caterpillars, but mowing in November or not mowing did not (3945). A study in the USA found that prairies managed with haying had more prairie specialist butterflies and fewer generalist and migrant butterflies than prairies managed by burning (3945). Another study in the USA found that Karner blue butterfly abundance on mown oak savannas was similar to unmanaged savannas or those managed by burning (3945). A study in Australia found that early season burning or no burning of a tropical savanna and floodplain increased caterpillar abundance, while late season burning did not (3878). A study in the USA found that the abundance of Karner blue butterflies on grasslands burned in summer or autumn was similar to unmanaged grasslands (3878). Another study in the USA found that prairies managed by burning had a lower abundance of prairie specialist butterflies, but a higher abundance of generalist and migrant butterflies than prairies managed by haying (3945).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
