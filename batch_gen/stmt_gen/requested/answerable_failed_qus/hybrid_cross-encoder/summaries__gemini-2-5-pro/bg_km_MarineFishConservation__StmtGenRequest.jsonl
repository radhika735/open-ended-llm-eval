Twelve of sixteen studies found that modifying trawl gear, such as changing trawl wires, the number of nets, codend, or footrope configuration, reduced unwanted catches of non-target or discarded fish species and sizes (2704). Five studies also found that such modifications improved the size-selectivity for unwanted fish (2704). Specifically, two out of four studies showed that using a topless trawl could reduce unwanted catches of Atlantic cod and other commercial fish species (2712). Furthermore, two studies on bottom trawls with parts raised off the seabed demonstrated a reduction in the catch of unwanted sharks, other elasmobranchs, and fish (2708). However, some studies also reported mixed effects or no reduction in unwanted catch from certain modifications (2704).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

This can also lead to higher commercial and recreational catches for targeted species in surrounding areas (2672). More broadly, prohibiting all fishing in Mediterranean marine protected areas has been shown to result in a different fish community composition, higher species richness and abundance, and larger fish (2682). It has also been linked to an increase in fish eggs for commercially targeted species (2682) and higher commercial fish catch rates near the reserve (2682). A study on prohibiting all commercial fishing in the Mediterranean found higher abundances of some targeted and non-targeted fish species after five years (2667).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the effects on marine fish populations of prohibiting different types of bottom fishing gear?\nanswer: Prohibiting all mobile and static fishing gears that target bottom-dwelling species led to a higher abundance of larger and older cod in one 15-year study (2654). Another study found that fish densities in areas closed to these gears for at least 11 years varied between species, depth, and temperature (2654), while a third study observed no change in fish densities after 2\u20137 years (2654). Cod growth was better in areas closed to these gears for 5\u201315 years in one study, while another found that fish size varied (2654).\n\nWhen mobile fishing gears dragged across the seafloor were prohibited, two out of three studies noted that the number of fish species and diversity varied between areas with different levels of bottom trawling (2673). However, another study found no effect on species richness after a decade of protection (2673). In terms of abundance, two of five studies reported higher total fish biomass or biomass of certain species like red mullet and seahorses after 1\u201315 years (2673). Other studies, however, showed no impact on the abundance of bottom-dwelling fish species (2673). One study indicated that after 14 years, the recruitment of young red mullet increased (2673), but another found no such increase for young haddock after seven years (2673). Similarly, one study noted larger red mullet after 14 years, while two others found that the effect on fish size was variable, and two more observed no effect at all (2673). One study revealed no reduction in unwanted catch after seven years (2673), whereas a study on prohibiting seine nets found higher overall fish catch rates (2673).\n\nIn an area where all but one gear type was prohibited, a higher fish density was observed compared to other areas (3810).

Survival was found to be reduced by hooking or capture depth injuries and longer tow durations (2691). For rockfish, one study showed that while nearly all yelloweye rockfish survived for four days, the survival of canary rockfish decreased with increasing capture depth (2691). In the case of spinetail devilrays, all individuals that were brailed aboard from purse seine nets survived, but those brought aboard entangled in the net did not (2691).\n\nWhen it comes to longline fishing, one global review indicated that using nylon hook attachment lines instead of wire resulted in higher survival for two out of three shark and ray species, but lower for one (2699).

However, the effect can differ based on factors like species, their position in the food chain, and habitat (2682). Other studies found varied effects or similar abundances between fished and protected areas (2682). For instance, after prohibiting all commercial fishing, two of four studies in the Mediterranean Sea, Indian Ocean, South Atlantic Ocean, and Gulf of Mexico reported higher abundances for some species (2667), and a study in the South China Sea noted an increase in overall fish density in the region surrounding new marine reserves (2667).

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What is the evidence for gear modifications improving the size-selectivity of commercial fishing gear?\nanswer: Five of six studies found that rotating the orientation of diamond mesh in a trawl net by 90 degrees led to better size selection for species like cod, red mullet, common pandora, and other round-bodied fish, but not for plaice, annular sea bream, or flatfish species (2715). In contrast, one study found that this modification did not improve size selectivity for cod, plaice, or flounder (2715). Other modifications to trawl gear have also been shown to improve size-selectivity for unwanted fish species or sizes (2704). These modifications include changes to the length of the extension piece, the codend strengthening bag, the method of weaving, the number of codend layers, and the overall design of the gear (2704). However, one study found that reducing the size of the main body of a trawl net did not improve the size-selection of cod and haddock (2705).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
