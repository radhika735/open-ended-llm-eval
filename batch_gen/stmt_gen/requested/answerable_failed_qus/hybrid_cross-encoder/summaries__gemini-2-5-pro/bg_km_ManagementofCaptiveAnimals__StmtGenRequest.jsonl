Another study in the Netherlands and Germany showed that when captive gorillas were given stinging nettles, they demonstrated the same foraging processing skills as wild gorillas (1332). Additionally, a replicated, controlled study in the USA reported that monkeys completed an enrichment task more quickly when they were in social groups compared to when they were feeding alone (1343). A before-and-after study in Italy found that monkeys were more willing to eat unfamiliar foods on their first encounter when they were in the presence of their groupmates (1343). Finally, a replicated, before-and-after study in the USA revealed that chimpanzees spent more time foraging when given planted rye grass and scattered sunflower seeds compared to when browse and grass were added to their enclosure with their regular diet (1327).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

A carcass on a bungee was found to decrease pacing in cougars, but initially increase it in tigers (1927). The provision of live invertebrate prey has been shown to increase explorative behaviours in fennec foxes (1926). For primates, presenting food in puzzle feeders has been found to increase foraging behaviour and the use of tools, alongside increasing time spent feeding while reducing time spent inactive (1318). However, puzzle feeders have also been observed to decrease food sharing and increase aggression (1318).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Two before-and-after studies in Switzerland and the USA found that an unpredictable feeding schedule increased behavioural diversity in red foxes and alertness in a black-footed cat (1904).

Providing fresh produce instead of pellet feed has been shown to increase time spent feeding and decrease inactivity in rhesus macaques (1335). Additionally, providing cut branches, such as stinging nettles, can encourage natural foraging behaviors in gorillas (1332). For captive carnivores, supplementing a meat-based diet with prebiotic plant material, such as Jerusalem artichoke, can aid digestion by increasing gut microbiota, faecal scores, and faecal moisture content in leopards (1905).

One study in Fiji found that adding rotting logs, hollow bamboo pipes, and various substrates to an enclosure promoted egg-laying in frogs (1876). Another study in Austria observed that captive frogs began breeding when their enclosures were enriched with more calling, perching, and egg-laying sites, and when they experienced simulated wet and dry seasons (1876). The reproductive success of captive frogs has been found to be dependent on temperature or the simulation of a wet and dry season (835). Egg and tadpole development in captivity has also been found to be influenced by factors such as parental care, density and temperature (835).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

For enclosure design, one study in Fiji found that adding rotting logs, hollow bamboo pipes, and a variety of substrates promoted egg-laying in frogs (1876). Another study in Austria reported that providing more calling, perching, and laying sites, along with simulating wet and dry seasons, initiated breeding in captive frogs (1876).\n\nHormone treatment is another option. One review and multiple studies found that hormone treatment in male amphibians stimulated or increased sperm production, or resulted in successful captive breeding (883). However, the amount and viability of sperm depended on the type, amount, or number of hormone doses (883). For female amphibians, hormone treatment yielded mixed results. Some studies reported that 30-71% of females produced viable eggs, with success often depending on the hormone combination and dosage, while other studies found no increase in egg production (883). Some studies also reported that eggs induced by hormone treatment were successfully raised to tadpoles or froglets, while others noted high mortality rates before or after hatching (883).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
