One UK study found that prescribed burning did not reduce purple moor grass cover but did reduce common heather cover (1723). In the USA, applying herbicide and sowing seeds of shrubland species led to more shrub seedlings in one study (1644), and another found it increased the number of native plant species but not their cover (1644). This method's effect on non-native grass cover was inconsistent across two US studies (1644). A study in the USA on applying herbicide and removing plants showed an increase in native grass and forb cover, and a reduction in non-native grass cover (1645). In the Netherlands, grazing had mixed effects on heather cover, and one study showed an increase in wavy-hair grass cover (1646), while a Spanish study noted a reduction in grass height (1646). A UK study on turf stripping found an increase in the number of heathland plants (1647).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the most effective interventions for restoring degraded shrubland habitats?\nanswer: Restoring or creating shrubland has been shown to have mixed effects on bird populations. In one UK study, one or two pairs of northern lapwing bred on an area of restored moorland where none had previously bred (364). Studies in the USA and Azores also found that populations of gamebirds and seabirds increased following shrubland restoration, amongst other interventions (364). However, a replicated UK study which did not distinguish between several interventions performed found a negative relationship between the combined intervention and the ratio of young-to-old grey partridges (364).\n\nFor butterflies and moths, a replicated, paired, site comparison study in the UK found that the moth community on restored moorland was more similar to that on established heather moorland than on degraded moorland (3946). In the Netherlands, a replicated, site comparison study found that in heathlands restored by topsoil removal butterfly species richness was lower than in the surrounding landscape but at restored sites abundance was higher in areas where heather litter had also been spread (3946). A UK study reported that a population of silver-studded blue butterflies released into a site which was managed for heathland restoration increased in abundance over 11 years and expanded its range (3946).\n\nPlanting turf from intact heathland sites has also been studied. Two randomized, controlled studies in the UK found that this practice increased the abundance or cover of heathland species, with one study also finding an increase in seedling abundance for a majority of heathland plant species and an increase in forb cover and reduced grass cover (1703). A randomized, replicated, controlled study in Iceland found that planting large turves from intact heathland sites increased the number of plant species, but smaller turves did not (1703).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the general effects of altering livestock grazing practices on shrubland vegetation?\nanswer: Altering livestock grazing practices has various effects on shrubland vegetation. Increasing the number of livestock can lead to a decline in common heather and dwarf shrub cover [1628]. However, it can also result in an increase in heather cover, as well as an increase in the number of common heather and cross-leaved heath seedlings [1628]. In some cases, increasing livestock numbers may not alter shrub cover at all, or have mixed effects [1628]. Grazing can also affect grass and vegetation height. For instance, using grazing to control grass has been found to increase the cover of wavy-hair grass and reduce grass height [1646]. Increasing the number of livestock has been shown to decrease overall vegetation height [1628]. When it comes to species diversity, areas with high livestock density may have a higher number of plant species, though in some cases, the number of species may decrease or show no change [1628].\n\nExcluding livestock from shrublands using fences has also been studied. Fencing has been found to increase shrub cover, abundance, and biomass [1545]. Specifically, heather presence and cover were higher in fenced areas in some studies [1545]. On the other hand, some studies found that fencing could lead to a decrease in the cover of woody plants, or have mixed or no effect on shrub cover [1545]. In terms of other vegetation, fencing has been observed to lead to a decline in grass cover in some instances, while in others, it did not alter or even increased grass cover [1545]. Fencing has also been found to have mixed or no effect on herb cover [1545].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the potential positive and negative outcomes of increasing livestock numbers for shrubland management?\nanswer: Increasing the number of livestock can have varied effects on shrublands. Several studies indicate that high densities of livestock can lead to a decline in common heather and dwarf shrub cover [1628]. Conversely, one study showed that grazing increased heather cover [1628], and another found it boosted the number of heather and heath seedlings [1628]. Some studies reported mixed effects or no change in shrub cover from grazing [1628]. Information from studies on fencing to exclude livestock corroborates some of these findings, with several studies showing that excluding livestock increased shrub cover, biomass, and height, suggesting that grazing has the opposite effect [1545]. The impact on plant diversity is also inconsistent. While some studies found that grazed areas had a higher number of plant species [1628], others reported a decrease or no change [1628]. One study on fencing found that excluding livestock resulted in lower species richness, suggesting grazing can enhance it [1545]. In terms of vegetation structure, increasing livestock was found to decrease vegetation height [1628]. The effect on grasses is also variable, with some studies showing increased grass cover relative to heather [1628], while another found a reduction in grass and herb cover with more livestock [1628]. Studies where livestock were excluded also showed mixed results regarding grass cover, with some showing a decline (implying grazing increases it) and others showing an increase or no change [1545].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Six studies focusing on waders and terns revealed that the use of signs and access restrictions near nest sites led to an increase in the number of breeders, higher reproductive success, or decreased levels of disturbance (309). A successful relocation of a black-crowned night heron colony to an area without public access was also reported (309). However, in contrast, two other studies found no impact on the reproductive success of eagles or penguins from access restrictions (309). For bat populations, the installation of gates at cave and mine entrances has produced mixed results. Some studies noted an increase or stabilization of bat populations following gate installation (999, 1963), while others reported a decrease in bat numbers and species diversity (1963). Negative behavioral changes, such as increased circling at entrances and reduced entry into caves and mines, were also observed (999, 1963). Furthermore, one study found that bats in a gated cave experienced greater body mass loss compared to those in an unaltered cave (999). The design of the gates, including the spacing of bars, was found to influence bat behavior (999, 1963), and in some cases, mines were abandoned by bats after gates were installed (1963).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
