[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: For agricultural landscapes, what are the most effective interventions for creating and managing aquatic habitats for amphibians?\nanswer: Creating ponds for amphibians has been shown to be an effective intervention, with amphibians using some or all created ponds in 28 studies (869). Multiple studies found that created ponds had similar or higher numbers of amphibian species compared to natural ponds, and that amphibians established stable populations in 50-100% of created ponds (869). The success of created ponds is influenced by factors such as age, permanence, vegetation, surrounding landscape, distance to other ponds, and the presence of fish (869). Creating wetlands has shown mixed results; some studies found that created wetlands had similar amphibian species numbers and abundance to natural wetlands, while others reported lower numbers (880). The design of the wetland, vegetation, water levels, surrounding habitat, presence of fish, and distance to source wetlands are factors that affect the colonization of created wetlands (880). Pond restoration has also yielded mixed but generally positive results, with several studies indicating that it increased amphibian species numbers, maintained or increased populations, and improved pond occupancy and breeding success (878). However, one study reported that pond restoration did not lead to an increase in great crested newt populations, and another noted varied effects on salamander hatching success depending on the restoration method (878). There is no evidence available to assess the effects of preventing pollution from agricultural lands or sewage treatment facilities on amphibian populations (802).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

One replicated study in the UK found that created hibernacula were used by common frogs and smooth newts, but not great crested newts, and another replicated study in the UK found four amphibian species close to hibernacula at two of three sites [759]. Two replicated, controlled studies in the USA and Indonesia reported that adding coarse woody debris to forest floors had no effect on the number of amphibian species or overall abundance, but had mixed effects on the abundance of individual species [772]. In contrast, a before-and-after study in Australia found that restoration that included reintroducing coarse woody debris to the forest floor increased frog species [772]. Furthermore, a replicated, before-and-after study in the UK found that creating refugia for great crested newts, along with other interventions, maintained four populations [772]. Two studies in New Zealand and the USA found that artificial refugia were used by translocated Hamilton's frogs and hellbenders, although few were used for breeding [772].

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What factors and interventions have influenced the success of natterjack toad conservation projects in the UK?\nanswer: Several conservation interventions have influenced the success of natterjack toad conservation projects in the UK. Studies have found that translocating natterjack toad eggs, tadpoles, juveniles, or adults has established breeding populations, with re-establishment on dune or saltmarsh habitat being more successful than on heathland [859]. Populations at translocation sites increased, particularly with replicated translocations of wild rather than captive-bred toads [859]. Pond creation, along with other interventions, has been found to significantly increase natterjack toad populations, or in some cases, maintain or increase them at 75% of sites [866]. A study in the UK found that created ponds had lower tadpole mortality from desiccation but higher mortality from predation by invertebrates compared to natural ponds [866]. The practice of adding lime to water bodies to reduce acidification has shown varied outcomes. In some UK studies, adding limestone to ponds led to the establishment of a translocated natterjack toad population, increased populations as part of species-specific habitat management, and temporarily increased breeding [748]. However, other studies in the UK reported that adding limestone to ponds resulted in high tadpole mortality, pond abandonment by natterjack toads, and a higher number of abnormal common frog eggs [748].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the general outcomes and challenges associated with captive breeding programs for different amphibian groups like frogs, toads, and salamanders?\nanswer: One review of release programmes for captive-bred or head-started amphibians revealed that 41% demonstrated evidence of breeding in the wild for multiple generations, 29% showed some evidence of breeding, and 12% showed signs of survival after release (871). For frogs, 23 out of 33 studies indicated that they produced eggs in captivity, with four of these studies reporting egg production from captive-bred females (835). Captive-bred frogs were successfully raised to hatching, tadpoles, froglets, or adults in 17 of the studies (835). In contrast, seven studies yielded mixed results, as some frog species were challenging to maintain or raise to adulthood (835). One study found that frogs did not breed successfully in captivity, and another reported the death of all breeding frogs (835). Low froglet survival and the failure to raise three species to adulthood were noted in two other studies (835). The success of frog breeding in captivity is influenced by temperature, simulated wet and dry seasons, parental care, and density (835). Survival rates for captive-bred frogs have been reported as 30-88% for eggs hatching, 75% for survival to metamorphosis, 17-51% for froglets, and 50-90% for adults (835). Additionally, a study on black-footed ferrets in the USA found that artificial insemination using preserved genetic material increased genetic diversity and reduced inbreeding in the captive population (2475). In Mexico, a study on aoudad produced five embryos for cryogenic preservation through a combination of non-traditional techniques and natural mating (2475).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

The success of amphibian colonization and breeding in these new habitats is influenced by several factors. These include the age and permanence of the pond, the amount of vegetation cover, and the characteristics of the surrounding landscape [869, 880]. The distance to existing ponds or wetlands that can act as a source for colonization is also a key factor [869, 880].

However, the number of mitigation licenses for great crested newts in England and Wales increased to over 600 over a ten-year period (779).\n\nFour UK-based studies showed that translocated great crested newts could maintain or establish breeding populations. However, one review indicated that populations were present in only 37% of cases one year after release, and another study noted that breeding failed in 48% of ponds within three years, even if the translocation initially seemed successful. Furthermore, a systematic review of 31 studies concluded there was no conclusive evidence that mitigation involving translocations led to self-sustaining populations. In 56% of translocations, great crested newts reproduced, sometimes aided by the release of head-started larvae and habitat management (858). Other studies in the UK and the USA also found that translocated eggs or adults of salamanders and smooth newts established breeding populations (860).\n\nIn Germany and the UK, three before-and-after studies showed that great crested newts (naturally colonizing, captive-bred, and translocated) established breeding populations in 57\u201375% of created ponds (863). A UK-based systematic review, however, found no conclusive evidence that mitigation with pond creation resulted in self-sustaining populations (863). Up to 88% of created ponds were colonized by translocated or naturally colonizing great crested newts, and another UK study found that head-started newts reproduced in 38% of created ponds (863). Additionally, providing artificial hibernacula along with other terrestrial habitat management was found to maintain great crested newt populations in a UK study (759). However, another UK study found that while common frogs and smooth newts used created hibernacula, great crested newts did not (759). In Germany, a study showed that captive-bred great crested newts and smooth newts released as larvae, juveniles, and adults established stable breeding populations (874).\n\nDraining ponds to remove fish was found to increase the number of amphibian species in a US study (826). In Estonia, pond restoration, including drying to eliminate fish, and pond creation led to an increase in the numbers of great crested newts compared to no management (826).
