These survival rates were similar to or greater than those of non-translocated pups, and dispersal times were also similar (2930). In contrast, for the goal of reducing human-wildlife conflict, two studies in the Tasman Sea showed that when Australian and New Zealand fur seals were moved away from salmon farms, more than half or nearly all of the translocated seals returned to the farms (2776). For the goal of moving mammals away from a contaminated site, one study in the USA found that most translocated sea otters survived the monitoring period and did not return to their capture location following a trial translocation for a hypothetical oil spill (2542).

Additionally, after release, more than a quarter of stranded Hawaiian monk seals were found to have reproduced, and a rescued common bottlenose dolphin was seen with a calf a year later (2924).

More than a quarter of rehabilitated Hawaiian monk seals also reproduced (2925).
