    "question": "What is the most cost-effective method for restoring freshwater marsh vegetation?",
    "answer": "This question cannot be answered by the provided evidence. The database evaluates the effectiveness of conservation actions based on ecological outcomes, such as changes in vegetation community and abundance, but it does not contain any information on the financial costs associated with these interventions. Therefore, a comparison of cost-effectiveness is not possible.",

    "question": "What are the effects of introducing bio-engineered microbes to improve soil quality in degraded salt marshes?",
    "answer": "This question is unanswerable as the provided database does not contain any studies or conservation actions related to the use of bio-engineered microbes for marsh restoration. The documented interventions focus on methods such as hydrological management, vegetation planting, and managing physical disturbances, not novel biotechnological approaches.",

    "question": "How does excluding capybaras from freshwater marshes in the Pantanal affect vegetation composition?",
    "answer": "This question cannot be answered using the provided text. While the database includes an action on excluding wild vertebrates from freshwater marshes (3132), none of the summarized studies investigated the specific effects of excluding capybaras, nor were any of the studies conducted in the Pantanal region of South America. The evidence is limited to the species and locations studied.",

    "question": "Which conservation strategy provides the greatest overall increase in biodiversity for brackish marshes, considering plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates?",
    "answer": "This question cannot be answered because the scope of the provided evidence is almost exclusively limited to vegetation. The database details the effects of various actions on plant community, abundance, and structure, but provides little to no information on the concurrent impacts on invertebrate or vertebrate species. A comprehensive comparison of overall biodiversity effects is therefore not possible.",
