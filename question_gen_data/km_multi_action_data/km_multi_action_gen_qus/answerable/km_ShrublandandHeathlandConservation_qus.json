    "answer": "While intended to control certain species, these actions can have negative effects on desired heathland vegetation. Using prescribed burning to control purple moor grass was found to reduce the cover of common heather (1723). Similarly, using grazing to control tree cover also reduced common heather cover (1634). Cutting bracken showed mixed results, sometimes increasing heather cover but sometimes not (1653).",
