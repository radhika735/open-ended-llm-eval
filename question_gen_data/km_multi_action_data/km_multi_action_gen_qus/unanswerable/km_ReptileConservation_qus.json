    "question": "What is the most cost-effective method for increasing reptile species richness in restored forests?",
    "answer": "The provided database does not contain information on the financial costs or cost-effectiveness of any of the conservation interventions. While several actions such as 'Create or restore forests' or 'Thin trees within forests' discuss their effects on reptile species richness, they do not include the economic data required to compare their cost-effectiveness.",

    "question": "What is the impact of global climate change on the long-term survival of temperature-sex-dependent reptile species?",
    "answer": "This question is too broad and cannot be answered by the provided information. The database details specific, localized conservation actions, such as altering incubation temperatures or providing artificial shade. It does not contain the large-scale, long-term data needed to assess the overall impact of global climate change on reptile populations.",

    "question": "What impact does microplastic pollution in wetlands have on the reproductive success of European pond turtles?",
    "answer": "The provided text does not contain any information on the effects of microplastic pollution on reptiles. While actions related to wetlands (e.g., 'Modify grazing regime: Wetland') and European pond turtles are mentioned, none of the studies investigate the impact of specific pollutants like microplastics on their reproductive success.",
