    "answer": "This question cannot be answered because the provided evidence base does not contain any information on the financial costs or cost-effectiveness of conservation actions. While action 1149 discusses applying insecticide, it only reports on seedling emergence and survival, not the associated economic costs.",

    "question": "How do different forest certification schemes (e.g., FSC vs. PEFC) compare in their effectiveness at preventing deforestation?",
    "answer": "This question is unanswerable with the given information. Action 1150 mentions a study on certification, but it only compares certified vs. uncertified forests in general. It does not provide any data that would allow for a comparison between different specific certification schemes.",
