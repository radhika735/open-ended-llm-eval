    "question": "What is the most cost-effective method for reducing bycatch in commercial trawling?",
    "answer": "This question cannot be answered from the provided evidence. While the database details numerous actions to reduce unwanted catch (bycatch) from trawling (e.g., using larger mesh sizes, escape grids, or changing net configuration), it provides no data on the economic costs of implementing these measures. Therefore, a cost-effectiveness analysis is not possible.",

    "question": "Does captive breeding and release of over-exploited species like cod help to restore wild fish stocks?",
    "answer": "This question cannot be answered. The conservation actions listed in the evidence database all relate to the management of wild fisheries, such as restricting fishing effort or improving gear selectivity. There are no actions or studies concerning the effectiveness of stock enhancement programs like captive breeding and release.",

    "answer": "This question cannot be answered. The provided evidence focuses entirely on conservation interventions related to fishing practices. It does not contain any information on the impacts of other human activities, such as the development of renewable energy infrastructure like wind farms, on marine fish behavior or populations.",
