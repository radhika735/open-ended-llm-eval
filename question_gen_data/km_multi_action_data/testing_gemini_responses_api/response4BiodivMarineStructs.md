Not as much variation as in google ai studio but better than with previous json schema.
Current schema:
class QuestionAnswer(BaseModel):
    question: str
    answer: str
    action_ids_used_for_question_generation: list[str]
Could change the wording of the last property to be even more verbose, matching the headings it itself used in google ai studio responses? See response5

    "question": "What interventions on subtidal artificial structures are most likely to benefit fish populations?",
    "answer": "Creating large swimthrough habitats (>100 mm) was found to increase overall fish species richness and abundance (3456). Managing or restricting harvesting also increased fish species richness in one study (3457). Transplanting oysters onto structures increased the combined invertebrate and fish species diversity and richness (3471). In contrast, creating small swimthroughs (3436), hole habitats (3434), or long flexible habitats (3451) had mixed or no effects on fish populations in the studies reviewed.",

    "question": "Which modifications to intertidal artificial structures are most effective for increasing invertebrate species richness?",
    "answer": "Creating 'rock pools' (3476), hole habitats (>50mm) (3467), and small protrusions (1-50mm) (3462) were all found to increase combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness. Combining features, such as grooves with pits (3475) or grooves with small ridges/ledges (3474), also increased overall richness. Transplanting oysters specifically increased mobile invertebrate species richness (3472). In contrast, creating natural rocky reef topography (3435) or small swimthroughs (3468) did not increase invertebrate richness in the studies assessed.",

    "question": "To improve biodiversity on intertidal structures, is it better to create complex surfaces with multiple small-scale features, or focus on a single type of habitat modification?",
    "answer": "The evidence suggests that combining features can be more effective. Creating grooves alone had mixed or no effect on species richness (3473), but combining grooves with pits (3475) or with small protrusions and ridges (3474) increased richness in several studies. While single features like holes (3467) or small protrusions (3462) could increase richness on their own, studies that combined multiple habitat features frequently reported altered community compositions and increased species richness.",

    "question": "How does the effectiveness of adding small-scale physical complexity, like grooves or holes, to artificial structures vary between subtidal and intertidal zones?",
    "answer": "The effectiveness shows some variation, but adding complexity can be beneficial in both zones. Creating hole habitats (>50 mm) was found to increase species richness and alter community composition in both subtidal (3434) and intertidal studies (3467). Creating groove habitats on subtidal structures (when combined with other features) increased diversity (3448), while on intertidal structures, grooves alone had mixed effects but increased richness when combined with pits (3473, 3475).",
