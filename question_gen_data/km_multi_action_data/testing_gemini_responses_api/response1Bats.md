"""**Question 1:** What are the most effective ways to operate wind turbines to reduce bat fatalities?

**Model Answer:** Evidence suggests that altering turbine operation is more effective than physical deterrents. Increasing the wind speed at which turbines become operational (‘cut-in speed’) and preventing blades from turning at low wind speeds (‘feathering’) are both rated as beneficial for reducing bat fatalities (1960, 970). Slowing blade rotation at low wind speeds and automatically reducing rotation when bat activity is high are also likely to be beneficial (2939, 971). In contrast, using ultrasonic deterrents and applying textured coatings to turbines have unknown effectiveness (968, 1957).

**Question 2:** How can human access to caves and mines be managed to protect bat populations, and what are the potential trade-offs?

**Model Answer:** Imposing restrictions on cave visits is likely to be beneficial, with studies showing bat populations increased after restrictions were put in place (1002). However, installing physical barriers like gates has mixed results. While some studies found gates can lead to population increases (1999), they are rated as a trade-off because they can also reduce bat abundance and species richness, and alter bat behaviour by causing them to circle more and enter less (1963, 1999). Installing fences has unknown effectiveness, though one study found more bats emerged from a cave with a fence than one with a gate (1991).

**Question 3:** What farming practices are beneficial for increasing bat abundance and diversity on agricultural land?  

**Model Answer:** Several practices are likely to be beneficial. Using organic farming instead of conventional methods, reducing pesticide and fertiliser use, and retaining or planting trees amongst crops (agroforestry) have all been shown to support higher bat diversity and/or abundance (961, 2013, 963). In contrast, agri-environment schemes that pay farmers for conservation measures were found to be unlikely to be beneficial, with studies reporting no improvement or even lower bat activity compared to conventional farms (962).

**Question 4:** To protect light-sensitive bats, what are the best strategies for managing artificial lighting near their roosts and commuting routes?

**Model Answer:** The most effective strategy is to avoid illumination altogether. Leaving roosts unlit is beneficial, leading to increased bat numbers and improved body condition (1017). Similarly, avoiding illumination on commuting routes is likely to be beneficial, as some
