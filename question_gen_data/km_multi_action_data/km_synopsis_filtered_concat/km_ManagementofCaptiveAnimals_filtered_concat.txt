Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

One replicated study in the UK found that there was no difference in clutch size between frogs given an ultraviolet (UV) boost compared with those who only received background levels. However, frogs given the UV boost had a significantly greater fungal load than frogs that were not UV-boosted.

Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

Two replicated studies in Australia and Fiji found that adding a variety of substrates to an enclosure, as well as rotting logs and hollow bamboo pipes in one case, promoted egg laying in frogs. The Australian study also temporarily flooded enclosures, manipulated sex ratios and played recorded mating calls.

Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

One replicated study in Australia found that frogs only bred after females carrying eggs were introduced to males, sex ratios were manipulated, recorded mating calls were played, and after being moved to an indoor enclosure which allowed temporary flooding and had various types of organic substrates.
One replicated, before-and-after study in Australia found that clutch size of frogs increased when female mate choice was provided, alongside playing recorded mating calls, sexes being separated in the non-breeding periods, and allowing females to increase in weight before breeding.

Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

One randomized, replicated, controlled study in the USA found that tadpoles had a higher body mass and reached a more advanced developmental stage when fed a control diet (rabbit chow and fish food) or freshwater algae, compared to those fed pine or oak pollen. Tadpoles fed only pine or oak pollen did not undergo metamorphosis.
One randomised, replicated study in Portugal found that tadpoles reared on a diet containing 46% protein had higher growth rates, survival and body weights at metamorphosis compared to diets containing less protein.
