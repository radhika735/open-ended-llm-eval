926: Use an alternative oil source: plant-based
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Key Messages:
 

Three replicated studies (two controlled) in Norway found growth rates were similar in salmon that were fed diets containing fish oil and vegetable oil. One replicated study in Norway found growth rates were higher in fish fed diets containing vegetable oil.  One replicated, controlled study found salmon growth rates were both lower and higher in vegetable oil diets compared to fish oil diets, dependant on family genetics.
Two replicated studies (one controlled) in Norway found similar average final body weights between groups of salmon fed both fish oil and vegetable oil diets.
Three studies (two replicated, one controlled) in Norway and Scotland found that the fatty acid profile of salmon flesh reflected oil source within diets.
A study in Norway found that oil source in diets did not affect salmon broodstock fecundity levels, egg weights, fertility rates, as well as the weights and development of resultant fry.
One replicated Norwegian study found that salmon fed vegetable oil diets had high liver lipid and low plasma lipoprotein compared to the fish oil diet. One replicated, controlled study found high levels of n-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids compared to diets containing rapeseed oil.
A replicated, controlled study in Scotland found salmon fed vegetable oil-based diets had lower concentrations of dioxin and polychlorinated biphenyls within flesh, compared with diets containing fish oil.
A replicated study in Norway found that fresh, frozen and smoked salmon flesh from fish fed vegetable oil- and fish oil-based diets had similar levels of gaping, texture and liquid holding capacity. Pigment concentration was lower in vegetable oil diets.

937: Eco friendly biofouling prevention
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Key Messages:

A replicated, controlled study in Australia found silicon coated nets accumulated less biofouling organisms which could be more easily removed than untreated nets. 
Two replicated, controlled trials found that a temperature of 50oC prevented the settlement of actinulae and hydroids on nets
