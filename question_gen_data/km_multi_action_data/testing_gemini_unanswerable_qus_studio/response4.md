Attached is a file containing conservation actions, their effectiveness and key messages relating to them. This has been gathered by hand and forms part of the Conservation Evidence living evidence database. Each action is prefixed with a numerical id.
You will be generating synthetic questions for use in an experiment. Generate four questions which CANNOT be answered by any of the actions in this database. Keep the questions short. Include a model answer to this question, explaining clearly why the question is unanswerable.

Here are some example reasons why a particular question may be unanswerable:
a) Answering the question requires drawing on actions for which there has been no supporting evidence.
b) The question asks about a factor which is not recorded in the database (e.g. cost-effectiveness)
c) None of the actions in the database are relevant enough to answer the question.
d) The question is too broad / not relevant to the database.

Potential question types:
a) Effects/outcomes of specific conservation actions
b) Actions to achieve specific conservation objectives/outcomes
c) Alternatives to achieve a particular conservation goal
d) Trade-offs between different conservation actions
e) Geographical and contextual variations in action effectiveness
f) Scaling of actions and their impacts
g) Timeframes for expected outcomes
h) Factors associated with success or failure of conservation efforts

Here are four questions that cannot be answered by the provided database, along with a model answer for each.

Question 1:
What is the relative cost-effectiveness of creating new ponds versus restoring existing ponds for establishing great crested newt populations?

Model Answer:
This question cannot be answered by the provided evidence. While the database contains information on the effectiveness of "Create ponds for great crested newts" (863) and "Restore ponds" (878), neither of these summaries, nor any others in the document, contain data on the financial costs of implementation. To assess cost-effectiveness, one would need both the effectiveness data and the associated economic costs, which are not recorded here.

Question 2:
What are the most effective interventions for mitigating the spread of Ranavirus in wild frog populations?

Model Answer:
This question cannot be answered by the provided evidence. The database includes numerous actions aimed at treating or reducing the impact of chytridiomycosis (e.g., 770, 882, 762). However, there are no actions or studies mentioned that deal with other significant amphibian diseases like Ranavirus. Therefore, none of the actions in the database are relevant enough to answer this specific question.

Question 3:
What are the most successful strategies for conserving threatened caecilian species?

Model Answer:
This question cannot be answered by the provided evidence. The database extensively covers conservation actions for frogs (e.g., 865, 870), toads (e.g., 855, 868), salamanders, and newts (e.g., 838, 860). However, there is no mention of caecilians, the third order of amphibians, in any of the provided actions. Answering this question requires drawing on actions for which there is no supporting evidence in the database.

Question 4:
Which timber harvesting method has the least impact on amphibian populations in tropical rainforests?

Model Answer:
This question cannot be answered by the provided evidence. The database details several timber harvesting methods, such as "Retain riparian buffer strips" (747), "Use shelterwood harvesting" (851), and "Thin trees within forests" (852). However, the evidence cited for these actions comes exclusively from studies conducted in North America (USA and Canada) and, in one case, Indonesia. There is no information provided on the effectiveness or impact of these methods specifically within the context of tropical rainforest ecosystems in other regions, such as South America or Africa.
