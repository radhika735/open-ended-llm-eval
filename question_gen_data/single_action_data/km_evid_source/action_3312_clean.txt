Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of mulching freshwater wetlands planted with emergent, non-woody plants. The study was in Australia.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY
 
VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Herb abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in floodplain swamps in Australia found that mulching with woodchips before planting native understory herbs either increased or had no significant effect on their overall cover, one year later.
Individual species abundance (1 study): The same study found that mulching with woodchips before planting native understory herbs reduced the cover of one problematic species (common reed Phragmites australis) one year later, but had no significant effect on another (reed canarygrass Phalaris arundinacea).
