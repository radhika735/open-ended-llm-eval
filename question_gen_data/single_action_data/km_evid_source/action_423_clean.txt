423: Reduce inter-specific competition for nest sites of woodpeckers by removing competitor species
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

All four studies we captured describe the management of red-cockaded woodpeckers Picoides borealis in open pine forests in the USA.
One small study found an increase in woodpecker population following the removal of southern flying squirrels Glaucomys volans, whilst a second found a population increase following squirrel removal, along with other interventions and a third found that reintroductions were  successful when squirrels were controlled.
A randomised, replicated and controlled before-and-after study found fewer holes were occupied by squirrels following control efforts, but that occupancy by red-cockaded woodpeckers was no higher.
