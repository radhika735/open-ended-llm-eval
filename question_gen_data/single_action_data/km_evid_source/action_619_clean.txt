619: Release captive-bred individuals into the wild to restore or augment wild populations of gamebirds
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

One of five studies from across the world found that releasing gamebirds established a population or bolstered an existing population, although the authors argued that the population of 30–40 western capercaillie Tetrao urogallus (from nearly 400 released) was unlikely to be self-sustaining.
A review of a reintroduction programme in Pakistan found some breeding success in released cheer pheasants Catreus wallichii, but that habitat change at the release site then excluded released birds.
Three studies from Europe and the USA found that released birds had low survival, low reproductive success and had no impact on the wild population.
