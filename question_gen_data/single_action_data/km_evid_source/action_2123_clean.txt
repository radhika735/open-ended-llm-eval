2123: Use an otter trawl instead of a dredge
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

One study examined the effects of using an otter trawl instead of a dredge on subtidal benthic invertebrates. The study was in the Irish Sea (Isle of Man).

 
COMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Unwanted catch overall composition (1 study): One replicated, controlled, study in the Irish Sea found that an otter trawl caught a different species composition of unwanted invertebrate and fish species (combined) compared to two scallop dredges.

POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Overall abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled, study in the Irish Sea found no difference in total invertebrate abundance and biomass living in or on the sediment of the trawl tracks following fishing with either an otter trawl or two scallop dredges.
Unwanted catch overall abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled, study in the Irish Sea found that an otter trawl caught fewer unwanted invertebrates and fish (combined) compared to two scallop dredges.

OTHER (1 STUDY)

Commercial catch abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled, study in the Irish Sea found that an otter trawl caught similar number of commercially targeted queen scallops compared to two scallop dredges.
