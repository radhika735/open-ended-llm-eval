770: Use temperature treatment to reduce chytridiomycosis infection
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Key Messages:

Four of five studies (including four replicated, controlled studies) in Australia, Switzerland and the USA found that increasing enclosure or water temperature to 30–37°C for over 16 hours cured frogs and toads of chytridiomycosis. One found that heat treatment at 30–35°C for 36 hours did not cure northern leopard frogs.
