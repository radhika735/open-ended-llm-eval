3352: Apply root dip to non-woody plants before planting: brackish/saline wetlands
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects – on emergent, non-woody plants typical of brackish/saline wetlands – of applying a non-fungal root dip before planting. The study was in the USA.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY
 
VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Individual species abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study on mudflats in the USA found that root-dipping smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora before planting had mixed effects on cordgrass density after 1–2 growing seasons, but never increased it.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Height (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study on mudflats in the USA found that root-dipping smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora before planting had mixed effects on cordgrass height after two growing seasons.

OTHER

Survival (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study on mudflats in the USA found that root-dipped smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora plants typically had a lower survival rate, after one growing season, than plants that had not been root-dipped.
