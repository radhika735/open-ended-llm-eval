1150: Adopt certification
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Forest certification is a market-based mechanism that tries to ensure sustainable wood harvesting. Well-known examples are the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) or Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC). To receive certification, forests need to be managed according to a pre-agreed set of standards to ensure their sustainability (standards may vary depending on the type of certification). Certification allows foresters to identify themselves as sustainable producers and add a price premium to their products. This could make their business more profitable possibly encouraging other foresters to adopt certification and potentially benefiting biodiversity.
 

Key Messages:

One replicated, site comparison study in Ethiopia found that the risk of deforestation was lower in certified than uncertified forests. One controlled, before-and-after trial in Gabon found that when logging intensity was taken into account although tree damage did not differ, changes in above-ground biomass were smaller in certified than in uncertified forests.

1151: Control birds
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Birds can consume seeds or physically damage trees. However, insectivorous birds may also control invertebrate herbivore populations. Some territorial species (such as bell-miners) may also displace other insectivorous birds and hence affect the impact of invertebrates on forests.
 

Key Messages:

One controlled study in Australia found that removing bell-miners from narrow-leaved peppermint forests did not improve the health of the trees in the forest.

1152: Adopt community-based management to protect forests
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Community-managed forests are forests managed by local communities. They aim to provide a livelihood for local communities while, at the same time, conserving biodiversity. However, a clearly established definition of community-managed forests is missing, and the difference with state and privately managed forests is not always clear (Casse & Millhøj 2013).
Casse T. & Milhøj A. (2013) While waiting for the answer: A critical review of meta-studies of tropical forest management. Journal of Environmental Management, 131, 334–342.
 

Key Messages:

Two studies from Ethiopia and Nepal (including one replicated, before-and-after, site comparison) found that forest cover increased more in community-managed forests than in forests not managed by local communities. One replicated, site comparison study in Colombia found that deforestation rates in community-managed forests did not differ from deforestation rates in forests that were not managed by local communities, or in uninhabited national parks.

1191: Halo ancient trees
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
As trees reach old age, they become smaller and their canopy becomes sparse because of the dieback of their outermost branches. As a result, ancient trees in dense forest stand the risk of being overtopped by younger, taller trees. Haloing involves the removal of these young, competing trees from around the ancient tree. This may release ancient trees from competition and allow them to survive for longer. However, sudden changes in environmental conditions (such as light availability) due to the removal of the surrounding canopy may also damage or kill ancient trees.

1205: Use wire fences within grazing areas to exclude livestock from specific forest sections
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Livestock grazing changes habitats, mainly by changing soil properties, plant composition, structure and diversity (Alkemade et al. 2013). High grazing pressure can degrade understory species diversity. This is mainly due to decreasing the abundance of palatable herbaceous and low woody species. Using wire fences to excluded livestock from regularly grazed forested areas may increase species diversity (Crawley 1983). Other studies aimed to reduce the detrimental effects of grazing are discussed in ‘Prevent livestock grazing from forest areas’.

1206: Prevent livestock grazing in forests
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Livestock grazing changes the habitat indirectly by changing soil properties and directly by the removal of vegetation. High grazing pressure may change plant diversity mainly by decreasing the abundance of palatable herbaceous species. It can also cause degradation of forest understory and reduce tree regeneration. Moderate grazing has less negative effects and may increasing shrubby vegetation height. Removing livestock grazing from forests may increase species diversity (Rook et al. 2004). Other studies that aim to reduce the detrimental effects of grazing are discussed in ‘Use wire fences within grazing areas to exclude livestock from specific forest sections'.

1207: Reduce the intensity of livestock grazing in forests
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Complete removal of livestock by fencing tends to promote regeneration, mainly in the early stages after removal. This is due to the removal of the disturbance effect of animals, which commonly provides ‘niches’ for seedling establishment. Reducing grazing intensity rather than complete removal may allow continued income from livestock.
 

Key Messages:

One replicated study in the UK found that reducing grazing intensity increased the number of tree saplings.
One replicated, randomized, controlled study in Greece found that reducing grazing intensity increased understory biomass.
