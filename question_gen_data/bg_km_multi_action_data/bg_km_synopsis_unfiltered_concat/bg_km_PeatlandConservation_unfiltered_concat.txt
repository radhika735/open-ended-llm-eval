1720: Retain/create habitat corridors in developed areas
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Habitat corridors are strips that link two larger habitat patches – in this case preventing peatland patches being separated by development. By connecting the habitat patches, corridors could improve survival prospects of peatland plant populations. Seeds, pollen or vegetation fragments can more easily move between the habitat patches (perhaps carried by animals), maintaining populations and diversity in each (Damschen et al. 2006).
Caution: Habitat corridors can also have negative effects, like allowing diseases, non-native species and fire to spread between patches (Resasco et al. 2014).

1729: Implement ‘mosaic management’ of agriculture
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Mosaic management involves managing neighbouring patches of land in different ways. For example, patches of agricultural land could be interspersed with natural vegetation that is never harvested. Sphagnum mosses could be farmed in patches on bogs; reeds farmed in patches of fens; trees producing latex, fruit or medicines farmed in patches of tropical peat swamps (e.g. Giesen 2015). There is some evidence that mosaic farmland management may benefit wildlife such as birds (Dicks et al. 2013).
Note that mosaic management of peatlands is only possible if the farmed areas are kept wet. Draining patches of peatland for agriculture will lower the entire local water table, affecting land beyond the focal agricultural area.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related action: implement mosaic management when harvesting wild biological resources.

1731: Cut/remove/thin forest plantations
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This section considers the threat from forest plantations on peatlands. Forests can dry out peatlands (trees take up water and reduce inputs from rainfall), create shade that prevents ground vegetation from growing, and cause peat to subside under the weight of the trees (Lindsay et al. 2014). Peatland vegetation may recover if trees are felled without any additional manipulation of the water table: it may rise on its own because water is no longer taken up by the trees, or as drainage ditches collapse and fill with debris.
This section includes cutting/thinning of afforested peatlands (where trees have been deliberately planted) and tree-colonized peatlands (where trees have colonized by themselves, for example after drainage for forestry). By comparison, peatlands with natural tree cover are described as forested or swamps. Clear-cutting refers to felling and removal of all trees from a site.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: rewetting, because peatlands are often drained for forestry; rewetting combined with tree removal; cutting large trees/shrubs on peatlands, not within forestry plantations.

Key Messages:

Four studies evaluated the effect on peatland vegetation of cutting/removing forest plantations: one in bogs and three in fens. The studies in the fens were all based, at least in part, on the same experimental set-up.
Herb cover (3 studies): Three replicated studies (two also paired and controlled) in bogs in the UK and fens in Sweden reported that tree removal increased cover of some herb species including cottongrasses and sedges. One of the studies reported no effect of tree removal on other herb species.
Moss cover (3 studies): One replicated, paired, controlled study in bogs in the UK reported that tree removal reduced cover of forest-characteristic mosses. One replicated before-and-after study in a drained rich fen in Sweden reported that Sphagnum moss cover decreased over three years following tree removal. However, one replicated, paired, controlled study in partly rewetted rich fens reported that Sphagnum cover increased over eight years following tree removal.
Overall plant richness/diversity (2 studies): Two replicated, paired, controlled studies in rich fens in Sweden reported that tree removal increased total plant species richness. However, one of these studies reported a much smaller effect of tree removal in rewetted plots than in drained plots.

This section considers the threat from forest plantations on peatlands. Forests can dry out peatlands (trees take up water and reduce inputs from rainfall), create shade that prevents ground vegetation from growing, and cause peat to subside under the weight of the trees (Lindsay et al. 2014). Peatland vegetation may recover if trees are felled, but the process may be sped up by additional interventions to raise the water table to rewet the surface peat (e.g. blocking drainage ditches).

Key Messages:

Eleven studies evaluated the effects of cutting/removing trees and rewetting peat (in combination): six in fens, two in bogs, and three in both fens and bogs. In four of the studies, the peatlands naturally contained some trees. Three studies were based on one experimental set-up, and two studies were based on another.
Plant community composition (5 studies): Of three replicated studies in fens, two in Finland found that removing trees/rewetting had no effect on the overall plant community composition whilst one in Sweden reported only a small effect. Two site comparison studies in bogs and fens in Finland found that removing trees/rewetting changed the overall plant community composition. It became less like sites that remained drained and forested.
Characteristic plants (2 studies): Two before-and-after studies (one site comparison, one controlled) in bogs and fens in Finland and Sweden reported that removing trees/rewetting increased the abundance of wetland-characteristic plants.
Moss cover (6 studies): Of five studies that examined the effect of removing trees/rewetting on Sphagnum moss, two replicated, paired studies in bogs and fens in Sweden and Finland found that the intervention increased Sphagnum cover. One replicated, before-and-after, site comparison study in forested fens in Finland found no effect. Two before-and-after studies in a bog in Finland and a fen in Sweden found mixed effects depending on site or species. Additionally, three studies (two replicated and paired) in peatlands in the UK and Finland found that removing trees/rewetting reduced cover of non-Sphagnum or forest-characteristic mosses. However, one replicated, before-and-after, site comparison study in forested fens in Finland found no effect of thinning trees/rewetting on forest mosses.
Herb cover (7 studies): Seven studies (including two replicated, paired, controlled) in bogs and fens in the UK, Finland and Sweden reported that removing trees/rewetting increased cover of at least one group of herbs, including cottongrasses and sedges. However, one of these studies reported loss of cottongrass from a fen where it was rare before intervention, along with reduced purple moor grass cover.
Vegetation structure (4 studies): One replicated site comparison study in a bog in the UK found that removing trees/rewetting increased ground vegetation height. One replicated, paired, controlled study in a fen in Sweden reported that removing trees/rewetting had no effect on canopy height after eight years. Two replicated, paired, site comparison studies in bogs and fens in Finland found that thinning trees/rewetting reduced the number of tall trees present for 1–3 years (although not to the level of natural peatlands).
Overall plant richness/diversity (4 studies): Two replicated, paired, controlled studies in rich fens in Sweden reported that removing trees/rewetting increased plant species richness. However, two replicated studies in fens in Finland found that removing trees/rewetting had no effect on total plant species richness or diversity.

Background information and definitions:
This section considers the effects of excluding livestock (with fences or other barriers) from an area of natural, ungrazed peatland whilst the surrounding peatland becomes grazed. This means the exclusion area has never (or at least not recently) been grazed. Domestic livestock directly consume peatland vegetation, destroy peatland vegetation by trampling, create bare patches of ground (e.g. repeatedly used tracks), and affect nutrient balance through excretion (Lindsay et al. 2014).
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: removing or excluding livestock from degraded peatlands; rewetting, if peatland has been drained for agriculture; low intensity grazing as a traditional or novel conservation tool; exclude wild herbivores from peatlands; use fences or barriers specifically to protect planted/sown peatland plants.

Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This section considers management of peatland vegetation by completely excluding or removing livestock from degraded peatlands.
Domestic livestock directly consume peatland vegetation, destroy peatland vegetation by trampling, create bare patches of ground (e.g. repeatedly used tracks), and affect nutrient balance through excretion (Lindsay et al. 2014). Some plant groups or species, such as heather and dwarf shrubs, may be impacted more by selective grazing (Grant et al. 1987). Removing livestock could allow these species to recover to natural levels, although there is a risk that they become over-abundant when not grazed.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: excluding livestock from pristine or undisturbed peatlands; reducing grazing intensity, rather than completely removing livestock; rewetting, if peatland has been drained for agriculture; low intensity grazing as a traditional or novel conservation tool; excluding wild herbivores from peatlands; using fences or barriers specifically to protect planted/sown peatland plants.

Key Messages:

Ten studies evaluated the effects on peatland vegetation of excluding or removing livestock from degraded peatlands. Seven studies were in bogs, two in fens and one in an unspecified peatland. Three studies were based on the same experimental set-up in the UK.
Plant community composition (2 studies): Of two replicated, paired, controlled studies in bogs in the UK, one found that excluding sheep had no effect on the development of the plant community. The other found no effect in wetter areas of the bog, but that in drier areas excluding sheep favoured dry moorland plants.
Herb cover (9 studies): Seven studies ­(including six replicated, paired, controlled) in bogs in the UK and Australia and fens in the USA found that excluding or removing livestock typically had no effect on cover of key herb groups. Five of five studies found that excluding livestock typically had no effect on cottongrass cover. Two of two studies reported no effect on sedge cover. However, one before-and-after study in a poor fen in Spain reported that rush cover increased after cattle were excluded (along with other interventions). One site comparison study in Chile found that excluding livestock (along with other interventions) increased overall herb cover, but one replicated, paired, controlled study in bogs in Australia found that excluding livestock had no effect on overall herb cover.
Moss cover (6 studies): Five replicated, paired, controlled studies in bogs in the UK and Australia found that excluding livestock typically had no effect on Sphagnum moss cover. Responses sometimes varied between species and sites. Three of the studies in the UK also found no effect on cover of other mosses. One before-and-after study in a poor fen in Spain reported that Sphagnum moss appeared after excluding cattle (and rewetting).
Tree/shrub cover (8 studies): Four replicated, paired, controlled studies in bogs in the UK and Australia found that excluding livestock had no effect on shrub cover (specifically heather or a heathland community). One replicated, paired, controlled study in a bog in the UK found that excluding sheep had no effect on heather cover in wetter areas, but increased heather cover in drier areas. Three studies (including two site comparisons) in bogs in the UK, fens in the USA and a peatland in Chile found that excluding or removing livestock increased shrub cover.
Vegetation structure (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in a bog in the UK found that excluding sheep increased total vegetation, shrub and bryophyte biomass but had no effect on biomass of grass-like herbs.

1735: Reduce intensity of livestock grazing
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This section considers the effects of reducing the intensity of grazing, but not completely removing livestock from peatlands. Grazing intensity could be reduced by letting fewer animals graze, allowing them to graze for fewer days (rotational or seasonal grazing), providing supplementary food as an alternative to living plants and/or encouraging use of alternative sites (e.g. through placement of feeding stations or shelter).
Domestic livestock directly consume peatland vegetation, destroy peatland vegetation by trampling, create bare patches of ground (e.g. repeatedly used tracks), and affect nutrient balance through excretion (Lindsay et al. 2014). Lower intensity grazing may have less of an impact and may maintain a more desirable plant community (Middleton et al. 2006). Plant groups or species that are most affected by trampling or are selectively grazed (Grant et al. 1987) could to recover to more desirable levels. Maintaining some grazing may prevent any one species from becoming over-abundant.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: completely remove livestock from degraded peatlands; low intensity grazing as a traditional or novel conservation tool.

1736: Change type of livestock
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Changing the species or breed of livestock on peatlands could reduce undesirable impacts. For example, using light sheep rather than heavy cows may reduce trampling impacts. Additionally, different species and breeds of livestock feed in different ways, leading to different impacts on vegetation (Loucougaray et al. 2004). Sheep nibble buds and shoots of selected plants, whilst cattle are less picky and pull off clumps of mixed vegetation. Sheep maintain shorter, more uniform lawns of vegetation than cattle which leave tufts of longer vegetation, whilst horses can maintain patches of short vegetation. Traditional or heritage livestock breeds may consume different species of plants in different amounts to modern breeds (Tolhurst & Oates 2001) and be better adapted to harsh conditions on some peatlands e.g. upland bogs.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: completely remove livestock from degraded peatlands; low intensity grazing as a traditional or novel conservation tool.

1737: Change season/timing of livestock grazing
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Grazing could have different effects on peatland vegetation depending on the time of year at which it is done. For example, it might be beneficial to avoid grazing when certain plants are young/flowering so that they can grow/reproduce and contribute to the peatland vegetation. Additionally, the effects of trampling may vary by season, being lowest in summer when the peatland is relatively dry or winter if it is frozen. Clearly, seasonal variation in the value of the peatland plants as food for livestock could also contribute to the decision of when to allow grazing.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: completely remove livestock from degraded peatlands; low intensity grazing as a traditional or novel conservation tool.

1738: Replace blocks of vegetation after mining or peat extraction
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves replacing blocks of peatland vegetation on a bare peat surface, such as that left behind after mining subsurface peat. In this way, the surface vegetation may recover much more quickly than if reassembled through colonization or planting individual plants. Blocks of introduced vegetation with an intact surface layer may help to regulate moisture.
The vegetation blocks should be cut from the upper 30 cm of natural peatlands. They may be cut from the mined peatland before mining begins, then kept aside during mining. This retention and replacement approach has its origins in the German Bunkerde concept (Money & Wheeler 1999) but is also known as ‘peat-block reclamation’ (Cagampan & Waddington 2008). Alternatively, vegetation blocks may be cut from another peatland area and transplanted to the damaged area, as in ‘bofedal transplants’ used in South America. Clearly, this damages the donor bog (although blocks could be sourced from peatlands destined to be destroyed by development). 
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related action: rewetting, because peatlands are often drained to allow peat extraction.

Plant community composition (2 studies): Two studies, in a bog in the UK and a fen in Canada, reported that transplanted vegetation blocks retained their peatland vegetation community. In the UK, the community of the transplanted blocks did not change over time. In Canada, the community of replaced vegetation blocks remained similar to an undisturbed fen.
Vegetation cover (2 studies): One before-and-after study in the UK reported that bare peat next to translocated bog vegetation developed vegetation cover (mainly grass/rush). Sphagnum moss cover declined in the translocated blocks. One site comparison study in Canada reported that replaced fen vegetation blocks retained similar Sphagnum and shrub cover to an undisturbed fen.

1741: Maintain/restore water flow across service corridors
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Peatlands may depend upon natural inflows or outflows of water, both above and below the surface, to maintain appropriate moisture and chemical conditions. Transportation or service corridors can block these water flows. This impact can be avoided by careful design e.g. building using permeable materials, or building raised service corridors (but note that floating roads built without digging into peat still block surface flow, and often sink over time so will block subsurface flow). Alternatively, water flows can be restored by building culverts, pipes or water diversions.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: rewetting more generally; restoring water level fluctuations.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on peatland vegetation of restoring water flow across service corridors. The study was in a fen.
Characteristic plants (1 study): One before-and-after study in a fen in the USA found that following restoration of water inflow across a road (along with general rewetting), cover of wet peatland sedges increased whilst cover of grasses preferring drier conditions decreased.

1743: Reduce frequency of harvest (of wild biological resources)
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Harvesting peatland vegetation less often (e.g. every two years instead of every year) will allow longer for the vegetation to recover from the disturbance, potentially growing taller and more densely. It might allow plants to mature and reproduce. Caution: In some fens and fen meadows, regular harvesting is important to maintain the diversity of desirable peatland species (Middleton et al. 2006).
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: reduce intensity of harvest; restrict vehicle use on peatlands; allow sustainable use of peatlands.

1744: Reduce intensity of harvest (of wild biological resources)
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Mechanical harvests can be intense, completely clearing vegetation from a peatland. Harvesting less intensely can increase the capacity of the peatland vegetation to recover. Harvesting by hand is often less intense, or allows better control of intensity (Zegers et al. 2006). Harvesting a smaller area or removing fewer plants leaves a larger population of plants to grow or spread into harvested gaps. Removing less of each plant (e.g. removing Sphagnum to a shallower depth) might avoid killing them and allow them to regrow (Díaz & Silva 2012). Low intensity harvests can often continue year after year.
Caution: In some fens and fen meadows, harvesting is important to maintain the diversity of desirable peatland species (Middleton et al. 2006).

1745: Use low impact harvesting techniques (for wild biological resources)
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
The impact of biological resource harvests could be reduced by better planning and/or using alternative techniques. For example, vehicles used for harvesting can compress, sink into and create ruts in wet peat soils. These impacts can be reduced by planning routes so the same ground is not repeatedly crossed, whilst ensuring vehicles are not overloaded and heavy (Schröder et al. 2015). Bails of vegetation could be rolled behind vehicles rather than carried on vehicles, spreading their weight over a larger area (Dubowski et al. 2013). In tropical forests, techniques to reduce logging impacts include directing the fall of felled trees, cutting lianas before felling (so they don’t drag down other trees linked to the felled tree) and planning to keep disturbance from roads as small as possible (FAO 2004).
To be included as evidence, studies must have compared low impact harvesting techniques with alternative, traditional techniques.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Mosaic management involves managing neighbouring patches of land in different ways. For example, while some patches might be fully harvested, others might not be harvested in a given year. Patches may be harvested at different times within a given year. In this way, there are always parts of the peatland with older vegetation that could assist re-vegetation of harvested patches. This system could be implemented by individual landowners and/or at a larger scale across land owned by multiple people (Dicks et al. 2013).

Background information and definitions:
Providing new, efficient technologies to people who live on or near peatlands, especially in developing countries, could reduce pressure on wild biological resources. More efficient equipment would use less of the natural resource, reducing the amount that needs to be harvested. For example, fuel-efficient stoves have been provided to reduce logging by inhabitants of Indonesian peat swamp forests (Rimba Raya 2017) and peat extraction from Andean bogs (BirdLife International 2013). The effects of these projects on peatlands were not quantitatively monitored. New technologies might also have health benefits e.g. less, or less harmful, smoke produced.

1756: Rewet peatland (raise water table)
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Peatlands may be drained for activities such as crop cultivation, livestock grazing, natural resource harvesting, road building or urban development. Peatland drainage may also be unintentional e.g. extracting drinking water from below ground lowers the water table over a large area. Drained peat can be too dry and chemically unsuitable for peatland plants (Lamers et al. 2002). Raising the water table will rewet the surface peat, creating more suitable conditions for recolonization by peatland plants and less suitable conditions for other species (Money & Wheeler 1999; Ritzema et al. 2014). It may be necessary to rewet the area around a peatland too (creating a ‘hydrological buffer zone’) to prevent water simply draining away from the peatland.
A range of techniques may be used to raise the water table in peatlands e.g. blocking drainage ditches or gullies (using peat, rocks, plastic dams or wooden dams), planting flood-resistant vegetation in ditches to slow water flow, blocking underground channels or peat pipes, building raised embankments or berms (elongated mounds of peat or rows of straw bales) to retain water, inserting dams (e.g. straw bales) below the peat surface to slow subsurface drainage, switching off drainage pumps, or restoring inflows. These interventions are all considered in this section.
Caution: Deep flooding is generally not desirable when restoring peatland vegetation. The water table should be raised to anywhere from just below the peat surface to a few centimetres above, depending on the site. Also, rewetting may increase emissions of greenhouse gasses such as methane (Abdalla et al. 2016).
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: interventions to address residential and commercial development, agriculture and peat mining, which are often accompanied by drainage; irrigate peatland surface; restoration using multiple interventions, often including rewetting; fill/block drainage ditches and the effect of vegetation growing within them; reprofile peatland, or remove peat, bringing the peatland surface closer to the water table; rewetting, irrigation and reprofiling to complement planting.

Key Messages:

Thirty-six studies evaluated the effects of rewetting (without planting) on peatland vegetation. Fifteen studies were in bogs (two being restored as fens). Fifteen studies were in fens or fen meadows (two were naturally forested). Six studies were in general or unspecified peatlands. Some studies were based on the same experimental set-up or sites as each other: two studies in Germany, three studies in Sweden, two studies in west Finland and two studies in south Finland.
Plant community composition (13 studies): Six before-and-after studies (four also replicated) in peatlands in Finland, Hungary, Sweden, Poland and Germany reported changes in the overall plant community composition following rewetting. Typically, drier grassland communities were replaced by more wetland- or peatland-characteristic communities. One replicated, paired, controlled study in a bog in the Czech Republic found that rewetted plots developed a different plant community to drained plots. Three site comparison studies in Finland and Canada reported that rewetted peatlands contained a different plant community to natural peatlands. Three replicated studies in peatlands in the UK and fens in Germany reported that rewetting typically had no effect, or insignificant effects, on the plant community.
Characteristic plants (11 studies): Five studies (including one replicated site comparison) in peatlands in Canada, the UK, China and Poland reported that rewetting (sometimes along with other interventions) increased the abundance of wetland- or peatland-characteristic plants. Two replicated site comparison studies in fens or fen meadows in central Europe found that rewetting reduced the number of fen-characteristic plant species. Two studies (one replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after) in fens in Sweden reported that rewetting had no effect on cover of fen-characteristic plants. Two before-and-after studies in fens in the USA and New Zealand reported that upland plant cover decreased following rewetting. 
Moss cover (19 studies): Twelve studies (five replicated, two also paired and controlled) in the UK, Ireland, Germany, Sweden, Latvia, Canada and Spain reported that rewetting bogs, fens or other peatlands (sometimes along with other interventions) increased Sphagnum moss cover or abundance. Three of these studies reported mixed responses by species. Two additional replicated studies, in bogs in Latvia and forested fens in Finland, reported that rewetting had no effect on Sphagnum cover. Five studies (one paired, controlled, before-and-after) in Finland, Sweden and Canada reported that rewetting bogs or fens had no effect on cover of non-Sphagnum mosses (or mosses/lichens). However, two controlled studies in bogs in Ireland and the UK reported that rewetting reduced cover of non-Sphagnum mosses or bryophytes. One site comparison study in Finland reported that a rewetted peatland had similar moss cover (Sphagnum and total) to a natural peatland, but another site comparison study in Canada reported that a rewetted bog had lower moss cover (Sphagnum and other) than nearby target peatlands.
Herb cover (25 studies): Twenty-one studies (including four replicated, paired, controlled) reported that rewetting (sometimes along with other interventions) increased cover of at least one group of herbs. These studies were in bogs, fens or other peatlands in the UK, Finland, Ireland, the Czech Republic, the USA, the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, China, Latvia, Poland, Canada and Spain. Specifically, rewetting increased other/total sedge cover in 13 of 15 studies, increased cottongrass cover in eight of nine studies, and increased reed/rush cover in five of seven studies. Three of four before-and-after studies in peatlands in the UK and Sweden reported that rewetting reduced purple moor grass cover; the other study reported no effect. One replicated site comparison study in forested fens in Finland reported that rewetting had no effect on total herb cover. Two site comparison studies in Europe reported greater herb cover in rewetted than natural peatlands (overall and sedges/rushes, but not forbs).
Tree/shrub cover (13 studies): Ten studies (including two paired and controlled) in peatlands in Finland, the UK, Germany, Latvia and Canada reported that rewetting typically reduced (seven studies) or had no effect (six studies) on tree and/or shrub cover. Two before-and-after studies in fens in Sweden and Germany reported that rewetting increased tree/shrub cover. One before-and-after study in a bog in the UK reported mixed effects of rewetting on different tree/shrub species.
Overall vegetation cover (4 studies): Of four before-and-after studies (three also controlled) that examined the effect of rewetting on overall vegetation cover, two in bogs in Ireland and Sweden reported that rewetting increased it. One study in a fen in New Zealand reported that rewetting reduced vegetation cover. One study in a peatland in Finland reported no effect.
Overall plant richness/diversity (14 studies): Six studies (including one replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after) in Sweden, Germany and the UK reported that rewetting increased total plant species richness or diversity in bogs, fens or other peatlands. However, five studies found no effect: in bogs in the Czech Republic and Latvia, fens in Sweden and Germany, and forested fens in Finland. One study in fen meadows in the Netherlands found scale-dependent effects. One paired, controlled, before-and-after study in a peatland in Finland reported that rewetting reduced plant diversity. Of four studies that compared rewetted and natural peatlands, two in Finland and Germany reported lower species richness in rewetted peatlands, one in Sweden found higher species richness in rewetted fens, and one in Europe found similar richness in rewetted and natural fens.
Growth (1 study): One replicated site comparison study in forested fens in Finland found that rewetting increased Sphagnum moss growth to natural levels.

Management to maintain stable water levels, for example in fens used for agriculture, can lead to nutrient enrichment and reduced plant diversity. Nutrient enrichment can occur because of chemical reactions in dry peat (especially the release of phosphorous), or because input water used to control the water level contains nutrients (Lamers et al. 2002). Reinstating water level fluctuations could allow natural communities to recover.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related action: rewetting, which may restore a naturally fluctuating water table without examining the effect of these fluctuations per se.

1759: Cut/mow herbaceous plants to maintain or restore disturbance
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Regular disturbance may maintain vegetation in a desirable, semi-natural state – particularly in fen meadows and some fens (Middleton 2012). Disturbance can clear dominant plants, maintain light availability and control nutrient levels. This can favour a plant community rich in plant species and/or peatland characteristic species. Thus, conservationists may sometimes want to restore or mimic a disturbance that has been lost. Increasing mowing or cutting frequency (e.g. mowing an abandoned peatland, or mowing twice per year instead of once) might be one way to do this. This section includes all forms of cutting/mowing herbaceous plants e.g. machine mowing, hand clipping, strimming and scything.
Cutting itself may be the desirable, traditional disturbance. Some fens and fen meadows have been mown for hundreds of years, to produce animal feed or bedding (Güsewell 2003). However, many historically cut peatlands have been abandoned over the past 60 years, especially those in remote areas (Middleton et al. 2006).
Caution: Disturbance is not desirable on all peatlands. Fen meadows and some fens may benefit from disturbance. Many other fens, bogs and peat swamps will not. Where cutting is desirable, heavy machinery could damage the peatland surface and vegetation: cutting by hand or with specialized vehicles might cause less damage.
Related actions: modify harvest logistics or use specialized vehicles to reduce the impact of mowing; cut large trees/shrubs, to maintain or restore disturbance; change season of cutting/mowing.

Key Messages:

Fourteen studies evaluated the effects on peatland vegetation of cutting/mowing to maintain or restore disturbance. All 14 studies were in fens or fen meadows. Most studies examined the effect of annual mowing regimes, but three examined the effect of single cuts. N.B. Cutting/mowing in peatlands with no history of disturbance is considered as a separate action.
Plant community composition (7 studies): Six replicated studies in fens and fen meadows in the UK, Belgium, Germany and the Czech Republic reported that mowing altered the overall plant community composition (compared to no mowing, before mowing or grazing). One site comparison study in Poland reported that mowing a degraded fen (along with other interventions) made the plant community more similar to a target fen meadow.
Characteristic plants (5 studies): Four studies (including one replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after) in fens and fen meadows in Switzerland, Germany, the Czech Republic and Poland found that cutting/mowing increased cover of fen- or wet meadow-characteristic plants. One replicated before-and-after study in fens in the UK found that a single mow typically had no effect on cover of fen-characteristic plants. In Poland and the UK, the effect of mowing was not separated from the effects of other interventions.
Moss cover (6 studies): Of six studies (five replicated, paired, controlled) in fens or fen meadows, four in Belgium, Switzerland and the Czech Republic found that mowing increased total moss or bryophyte cover. Two studies in Poland and the UK found that a single mow typically had no effect on bryophyte cover (total or hollow-adapted mosses).
Herb cover (8 studies): Six replicated studies (three also randomized and controlled) in fens and fen meadows in Belgium, Germany, Poland and the UK found that mowing reduced cover or abundance of at least one group of herbs (including bindweed, reeds, sedges, purple moor grass and grass-like plants overall). One before-and-after study in a fen in Poland found that mowing (along with other interventions) increased sedge cover. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in fen meadows in Switzerland found that mowing had no effect on overall herb cover.
Tree/shrub cover (3 studies): Of three replicated studies in fens, two in the UK found that a single mow (sometimes along with other interventions) reduced shrub cover. However, one study in Poland found that a single mow had no effect on shrub cover.
Vegetation structure (7 studies): In the following studies, vegetation structure was measured 6–12 months after the most recent cut/mow. Three replicated studies in fens in Poland and the UK reported that a single mow (sometimes along with other interventions) had no, or no consistent, effect on vegetation height. One replicated, paired, site comparison study in fen meadows in Switzerland found that mowing reduced vegetation height. Three studies (including two replicated, paired, site comparisons) in fen meadows in Switzerland, Poland and Italy found mixed effects of mowing on vegetation biomass (total, sedge/rush, moss or common reed). One replicated, paired, site comparison study in Germany reported that mown fen meadows had similar vegetation structure to grazed meadows.
Overall plant richness/diversity (11 studies): Eight studies in fens and fen meadows in the UK, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, the Czech Republic and Poland found that mowing/cutting increased plant species richness (compared to no mowing, before mowing or grazing). Three studies (including two replicated, randomized, paired, controlled) in fens in Poland and the UK found that a single mow (sometimes along with other interventions) typically had no effect on plant species richness and/or diversity.

1760: Remove plant litter to maintain or restore disturbance
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Traditional management such as mowing, grazing and burning can prevent build up of plant litter (dead material). Some fens and fen meadows have been mown for hundreds of years to produce animal feed or bedding (Güsewell 2003). However, many historically cut peatlands have been abandoned over the past 60 years, especially those in remote areas (Middleton et al. 2006). Accumulation of litter may affect the growth of some or all plants by influencing temperature, light and nutrient availability (Weltzin et al. 2005). Litter also creates a physical barrier above growing seedlings and below any seeds that fall on top of it (Facelli & Pickett 1991).
Removing vegetation litter by hand may mimic some of the disturbance caused by traditional management. To be included as evidence in this section, studies must have examined the effect of litter removal alone (not, for example, the effect of removing litter from mown plots).
Caution: Disturbance is not desirable on all peatlands. Fen meadows and some fens may benefit from disturbance. Many other fens, bogs and peat swamps will not. In fact, accumulation of dead plant matter is fundamental to the process of peat formation.
Related action: prescribed burning, which will clear plant litter as part of its wider effects on peatland vegetation.

Two studies evaluated the effects on peatland vegetation of removing plant litter to maintain or restore disturbance. One study was in fen meadow and one was in a fen.
Plant community composition (2 studies): Two replicated, controlled studies (one randomized, one paired, before-and-after) in a fen meadow in Germany and a fen in Czech Republic found that removing plant litter did not affect plant community composition.
Vegetation cover (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in a fen in the Czech Republic found that removing plant litter did not affect bryophyte or tall moor grass cover.
Overall plant richness/diversity (2 studies): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in a fen meadow in Germany reported that removing plant litter increased plant species richness and diversity. However, one replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in a fen in the Czech Republic found that removing litter did not affect vascular plant diversity.

1761: Cut large trees/shrubs to maintain or restore disturbance
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Regular disturbance may maintain vegetation in a desirable, semi-natural state – particularly in fen meadows and some fens (Middleton 2012). In particular, disturbance can clear shrubs and trees that would otherwise become dominant. To control woody vegetation, conservationists may sometimes want to restore or compensate for a disturbance that has been lost. Initially, large trees and shrubs may need to be managed by cutting them close to the ground. Afterwards, a traditional mowing or grazing regime may be resumed to keep regrowth of trees or shrubs in check, and manage the vegetation as a whole.
Caution: Tree/shrub removal may be desirable on a subset of peatlands e.g. open bogs, fens and fen meadows. Tree thinning may be desirable on some naturally forested peatlands - but tree removal is more typically a threat here.
Related actions: cutting/mowing herbaceous plants and small woody plants, to maintain or restore disturbance or control problematic plants whose growth is not attributed to loss of traditional management.

Plant community composition (1 study): One before-and-after, site comparison study in a fen in Poland found that in an area where shrubs were removed (along with other interventions), the plant community composition became more like a target fen meadow.
Characteristic plants (1 study): One before-and-after, site comparison study in a fen in Poland found that in an area where shrubs were removed (along with other interventions), the abundance of fen meadow plant species increased.
Vegetation cover (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in forested fen in the USA found that cutting and removing trees increased herb cover, but had no effect on shrub cover.

1762: Use grazing to maintain or restore disturbance
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Regular disturbance may maintain vegetation in a desirable, semi-natural state – particularly in fen meadows and some fens (Middleton 2012). Disturbance can clear dominant plants such as trees and shrubs, maintain light availability and control nutrient levels. This can favour a plant community rich in plant species and/or peatland characteristic species. Therefore, conservationists may sometimes want to actively maintain or restore disturbance. Grazing by large vertebrates (e.g. sheep or cows) could be one way to do this.
Grazing itself may be the disturbance that has been reduced. Some peatlands have been historically grazed, usually at low intensities. Over the last 60 years many have been abandoned, especially those in remote areas (Middleton et al. 2006).
Caution: Disturbance is not desirable on all peatlands. Fen meadows and some fens may benefit from disturbance, but many other fens, bogs and peat swamps will not. Careful management of grazing (e.g. species used, density, timing) may be necessary.
Related actions: use grazing to control problematic plants whose growth is not attributed to loss of traditional management; reduce intensity of grazing; change type of livestock; change season/timing of grazing.

One replicated before-and-after study in a fen in the UK reported that cover of fen-characteristic mosses did not change after grazers were introduced. One replicated, paired, site comparison study, also in Germany, found that grazed fen meadows contained fewer fen-characteristic plant species than mown meadows.
Herb cover (2 studies): Two before-and-after studies in fens in the UK reported that grazing increased cover of some herb groups (cottongrasses, sedges or all grass-like plants). One of the studies found that grazing reduced purple moor grass cover, but the other found that grazing typically had no effect.
Moss cover (2 studies): One replicated before-and-after study in a fen in the UK reported that cover of fen-characteristic mosses did not change after grazers were introduced. One controlled, before-and-after study in a fen in the UK found that grazing reduced Sphagnum moss cover.

1763: Use prescribed fire to maintain or restore disturbance
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Regular disturbance may maintain vegetation in a desirable, semi-natural state – particularly in fen meadows and some fens (Middleton 2012). Disturbance can clear dominant plants, maintain light availability and control nutrient levels. This can favour a plant community rich in plant species and/or peatland characteristic species. Therefore, conservationists may sometimes want to actively maintain or restore disturbance. Prescribed burns might be one way to do this.
Burning itself may be the disturbance that has been reduced, as a result of land abandonment or because landscape changes (such as roads or ditches) create fire breaks. Historically, some North American fens burned annually due to lightning fires or intentional burning by humans (Middleton et al. 2006). Burning on some bogs helps to clear dominant vegetation (Norton & De Lange 2003).
Caution: Disturbance is not desirable on all peatlands. Fen meadows and some fens may benefit from disturbance. Many other fens, bogs and peat swamps will not. Natural fires in bogs and tropical peat swamps are rare, occurring every few centuries (Lindsay et al. 2011; Page & Hooijer 2016). Further risks specific to prescribed fires include the difficulty of controlling their intensity, duration and area. Uncontrolled burns can damage seed banks, Sphagnum mosses and the peat itself. Prescribed burns may be best carried out in the winter, when the peat is cold and wet (sometimes frozen), to avoid setting the peat on fire and reduce the risk of fire spreading beyond the prescribed area. Also note that burning might produce apparently desirable changes in vegetation over the short term (e.g. less heather cover and increased herb cover), followed by a rapid return to a degraded state.
Related action: use prescribed fire to control problematic plants whose growth is not attributed to loss of traditional management.

1764: Thin vegetation to prevent wild fires
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Naturally, most peatlands do not burn often. Bogs and tropical peat swamps may only burn every few centuries (Lindsay et al. 2011; Page & Hooijer 2016). Some fens may burn more often, perhaps annually in parts of North America (Middleton et al. 2006).
Frequent, intense, uncontrolled wild fires may be damaging to peatland vegetation that is not adapted to cope with them. Such fires are becoming more common as a result of peatland drainage (so the peat becomes drier), logging (which opens up the canopy and makes the forest warmer and drier) and climate change (warmer, drier, more storms with lightning) (Turetsky et al. 2014; Page & Hooijer 2016). Removing some vegetation to reduce the amount of fuel for wild fires could reduce their frequency and intensity, limiting the damage to vegetation.
Caution: In peatland fires, the peat itself can burn. Fire can spread underground, within the peat. Reducing vegetation fuel loads may not control these risks.  
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: rewet peat to prevent wild fires; build fire breaks; methods of controlling vegetation biomass: cutting, physical removal, herbicide and prescribed burning; increase ‘on the ground’ protection, including fire fighting teams.

Frequent, intense, uncontrolled wild fires may be damaging to peatland vegetation that is not adapted to cope with them. Along with logging and climate change, peatland drainage is a key factor increasing the amount of damaging fire in peatlands (Turetsky et al. 2014; Page & Hooijer 2016). Drained peatlands may be more likely to burn and can burn more intensely (deeper into the peat) when they do (Wösten et al. 2008). Raising the water table to rewet the surface peat, for example by building dams, may combat this threat.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.

This section considers complete physical removal of problematic plants i.e. pulling up or digging up entire plants, or scraping living vegetation from the peatland surface. By completely removing plants, including roots where applicable, immediate regrowth will be prevented (although long-term recolonization is possible).
Physical removal can precisely target individuals of problematic species. Alternatively, it can involve broad clearance of dominant vegetation that outcompetes desirable plants or changes the physical environment to an undesirable state (e.g. acidification and nutrient enrichment by moss carpets on fens; Bootsma et al. 2002).

Results varied between species or between sites, and sometimes depended on other treatments applied to plots (i.e. drainage or isolation from the surrounding bog).
Moss cover (3 studies): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in a fen in Ireland reported that removing the moss carpet reduced total bryophyte and Sphagnum moss cover for three years. Two replicated, controlled, before-and-after studies in fens in the Netherlands reported that removing the moss carpet had no effect on moss cover (after 2–5 years) in wet plots, but reduced total moss and Sphagnum cover in drained plots.

1770: Use cutting/mowing to control problematic herbaceous plants
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Cutting or mowing is the removal of above-ground parts of herbaceous plants or young trees/shrubs. Roots are left in place. Mowing and cutting can be broad tools affecting all plants in a community, so are often used to manage succession (development of plant communities over time). Cuttings may be removed from the site or left in place to rot down. Note that this choice will affect nutrients, temperature and light within the peatland, in turn determining which plant species can grow (Weltzin et al. 2005).
Caution: Mowing with heavy machinery could damage the peatland surface and vegetation. Cutting by hand or with specialized vehicles might cause less damage.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: cutting/mowing to control herbaceous plants as part of a traditional disturbance regime; remove plant litter as part of/to compensate for loss of a traditional disturbance regime; change season of cutting/mowing; use low impact vehicles or harvesting techniques.

Key Messages:

Four studies evaluated the effects on peatland vegetation of cutting/mowing problematic herbaceous plants. Three studies were in fens or fen meadows and one was in a bog. N.B. Cutting/mowing in historically disturbed peatlands is considered as a separate action.
Plant community composition (3 studies): Two replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after studies in rich fens in Sweden found that mowing typically had no significant effect on the overall plant community composition. One controlled study in a fen meadow in the UK reported that mown plots developed different plant communities to unmown plots.
Characteristic plants (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in a fen in Sweden found that mown plots contained more fen-characteristic plant species than unmown plots, although their cover did not differ significantly between treatments.
Vegetation cover (2 studies): Of two replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after studies in rich fens in Sweden, one found that mowing had no effect on vascular plant or bryophyte cover over five years. The other reported that mowing typically increased Sphagnum moss cover and reduced purple moor grass cover, but had mixed effects on cover of other plant species.
Growth (1 study): One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in a bog in Estonia found that clipping competing vegetation did not affect Sphagnum moss growth.

1771: Change season/timing of cutting/mowing
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Studies in this section compare the effects of cutting/mowing at different times of year, given a fixed cutting frequency (i.e. number of cuts each year). Mowing could have different effects on peatland vegetation depending on the season in which it is done. For example, if an undesirable plant is only present above ground in some seasons, mowing must be done at the right time to damage this plant. The timing of cutting will also affect nutrient removal. Usually, more nutrients will be removed by cutting in summer or autumn: before the above-ground biomass of annual plants dies off and nutrients are stored in underground organs. In some peatlands, mowing has shifted from the traditional season (Rowell et al. 1985).
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: maintain or restore cutting/mowing as part of a traditional disturbance regime; use cutting/mowing to manage vegetation: overall effect.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects on peatland vegetation of mowing or cutting in different seasons. One study was in a fen meadow and one was in a peatland with mixed vegetation.
Plant community composition (2 studies): One replicated, randomized, paired, before-and after study in a fen meadow in the UK reported that changes in plant community composition were typically similar in spring-, summer- and autumn-mown plots. However, one study in a peatland in the Netherlands reported that summer- and winter-mown areas developed cover of different plant community types.
Overall plant richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, before-and after study in a fen meadow in the UK found that plant species richness increased more, over two years, in summer-mown plots than spring- or autumn-mown plots.

1772: Use cutting to control problematic large trees/shrubs
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This section considers cutting and the removal of above-ground parts of mature shrubs and trees: plants that are too large to mow. Roots are left in place. Cuttings may be removed from the site (which means the nutrients they contain are also removed), or left in place to rot down.
Caution: Tree/shrub removal may be desirable on a subset of peatlands e.g. open bogs, fens and fen meadows. Tree thinning may be desirable on some naturally forested peatlands - but tree removal is more typically a threat here.
Related actions: cutting and removing trees that have grown as part of forestry operations; cutting to control trees/shrubs as part of a traditional disturbance regime; completely removing problematic plants by digging/pulling.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects on peatland vegetation of cutting and removing problematic large trees/shrubs. Both studies were in fens. N.B. Cutting trees/shrubs in historically disturbed peatlands is considered as a separate action.
Plant community composition (2 studies): Two studies (one replicated, controlled, before-and-after) in fens in the USA and Sweden reported that the plant community composition changed following tree/shrub removal, becoming less like unmanaged fens or more like undegraded, open fen.
Characteristic plants (1 study): One study in a fen in Sweden found that species richness and cover of fen-characteristic plants increased following tree/shrub removal.
Vegetation cover (2 studies): One study in a fen in Sweden found that moss and vascular plant cover increased following tree/shrub removal. One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in fens in the USA found that shrub removal (along with other interventions) could not prevent increases in shrub cover over time.
Overall plant richness/diversity (2 studies): One study in a fen in Sweden found that moss and vascular plant species richness increased following tree/shrub removal. However, one replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in fens in the USA found that shrub removal (along with other interventions) prevented increases in total plant species richness.

1773: Use grazing to control problematic plants
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This section considers using grazing vertebrates (e.g. sheep or cows) to control problematic plants. Grazers remove shoots or flowers, limiting plant growth and/or reproduction. They might selectively graze certain plant groups or species (Grant et al. 1987), creating space for other species to grow. Caution: Trampling, erosion and nutrient enrichment from grazers can have negative impacts on peatlands, especially if the density of grazers is high.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: interventions to address domestic livestock as a threat, such as exclusion; grazing to manage plants as part of a traditional disturbance regime.

1774: Use prescribed fire to control problematic plants
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Prescribed burns can be used to manage problematic plants, especially shrubs and grasses that may overgrow and outcompete other desirable peatland vegetation like mosses (Chapman & Rose 1991). By removing above-ground vegetation, fire can also be used to manage the physical vegetation structure. The effect of fire on problematic plants is often temporary: many can regrow from roots or stumps that remain.
Frequent fires are not a natural feature of peatlands, with the exception of some fens (Middleton et al. 2006). Bogs and tropical peat swamps naturally burn every few centuries (Lindsay et al. 2011; Page & Hooijer 2016).
Caution: There are many risks to management by prescribed burning. For example, it can be difficult to control the intensity, duration and area of a prescribed burn. Uncontrolled burns can damage seed banks, Sphagnum mosses and the peat itself. Prescribed burns may be best carried out in the winter, when the peat is cold and wet (sometimes frozen), to avoid setting the peat on fire and reduce the risk of fire spreading beyond the prescribed area. Also note that burning might produce apparently desirable changes in vegetation over the short term (e.g. less heather cover and increased herb cover) followed by a rapid return to a degraded state.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: prescribed burning to manage plants as part of a traditional disturbance regime; interventions to address the threat from excess wild fire: thinning vegetation, rewetting, building fire breaks, adopting zero burning policies or awareness-raising.

Key Messages:

Six studies evaluated the effects on peatland vegetation of using prescribed fire to control problematic plants: five in bogs and one in fens. Four studies were based on the same experimental set-up in the UK. N.B. Prescribed burning in historically disturbed peatlands is considered as a separate action.
Moss cover (4 studies): One replicated, paired, controlled study in bogs in Germany found that burning increased moss/lichen/bare ground cover in the short term (2–7 months after burning). Three replicated, paired studies (based on the same experimental set-up) in one bog in the UK found that moss cover (including Sphagnum) was higher in plots burned more often.
Herb cover (4 studies): Of two replicated, paired, controlled studies in bogs in Germany and the UK, one found that burning had no effect on cottongrass cover after 2–7 months but the other found that burning increased cottongrass cover after 8–18 years. Two replicated, paired studies in the same bog in the UK reported that cottongrass cover was similar in plots burned every 10 or 20 years. The study in Germany also found that burning reduced purple moor grass cover but had mixed effects, amongst sites, on cover of other grass-like plants and forbs.
Tree/shrub cover (5 studies): Three replicated, paired studies in a bog in the UK found that heather cover was lower in plots burned more often. One replicated, paired, controlled study in bogs in Germany found that heather cover was lower in burned than unburned plots. Two replicated, controlled studies in the bogs in Germany and fens in the USA found that burning (sometimes along with other interventions) did not affect cover of other shrubs.
Vegetation structure (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in a bog in the UK found that plots burned more frequently contained more biomass of grass-like plants than plots burned less often, but contained less total vegetation, shrub and bryophyte biomass.
Overall plant richness/diversity (2 studies): Two replicated, controlled studies (one also randomized and paired) in the fens in the USA and a bog in the UK found that burning reduced or limited plant species richness. In the USA, burning was carried out along with other interventions.

1775: Use covers/barriers to control problematic plants
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Covers such as plastic sheeting or straw mulch could be used to control problematic plants. These may act as direct physical barriers (e.g. temporarily covering the peatland surface, to prevent seeds from establishing whilst they are viable) and/or indirect barriers that modify environmental conditions (e.g. opaque covers that block light, prevent photosynthesis and kill problematic plants). Caution: Covers may also kill desirable species. Temporary application, when the peatland is most vulnerable to invasion by problematic plants, could solve this problem.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on peatland vegetation, of using covers or barriers to control problematic plants.

1776: Use herbicide to control problematic plants
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Herbicides are plant-killing chemicals. They can be applied to an entire peatland area, or specifically applied to individual plants (typically shrubs and trees).
Caution: Herbicides are not recommended as general conservation tool. Many are not specific to the target plant so can cause collateral damage. Many have negative effects side effects on biodiversity, the environment and human health (Pimentel et al. 1992). Accordingly, herbicide use is being reduced or banned in many countries.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on peatland vegetation of using herbicide to control problematic plants. The study was in fens.
Plant community composition (1 study): One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in fens in the USA found that applying herbicide to shrubs (along with other interventions) changed the overall plant community composition.

1777: Introduce an organism to control problematic plants
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This section considers biological control: controlling problematic organisms by managing their enemies. Typically, this involves releasing natural enemies of target problematic organisms, such as microorganisms (e.g. a virus or a fungus), insects or parasitic plants. More enemies usually equals more damage to the target organisms. Biological control could be particularly effective for non-native problematic plants: their success in their new range may be due to escape from natural enemies in their native range (Keane & Crawley 2002).
Caution: Organisms introduced for biological control can themselves become problematic pests (e.g. the harlequin ladybird; Roy et al. 2016) or could damage non-target plants. Introductions should not be carried out without thorough assessment of likely negative impacts, non-target effects and effectiveness of control.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related action: ‘introduce’ large grazing vertebrates, such as sheep or cows, to control problematic plants.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects, on peatland vegetation, of introducing an organism (other than large vertebrate grazers) to control problematic plants. The study was in a fen meadow.
Plant community composition (1 study): One controlled, before-and-after study in a fen meadow in Belgium found that introducing a parasitic plant altered the overall plant community composition.
Vegetation cover (1 study): The same study found that introducing a parasitic plant reduced cover of the dominant sedge but increased moss cover.

1778: Clean waste water before it enters the environment
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Waste water could be cleaned before it is released into peatlands or before it enters the environment in general (ultimately reaching peatlands). Excess nutrients, salts, heavy metals, radioactive materials and organic compounds should be removed. Acidity (pH) should be adjusted. Hot water should be cooled. Waste water could be treated using traditional industrial methods, or in ‘constructed wetlands’ that contain plants and microorganisms to absorb or break down pollutants (Kadlec et al. 2000).
Caution: Peatland vegetation is very sensitive to water chemistry (Rydin & Jeglum 2013). If cleaned waste water is being discharged directly into a peatland, its chemistry should be carefully controlled to match natural input water. Note that bogs receive their water only as rain, so are likely to be harmed by any other water inputs.
Key peatland types for which this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related action: remove atmospheric pollutants from waste gases before they enter the environment.

1779: Divert/replace polluted water source(s)
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This section considers interventions that prevent polluted water from entering peatlands. These usually involve construction of new pipes, channels or waterways to divert polluted water away from a focal peatland. Clearly, this could create a pollution problem for another habitat – unless the polluted water is diverted into a waste water treatment system, such as a constructed wetland.
Caution: Peatland vegetation is very sensitive to water quantity and quality (Rydin & Jeglum 2013). If a polluted water source is removed from a fen, it may need to be replaced with an alternative clean water source to avoid the peatland drying out (e.g. Kooijman et al. 2016). The chemistry of this water should be carefully monitored or controlled to avoid changing the chemistry of the peatland. Ground water should generally not be added to bogs: they should receive water only as rain.
Key peatland types for which this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: drain/replace acidic water, which focuses on the removal/replacement of a specific type of polluted water; legally protect peatlands, including policies or laws to prevent pollution.

Both studies reported mixed effects on herb cover, depending on species.

1780: Slow down input water to allow more time for pollutants to be removed
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Polluted water entering a peatland could be slowed down, allowing more time for natural breakdown or removal of pollutants before the water reaches the peatland. This could be facilitated by making input channels longer (e.g. Kooijman et al. 2016) or building a dam in the input channels (e.g. Bootsma et al. 2002). This intervention is mainly relevant to fens and fen meadows, which are fed by inputs of ground water. Bogs and tropical peat swamps are mainly fed by inputs of rainfall.
Key peatland types for which this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: clean waste water before it enters the environment; divert/replace source(s) of polluted input water.

1781: Retain or create buffer zones between pollution sources and peatlands
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Buffer zones can separate a peatland from a pollution source, preventing pollution from reaching the peatland or slowing it down to allow more time for pollutants to break down. Buffer zones of existing vegetation could be retained around development (e.g. by not building right up to the edge of a peatland), or vegetated buffer zones could be specifically created. They may be planted with plants that can absorb or break down pollutants (Kadlec et al. 2000). Buffer zones could be harvested to provide income to support peatland conservation (Wantzen et al. 2006).
To be included as evidence in this section, studies must have reported the effect of buffer zones on focal protected peatlands. Studies that report effects on vegetation within a buffer zone (e.g. Hynninen et al. 2011) are not included: this vegetation is sacrificed (exposed to pollution) to protect the focal peatland.
Key peatland types for which this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: use artificial barriers to prevent pollution entering peatland.

Artificial barriers such as sand bags, rocks, plastic curtains, absorbent matting or ditches could be used to separate peatlands from a pollution source. Barriers could prevent pollution from reaching the peatland entirely, or slow it down so it has more time to break down before reaching the peatland. These barriers are likely to be most effective as a short-term intervention to extreme pollution events e.g. oil or chemical spills (Zoltai & Kershaw 1995).

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Fertilizers and herbicides can have negative effects on peatland vegetation if they spill over from agricultural or domestic land (Smolders et al. 2010). Herbicides can kill plants directly. Run off from fertilized land can carry excess nutrients (such as nitrogen and phosphorous) into peatlands, altering their naturally low nutrient levels. Simply applying less fertilizer or herbicide to agricultural land near peatlands could reduce the amount spilling over into peatlands. Ultimately, reduced chemical application could be driven by legislation, financial incentives and/or education.

1784: Manage fertilizer or herbicide application near peatlands
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Fertilizers and herbicides can have negative effects on peatland vegetation if they spill over from agricultural or domestic land (Smolders et al. 2010). Herbicides can kill plants directly. Run off from fertilized land can carry excess nutrients (such as nitrogen and phosphorous) into peatlands, altering their naturally low nutrient levels.
Various techniques could be used to reduce spillover of these chemicals into peatlands (without reducing the overall amount applied, although this could also be beneficial). Applying fertilizers when plants are actively growing means a greater proportion of the nutrients are taken up by the plants. Avoiding chemical application before heavy rain reduces the amount that is immediately washed away. Ploughing or harrowing parallel to slopes avoids creating channels that carry chemicals off agricultural land towards peatlands (or other habitats). Planting cover crops could protect bare ground, and the chemicals applied to it, from rainfall and reduce the amount washed away. Ultimately, better chemical management could be driven by legislation, financial incentives and/or education.
Key peatland types for which this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related action: reduce the overall amount of fertilizer or herbicide use near peatlands, without other management of its application.

1785: Convert to organic agriculture or aquaculture near peatlands
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Organic farming avoids the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, instead relying on crop rotation, locally adapted crops/livestock, biological pest control and natural on-site fertilizers such as manure (European Commission 2017). If these principles are applied on terrestrial farms or in aquaculture systems close to peatlands, spillover of pollutants into peatlands may be reduced.
This section considers the overall effect of organic vs conventional farming on peatland vegetation. Organic farming may benefit biodiversity in general (Dicks et al. 2013), as well as reducing spillover of chemicals on to peatlands.
Key peatland types for which this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: retain or create buffer zones between pollution source (e.g. agricultural land) and peatland); reduce amount of fertilizer or herbicide used near peatlands; manage fertilizer or herbicide application near peatlands, such as when or how they are applied.

1786: Limit the density of livestock on farmland near peatlands
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Waste products from livestock can run off agricultural land and flow into peatlands. This is a particular problem when land is compacted due to trampling by many animals. Excess nutrients in peatlands could reduce their ability to support their characteristic, and sometimes diverse, vegetation. Reducing the number of livestock on land near peatlands would reduce the amount of excrement and compaction, potentially reducing nutrient inputs to peatlands.
Key peatland types for which this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: interventions to reduce the impact of livestock grazing directly on peatlands i.e. use barriers to protect pristine peatlands; exclude or remove livestock from degraded peatlands; reduce intensity of grazing; change type of livestock; change season/timing of grazing.

1788: Remove oil from contaminated peatlands
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Peatlands may be affected by oil spills. North American peatlands are particularly vulnerable to oil spills from pipelines or wells: oil is extracted from large reserves in Alaska and Alberta, then transported long distances over peatlands. Spontaneous vegetation recovery following oil spills can be slow (Racine 1994). Interventions to remove oil, or increase microbial activity to break down oil more rapidly, include washing, burning, tillage, aeration and fertilization (Jorgenson & Joyce 1994; ExxonMobil 2008). Historical oil spills, such as those from wrecked military vehicles (Ardron 2013), may be harder or impossible to clean.
Caution: Interventions to clean up oil spills could kill any surviving vegetation and/or churn oil into the peat, hindering long term recovery in some situations. 
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: use artificial barriers to prevent pollution entering peatlands, or spreading from an initial source of pollution.

1789: Remove pollutants from waste gases before they enter the environment
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Atmospheric pollutants can be removed from waste gases (e.g. from industry or transport) before they enter the environment. Physical or electrostatic filters can trap dust and ash particles. Sulphur dioxide can be removed by spraying alkaline substances (such as seawater) into waste gases. Reducing emissions of atmospheric pollutants may prevent damage to peatland vegetation or allow it to recover.
Key peatland types for which this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related action: clean waste water before it is released into the environment.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects, on peatland vegetation, of removing pollutants from waste gases before release into the environment. The study was in bogs.
Plant richness/diversity (1 study): One before-and-after study in bogs in Estonia reported that following installation of dust filters in industrial plants (along with a general reduction in emissions), the number of Sphagnum moss species increased but the total number of plant species decreased.

1790: Add lime to reduce acidity and/or increase fertility
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Peatland plant survival and growth is partly determined by the acidity of a peatland, or pH (Rydin & Jeglum 2013). Fen plants grow in alkaline to weakly acidic peat (approximately pH 6–8, similar to saliva, tap water or sea water). Bog plants grow in more acidic peat (approximately pH 4–5, similar to tomato juice or coffee). Lime (calcium and/or magnesium-rich chemicals) can be added if the peat becomes too acidic for a desired plant community. Liming can reduce acidity. It can also affect nutrient availability: nutrients such as phosphorous become locked away in acidic soils (Weil & Brady 2016).
Caution: The benefits and harms of liming are very context specific. Because fen plants require the least acidic conditions, liming is mostly used to manage fens and fen meadows. Liming may be useful in some bogs that have become extremely acidic (e.g. as a result of exceptionally acidic rain). In most bogs, liming could cause damage by removing natural acidity.
Related actions: rewetting, which may reverse drainage-related acidification of surface peat; restoring peatlands using multiple interventions, because lime is often used as part of a suite of interventions; add lime to complement planting.

1791: Drain/replace acidic water
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Peatlands can hold onto acidic water, especially in thick carpets of moss. This is a natural process in the development of peatlands from fens to bogs (Rydin & Jeglum 2013). However, where the desired plant community is a fen, intervention may be needed to reduce acidity. Fen plants prefer weakly acidic, neutral or even alkaline peat (approximately pH 6–8, similar to saliva, tap water or sea water). Ditches can be dug to drain excess surface water (especially during periods of heavy rain). This may be replaced by less acidic water naturally, or with further intervention.
Caution: Peatland vegetation is very sensitive to water quantity and quality (Rydin & Jeglum 2013). If acidic water is drained, it will probably have to be replaced to prevent the peatland drying out. The chemistry of this water should be carefully monitored or controlled to avoid changing the chemical conditions of the peatland. This intervention is generally not applicable to bogs, which are naturally acidic.
Related actions: remove plants, including mosses that can store acidic water; divert/replace other sources of polluted water.
Rydin H. & Jeglum J.K. (2013) The Biology of Peatlands, Second Edition. Oxford University Press, Oxford.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects on peatland vegetation of draining/replacing acidic surface water. Both studies were in fens.
Vegetation cover (2 studies): Two controlled studies in fens in the Netherlands reported that draining acidic water had mixed effects on cover of Sphagnum moss and herbs after 4–5 years, depending on the species and whether moss was also removed.
Overall plant richness/diversity (1 study): One controlled, before-and-after study in a fen in the Netherlands reported that draining and replacing acidic water increased plant species richness.

1792: Add water to peatlands to compensate for drought
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Peatland vegetation can only grow in wet areas. The plants depend on the water itself, but also the chemistry of wet peat (if peat dries out, acidity and nutrient levels can change though chemical reactions; Lamers et al. 2002). As a short-term intervention to compensate for drought, water could be diverted to peatlands (e.g. from rivers; Roelofs 1991).
Caution: Peatland vegetation is very sensitive to water quality (Rydin & Jeglum 2013). To avoid altering the chemistry of the peatland, a suitable water source must be chosen: of the correct pH (not too acidic, not to alkaline) and with no unusual nutrients/chemicals. Note that bogs receive their water only as rain, so ground water addition should be avoided if possible.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: rewetting, as a more long-term intervention; interventions to address wild fires, which could be associated with droughts i.e. thinning vegetation; rewetting; building fire breaks; adopting zero burning policies near peatlands; increasing 'on-the-ground' protection; raising awareness about wild fires.

1794: Build barriers to protect peatlands from the sea
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Some peatlands are in low-lying and/or coastal areas (e.g. bogs in eastern Canada, fens in eastern England) and are therefore vulnerable to seawater flooding, either due to temporary storm surges or longer-term sea level rise. Peatlands with a lowered surface (as a result of peat extraction, compaction or subsidence) are especially vulnerable to flooding. Barriers could be built to separate the peatland from the sea.
If saltwater influx does occur, peatlands can be permanently damaged. Some peatland plant species, notably Sphagnum moss, cannot tolerate salinity (Ward 2013). Therefore, any restoration attempts might focus on introducing salt tolerant vegetation rather than attempting to restore the former peatland characteristic vegetation (e.g. Emond et al. 2016).
Key peatland types for which this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related action: use artificial barriers to prevent pollution entering peatlands.

It may be wise to prioritize restoration or creation of peatland habitats in areas that will remain or become climatically suitable in the future (rather than areas that are destined to become unsuitable). These areas will also provide space for peatland vegetation to move into as current peatlands become too dry/wet/warm to support their characteristic plants (Oliver et al. 2012).

1796: Legally protect peatlands
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Peatland habitats might be protected by law. Specific sites may be purchased or designated as protected areas in order to limit damaging activities like trampling, vehicle use, extraction of resources and development. Protected sites may be left alone or, where necessary, actively managed/restored to increase their value. This section considers the overall effects of legally protecting specific areas. Effects of individual interventions performed within protected areas are also considered as separate actions.
Assessing the effectiveness of protected areas is particularly difficult. For example, protected and unprotected areas might start off with different quality habitats (protection being granted to the best quality peatlands). Protected areas are also more likely to be in remote areas, so less accessible to threats such as harvesting (Joppa & Pfaff 2009). Finally, effectiveness is best monitored over long timescales, but this increases the chance that other factors influence the ecosystem. The most reliable studies would compare protected and unprotected areas over time, and possibly correct for some of the biases.
Key peatland types for which this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: create legislation for ‘no net loss’ of wetlands; adopt voluntary codes to protect peatlands.

Key Messages:

Five studies evaluated the effects on peatland habitats of legally protecting them: two of tropical peat swamp forest, two of unspecified peatlands and one of a bog.
Peatland habitat (3 studies): Two studies in Indonesia reported that peat swamp forest was lost from within the boundaries of national parks. However, one of these studies was a site comparison and reported that forest loss was greater outside the national park. One before-and-after study of peatlands in China reported that peatland area initially decreased, but then increased, following legal protection.
Plant community composition (1 study): One before-and-after study in a bog in Denmark reported that the plant community compositon changed over 161 years of protection. In particular, woody plants became more abundant.
Vegetation cover (1 study): One site comparison study in a peatland in Chile found that a protected area had greater vegetation cover (total, herbs and shrubs) than an adjacent grazed and moss-harvested area.
Overall plant richness/diversity (2 studies): One before-and-after study in Denmark reported that the number of plant species in a protected bog fluctuated over time, with no clear trend. One site comparison study in a peatland in Chile found that a protected area had lower plant richness and diversity (but also fewer non-native species) than an adjacent grazed and harvested area.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Legislation may be developed to ensure no net loss of habitat. Simply, this means that any habitat lost to development must be compensated for by restoration or creation elsewhere. For example, under the Clean Water Act in the USA, a permit for development on wetlands may only be granted if there are plans to restore or create other wetlands. Alternatively, wetlands can be ‘bought’ from a ‘bank’ of restoration or creation projects to offset damage done by a particular development (Burgin 2010).

1798: Adopt voluntary agreements to protect peatlands
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Voluntary agreements or codes (i.e. not legally binding) could be used to protect peatlands. Such agreements prevent or restrict activities that damage specific peatlands. They may apply within a focal peatland or in surrounding habitats to prevent threats from spilling over into peatlands. Additionally, voluntary agreements often encourage peatland restoration or creation to protect the overall peatland resource. For example, members of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) are prohibited from clearing primary forest, discouraged from using fire to clear land, encouraged to leave corridors to connect forest patches and encouraged to restore or rehabilitate neighbouring peatland (Parish et al. 2012). The Ramsar Convention provides the basis for voluntary agreements to protect wetlands (including peatlands), although it is often translated into legal protection by national legislation (Ramsar Convention Secretariat 2007).
This section considers the overall effects of protecting peatlands with voluntary agreements (but excluding information on uptake only e.g. area of land or number of people signed up to agreements). Effects of individual interventions performed under voluntary agreements are considered elsewhere.

1799: Pay landowners to protect peatlands
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Landowners could be paid to protect natural, vegetated peatlands and the benefits they provide (e.g. carbon storage). Landowners may be paid to protect pristine peatlands. Where necessary, they may be paid to actively manage areas to maintain or restore peatlands. Thus, many payment schemes also protect the peatland resource as a whole. Payments could be made directly or as tax incentives, could be paid as cash or as alternative lands, and could come from governments, non-governmental organizations or private sponsorship. Payments should be supported by advice, monitoring and enforcement.
Examples of payment schemes relevant to peatlands include the Bio-Rights programme (van Eijk & Kumar 2009), the UK Peatland Code and the German MoorFutures® voluntary carbon market (Bonn et al 2014) and nationally or internationally funded agri-environment schemes (Keenleyside & Moxey 2011).

1801: Allow sustainable use of peatlands
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
‘Wise use’ of wetlands is one of the fundamental principles of the Ramsar Convention (Ramsar Convention Secretariat 2010). Allowing sustainable use of peatlands could give them an economic value, preventing their conversion to other land uses (e.g. agriculture, mining or urban development). Meanwhile sustainable use does not, by definition, damage the peatland: use can be sustained year after year. Reeds could be harvested sustainably from fens (Croon 2013), Sphagnum harvested from bogs and non-timber forest products (e.g. resin, latex, dyes, medicinal plants) harvested from tropical peat swamps. Sustainable use could complement other interventions e.g. pools created by blocking drainage canals could be used for fish farming (Suryadiputra et al. 2005).
This section considers the overall effects of allowing sustainable use of peatlands e.g. by granting licenses for long-term harvesting or requiring limited extraction of resources. In Australia, long-term Sphagnum harvesting licenses have been granted to encourage sustainable use (Whinam & Buxton 1997). In Indonesia, natural forest timber concessions are leased out on a long-term basis. Managers are obliged to maintain natural forest cover. Across all forest types (including some peat swamps), these concessions are as effective as strictly protected areas in preventing forest loss (Gaveau et al. 2013). Effects of individual interventions performed within sustainably managed peatlands are considered elsewhere.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.

1803: Restore/create peatland vegetation (multiple interventions)
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Peatland creation and restoration schemes can involve many different specific interventions. This section considers peatland creation and restoration using more than three separate interventions at once, such that it is difficult to attribute outcomes to any single intervention. Where three or fewer interventions have been used together in a study, results are reported elsewhere on the website: under each intervention (but noting the influence of the others, where appropriate) or sometimes as a combined intervention (e.g. tree removal and rewetting).
Tree-colonized describes peatlands that would not naturally contain trees. Forested or swamps are used to describe peatlands with natural tree cover. Restored refers to areas where restoration interventions have been applied (i.e. undergoing the process of restoration) rather than the state of those areas (i.e. whether they have been successfully restored).
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related action: restoration using the moss layer transfer technique, a specific combination of multiple interventions.

Key Messages:

Nine studies evaluated the effects of multiple restoration interventions (other than the moss layer transfer technique) on peatland vegetation. Six studies were in bogs (one being restored as a fen). One study was in a fen. Two studies were in unspecified or mixed peatlands.
Plant community composition (3 studies): One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the UK reported that the overall plant community composition differed between restored and unrestored bogs. One replicated, controlled, site comparison study in Estonia found that restored and natural bogs contained more similar plant communities than unrestored and natural bogs. However, one site comparison study in Canada reported that after five years, bogs being restored as fens contained a different plant community to natural fens.
Characteristic plants (1 study): One controlled study in a fen in France reported that restoration interventions increased cover of fen-characteristic plants.
Moss cover (7 studies): Five studies (including one replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after) in bogs or other peatlands in the UK, Estonia and Canada found that restoration interventions increased total moss (or bryophyte) cover. Two studies (one replicated and controlled) in bogs in the Czech Republic and Estonia reported that restoration interventions increased Sphagnum moss cover, but one replicated before-and-after study in bogs in the UK reported no change in Sphagnum cover following intervention. Two site comparison studies in Canada reported that after 1–15 years, restored areas had lower moss cover than natural fens.
Herb cover (5 studies): Five studies (one replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after) in bogs or other peatlands in the Czech Republic, the UK, Estonia and Canada reported that restoration interventions increased cover of herbaceous plants, including cottongrass and other grass-like plants.
Overall vegetation cover (3 studies): Three studies (one replicated, controlled, before-and-after) in bogs in the UK and France reported that restoration interventions increased overall vegetation cover.

1804: Restore/create peatland vegetation using the moss layer transfer technique
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
The moss layer transfer technique (Quinty & Rochefort 2003; Rochefort et al. 2013) combines multiple interventions to restore peatlands: (1) Rewetting the peat, for example by blocking drainage ditches or building water-retaining ridges. (2) Reprofiling the peat i.e. clearing and flattening the peat surface. Surface peat may be pushed into water-retaining ridges around or across the peatland, achieving steps 1 and 2 in one go. (3) Spreading plant fragments collected from the surface (top 10 cm) of a nearby bog. (4) Adding a straw mulch to provide shade and keep the surface of the peat moist. (5) Fertilizing with phosphorous to stimulate growth of nurse plants such as haircap moss. To be included as evidence in this section, studies must have tested all five steps in combination – although fertilizing is an optional step that is not always appropriate (e.g. Karofeld et al. 2016).
The moss layer transfer technique is typically used to restore bogs damaged by peat extraction. Whether it is more appropriate to introduce vegetation from bogs or fens will depend on the chemistry of the peat remaining in the degraded peatland (Quinty & Rochefort 2003). In this section, restored refers to areas where restoration interventions have been applied (i.e. undergoing the process of restoration) rather than the state of those areas (i.e. whether they have been successfully restored).
Caution: Collecting plant fragments damages the donor site, although rapid recovery has been reported (Rochefort & Campeau 2002).
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: restoration using other combinations of multiple interventions. Interventions within the moss layer transfer technique, tested individually: rewetting; reprofiling; sowing mosses or mixed vegetation; adding mulch after planting; fertilizing to complement planting.

Key Messages:

Four studies evaluated the effects, on peatland vegetation, of restoration using the moss layer transfer technique (as defined in the Background section). All four studies were based on bogs in Canada. Three studies were based on one experimental set-up that was included in the other, larger study.
Plant community composition (2 studies): One replicated study in bogs in Canada reported that the majority of restored areas developed a community of bog-characteristic plant species within 11 years. One controlled, before-and-after study in a bog in Canada reported that a restored area (included in the previous study) developed a more peatland-characteristic plant community over time, and relative to an unrestored area.
Vegetation cover (2 studies): Two controlled studies in one bog in Canada reported that a restored area had greater moss or bryophyte cover (including Sphagnum) than an unrestored area after 4–8 years. The restored area also had greater herb cover (including cottongrass), but less shrub cover, than the unrestored area. One of the studies reported that vegetation in the restored area became more similar to local natural bogs.
Overall plant richness/diversity (1 study): One controlled, before-and-after study in a bog in Canada reported that a restored area contained more plant species than an unrestored area.

1805: Fill/block ditches to create conditions suitable for peatland plants (without planting)
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Many threats can contribute to the formation of ditches or channels in peatlands (Evans et al. 2005). Deep channels (gullies) may be eroded by humans or livestock repeatedly using set trails and/or by heavy rainfall events. Erosion can be increased by burning and acid rain. Ditches may be deliberately dug to drain peatlands for agriculture, forestry or mining. Peatland vegetation cannot establish in ditches that contain deep water or are regularly disturbed by flowing water.
This section considers growth of peatland vegetation within filled or blocked ditches. Ditches could be completely filled to immediately create a surface for plants to grow on. Alternatively, ditches could be blocked with dams: creating shallow pools, encouraging peat deposition and eventually creating new surfaces on which peatland plants can grow. This would mimic natural revegetation processes (Evans et al. 2005).
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related action: rewetting larger areas of peatland, including by blocking ditches.

Key Messages:

Three studies evaluated the effects of filling or blocking ditches (without planting) on peatland vegetation within them. Two studies were in bogs and one was in a fen.
Vegetation cover (3 studies): Two studies in a bog in the UK and a fen in the USA reported that blocked or filled ditches were colonized by herbs and bryophytes within 2–3 years. In the USA, vegetation cover (total, bryophyte, forb, grass and sedge) was restored to natural, undisturbed levels. One replicated study in bogs in the UK reported that plants had not colonized blocked gullies after six months.
Overall plant richness/diversity (1 study): One site comparison study in a fen in the USA found that a filled ditch contained more plant species than adjacent undisturbed fen, after two years.

1806: Excavate pools (without planting)
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Peatlands may contain permanent pools which contribute to habitat diversity. However, these pools can be lost following drainage, peat harvesting or drought (Beadle et al. 2015). Pools may also be filled in naturally as vegetation develops and peat accumulates, so they may need to be re-excavated to maintain certain communities (van Diggelen et al. 1996). This section considers excavating pools in peatlands, then leaving vegetation to naturally recolonize.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: rewetting, which may need to be done to fill created pools; introduce peatland vegetation, including introductions into created pools i.e. planting mosses, planting herbs, spreading moss fragments or spreading mixed vegetation fragments.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects of excavating pools (without planting) on peatland vegetation. Both studies were based on the same experimental set-up in bogs in Canada.
Plant community composition (1 study): One replicated, before-and-after, site comparison study in bogs in Canada reported that excavated pools were colonized by peatland vegetation over 4–6 years, but contained different plant communities to natural pools. In particular, cattail was more common in created pools.
Vegetation cover (1 study): One replicated, before-and-after, site comparison study in bogs in Canada reported that after four years, created pools had less cover than natural pools of Sphagnum moss, herbs and shrubs.
Overall plant richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, before-and-after, site comparison study in bogs in Canada reported that after six years, created pools contained a similar number of plant species to natural pools.

1807: Reprofile/relandscape peatland (without planting)
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Large scale relandscaping of a degraded peatland may create a more suitable environment for vegetation growth. In particular, local moisture levels could be raised by reprofiling the peat surface into basins (removing &lt;30 cm of surface peat, and pushing this into ridges) or flat terraces (removing mounds that are too dry for colonization). Steep gully sides or eroding slopes can be reprofiled into shallower, more stable slopes.
Caution: Heavy machinery used for landscaping may churn and compress the peat soil, damaging its structure. Removing surface peat from bogs may expose fen peat, which has different chemical properties to bog peat and will not (in the short term) support bog vegetation (Lindsay & Clough 2016).
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: rewetting, without altering the level of the peat surface; removing upper layer of peat/soil with no other landscaping; reprofiling/relandscaping before planting.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of reprofiling/relandscaping peatlands (without planting) on peatland vegetation. The study was in degraded bogs (being restored as fens).
Plant community composition (1 study): One site comparison study in Canada reported that after five years, reprofiled (and rewetted) bogs contained a different plant community to nearby natural fens.
Vegetation cover (1 study): The same study reported that after five years, reprofiled (and rewetted) bogs had lower vegetation cover (Sphagnum moss, other moss and vascular plants) than nearby natural fens.

1808: Roughen peat surface to create microclimates (without planting)
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Exposed bare peat can be too dry for peatland vegetation to naturally recolonize. Roughening the peat surface (e.g. by ploughing or driving over it, or by adding peat blocks) could benefit recolonization in two ways. First, it could create more suitable (sheltered and moist) microclimates for plant colonisation within low areas or depressions. Although raised areas might be less suitable for peatland vegetation initially, the idea is that peatland vegetation can spread from the depressions once they have been colonized. Second, disturbing the peatland surface will also break up any hard crust or loose peat that has developed, both of which can limit water supply to the vegetation above.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: rewetting large areas of peatland by raising the water table; roughen peat surface, by creating mounds or hollows, before planting.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on peatland vegetation, of roughening the peat surface to create microclimates (without planting afterwards).

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.

1809: Remove upper layer of peat/soil (without planting)
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Damaged peatlands may be covered by a layer of non-peat soil. Alternatively, the surface peat may contain excess nutrients or a seed bank of undesirable plants (e.g. left over from agricultural use), may be too acidic (e.g. as a result of atmospheric deposition), or may be covered in a hard crust or very loose peat (making plant establishment and growth more difficult). Fens will naturally develop into bogs as peat accumulates, but this change is not always desirable.
The upper layer of peat or soil (and any vegetation on it) could be removed from damaged peatlands, creating a new bare peat surface for colonization. This surface may have fewer nutrients, no undesirable seed bank, and often wetter and less acidic peat since the surface is closer to the water table (Grootjans et al. 2002; Lamers et al. 2015). Stripping surface peat can reverse the development of fens into bogs.
Caution: Soil stripping may be unsuitable for wetter peatlands as heavy machinery involved may churn and compress the peat soil. Stripping surface peat from bogs may expose fen peat, which has different chemical properties to bog peat and will not (in the short term) support bog vegetation (Lindsay & Clough 2016).
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: rewetting; reprofile/relandscape peatland e.g. by building ridges or embankments; bury upper layer of peat or soil; disturb peatland surface, but without removing peat/soil; remove soil before planting; interventions to control vegetation without also removing peat e.g. physical damage, cutting/mowing or herbicide.

Key Messages:

Ten studies evaluated the effects of removing the upper layer of peat or soil (without planting afterwards) on peatland vegetation. Nine studies were in fens or fen meadows and one was in an unspecified peatland.
Plant community composition (6 studies): Five studies (including one replicated, randomized, paired, controlled) in a peatland in the USA and fens or fen meadows in the Netherlands and Poland reported that plots stripped of topsoil developed plant communities with a different composition to those in unstripped peatlands. In one study, the effect of stripping was not separated from the effect of rewetting. Two studies in fen meadows in Germany and Poland reported that the depth of soil stripping affected plant community development.
Characteristic plants (5 studies): Four studies in fen meadows in Germany and the Netherlands, and a peatland in the USA, reported that stripping soil increased cover of wetland-characteristic or peatland-characteristic plants plants after 4–13 years. In the Netherlands, the effect of stripping was not separated from the effect of rewetting. One replicated site comparison study in fens in Belgium and the Netherlands found that stripping soil increased fen-characteristic plant richness.
Herb cover (4 studies): Three studies (including one replicated, paired, controlled) in fens or fen meadows in Germany, the UK and Poland found that stripping soil increased cover of rushes, reeds or sedges after 2–6 years. However, one controlled study in a fen meadow in the Netherlands reported that stripping soil had no effect on sedge or bentgrass cover after five years. Two controlled studies in a fen meadow in the Netherlands and a fen in the UK found that stripping soil reduced purple moor grass cover for 2–5 years.
Vegetation structure (3 studies): Two studies in fens or fen meadows in the Netherlands and Belgium found that stripping soil reduced vegetation biomass (total or herbs) for up to 18 years. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a peatland in the USA found that stripping soil had no effect on vegetation biomass after four years.
Overall plant richness/diversity (6 studies): Three studies (including one replicated, paired, controlled) in fens or fen meadows in the UK, Belgium and the Netherlands reported that stripping soil increased total plant species richness over 2–18 years. In one study, the effect of stripping was not separated from the effect of rewetting. One replicated, controlled study in a fen in Poland found that stripping soil had no effect on plant species richness after three years. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a peatland in the USA found that stripping soil increased plant species richness and diversity, after four years, in one field but decreased it in another. One replicated study in a fen meadow in Poland reported that plant species richness increased over time, after stripping soil.

1810: Bury upper layer of peat/soil (without planting)
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Damaged peatlands may be covered by a layer of non-peat soil. Alternatively, the surface peat may contain excess nutrients or a seed bank of undesirable plants (e.g. left over from agricultural use), or may be too acidic (e.g. as a result of atmospheric deposition). Burying this upper layer (and any vegetation on it) under deeper peat layers, for instance by deep ploughing, could make these nutrients inaccessible to plants and prevent undesirable plants from growing. It will also create bare peat with spaces for plants to colonize (Glen et al. 2017). By replacing the surface layers under the deeper peat, the ground level could be maintained.
Caution: Soil burial may be unsuitable for wetter peatlands as heavy machinery involved may churn and compress the peat soil. Burying surface peat from bogs may expose fen peat, which has different chemical properties to bog peat and will not (in the short term) support bog vegetation (Lindsay & Clough 2016).
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: strip/remove upper layer of peat or soil; disturb peatland surface; bury upper layer of peat/soil before planting.

1811: Disturb peatland surface to encourage growth of desirable plants (without planting)
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Mechanically disturbing the peat or soil surface (e.g. by tilling, ploughing or scarifying) can encourage the growth of desirable plants. It can create bare patches, clear of previous dominant species, in which peatland plants can grow. Peatland plants may colonize from nearby patches or germinate from seeds or spores already in the soil. Colonizing plants will typically be fast-growing, weedy species – but sometimes these are desirable members of natural peatland plant communities, or are desirable to provide some cover that can shelter and nurse other colonizing plants.
Caution: Disturbance can destroy the physical structure of the peat and aerate the peat more than usual. Deep ploughing could mix the peat with underlying mineral soil.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: physically damage problematic plants, including by disturbing the peat/soil; bury upper layer of peat or soil, as opposed to shallow disturbance only.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects of disturbing the peat surface (without planting) on peatland vegetation. Both studies were in fens.
Plant community composition (2 studies): Two replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after studies (one also randomized) in fens in Germany and Sweden reported that soil disturbance affected development of the plant community over 2–3 years. In Germany, disturbed plots developed greater cover of weedy species from the seed bank than undisturbed plots. In Sweden, the community in disturbed and undisturbed plots became less similar over time. 
Characteristic plants (2 studies): The same two studies reported that wetland- or fen-characteristic plant species colonized plots that had been disrturbed (along with other interventions). The study in Germany noted that peat-forming species did not colonize the fen.

1812: Add inorganic fertilizer (without planting)
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Inorganic fertilizers could be used to manage nutrients in peatlands and speed up revegetation. Plant growth might be limited by a lack of nutrients overall, or of a specific nutrient, after drainage, mining, vegetation harvest or pollution. Commonly added nutrients include nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P) and/or potassium (K).
Caution: Some peatlands are characterized by low nutrient availability (Rydin & Jeglum 2013). Adding fertilizer might be a short-term solution to encourage initial plant growth, but could lead to undesirable long-term increases in nutrient levels.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related action: add inorganic fertilizer to complement planting.

Vegetation cover (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in a bog in New Zealand reported that fertilizing typically increased total vegetation cover.
Vegetation structure (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in a fen meadow in the Netherlands found that fertilizing with phosphorous typically increased total above-ground vegetation biomass, but other chemicals typically had no effect.
Overall plant richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in a bog in New Zealand reported that fertilizing typically increased plant species richness.
Growth (1 study): One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in a bog in Germany found that fertilizing with phosphorous typically increased herb and shrub growth rate, but other chemicals had no effect.
Other (3 studies): Three replicated, controlled studies in a fen meadow in Germany and bogs in Germany and New Zealand reported that effects of fertilizer on peatland were more common when phosphorous was added, than when nitrogen or potassium were added.

1813: Cover peatland with organic mulch (without planting)
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Peatland vegetation may be killed by hot, dry conditions on bare peat surfaces (e.g. Sagot & Rochefort 1996). Organic mulches (e.g. straw, grass cuttings or shrub roots) can be placed on the peatland surface to stabilize temperatures and humidity, and provide shade. This may create a more hospitable environment for establishment and growth of peatland vegetation (Good et al. 2009). Typically, mulch is applied sparsely enough that some light can still reach the peat surface. Caution: Mulches may contain seeds of undesirable plants. Sterilization before application can kill these.
This section considers the effect of adding mulch without adding living vegetation. The mulch is intended to help existing vegetation e.g. remnant moss patches, or seedlings that germinate from seeds already in the peat.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: cover peat with something other than mulch e.g. plastic sheets or shade cloths; add mulch after planting.

Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Peatland vegetation may be killed by hot, dry and bright conditions on bare peat surfaces (e.g. Harley et al. 1989; Sagot & Rochefort 1996). Covers (e.g. plastic sheets, fleece or fibre mats) can maintain more stable temperatures and humidity, and offer some shading. This may create a more hospitable environment for establishment and growth of peatland vegetation (Good et al. 2009). The precise effect (mainly affecting light and/or moisture) depends on the material and its height above the peatland.
This section considers the effect of adding covers without adding vegetation. The cover is intended to help existing vegetation e.g. remnant moss patches, or seedlings that germinate from seeds already in the peat. We use the term mesh to describe covers such as shade cloths, gauze and netting that are used to shade a peatland.

1815: Stabilize peatland surface to help plants colonize
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Peatland plants may struggle to colonize loose bare peat. Seeds, spores or young plants can be washed or blown away. The peatland surface could be stabilized by pegging fibre netting (e.g. geojute) into the peat or applying fibre rolls to act as wind/water breaks. If made of organic material, these stabilizing aids should degrade once peatland vegetation has colonized.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: cover peat with mulch or other material, which may stabilize the peat surface as well as controlling the microclimate.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of stabilizing the peatland surface (without planting) on peatland vegetation. The study was in a bog.

1816: Introduce nurse plants (without planting peatland vegetation)
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Nurse or companion plants can be planted to help naturally recolonizing peatland vegetation (Padilla & Pugnaire 2006). Nurse plants can bind together loose peat and reduce harsh environmental conditions (temperature fluctuations, desiccation and strong sunlight). Clearly, nurse plants that can tolerate these conditions must be selected. Invasive species (that spread easily) and species that may outcompete focal plants (physically or chemically) should be avoided. Instead, it is expected that nurse plants are eventually outcompeted by focal plants.
Herbs are common nurse plants in temperate peatlands, creating shelter for mosses. They may be directly planted or added as seed (the latter being a more efficient way to cover larger areas). Haircap moss Polytrichum strictum may act as a nurse plant for Sphagnum mosses: a correlative study in Canada found that natural recolonization of Sphagnum only occurred in carpets of haircap moss (Groeneveld et al. 2007). In tropical peat swamps, light-tolerant trees can be used to shelter shade-loving trees.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: restore or create a peatland using multiple interventions, which commonly includes introducing nurse plants; introduce nurse plants before planting focal peatland plants.

1817: Build artificial bird perches to encourage seed dispersal
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Artificial bird perches may help to restore peatland forests. Perches are placed near to remaining forest patches to encourage birds to fly out, perch and defecate onto degraded land. The seeds transported in this way might belong to peatland plants (especially tropical swamp forest trees) that would otherwise not disperse into degraded land. Consequently, the abundance and diversity of seedlings may increase in areas with perches (Agra et al. 2016).
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related action: directly introduce herb seeds, shrub/tree seeds, or vegetation fragments containing seeds.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on peatland vegetation of building artificial bird perches. The study was in a tropical peat swamp.
Vegetation cover (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in a peat swamp forest in Indonesia found that artificial bird perches had no significant effect on seedling abundance.

1818: Directly plant peatland mosses
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This section considers introducing peatland vegetation by planting moss shoots, plants or sods directly into peat/soil. Plants may be collected from natural peatlands or grown in greenhouses/laboratories. Direct introduction of peatland vegetation might be necessary in severely degraded or bare peatlands. Natural revegetation (from remnant plants, seed banks or dispersal) might not happen, might be very slow or might not produce the desired mix of species.
Caution: Collecting vegetation from natural peatlands damages the donor site, although rapid recovery has been reported (Rochefort & Campeau 2002). 
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: spread vegetation onto peatland surface (mosses or mixed vegetation); introduce seeds (of herbs or shrubs/trees); restoration using more than three interventions, sometimes including planting; supporting interventions from this section used without introducing vegetation (e.g. mulching or fertilizing); experimental tests of interventions to complement planting (e.g. mulching or fertilizing).

Key Messages:

Seven studies evaluated the effects on peatland vegetation of planting mosses. Six studies were in bogs and one was in a fen.
Survival (1 study): One study in Lithuania reported that of 50 Sphagnum-dominated sods planted into a rewetted bog, 47 survived for one year.
Growth (2 studies): Two before-and-after studies in a fen in the Netherlands and bog pools in the UK reported that mosses grew after planting.
Moss cover (5 studies): Five before-and-after studies in a fen in the Netherlands and bogs in Germany, Ireland, Estonia and Australia reported that after planting mosses, the area covered by moss increased in at least some cases. The study in the Netherlands reported spread of planted moss beyond the introduction site. The study in Australia was also controlled and reported that planted plots developed greater Sphagnum moss cover than unplanted plots.

Key Messages:

Five studies evaluated the effects on peatland vegetation of planting herbaceous plants. Three studies were in fens or fen meadows and two were in bogs.
Survival (3 studies): Three replicated studies in a fen meadow in the Netherlands and fens in the USA reported that planted herbs survived over 2–3 years. However, for six of nine species only a minority of individuals survived.
Growth (2 studies): Two replicated before-and-after studies in a bog in Germany and fens in the USA reported that individual planted herbs grew.
Vegetation cover (1 study): One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in Canada found that planting herbs had no effect on moss, herb or shrub cover in created bog pools relative to natural colonization.

1820: Directly plant peatland trees/shrubs
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This section considers introduction of peatland vegetation by planting whole shrubs/trees (seedlings, mature plants or cuttings) directly into the soil. Plants may be collected from natural peatlands or grown in greenhouses/laboratories. Direct introduction of peatland vegetation might be necessary in severely degraded or bare peatlands. Natural revegetation (from remnant plants, seed banks or dispersal) might not happen, might be very slow or might not produce the desired mix of species.
Caution: Collecting vegetation from natural peatlands can damage the donor site. Trees and shrubs are not natural features of all peatlands: growth of woody plants is a threat to many bogs and fens. Trees could dry out peatlands by taking up water.
Related actions: spread vegetation onto peatland surface (mosses or mixed vegetation); introduce seeds (of herbs or shrubs); restoration using more than three interventions, sometimes including planting; supporting interventions from this section used without introducing vegetation (e.g. mulching or fertilizing); experimental tests of interventions to complement planting (e.g. mulching or fertilizing).

Key Messages:

Eleven studies evaluated the effects, on peatland vegetation, of planting trees/shrubs to restore or create forested/shrubby peatland. Seven studies were in tropical peat swamps, three in bogs and one in a fen.
Survival (10 studies): Eight studies (seven replicated) in peat swamp forests in Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia and bogs in Canada reported that the majority of planted trees/shrubs survived over periods between 10 weeks and 13 years. Species with &lt;50% survival included Dacryodes, poplar and katok. One replicated study in a fen in the USA reported that most planted willow cuttings died within two years. One study in a peat swamp forest in Indonesia reported &lt;5% survival of planted trees after five months, following unusually deep flooding.
Growth (5 studies): Four studies (including two replicated, before-and-after) in peat swamp forests in Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia reported that planted trees grew. One replicated before-and-after study in bogs in Canada reported that planted shrubs grew.

1821: Add mosses to peatland surface
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This section considers introducing peatland vegetation by spreading mosses or moss fragments (not mixed vegetation) onto the peatland surface. This includes studies that separated mosses from collected mixed vegetation. The mosses are expected to establish and grow. It may also be possible to establish peatland vegetation on non-peat soil (e.g. mesocosm experiment of Borkenhagen & Cooper 2016). Vegetation can be sourced from nearby natural peatlands or grown in greenhouses. Direct introduction of peatland vegetation might be necessary in severely degraded or bare peatlands. Natural revegetation (from remnant plants, seed banks or dispersal) might not happen, might be very slow or might not produce the desired mix of species.
Caution: Collecting vegetation from natural peatlands damages the donor site, although rapid recovery has been reported (Rochefort & Campeau 2002). Non-native or non-peatland species could be present in the introduced vegetation.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: directly plant whole plants into peatland (mosses, herbs or shrubs/trees); introduce seeds (of herbs or shrubs/trees); restoration using more than three interventions, sometimes including planting; supporting interventions from this section used without introducing vegetation (e.g. mulching or fertilizing); experimental tests of interventions to complement planting (e.g. mulching or fertilizing).

Key Messages:

Thirteen studies evaluated the effects of adding mosses or moss fragments onto peatland surfaces. Eleven were in bogs and two in were in fens. One study was a continuation of an earlier study. Three of the studies involved sowing moss in gel beads.
Sphagnum moss cover (12 studies): Eleven studies in bogs in the UK, Canada, Finland and Germany and fens the USA reported that Sphagnum moss was present, after 1–4 growing seasons, in at least some plots sown with Sphagnum. Cover ranged from negligible to &gt;90%. Six of these studies were controlled and found that Sphagnum cover or abundance was higher in sown than unsown plots. One of the studies reported that Sphagnum only survived in one of three sites, and only when plots were mulched. One additional study in Canada found that adding Sphagnum to bog pools did not affect Sphagnum
Other moss cover (4 studies): Four studies (including one replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after) in bogs in Canada and fens in Sweden and the USA reported that mosses or bryophytes other than Sphagnum were present, after 2–3 growing seasons, in at least some plots sown with moss fragments. Cover ranged from negligible to 76%. In the fens in Sweden and the USA, moss cover was low (&lt;1%) unless the plots were mulched, shaded or limed.

1822: Add mixed vegetation to peatland surface
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This section considers introduction of peatland vegetation by spreading mixed vegetation fragments (including seeds, rhizomes, seedlings and spores of other species even if dominated by mosses) onto the peatland surface. These are expected to take root and grow. It may also be possible to establish peatland vegetation on non-peat soil (e.g. mesocosm experiment of Borkenhagen & Cooper 2016). Vegetation can be sourced from nearby natural peatlands or grown in greenhouses. Direct introduction of peatland vegetation might be necessary in severely degraded or bare peatlands.

Key Messages:

Eighteen studies evaluated the effects on peatland vegetation of spreading mixed vegetation onto the peatland surface. All 18 studies were in bogs (two being restored as fens). One study was a continuation of an earlier study.
Characteristic plants (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in a degraded bog in Canada found that adding fen vegetation increased the number and cover of fen-characteristic plant species.
Sphagnum moss cover (17 studies): Seventeen replicated studies (five also randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after) in bogs in Canada, the USA and Estonia reported that Sphagnum moss was present, after 1–6 growing seasons, in at least some plots sown with vegetation containing Sphagnum. Cover ranged from &lt;1 to 73%. Six of the studies were controlled and found that Sphagnum cover was higher in sown than unsown plots. Five of the studies reported that Sphagnum cover was very low (&lt;1%) unless plots were mulched after spreading fragments.
Other moss cover (8 studies): Eight replicated studies (seven before-and-after, one controlled) in bogs in Canada, the USA and Estonia reported that mosses or bryophytes other than Sphagnum were present, after 1–6 growing seasons, in at least some plots sown with mixed peatland vegetation. Cover was &lt;1–65%.
Vascular plant cover (10 studies): Ten replicated studies in Canada, the USA and Estonia reported that vascular plants appeared following addition of mixed vegetation fragments to bogs. Two of the studies were controlled: one found that vascular plant cover was significantly higher in sown than unsown plots, but one found that sowing peatland vegetation did not affect herb cover.

1823: Introduce seeds of peatland herbs
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This section considers introducing seeds of peatland herbs: directly sowing seeds, spreading vegetation fragments on the peatland that will not themselves grow but contain seeds (e.g. hay harvested from fens), or adding peat/soil that contains seeds of peatland plants. Adding vegetation fragments may have the additional benefit of protecting the peat surface, controlling moisture levels and providing shade. Note that this section does not include studies that only introduce, or report responses of, nurse plants (e.g. Caporn et al. 2007).
Direct introduction of peatland vegetation might be necessary in severely degraded or bare peatlands. Natural revegetation (from remnant plants, seed banks or dispersal) might not happen, might be very slow or might not produce the desired mix of species.
Caution: Collecting seeds from natural peatlands may damage the source site.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.

Key Messages:

Ten studies evaluated the effects, on peatland vegetation, of introducing seeds of herbaceous peatland plants. Seven studies were in fens or fen meadows, two in bogs and one in unspecified peatland.
Germination (2 studies): Two replicated studies reported that some planted herb seeds germinated. In a bog in Germany three of four species germinated, but in a fen in the USA only one of seven species germinated.
Characteristic plants (3 studies): Three studies (two controlled) in fen meadows in Germany and a peatland in China reported that wetland-characteristic or peatland-characteristic plants colonized plots where herb seeds were sown (sometimes along with other interventions).
Herb cover (4 studies): Three before-and-after studies (one also replicated, randomized, paired, controlled) in a bog in New Zealand, fen meadows in Switzerland and a peatland in China reported that plots sown with herb seeds developed cover of the sown herbs (and in New Zealand, greater cover than unsown plots). In China, the effect of sowing was not separated from the effects of other interventions. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a fen in the USA found that plots sown with herb (and shrub) seeds developed similar herb cover to plots that were not sown.
Overall vegetation cover (3 studies): Of three replicated, controlled studies, one in a fen in the USA found that sowing herb (and shrub) seeds increased total vegetation cover. One study in a bog in New Zealand found that sowing herb seeds had no effect on total vegetation cover. One study in a fen meadow in Poland found that the effect of adding seed-rich hay depended on other treatments applied to plots.
Overall plant richness/diversity (4 studies): Two replicated, controlled studies in fens in the USA and Poland found that sowing herb seeds had no effect on plant species richness (total or vascular). Two replicated, controlled, before-and-after studies in a bog in New Zealand and a fen meadow in Poland each reported inconsistent effects of herb sowing on total plant species richness.

Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This section considers introducing seeds of peatland trees/shrubs, including directly sowing seeds, spreading vegetation fragments on the peatland that will not themselves grow but contain seeds (e.g. seed-rich heather brash), or adding peat/soil that contains seeds of peatland plants. Adding vegetation fragments may have the additional benefit of protecting the peat surface, controlling moisture levels and providing shade. Note that this section does not include studies that only introduce, or report responses of, nurse plants (e.g. Caporn et al. 2007).
Direct introduction of peatland vegetation might be necessary in severely degraded or bare peatlands. Natural revegetation (from remnant plants, seed banks or dispersal) might not happen, might be very slow or might not produce the desired mix of species.

Key Messages:

Five studies evaluated the effects, on peatland vegetation, of introducing seeds of peatland trees/shrubs to restore or create forested/shrubby peatland. Three studies were in bogs and two were in fens.
Germination (2 studies): Two replicated studies in a bog in Germany and a fen in the USA reported germination of heather and willow seeds, respectively, in at least some sown plots.
Survival (2 studies): One replicated study in a bog in Germany reported survival of some heather seedlings over two years. One replicated study in a fen in the USA reported that all germinated willow seedlings died within one month.
Shrub cover (3 studies): Two studies (one replicated, randomized, paired, controlled) in bogs in New Zealand and Estonia reported that plots sown with shrub seeds (sometimes along with other interventions) developed greater cover of some shrubs than plots that were not sown: sown manuka or naturally colonizing heather (but not sown cranberry). One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a fen in the USA found that plots sown with shrub (and herb) seeds developed similar overall shrub cover to unsown plots within two years.
Overall vegetation cover (3 studies): Two replicated, randomized, paired, controlled studies in a bog in New Zealand and a fen in the USA reported that plots sown with shrub (and herb) seeds developed greater total vegetation cover than unsown plots after two years. One site comparison study in bogs in Estonia reported that sowing shrub seeds (along with fertilization) had no effect on total vegetation cover after 25 years.
Overall plant richness/diversity (3 studies): One site comparison study in bogs in Estonia reported that sowing shrub seeds (along with fertilization) increased plant species richness. However, one replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a bog in New Zealand reported that plots sown with shrub seeds typically contained fewer plant species than plots that were not sown. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a fen in the USA found that sowing shrub (and herb) seeds had no effect on plant species richness.

1825: Add lime (before/after planting)
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be ineffective or harmful
Background information and definitions:
Peatland plant survival and growth is partly determined by the acidity of a peatland, or pH (Rydin & Jeglum 2013). Fen plants grow in alkaline to weakly acidic peat (approximately pH 6–8, similar to saliva, tap water or sea water). Bog plants grow in more acidic peat (approximately pH 4–5, similar to tomato juice or coffee). The acidity of a peatland also determines the availability of nutrients. For example, phosphorous becomes locked away in acidic soils (Weil & Brady 2016).
Lime (calcium and/or magnesium-rich chemicals) can be added to peatlands to reduce acidity and modify nutrient availability, potentially increasing survival or growth of peatland vegetation. To be included as evidence in this section, studies must have reported the response of peatland vegetation, not just nurse plants (e.g. Caporn et al. 2007).
Caution: The benefits and harms of liming are very context specific. Liming is mostly used in fens and fen meadows, but is sometimes used in extremely polluted, exceptionally acidic bogs. Lime could damage most bogs by reducing natural acidity.
Related actions: add lime to peatlands without introducing vegetation; restoration using multiple interventions, sometimes including liming.

Key Messages:

Six studies evaluated the effects on peatland vegetation of liming areas planted with peatland plants. Four studies involved fen plants, one involved bog plants and one involved peat swamp plants. Two of the studies were in greenhouses/nurseries.
Survival (2 studies): One replicated, controlled study in the Netherlands reported that liming typically reduced survival of planted fen herbs after two growing seasons. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in Sweden found that liming increased survival of planted fen mosses over one growing season.
Growth (3 studies): Two controlled, before-and-after studies found that liming did not increase growth of planted peatland vegetation. Liming reduced or had no effect on Sphagnum moss growth in bog pools in the UK, and reduced growth rates for the majority of peat swamp tree seedlings in a nursery in Indonesia. One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in Sweden found that liming increased growth of planted fen mosses.
Cover (2 studies): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in a fen in Sweden found that liming increased cover of sown mosses. However, one replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a bog in Canada found that liming plots sown with fen vegetation fragments had no effect on total vegetation, vascular plant or bryophyte cover.

1826: Add inorganic fertilizer (before/after planting)
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Inorganic fertilizer can provide nutrients that are in short supply, thereby increasing the initial survival and/or growth rate of introduced plants. Commonly added nutrients include nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P) and/or potassium (K). These are major nutrients that are most commonly limiting for plant growth in peatlands (Rydin & Jeglum 2013). Fertilizer is usually added immediately before or immediately after planting. Note that we do not include studies that only report responses of nurse plants (e.g. Caporn et al. 2007).
Caution: Peatlands are characterized by low nutrient availability (Rydin & Jeglum 2013). Adding fertilizer might be a short-term solution to encourage initial plant growth, but could lead to undesirable long-term increases in nutrient levels. Some studies involve planting trees, but trees are not natural features of many peatlands.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: add fertilizer to peatlands without introducing vegetation; restoration using multiple interventions, including fertilization.

Key Messages:

Nine studies evaluated the effects, on peatland vegetation, of adding inorganic fertilizer to areas planted with peatland plants. Eight studies were in bogs (two being restored as fens). One study was in a tropical peat swamp nursery.
Survival (2 studies): Two replicated, randomized, paired, controlled studies in bogs in Canada examined the effect, on plant survival, of adding inorganic fertilizer to areas planted with peatland plants. One study reported that fertilizer increased survival of two planted tree species. The other study found that fertilizer had no effect on three planted tree species and reduced survival of one.
Growth (6 studies): Five studies (three replicated, randomized, paired, controlled) in bogs in the UK, Germany and Canada found that fertilizer typically increased growth of planted mosses, herbs or trees. However, for some species or in some conditions, fertilizer had no effect on growth. One replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after study in a nursery in Indonesia found that fertilizer typically had no effect on growth of peat swamp tree seedlings.
Cover (3 studies): Three replicated, randomized, paired, controlled studies examined the effect, on vegetation cover, of fertilizing areas planted with peatland plants. One study in a bog in Canada found that fertilizer increased total vegetation, vascular plant and bryophyte cover. Another study in a bog (being restored as a fen) in Canada found that fertilizer increased sedge cover but had no effect on total vegetation cover, total herb cover or Sphagnum moss cover. One study in a bog in New Zealand reported that fertilizer typically increased cover of a sown shrub and rush, but this depended on the chemical in the fertilizer and preparation of the peat.

1827: Add organic fertilizer (before/after planting)
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Organic fertilizer (i.e. remains or waste products of living organisms) can provide nutrients that are in short supply, thereby increasing the initial survival and/or growth rate of introduced plants. Once successfully established, these plants are more likely to survive long term. Fertilizer would usually be added into the peat immediately before or after planting.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related action: add inorganic fertilizer to complement planting.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on peatland vegetation, of adding organic fertilizer to areas planted with peatland plants.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.

1828: Cover peatland with organic mulch (after planting)
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Introduced peatland vegetation may be killed by hot, dry conditions on bare peat surfaces (e.g. Sagot & Rochefort 1996). Organic mulches (e.g. straw, grass cuttings, heather brash or shrub roots) can be placed on the peatland surface after plants have been introduced to stabilize temperatures and humidity, and offer some shading. This creates a more hospitable environment for establishment and growth of introduced vegetation (Price et al. 1998). Typically, mulch is applied sparsely enough that some light can still reach the peat surface. Caution: Mulches may contain seeds of undesirable plants. It may be necessary to sterilize the material before use.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: add mulch to peatlands without introducing vegetation; add other covers such as mats, sheets or screens after planting.

Key Messages:

Twelve studies evaluated the effects, on peatland vegetation, of adding organic mulch after planting peatland plants. Nine studies were in bogs (one being restored as a fen). Two studies were in fens. One was in a tropical peat swamp.
Germination (1 study): One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in a bog in Germany found that mulching after sowing seeds increased germination rates for two species (a grass and a shrub), but had no effect on three other herb species.
Survival (3 studies): Two replicated, paired, controlled studies in a fen in Sweden and a bog in the USA reported that mulching increased survival of planted vegetation (mosses or sedges). One replicated, paired, controlled study in Indonesia reported that mulching with oil palm fruits reduced survival of planted peat swamp tree seedlings.
Growth (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in a fen in the USA reported that mulching increased growth of transplanted sedges.
Cover (9 studies): Six studies (including four replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after) in bogs in Canada and the USA and a fen in Sweden found that mulching after planting increased vegetation cover (specifically total vegetation, total mosses/bryophytes, Sphagnum mosses or vascular plants after 1–3 growing seasons). Three replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after studies in degraded bogs in Canada found that mulching after planting had no effect on vegetation cover (Sphagnum mosses or fen-characteristic plants).

Introduced peatland vegetation may be killed by hot, dry and bright conditions on bare peat surfaces (e.g. Harley et al. 1989; Sagot & Rochefort 1996). Covers (e.g. plastic sheets, fleece or geojute fibre mats) can physically stabilize the peat surface, maintain more constant temperatures and humidity, and offer some shading. This creates a more hospitable environment for establishment and growth of introduced vegetation (Price et al. 1998).
This section considers covers that may be placed on peatlands as sheets to control light and/or moisture levels. The precise effect may vary depending on the material and the height above the peatland. We use the term mesh to describe all net-like covers with lots of small holes, used primarily to shade the peatland surface. This includes shade screens, shade cloths, gauze and netting.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: cover peatlands without introducing vegetation; add organic mulch after planting.

Key Messages:

Eight studies evaluated the effects, on peatland vegetation, of adding covers (other than mulch) after planting peatland plants. Five studies involved bog plants, two involved fen plants and one involved peat swamp plants. Two of the studies were in greenhouses or nurseries.
Germination (1 study): One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in a bog in Germany reported mixed effects of fleece and fibre mats on germination of sown herb and shrub seeds (positive or no effect, depending on species).
Survival (2 studies): Two replicated, randomized, controlled studies examined the effect, on plant survival, of covering planted areas. One study in a fen in Sweden reported that shading with plastic mesh increased survival of planted mosses. One study in a nursery in Indonesia reported that shading with plastic mesh typically had no effect on survival of peat swamp tree species, but increased survival of some.
Growth (3 studies): Three replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after studies examined the effect, on plant growth, of covering planted areas. One study in a greenhouse in Switzerland found that covering planted Sphagnum mosses with transparent plastic sheets or shading mesh increased their growth. One study in a fen in Sweden found that shading with plastic mesh reduced growth of planted fen mosses. One study in a nursery in Indonesia reported that seedlings shaded with plastic mesh grew taller and thinner than unshaded seedlings.
Cover (4 studies): Two replicated, paired studies in a fen in Sweden and a bog in Australia reported that shading plots with plastic mesh increased cover of planted mosses. One study in a bog in Canada found that covering sown plots with plastic mesh, not transparent plastic sheets, increased the number of Sphagnum moss shoots. Another study in a bog in Canada reported that shading sown plots with plastic mesh had no effect on cover of vegetation overall, vascular plants, Sphagnum or other moss.

1830: Introduce nurse plants (to aid focal peatland plants)
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Nurse or companion plants can be planted alongside focal plants to help the focal plants establish (Padilla & Pugnaire 2006). Nurse plants can bind together loose peat and reduce harsh environmental conditions (temperature fluctuations, desiccation and strong sunlight). Nurse plants must be able to tolerate these conditions, but invasive species (that spread easily) and species that may outcompete focal plants (physically or chemically) should be avoided. Instead, it is expected that nurse plants are eventually outcompeted by focal plants.
Herbs are common nurse plants in temperate peatlands, creating shelter for mosses. They may be directly planted or added as seed (the latter being a more efficient way to cover larger areas). Haircap moss Polytrichum strictum may act as a nurse plant for Sphagnum moss and vascular plant seedlings (based on a correlative study of natural colonization, and an experiment using non-peatland species; Groeneveld et al. 2007). In tropical peat swamps, light-tolerant trees can be used to shelter shade-loving trees.
To be included as evidence in this section, studies must have deliberately introduced nurse plants before planting focal peatland vegetation. Studies that planted peatland vegetation into existing nurse vegetation (e.g. Sliva & Pfadenhauer 1999), or examined natural colonization of nurse vegetation (e.g. Groeneveld et al. 2007) are not included.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: introduce nurse plants as one of many combined interventions e.g. lime/seed/fertilizer; introduce nurse plants without introducing peatland vegetation.

1831: Rewet peatland (before/after planting)
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
The surface of exploited peatlands can be too dry for natural peatland vegetation. Drainage for agriculture, peat extraction or construction – within or near to a focal peatland – can dry out the peat surface. To rewet surface peat, the water table of a large area of peatland could be raised by e.g. blocking drainage ditches, blocking underground channels or peat pipes, building raised banks, switching off drainage pumps or restoring inflows.
To be included as evidence in this section, studies must have experimentally tested the effect of raising the water table on planted peatland vegetation (e.g. by comparing rewetted areas to areas that remain drained).
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: rewet peatlands without introducing vegetation; lower peatland surface by excavation/peat removal, bringing it closer to the water table; excavate/remove surface peat or irrigate peatland to complement planting.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on peatland vegetation, of rewetting (by raising the water table) areas planted with peatland plants.

1832: Irrigate peatland (before/after planting)
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Irrigation systems, such as sprinklers, could be used to maintain a damp peat surface and stop planted vegetation from drying out (Rochefort & Bastien 1998). Water could be recirculated from drainage ditches or ponds on the peatland. Irrigation can be expensive so may be best used as a short-term intervention to kick-start restoration.
Caution: A suitable water source, with the right level of nutrients and acidity/alkalinity, must be chosen to avoid altering chemical conditions on the peatland (Lamers et al. 2002). For example, bogs should only be irrigated with water stored on the bog, not ground water. Taking water for irrigation might reduce water levels in neighbouring wetlands.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related action: irrigate peatlands without introducing vegetation.

1833: Reprofile/relandscape peatland (before planting)
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
The peatland surface could be modified before introducing vegetation to create a more suitable environment for vegetation growth. In particular, local moisture levels could be raised by excavating shallow basins (removing &lt;30 cm of surface peat and pushing it into ridges). At the same time, drier mounds of peat can be flattened. Steep gully sides or eroding slopes can be reprofiled into shallower, more stable slopes.
Caution: Heavy machinery used for landscaping may churn and compress the peat soil, damaging its structure. Removing surface peat from bogs may expose fen peat, which has different chemical properties to bog peat and will not (in the short term) support bog vegetation (Lindsay & Clough 2016).
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: reprofile/relandscape without introducing vegetation; raise water table to complement planting; create small mounds or hollows in peat before planting; remove upper layer of peat/soil before planting, without further reprofiling.

Key Messages:

Four studies evaluated the effects, on peatland vegetation, of reprofiling or relandscaping before planting peatland plants. All four studies were in bogs.
Survival (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in a bog in Canada found that survival of sown Sphagnum mosses was higher, after one growing season, in reprofiled basins than on raised plots.
Cover (3 studies): Two replicated, controlled, before-and-after studies in bogs in Canada found that reprofiled basins had higher Sphagnum cover than raised plots, 3–4 growing seasons after sowing Sphagnum-dominated vegetation fragments. However, one controlled study in a bog in Estonia reported that total Sphagnum cover did not differ between reprofiled and raised plots, 1–2 years after sowing. All three studies found that reprofiled and raised plots developed similar cover of other mosses/bryophytes and vascular plants.

1834: Create mounds or hollows (before planting)
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Vegetation may struggle to colonize flat bare peat. It can be damaged by extreme heat, sunlight, strong winds or prolonged flooding. In temperate peatlands, roughening the peat surface (e.g. by ploughing, creating vehicle tracks, or adding peat blocks) could create lower sheltered, moist and shaded habitats that are more suitable for plant growth. These processes can also break up any hard crust or compress loose, dry peat. Although raised areas might be less suitable for peatland vegetation initially, the idea is that peatland vegetation can spread from the depressions once they have been colonized. In tropical peatlands, planting trees into mounds might improve their survival by reducing the duration of flooding and increasing oxygen supply to the roots (Wibisono et al. 2005). Mounds may naturally form in peat swamp forests from the roots of fallen trees.   
Caution: Manipulating the peat surface may damage its physical structure. Repeated use of vehicles on soft, wet peat may be particularly damaging.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: roughen peat surface without introducing vegetation; large scale reprofiling/relandscaping before planting.

Growth (1 study): One controlled study in a peat swamp in Thailand reported that trees planted into mounds of peat grew thicker stems than trees planted at ground level.
Cover (2 studies): Two replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after studies in bogs in Canada found that roughening the peat surface (by harrowing, ploughing, creating vehicle tracks or adding peat blocks) did not significantly affect cover of planted Sphagnum moss after 1–3 growing seasons.

1835: Remove upper layer of peat/soil (before planting)
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
The upper layer of soil/peat (and any vegetation on it) could be removed from damaged peatlands, creating a new surface of bare peat for introducing vegetation with fewer nutrients, no undesirable seed bank, and often wetter and less acidic peat since the surface is closer to the water table (Grootjans et al. 2002). Clearing surface peat could also remove a hard crust or loose peat through which water cannot easily rise to the plants above.
Caution: Soil stripping may be unsuitable for wetter peatlands as heavy machinery involved may churn and compress the peat soil. Stripping surface peat from bogs may expose fen peat, which has different chemical properties to bog peat and will not (in the short term) support bog vegetation (Lindsay & Clough 2016).
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: remove surface peat/soil without introducing vegetation; reprofiling/relandscaping, e.g. building ridges or embankments, before planting; bury surface peat/soil before planting.

1836: Bury upper layer of peat/soil (before planting)
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
The upper layer of soil or peat (and any vegetation on it) from damaged peatlands could be buried under deeper peat layers, for instance by deep ploughing. Burial can create bare peat with spaces for introduced plants to grow, prevent undesirable plants from growing from seeds already in the soil, and remove excess nutrients that favour growth of undesirable weedy plants (Glen et al. 2017). Inverting, rather than removing, the upper soil layer maintains the ground level.
Caution: Soil burial may be unsuitable for wetter peatlands as heavy machinery involved may churn and compress the peat soil. Burying surface peat from bogs may expose fen peat, which has different chemical properties to bog peat and will not (in the short term) support bog vegetation (Lindsay & Clough 2016).

1837: Add fresh peat to peatland (before planting)
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Fresh ground or ‘milled’ peat could be added to the surface of peatlands before introducing vegetation. The fresh peat could provide a better substrate for plant growth: covering any dry crust on the degraded peatland and providing a fine substrate for rooting. Added peat can also be used to smooth over the peatland surface (removing raised areas or depressions that might be too dry or wet for peatland plant growth), modify the water level to which introduced vegetation is exposed (e.g. to avoid winter flooding), or create a buffer between polluted peat and the surface where plants are introduced (Rezanezhad et al. 2012). Finally, the fresh peat may contain extra nutrients to give plants an initial boost.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: introduce seeds of peatland herbs or shrubs/trees, including addition of smaller amounts of soil to introduce the seeds/spores within.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Sphagnum fragments can be encapsulated in gel beads or a suspended in a gel slurry (e.g. www.beadamoss.co.uk). The gel keeps the moss fragments moist and provides an initial food source. It may also make sowing easier and cheaper. After spreading, the gel eventually breaks down. Qualitative observations indicate that encapsulated fragments may survive for longer than loose fragments (Hinde et al. 2010). One study in the UK recorded fewer Sphagnum clumps in plots sown with beads than with loose fragments, but this compared different species sown at different densities (Rosenburgh 2015). We captured no direct quantitative comparisons of encapsulated and loose moss performance.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.

Many plants (including grasses, trees and shrubs) form mutually beneficial associations with fungi. The ‘mycorrhizal’ fungi live in or around plant roots. They can increase plant access to nutrients and minimise the effect of stresses such as drought and pollution (Finlay 2008). Adding these fungi to plants before they are introduced to peatlands could therefore help survival and growth. Fungi could be added via a root dip, or through adding spores to soil in the nursery.

This section considers the effects of education programmes, training courses or workshops, generally aimed at people who manage peatlands (landowners, land managers, local people). They may be about peatlands in general (e.g. their wildlife, their value to humans) or about management techniques (including sustainable land use practices). They may be specifically about peatland vegetation or about broader aspects of peatland ecosystems.
As an example, the ‘Bogathon’ and ‘Sphagathon’ programmes in the UK involved a range of land managers (from private estates, landowner organizations, conservation organizations and water companies) in discussions about the most desirable state for upland bogs and how to achieve it (BASC n.d.). In tropical peat swamps, blocking drainage canals can ultimately reduce fire risk, restore forest and create aquaculture ponds. Discussions with local people may alleviate concerns over the immediate loss of transport routes and ensure the blockages remain in place (Page et al. 2009).
Key peatland types for which this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: adopt voluntary agreements or pay landowners to protect peatlands, because these schemes are often linked with education or training; allow sustainable use of peatlands, possibly supported by education/training programmes.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects of peatland education/training programmes on knowledge, behaviour, peatland habitats or peatland vegetation. Both studies were in tropical peat swamps.
Behaviour change (2 studies): One study in peat swamps in Indonesia reported that over 3,500 households adopted sustainable farming practices following workshops about sustainable farming. One before-and-after study in peat swamps in Indonesia reported that a training course on rubber farming increased the quality of rubber produced by local farmers.

1849: Lobby, campaign or demonstrate to protect peatlands
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Lobbying or peaceful demonstrations could put pressure on projects that threaten peatlands, preventing them from occurring or minimizing their impact. This section considers campaigns targeted at organizations such as businesses or governments. Specific actions include demonstrating on site, writing letters and social media campaigns.
The Peatlands Campaign Consortium was formed in 1990 by 10 UK conservation organizations. Its overall aim was to protect UK peatlands of conservation importance, with a focus on (a) on reducing peat extraction and use and (b) raising awareness of the importance of peatlands and the threats they face. Campaigning involved meetings with businesses, parliamentary debates, publishing reports and leaflets, organizing seminars, establishing a National Bog Day and placing education volunteers in garden centres (Rawcliffe 1998).
Key peatland types for which this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: raise public awareness about peatlands.
Rawcliffe P. (1998) Environmental Pressure Groups in Transition. Manchester University Press, Manchester and New York.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects of lobbying/campaigning/demonstrating for peatland protection on knowledge, behaviour, peatland habitats or peatland vegetation. Both studies reported effects, on unspecified peatlands, of the same campaign in the UK.
Peatland protection (2 studies): Two studies in the UK reported that the area of protected peatland increased following pressure from a campaign group.
Behaviour change (1 study): One study in the UK reported that following pressure from a campaign group, major retailers stopped buying compost containing peat from important peatland areas and horticultural companies began marketing peat-free compost.
Attitudes/awareness (1 study): One study in the UK reported that following campaign pressure, garden centres and local governments signed peatland conservation agreements.

1856: Adopt zero burning policies near peatlands
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Fire is used, especially in tropical peatlands, to clear vegetation and prepare land for farming. If this fire is not controlled, it can spread to natural peatlands (Cattau et al. 2016). Land managers could adopt a zero burning policy in order to reduce the risk of fire escape. Procedures could involve cutting and shredding waste vegetation, then leaving it on site to decompose rather than burning it (Adinugroho et al. 2011). Zero burning policies have been adopted at the national level, and sometimes written into law, by members of the Association of South East Asian Nations (Adinugroho et al. 2011). Some large plantation companies have also adopted zero burning policies (Page & Hooijer 2016).
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: clear/remove vegetation to prevent wild fire; rewet peat to prevent wild fire; increase ‘on the ground’ protection, including fire fighting teams; education and awareness-raising to prevent wild fire.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on peatland vegetation, of adopting zero burning policies near peatlands.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.

1859: Irrigate peatland (without planting)
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
To avoid desiccation of vegetation on the surface of peatlands, irrigation systems such as sprinklers could be used (Rochefort & Bastien 1998). Water could be recirculated from drainage ditches or ponds on the peatland. Irrigation would maintain a damp peat surface. Irrigation can be expensive so may be best used as a short-term intervention to kick-start restoration.
Caution: A suitable water source, with the right level of nutrients and acidity/alkalinity, must be chosen to avoid altering chemical conditions on the peatland (Lamers et al. 2002). For example, bogs should only be irrigated with water stored on the bog, not ground water. Taking water for irrigation might reduce water levels in neighbouring wetlands.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: rewet peatlands by raising the water table rather than irrigating the surface; irrigation to complement planting.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects of irrigation (without planting) on peatland vegetation. One study was in a bog and one was in a fen.
Vegetation cover (2 studies): One replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in a bog in Canada found that irrigation increased the number of Sphagnum moss shoots present after one growing season, but had no effect after two. One before-and-after study in Germany reported that an irrigated fen was colonized by wetland- and fen-characteristic herbs, whilst cover of dryland grasses decreased.

1860: Exclude wild herbivores using physical barriers
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Herbivores are animals that eat plants. Wild herbivores on temperate peatlands include deer, rabbits, hares, kangaroos, feral horses, feral pigs, grouse and slugs. Insects, monkeys and other large mammals are important herbivores in tropical peat swamps. Herbivores can damage peatland vegetation directly, by eating it. Herbivores can also have indirect effects on peatland vegetation. Large animals can trample and compact peat. Beavers, introduced to Tierra del Fuego, can flood existing peatlands when they build dams or drain peatlands through channels formed when dams fail (Grootjans et al. 2014). Wild herbivores could be physically excluded from pristine peatlands to prevent damage, or from damaged peatlands to let them recover.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: exclude or remove domestic livestock, which may be the dominant herbivores on peatlands; use fences or barriers specifically to protect planted/sown peatland plants.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on peatland vegetation of physically excluding wild herbivores. The study was in a fen meadow.
Vegetation cover (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in a fen meadow in Poland reported that the effect of boar- and deer exclusion on vascular plant and moss cover depended on other treatments applied to plots.
Vegetation structure (1 study): The same study reported that the effect of boar- and deer exclusion on total vegetation biomass depended on other treatments applied to plots.
Overall plant richness/diversity (1 study): The same study reported that the effect of boar- and deer exclusion on plant species richness depended on other treatments applied to plots.

1861: Control populations of wild herbivores
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Herbivores are animals that eat plants. Wild herbivores on temperate peatlands include deer, rabbits, hares, kangaroos, feral horses, feral pigs, grouse and slugs. Insects, monkeys and other large mammals are important herbivores in tropical peatlands. Herbivores can damage peatland vegetation directly, by eating it. Herbivores can also have indirect effects on peatland vegetation. Large animals can trample and compact peat. Beavers, introduced to Tierra del Fuego, can flood existing peatlands when they build dams or drain peatlands through channels formed when dams fail (Grootjans et al. 2014). Controlling herbivore populations (e.g. by trapping, shooting or applying pesticides) could reduce these impacts.
Caution: These actions might have negative side effects for the rest of the food chain (e.g. less food for predators of the controlled animals, accumulation of poisons in non-target animals) or could directly kill non-target animals.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: interventions to address the threat from domestic livestock, which may be the dominant herbivores on peatlands e.g. excluding livestock, changing type of livestock or changing timing of grazing.
