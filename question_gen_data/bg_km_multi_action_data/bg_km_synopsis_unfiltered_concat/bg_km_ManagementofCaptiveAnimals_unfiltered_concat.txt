1315: Primates: Scatter food throughout enclosure
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
More natural foraging conditions can be stimulated by scattering food throughout enclosures and hiding food in materials covering the flooring (e.g. straw) instead of in bowls or trays. The aim is to increase the amount of time that primates are active in captivity.
 

Key Messages:

Two replicated, before-and-after and one before-and-after study in the USA found that scattering food throughout the enclosure increased feeding and exploratory behaviours in rhesus macaques and reduced abnormal behaviours in chimpanzees and aggression in lemurs.
One before-and-after study in the USA found that when food was scattered throughout the enclosure more foraging was seen and activity levels increased in gorillas.

Background information and definitions:
Many primates are classed as fruit eaters, and so are provided with a diet with a high proportion of domestic fruits in captivity. Studies have shown this can lead to obesity, diabetes and dental disease (Plowman et al 2014). Domestic fruits have now been replaced with vegetable diets in many zoos, with subsequent reductions in obesity and dental conditions (Plowman et al 2014). The aim of this intervention is to reduce abnormal feeding behaviours, social tension and aggression within primates.

This behaviour; known as zoopharmacognosy, typically involves ingestion or topical application of plants, soils or insects in order to treat and prevent diseases. One of the first documented cases of self-medication was observed in wild chimpanzees (Wrangham 1983), where they were observed folding and swallowing Aspilia spp leaves without chewing them. These leaves have a rough and bristly surface which it is suggested helped the chimpanzees to expell parasitic worms from their digestive systems. Providing potentially medicinal plants as browse or growing in herb gardens may allow primates to self-medicate in captivity.

Many primate species feed in social groups in the wild but may be housed individually in captivity either routinely (e.g. in some laboratory contexts) or temporarily (e.g. for medical treatment). Time spent feeding and foraging as a group may be important for reinforcing social structures (Brennan & Anderson, 1998) and for the development of natural feeding behaviours in young animals (Lefebvre 1995). Captive primates can be fed in social groups or given visual access to animals in other enclosures, with the aim of allowing natural group dynamics and social learning of feeding behaviours.

Background information and definitions:
Wild primates have to forage over an area that can meet their energetic and nutritional needs.

For some species, breeding is seasonal and can be triggered by longer periods of sunlight. It may be possible to trigger breeding by simulating these cues within an enclosure.
In captivity, metabolic bone disease can be an issue in amphibians if the correct lighting is not used. It develops as a result of an imbalance of vitamin D3, phosphorous or calcium. Amphibians cannot process calcium without vitamin D, which is activated by ultraviolet light. If the correct lighting is not provided, animals can suffer from brittle or deformed bones. Health problems may affect reproduction in captive animals.

1871: Amphibians: Provide artificial aquifers for species which breed in upwelling springs
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Some amphibian species appear to breed underground in places where water flows up through rock fragments to form springs (aquifers). In captivity, artificial systems can be designed to replicate these upflows and may improve breeding success for cave-dwelling species.   

Key Messages:

One small study in the USA found that salamanders bred in an aquarium fitted with an artificial aquifer.

1872: Amphibians: Vary artificial rainfall to simulate seasonal changes in the wild
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
In some amphibian habitats, rainfall is highly seasonal with the onset of rain following a dry period signaling the start of the breeding season. It may be possible to trigger breeding by simulating these cues within an enclosure.

Key Messages:

Two replicated, before-and-after studies in Germany and Austria found that simulating a wet and dry season, as well as being moved to an enclosure with more egg laying sites and flowing water in Austria, stimulated breeding and egg deposition. In Germany, no toadlets survived past 142 days old.

1873: Amphibians: Provide multiple egg laying sites within an enclosure
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
A choice of egg laying sites may be offered which vary in humidity, temperature, water level or protection from predation. This can often be done by using inexpensive, readily accessible natural items. Mimicking an amphibian’s natural environment in captivity, to meet species specific needs, could help improve breeding success. 

Key Messages:

One replicated study in Australia found that frogs only bred once moved into an indoor enclosure which had various types of organic substrate, allowed temporary flooding, and enabled sex ratios to be manipulated along with playing recorded mating calls.
One small, replicated, before-and-after study in Fiji found that adding rotting logs and hollow bamboo pipes to an enclosure, as well as a variety of substrates, promoted egg laying in frogs.

1880: Amphibians: Separate sexes in non-breeding periods
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Many species of amphibian lead largely solitary lives during non-breeding periods in the wild but may be permanently housed in mixed-sex groups in captivity. In some species, burrows or nests are constructed before the breeding season. Separating the sexes outside of the breeding season allows the males or females time to construct these burrows. The timing of introducing the females to the males alongside could promote breeding.

Key Messages:

One replicated, before-and-after study in Australia found that clutch size of frogs increased when sexes were separated in the non-breeding periods, alongside providing female mate choice, playing recorded mating calls and allowing females to increase in weight before breeding.

1898: Amphibians: Use artificial cloning from frozen or fresh tissue
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Conservation breeding programmes are being used more frequently for threatened amphibian species. However, captive breeding often results in loss of genetic variation. This may mean that animals bred for release to the wild have reduced fitness. Freezing, or ‘cryopreservation’, of sperm and eggs or tissue, allows them to be stored until they are needed. Gene banks can therefore be created for amphibians ensuring that species’ genetic variation is preserved. It also means that the number of a particular species needed in captivity can be reduced and genes can be swapped between captive facilities. Cloning is the process whereby organisms are artificially produced with identical genetic material to the single ancestor from which a tissue sample has been preserved. This technique could be used to produce clones of individuals from threatened or even extinct amphibian species for use in captive breeding or reintroduction projects.

Key Messages:

No evidence was captured for the effects of using artificial cloning from frozen or fresh tissue.

1900: Carnivores: Feed commercially prepared diets
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Nutritional requirements of many exotic species are often unknown and therefore are commonly based on the nearest domestic relative. However, felids and canids typically eat many different parts of carcasses in the wild. Therefore, feeding a commercial diet may reduce the health risks to keepers and animals compared to handling raw meat but may not meet the nutritional needs of the animal. Identifying the digestibility and faecal or blood nutrient content may indicate the appropriateness of the diet in reference to the digestive health of the animal.

Key Messages:

One replicated, before-and-after study in the USA found that providing a commercial diet to maned wolves led to similar dry matter intake and digestibility despite having a lower protein content.
One replicated, randomized study of African wildcats in the USA found that feeding a commercial diet decreased crude protein digestibility and increased food intake and faecal output compared to raw meat. One controlled study of African wildcats in the USA found lower organic matter digestibility compared to a ground-chicken diet.
One replicated, controlled study in South Africa found that cheetahs fed a commercial diet had a similar likelihood of developing gastritis as those fed horse meat, lower levels of blood protein urea but higher levels of creatine. One study in USA found that cheetahs fed a commercial meat diet or whole chicken carcasses had plasma a-tocopherol, retinol and taurine concentrations within the ranges recommended for domestic cats.

1901: Carnivores: Feed whole carcasses (with or without organs/gastrointestinal tract)
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
For most carnivorous species, whole carcasses, including bones, skin and cartilage are a large part of their diet in the wild. These parts of the carcass help facilitate digestion of many species, including cheetahs [1]; they also include essential vitamins, minerals and amino acids which are not always present in commercial or meat only diets. Furthermore, carcasses require more manipulation before and whilst consuming, potentially allowing more natural feeding behaviours.

Key Messages:

Two replicated, before-and-after studies in the USA found that feeding whole carcasses reduced pacing levels in lions, leopards, snow leopards and cougars. However, it increased pacing in tigers.
One replicated, randomized, controlled study in Denmark found that when fed whole rabbit, cheetahs had lower blood protein urea, zinc and vitamin A levels compared to supplemented beef. One replicated before-and-after study in Denmark found that feeding whole rabbit showed lower levels of inflammatory bowel indicators in cheetahs.
One replicated, randomized study and one controlled study in the USA found that when fed whole 1 to 3 day old chickens, ocelots had lower digestible energy and fat compared to a commercial diet and African wildcats had had lower organic matter digestibility compared to a ground-chicken diet.

Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
In captivity, mental and physical stimulation can be unfulfilled due to the limiting environment. Many animals in captivity are fed unnatural food items that may inhibit the expression of appetitive behaviours, this can cause a deterioration in oral health and the expression of abnormal, repetitive behaviours as a coping mechanism. Providing items such as bones aims to promote natural foraging or gnawing behaviours.

Key Messages:

One replicated, before-and-after study in the USA and one replicated, controlled study in Finland found that the provision of bones decreased the frequency of stereotypic behaviours in lions, tigers and Arctic foxes.
Two replicated, before-and-after studies of felids and red foxes in the USA and Norway found that the provision of bones increased activity and manipulation time.

Background information and definitions:
Many captive, exotic animals are fed diets based on the nutritional requirements of their closest domestic relative. However, these diets for domestic animals are not always suitable for non-domestic species with different wild feeding behaviours. This can cause long-term health problems such as cystinuria, a metabolic defect in maned wolves.

Key Messages:

One replicated, randomized, controlled study and one replicated, controlled study in the USA found that a plant-derived protein diet increased digestible energy and dry matter digestibility but decreased mineral retention and plasma taurine levels in maned wolves compared to a (supplemented) animal-based protein diet.

Certain carbohydrates are beneficial for the growth of healthy bacteria in the gut. Strict carnivores consume connective tissues that have similar effects as these carbohydrates. However, these animal products are not always easy to obtain and can be unhygienic if animals refuse them in captive conditions. Therefore, a plant alternative aims to replicate the digestive functions of animal tissues in obligate carnivores.

Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
In the wild, a carnivore’s diet depends on the abundance and availability of prey. Therefore, many species do not feed every day. While it is not fully understood why captive animals perform stereotypic behaviours, it is thought they can be influenced by food restriction, causing appetitive behaviours that are deemed as repetitive and abnormal. In captivity, larger carnivore species are often fasted for one or more days per week with the aim of replicating natural feeding behaviour.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
The diets of many wild carnivores change across different seasons but this may not be reflected in their captive husbandry. There is evidence to suggest stereotypic behaviours in captivity can alter seasonally due to innate urges to mate and forage at different times of the year [1]. Not only this, weight management can also be an issue due to a lack of understanding of the yearly feeding ecology as well as food availability in each zoo [2]. Altering food type seasonally aims to maintain the health of the animal as well as encourage natural annual feeding cycles.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
In the wild, animals have a varied diet due to food abundance and availability. In captive environments, the same food is routinely given, with little variety. Essential amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins and minerals may not be provided in one type of feed. The aim of a varied diet is to supply an animal with all nutrients essential for health, growth and maintenance.

Key Messages:

No evidence was captured on the effect of increasing the variety of food items on captive carnivores.

1915: Carnivores: Hide food around enclosure
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
In the wild, many felids, canids and ursids have to forage for food which may be hidden or difficult to access. In captivity, food may be presented to the animal directly without any need for active searching. Enrichment, including hiding food, is aimed at promoting natural foraging behaviours and decreasing abnormal behaviours.

Key Messages:

Four replicated, before-and-after studies in the USA, UK and Germany and one before-and-after study of a black bear, leopard cats, bush dogs, maned wolves and Malayan sun bears found that hiding food increased exploring and foraging behaviours.
One replicated, before-and-after study and one before-and-after study in the USA found a decrease in stereotypical pacing in leopard cats and black bear.

1916: Carnivores: Provide food during visitor experiences
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Visitor experiences are increasingly popular events in zoos and give visitors the opportunity to get closer to animals in ways that would not normally be possible. These events often involve feeding the animals, including large carnivores. This may have a positive or negative affect on the health and welfare of the animal. For example, getting closer to the animals allows better health observations and positively reinforces the animals to remain relaxed around humans. However, excessive feeding can cause health problems and it is not always easy to monitor food intake, especially for animals living in social groups. Some species or individuals of the species may also find the close proximity to unfamiliar humans stressful. Also see background of the action "Alter feeding schedule according to visitor activity".

Key Messages:

No evidence was captured for the effects of feeding during visitor experiences on captive carnivores.

Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Predictability in feeding regimes has been linked to potential anticipatory behaviours such as pacing and higher levels of aggression. Varying the location of feeding may make the feeding routine less predictable and therefore reduce pacing and increase foraging behaviours.

Key Messages:

One replicated, before-and-after study in Ireland found that altering the location of food decreased pacing behaviours in cheetahs.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Feeding within a social group is natural for many species. For example, wolves have a strong social dynamic, and feeding behaviours reinforce social ranking. In captivity, animals may be housed individually either routinely (e.g. in some laboratory contexts) or temporarily (e.g. for medical treatment). 

Key Messages:

No evidence was captured for the effects of feeding individuals within a social group.

1921: Carnivores: Scatter food around enclosure
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
In the wild, many felids, canids and ursids have to forage for food over large areas whereas in captivity, food is often presented to animals directly without any need for active searching. Potentially, more natural foraging conditions can be simulated by scattering food throughout enclosures and hiding food in materials covering the floor (e.g. straw) for longer periods. Scatter feeds aim to increase foraging and exploratory behaviours potentially providing a more stimulating environment.

Key Messages:

One replicated, before-and-after study in Brazil found that scattered feeding increased locomotion in maned wolves.
One replicated study in Brazil found that maned wolves spent more time in the section of their enclosure with scattered food than in a section with food on a tray.
