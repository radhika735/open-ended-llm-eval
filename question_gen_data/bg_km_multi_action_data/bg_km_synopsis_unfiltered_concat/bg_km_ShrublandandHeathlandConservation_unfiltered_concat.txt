1545: Use fences to exclude livestock from shrublands
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Livestock grazing can alter shrubland habitats by changing plant structure, composition, and diversity (Alkemade et al 2013). High grazing pressure can reduce the cover of woody species in shrublands, leading to an increase in grass cover or unvegetated areas. Using fences to exclude livestock from shrublands could reduce the negative impacts of overgrazing.

Key Messages:
 

Two replicated, controlled, randomized studies (one of which was also a before-and-after trial) and one controlled before-and-after trial in the UK found that using fences to exclude livestock increased shrub cover or abundance. Two replicated, controlled, randomized studies in Germany and the UK found that using fences increased shrub biomass or the biomass and height of individual heather plants. Two controlled studies (one of which was a before-and-after study) in Denmark and the UK found that heather presence or cover was higher in fenced areas that in areas that were not fenced. However, one site comparison study in the USA found that using fences led to decreased cover of woody plants. Three replicated, controlled studies (one of which was a before and after study) in the USA and the UK found that fencing either had a mixed effect on shrub cover or did not alter shrub cover.
One randomized, replicated, controlled, paired study in the UK found that using fences to exclude livestock did not alter the number of plant species, but did increase vegetation height and biomass. One controlled, before-and-after study in the UK found that fenced areas had lower species richness than unfenced areas.
One randomized, replicated, controlled, before-and-after trial in the UK and one site comparison study in the USA found that using fences to exclude livestock led to a decline in grass cover. However, four controlled studies (one of which a before-and-after trial) in the USA, the UK, and Finland found that using fences did not alter cover of grass species. One site comparison study in the USA and one replicated, controlled study in the UK recorded an increase in grass cover.
One controlled study in Finland found that using fences to exclude livestock did not alter the abundance of herb species and one site comparison in the USA found no difference in forb cover between fenced and unfenced areas. One replicated, controlled study in the USA found fencing had a mixed effect on herb cover.

1607: Reduce number of livestock
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Reducing grazing intensity by reducing livestock numbers may allow plants to grow taller and allow species that cannot tolerate heavy grazing to grow.

Key Messages:

Two before-and-after trials in the UK and South Africa and one replicated, controlled study in the UK found that the reducing or stopping grazing increased the abundance or cover of shrubs. Two site comparison studies in the UK found that cover of common heather declined in sites with high livestock density, but increased in sites with low livestock density. One site comparison study in the Netherlands found that dwarf shrub cover was higher in ungrazed sites. One replicated, randomized, before-and-after study in Spain found that reducing grazing increased the cover of western gorse. One randomized, controlled trial and one before-and-after trial in the USA found that stopping grazing did not increase shrub abundance. One site comparison study in France found that ungrazed sites had higher cover of ericaceous shrubs, but lower cover of non-ericaceous shrubs than grazed sites. One site comparison study in the UK found that reducing grazing had mixed effects on shrub cover.
One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK found that reducing grazing increased vegetation height. However, one replicated, controlled, paired site, site comparison study in the UK found that reducing grazing led to a reduction in the height of heather plants.
Two site comparison studies in France and the Netherlands found that ungrazed sites had a lower number of plant species than grazed sites. One replicated, controlled, paired, site comparison study in Namibia and South Africa found that reducing livestock numbers increased plant cover and the number of plant species.
One controlled study in Israel found that reducing grazing increased plant biomass. However, one randomized, site comparison on the island of Gomera, Spain found that reducing grazing did not increase plant cover and one replicated, controlled study in the UK found that the number of plant species did not change .
One replicated, controlled study in the UK found no change in the cover of rush or herbaceous species as a result of a reduction in grazing. Two site comparison studies in France and the Netherlands found that grass cover and sedge cover were lower in ungrazed sites than in grazed sites. One randomized, controlled study in the USA found a mixed effect of reducing grazing on grass cover.

1608: Change type of livestock
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Changing the type of livestock that graze in shrublands may help to reduce grazing pressure on particular plant species that were previously damaged by overgrazing, thereby allowing recovery of populations of these plants. Changes in the type of livestock may also lead to changes in the structure of the community, such as the height of plants.

Key Messages:

Two replicated, before-and-after studies and one controlled study in Spain and the UK found changing the type of livestock led to mixed effects on shrub cover. However, in two of these studies changing the type of livestock reduced the cover of herbaceous species.
One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the UK found that grazing with both cattle and sheep, as opposed to grazing with sheep, reduced cover of purple moor grass, but had no effect on four other plant species.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Planting spiny shrubs in sensitive shrubland areas may help to reduce access by people therefore reducing negative impacts such as trampling. However, planting of some spiny plants, such as cacti can result in spread of invasive species (Essl & Kobler 2009; Novoa et al. 2015). As such any use of this intervention should first assess the potential risks associated with introducing spiny plants, particularly if they are not-native to the region of interest.

Cutting of ‘firebreaks’ creates gaps in shrublands that can act as a barrier to slow or stop the spread of fire. These firebreaks are commonly used to protect human property and life, rather than to benefit biodiversity. For the purposes of this synopsis we only considered studies that examined the effect of firebreaks that were explicitly cut to protect shrubland biodiversity. In addition, many of the studies of the effect of firebreaks are not empirical, and use modelling approaches to assess their effects on the spread of fire and effects on biodiversity (e.g. Cary et al. 2009, Taylor et al. 2013).

1627: Use cutting/mowing to mimic grazing
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Many shrublands depend on disturbances such as grazing to reduce succession that leads to an increase in woody plant species and conversion to forest. In addition, grazing may help to maintain plant diversity and the populations of plant species that depend on disturbance. However, in some cases grazing by livestock may no longer be economically viable and so cutting or mowing have been used to replace it. This cutting may be able to limit the growth of woody species and invasion of trees.

Key Messages:

One systematic review of three studies in lowland heathland in North Western Europe found that mowing did not alter heather abundance relative to grass abundance. A site comparison in Italy found that mowing increased heather cover. Two replicated, randomized, before-and-after trials in Spain (one of which was controlled) found that using cutting to mimic grazing reduced heather cover.
One replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after trial in Spain found that cutting increased the number of plant species. However, a replicated, randomized, before-and-after trial found that the number of plant species only increased in a minority of cases.

Background information and definitions:
Many shrublands depend on disturbances such as grazing to reduce succession that leads to an increase in woody plant species and conversion to forest. However, in many cases grazing by livestock has declined as it is no longer economically viable. Reintroduction of livestock may help to reduce the number of woody species in a shrubland and reduce the possibility of succession to forest.

Key Messages:

One site comparison in France found that areas grazed by cattle had higher cover of non-ericaceous shrubs, but lower cover of ericaceous shrubs. One before-and-after study in the Netherlands found that increasing the number of livestock resulted in an increase in the number of common heather and cross-leaved heath seedlings. One randomized, replicated, paired, controlled study in the USA found that increasing the number of livestock did not alter shrub cover. One replicated, site comparison study and one before-and-after study in the UK and Netherlands found that increasing grazing had mixed effects on shrub and heather cover.
Three site comparisons in France, the Netherlands and Greece found that grazed areas had a higher number of plant species than ungrazed areas. One before-and-after study in Belgium found that the number of plant species did not change after the introduction of grazing. One replicated, before-and-after study in the Netherlands found a decrease in the number of plant species.
One before-and-after study in the Netherlands found that increasing the number of livestock resulted in a decrease in vegetation height. One replicated, before-and-after trial in France found that grazing to control native woody species increased vegetation cover in one of five sites but did not increase vegetation cover in four of five sites.
A systematic review of four studies in North Western Europe found that increased grazing intensity increased the cover of grass species, relative to heather species. One before-and-after study and two site comparisons in the Netherlands and France found areas with high livestock density had higher grass and sedge cover than ungrazed areas. One randomized, replicated, paired, controlled study in the USA found that increasing the number of livestock reduced grass and herb cover. One before-and-after study in Spain found that increasing the number of ponies in a heathland site reduced grass height. One replicated, site comparison in the UK and one replicated before-and-after study in the Netherlands found that increasing cattle had mixed effects on grass and herbaceous species.

1727: Disturb vegetation
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Disturbing vegetation reduces ground cover, allowing more light to reach the ground, and potentially increasing the germination of shrubland species.

Key Messages:

One randomized, replicated, controlled study in the UK found that vegetation disturbance did not increase the abundance or species richness of specialist plants but increased the abundance of generalist plants.

1728: Disturb topsoil
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Disturbing soil reduces ground cover, allowing more light to reach the ground, as well as potentially bringing any shrubland seeds to the surface. This may help to increase the germination of the seeds of shrubland species.

Key Messages:

A controlled study in a former pine plantation in South Africa found that digging soil did not alter vegetation cover or the density of native plants.
One randomized, replicated, controlled study in the UK found that soil disturbance increased the abundance or species richness of specialist and generalist plant species.

1857: Add topsoil (alongside planting/seeding)
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Adding topsoil from shrublands to degraded shrubland sites may help to increase the number of seeds in the soil, thereby increasing the probability of shrubland plants becoming established. The addition of topsoil may also help to increase soil fertility or reduce the effects of processes that dramatically alter soil structure, such as mining or quarrying. Combined with planting or seeding addition of topsoil may help to increase germination and survival of shrubland plants.

Key Messages:

One randomized, replicated, paired, controlled study in the USA found that addition of topsoil alongside sowing of seed increased the biomass of grasses but reduced the biomass of forbs in comparison to addition of topsoil alone.
