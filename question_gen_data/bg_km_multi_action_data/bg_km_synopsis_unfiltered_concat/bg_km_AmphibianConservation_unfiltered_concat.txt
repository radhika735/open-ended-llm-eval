746: Exclude domestic animals or wild hogs by fencing
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be ineffective or harmful
Background information and definitions:
Livestock grazing can have significant effects on aquatic habitats through disturbance, trampling, erosion, reduced water quality and changes in vegetation structure and composition. Such changes may have detrimental effects on amphibian populations. However, grazing can also have beneficial effects on amphibians and their habitats. For example, a study found that three years after excluding livestock grazing by fencing, ungrazed temporary pools dried 50 days earlier than grazed pools (Pyke & Marty 2005). Other studies investigating the effects of grazing on amphibians are discussed in ‘Manage grazing regime’.
Pyke C.R. & Marty J. (2005) Cattle grazing mediates climate change impacts on ephemeral wetlands. Conservation Biology, 19, 1619–1625.

Key Messages:

Three replicated, site comparison studies in the USA found that excluding livestock from streams or ponds did not increase numbers of amphibian species or overall abundance, but did increase larval abundance and abundance of green frog metamorphs. Two studies found that the abundance of green frogs and/or American toads was higher with grazing.
One randomized, replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that excluding cattle from ponds did not increase numbers of eggs or larval survival of Columbia spotted frogs. One before-and-after study in the UK found that pond restoration that included livestock exclusion increased pond use by breeding natterjack toads.

747: Retain riparian buffer strips during timber harvest
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Retaining forest strips along water courses or around ponds during timber harvest can help mitigate the effects of habitat loss and disturbance for forest species. They can also help sustain the microclimate and reduce potential problems such as soil erosion. Retained habitat strips also provide corridors for dispersal.
 

Key Messages:

Twelve studies investigated the effectiveness of retaining buffer strips during timber harvest for amphibians.
Six replicated and/or controlled studies in Canada and the USA compared amphibian numbers following clearcutting with or without riparian buffer strips. Five found mixed effects on abundance depending on species and buffer width. One found that amphibian abundance was significantly higher with buffers.
Eleven studies, including 10 replicated and/or controlled studies in Canada and the USA and one meta-analysis, compared amphibian numbers in forest with riparian buffers retained during harvest to unharvested forest. Six found mixed effects depending on species or volume of existing downed wood. Four found that abundance and species composition were similar to unharvested forest. Two found that numbers of species and abundance were lower than in unharvested forest.
Two of four replicated studies (including one randomized, controlled, before-and-after study) in Canada and the USA found that numbers of amphibian species and abundance were greater in wider riparian buffer strips. Two found that there was no difference in abundance in buffers of different widths.

748: Add lime to water bodies to reduce acidification
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Water bodies can become acidified from atmospheric pollution that includes sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, which fall as acid rain. Polluted water, from mines for example, can also enter water bodies changing the acidity. This can have significant effects on amphibian abundance, diversity and reproduction (Leuven et al. 1986). Adding lime (calcium and magnesium-rich minerals) to water bodies can help reduce acidity.

Key Messages:

One before-and-after study in the UK found that adding limestone to ponds resulted in establishment of one of three translocated populations of natterjack toads. One replicated, site comparison study in the UK found that species-specific habitat management that included adding limestone to ponds increased natterjack toad populations.
One before-and-after study in the UK found that adding limestone to ponds temporarily increased breeding by natterjack toads. Three before-and-after studies (including one controlled, replicated study) in the Netherlands and UK found that adding limestone increased larval and/or egg survival of moor frogs and common frogs and resulted in metamorphosis of natterjack toads at two of three sites.
Two before-and-after studies (including one controlled study) in the UK found that adding limestone to ponds resulted in high tadpole mortality and pond abandonment by natterjack toads and higher numbers of abnormal common frog eggs.

749: Manage ditches
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Intensification of agricultural and other land management can result in loss of ditch biodiversity through activities such as mowing, grazing and use of fertilizer and pesticides leading to water pollution. These can have significant effects on amphibian populations. Ditch management practices such the frequency, season and technique used to clean or dredge ditches have also been found to affect the presence of amphibians (Twisk et al. 2000). Management practices that maintain and increase species diversity should therefore be encouraged.

Key Messages:

One controlled, before-and-after study in the UK found that managing ditches increased common toad numbers.
One replicated, site comparison study in the Netherlands found that numbers of amphibian species and abundance was significantly higher in ditches managed under agri-environment schemes compared to those managed conventionally.

755: Artificially mist habitat to keep it damp
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Reduction in river flow due to activities such as the implementation of hydropower projects can have significant effects on wetland habitats and the amphibians they support. In cases where alternative habitat is not available, intensive management may be undertaken to recreate natural habitats in attempt to conserve particular species. For example, the wetland habitat in the study described below was the only known habitat for the Kihansi spray toad Nectophrynoides asperginis.
 

Key Messages:

One before-and-after study in Tanzania found that installing a sprinkler system to mitigate against a 90% reduction of river flow did not maintain a population of Kihansi spray toads.

756: Install barrier fencing along roads
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Traffic on roads can cause significant mortality of amphibian populations. Barriers can be installed at migration points along roads to try to reduce mortality. These are usually installed in association with underpasses. Studies investigating the use of under road wildlife passages, many of which had barrier fencing are discussed in ‘Install culverts or tunnels as road crossings’.
 

Key Messages:

Seven of eight studies (including one replicated and two controlled studies) in Germany, Canada and the USA found that barrier fencing with culverts decreased amphibian road deaths, or decreased deaths provided that the fence length and material were effective. One found that low numbers of amphibians were diverted by barriers during breeding migrations.
One replicated study in the USA found that barriers at least 0.6 m high were required to prevent green frogs and leopard frogs climbing over. Two studies in the Netherlands and USA found that treefrogs and 10% of common toads climbed over barrier fencing during breeding migrations.

758: Remove tree canopy to reduce pond shading
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Shading of ponds by tree canopies reduces water temperature, affects plant communities and can result in chemical changes resulting from the decomposition of increased leaf litter. Such changes can affect amphibian populations. For example, warm ponds are more favourable for amphibian growth and development.
Studies in which tree canopies were removed as one of a combination of interventions for the restoration of ponds are discussed in ‘Restore ponds’.
 

Key Messages:

One before-and-after study in Denmark found that translocated garlic toads established breeding populations following pond restoration that included canopy removal.
One before-and-after study in the USA found that canopy removal did not increase hatching success of spotted salamanders.

759: Create artificial hibernacula or aestivation sites
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Amphibians need damp sheltered places for overwintering or aestivating during hot arid summers. Overwintering or aestivating sites, or ‘hibernacula’, can be created for amphibians where natural sites are limited or where these habitats have been lost, for example at newly restored sites or in gardens.
Other studies investigating the creation of shelter habitat are discussed in ‘Create refuges’ and ‘Biological resource use - Leave coarse woody debris in forests’.
 
 

Key Messages:

One replicated, before-and-after study in the UK found that providing artificial hibernacula, along with other terrestrial habitat management, maintained populations of great crested newts.
One replicated study in the UK found that created hibernacula were used by common frog and smooth newts, but not great crested newts. One replicated study in the UK found four amphibian species close to hibernacula at two of three sites.

Background information and definitions:
Projects in which volunteers are engaged to collect data on amphibians help to raise awareness and change public perceptions and may therefore have an indirect effect on the conservation of species.

Key Messages:

Five studies in Canada, the UK and USA found that amphibian data collection projects engaged 100–10,506 volunteers and were active in 16–17 states in the USA.
Five studies in the UK and USA found that volunteers undertook 412 surveys, surveyed 121–7,872 sites, swabbed almost 6,000 amphibians and submitted thousands of amphibian records.

761: Clear vegetation
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Vegetation can be removed to prevent natural succession where specific habitat types are desired, or where invasive species are out-competing native species for example.
Studies that used fire or removed vegetation in forest are discussed in ‘Threat: Natural system modifications – Use prescribed burning’, ‘Use herbicides to control mid-storey or ground vegetation’ and ‘Mechanically remove mid-storey or ground vegetation’.
Studies that investigated the effect of removing aquatic plants are discussed in ‘Habitat restoration and creation – Remove specific aquatic plants’, ‘Threat: Invasive alien and other problematic species – Control invasive plants’ and as one of a combiniation of restoration management actions in ‘Habitat restoration and creation – Restore wetland’ and ‘Restore ponds’.
 

Key Messages:

Six studies (including four replicated studies) in Australia, Estonia and the UK found that vegetation clearance, along with other habitat management and in some cases release of animals, increased numbers of frog species, or increased, stabilized or maintained populations of natterjack toads. One before-and-after study in the UK found that vegetation clearance, along with other habitat management, maintained a population of great crested newts for the first six years, but not in the longer term.
One before-and-after study in England found that vegetation clearance, resulted in increased occupancy by natterjack toads.

762: Add salt to ponds to reduce chytridiomycosis
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
The chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis has been found to survive in lake water for seven weeks after introduction (Johnson & Speare 2003). Treating the aquatic environment may help to reduce the effect of the disease on amphibians. Salt is often used for fungal diseases in aquaculture and for veterinary treatments of fish and amphibians (Wright & Whitaker 2001; Mifsud & Rowland 2008) and has been found to kill the chytrid fungus (Johnson et al. 2003).

763: Use antibacterial treatment to reduce chytridiomycosis infection
Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Effective treatments for chytridiomycosis, caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, are vital to ensure the success of amphibian captive-breeding programmes. They are also required to reduce the risk of spreading the disease when animals are moved between breeding facilities, released or translocated between field sites.
 

Key Messages:

Two studies (including one randomized, replicated, controlled study) in New Zealand and Australia found that treatment with chloramphenicol antibiotic ointment (Bishop et al. 2009) or solution, with other interventions in some cases, cured green tree frogs and one Archey’s frog of chytridiomycosis.
One replicated, controlled study found that treatment with trimethoprim-sulfadiazine increased survival time but did not cure blue-and-yellow poison dart frogs of chytridiomycosis.

764: Use antifungal skin bacteria or peptides to reduce chytridiomycosis infection
Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
The chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis infects the outer layer of amphibian skin. A number of bacterial species of amphibian skin have been found to inhibit the chytrid fungus in experiments (e.g. Harris et al. 2006; Becker et al. 2010; Lam et al. 2011). There is also some evidence that anti-microbial peptides, which are secreted into mucus and thought to help protect against colonization by skin pathogens, may provide some resistance to chytrid infections (e.g. Pask et al. 2012; 2013). It is therefore possible that adding such anti-fungal species or peptides to amphibian skin or to their environment may reduce the effects of the disease.

Key Messages:

Three of four randomized, replicated, controlled studies in the USA found that adding antifungal bacteria to the skin of salamanders or frogs exposed to the chytrid fungus did not reduce chytridiomycosis infection rate or death. One found that adding antifungal bacteria to frogs prevented infection and death. One randomized, replicated, controlled study in the USA found that adding antifungal skin bacteria to soil significantly reduced chytridiomycosis infection rate of red-backed salamanders. 
One randomized, replicated, controlled study in Switzerland found that treatment with antimicrobial skin peptides before or after infection with chytridiomycosis did not significantly increase survival of common toads.
Three randomized, replicated, controlled studies in the USA found that adding antifungal skin bacteria to chytrid infected amphibians reduced weight loss.

765: Immunize amphibians against chytridiomycosis infection
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Chytridiomycosis infection often spreads rapidly once it has been introduced to amphibian populations, causing mass mortality and population declines. However, some species of amphibians appear to be resistant to developing the disease if they have previously been exposed to the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Hanselmann et al. 2004). This suggests that it may be possible to reduce infection by injecting animals with dead chytrid fungus to stimulate a protective immune response.

768: Sterilize equipment when moving between amphibian sites
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
The movement of field biologists increases the risk of spreading wildlife diseases such as the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. For example, the chytrid fungus has been found to survive in lake water for seven weeks and tap water for three weeks after introduction (Johnson & Speare 2003). Precautions therefore need to be taken to reduce the risk of spreading diseases between sites and populations. This is also the case within and between captive populations.
We found no evidence for the effects of sterilizing equipment when moving between amphibian sites on the spread of disease between amphibian populations. The studies captured here examine the effect of different types of disinfectants on amphibians.
There is additional literature examining the effectiveness of using a range of disinfectants to kill the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. Most chemicals killed 100% of chytrid zoospores when used at certain concentrations (e.g. sodium chloride, household bleach, potassium permanganate, formaldehyde solution, Path-XTM agricultural disinfectant, quaternary ammonium compound 128, Dithane, Virkon, ethanol and benzalkonium chloride; Johnson et al. 2003; Webb et al. 2007). Complete drying of the fungus or heating above 37°C for at least four hours also resulted in 100% mortality (Johnson et al. 2003).

Background information and definitions:
Precautions need to be taken to reduce the risk of spreading diseases such as chytridiomycosis between amphibian individuals, populations and habitats. One way to minimize the risk is to wear disposable gloves when handling individual amphibians.
We found no evidence for the effects of using gloves on the spread of disease between amphibian populations. The studies captured here investigate the effect of different types of gloves on amphibians.
There is additional literature examining the effectiveness of disposable gloves acting as a fungicide on the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. For example one study found that nitrile gloves (and bare hands), but not latex, polyethylene or vinyl gloves were effective in killing the chytrid fungus (Mendez et al. 2008).

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of using gloves on the spread of disease between amphibian populations or individuals. 
A review for Canada and the USA found that there were no adverse effects of handling 22 amphibian species using disposable gloves. However, three replicated studies (including one controlled study) in Australia and Austria found that deaths of tadpoles were caused by latex gloves for all four species tested, by vinyl gloves for three of five species and by nitrile gloves for the one species tested.

Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Treatment of chytridiomycosis is vital to ensure the success of amphibian captive-breeding programmes. Also to reduce the risk of spreading the disease when animals are moved between captive or wild populations.
The chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis is very sensitive to temperatures above 32°C. At 37°C the fungus is killed within four hours and at 47°C within 30 minutes (Young et al. 2007). A study found that the probability of infection by chytrid in the wild decreased strongly with increasing time spent with body temperatures above 25°C in three frog species (Rowley & Alford 2013). A study in captivity also found that fewer frogs became infected and died when exposed to the chytrid fungus if they were housed at 27°C rather than 17°C or 23°C (50 vs 100% mortality; Berger et al. 2004). Increasing temperatures within amphibian housing may therefore provide a treatment for chytridiomycosis.

772: Create refuges
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Refuge habitats can provide amphibians with microclimates to keep them at the correct temperature and prevent them from dehydrating and can protect them from predation. Many amphibians seek shelter in rocks, logs or other refuges created by tree falls and other disturbances. Refuges can be created for amphibians where natural shelter habitat is limited, or to replace these habitats where they have been lost.
Other studies investigating the creation of shelter habitat are discussed in ‘Create artificial hibernacula or aestivation sites’ and ‘Biological resource use – Leave coarse woody debris in forests’.
 

Key Messages:

Two replicated, controlled studies (including one randomized study) in the USA and Indonesia found that adding coarse woody debris to forest floors had no effect on the number of amphibian species or overall abundance, but had mixed effects on abundance of individual species. One before-and-after study in Australia found that restoration that included reintroducing coarse woody debris to the forest floor increased frog species.
One replicated, before-and-after study in the UK found that creating refugia for great crested newts, along with other interventions, maintained four populations.

777: Engage landowners and other volunteers to manage land for amphibians 
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Only 11.5 % of the world’s land surface is protected (Rodrigues et al. 2004). This means that it is vital to engage effectively with landowners so that they manage their land in ways that help to maintain amphibian populations. Volunteers can make a valuable contribution to the management of habitats for amphibians, on private and public land. In some cases the long-term success of habitat management can depend on the involvement of local people.
As well as the direct effects from habitat restoration, volunteer programmes help raise awareness about amphibians and the threats that they face. For example, a study found that participants with high levels of engagement in conservation projects learned more (Evely et al. 2011). For interventions that involve engaging volunteers to help manage or monitor amphibian populations see ‘Threat: Transportation and service corridors – Use humans to assist migrating amphibians across roads’ and ‘Education and awareness raising – Engage volunteers to collect amphibian data’.

779: Legal protection of species
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Legal protection can be given to species on a national or international scale. Levels of protection vary for species and may include protection against killing, capturing, disturbing or trading, or damaging or destroying their breeding sites or resting places. Depending on the level of protection, activities such as development that are likely to affect protected species in these ways may be against the law and require licences from a government licensing authority.
Other studies that discuss legal protection of species are included in ‘Threat: Biological resource use – Use legislative regulation to protect wild populations’.
 

Key Messages:

Three reviews (including one systematic review) in the Netherlands and UK (Bosman et al. 2011, Spitzen-van der Sluijs et al. 2011, Lewis 2012) found that legal protection of amphibian species was not effective at protecting populations during development.
Two reviews in the UK (Edgar et al. 2005, Lewis 2012) found that the number of great crested newt mitigation licences issued over 10 years increased to over 600 in England and Wales.

780: Manage grazing regime
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Livestock grazing changes habitats in a number of ways such as reducing vegetation height, changing plant diversity, creating openings for seed growth and preventing reed and shrub growth. Such changes can have beneficial or detrimental effects on amphibian populations, depending on the amphibian species, grazing intensity and timing.
For an intervention that aims to reduce the detrimental effects of grazing see ‘Exclude domestic animals or wild hogs by fencing’.
 

Key Messages:

One replicated, controlled study in the UK found that grazed plots did not have higher abundance of natterjack toads than ungrazed plots and had lower abundance of common toads. Five studies (including four replicated studies) in Denmark, Estonia and the UK found that habitat management that included reintroduction of grazing increased green toad populations, maintained or increased natterjack toad populations and maintained common toad populations. 
One before-and-after study in the USA found that the decline in amphibian species was similar under traditional season-long or intensive-early cattle stocking.

781: Mechanically remove mid-storey or ground vegetation
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Removing vegetation can be used as a substitute for prescribed fire to eliminate competing mid-storey or ground vegetation. Although this technique does not have the multiple ecosystem functions provided by fire, it has advantages, such as increased selectivity and decreased risk of offsite fire damage.
Other studies that control mid-storey or ground vegetation are discussed in ‘Use herbicides to control mid-storey or ground vegetation’.
 

Key Messages:

One randomized, replicated, controlled study in the USA found that numbers of amphibian species, but not abundance, were significantly higher in plots with mechanical understory reduction compared to those without.

782: Modify gully pots and kerbs
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Gully pots along roadside kerbs form effective traps for amphibians. Animals crossing roads reach the kerb and often move along its base, until they fall into a gully pot. Once in the gully pot amphibians cannot climb out. A study found that 63% of 636 gully pots in two areas in Scotland contained wildlife, of which 91% were amphibians (1,087 animals; Muir 2012).
There are a number of ways in which the impact on amphibians could be reduced, such as moving gully pots, modifying the design of their grills, providing escape ladders or changing the shape of kerb stones (angled or indented).

784: Use humans to assist migrating amphibians across roads
Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Many amphibians are killed by vehicles, particularly where their annual migration routes between breeding and over-wintering habitats cross roads. In some areas local volunteers may try to reduce deaths by collecting animals and releasing them on the other side of the road. Temporary drift-fencing and pitfall traps are often used to capture amphibians so that they can be assisted across the road. Patrols often focus on migrations to breeding sites rather than migrations of adults and juveniles away from those sites.
Ideally evidence of the effectiveness of this intervention would consist of survival rates, counts of animals in the population or numbers killed on the road before and after or at sites with and without human assistance. However, such evidence is rarely available and so here we not only present data on population trends, but also numbers of animals that were moved across roads and numbers and effort of patrols assisting amphibians.
For other interventions that involve engaging volunteers to help manage amphibian populations or habitats see ‘Education and awareness raising – Raise awareness amongst the general public through campaigns and public information’ and ‘Engage landowners and volunteers to manage land for amphibians’.
 
 

Key Messages:

Two studies (including one replicated study) in Italy and the UK found that despite assisting toads across roads during breeding migrations, 64–70% of populations declined over 6–10 years.
One study in the UK  found that despite assisting toads across roads during breeding migrations, at 7% of sites over 500 toads were still killed on roads.
Five studies in Germany, the UK and Italy found that large numbers of amphibians were moved across roads by patrols. Numbers ranged from 7,532 toads moved before and after breeding to half a million moved during breeding migrations annually. In the UK, there were over 400 patrols and 71 patrols spent an average of 90 person-hours moving toads and had been active for up to 10 years.

801: Sterilize equipment to prevent ranavirus
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Ranavirus, sometimes known as ‘red-leg’, causes two forms of disease in amphibians, skin ulcers and internal bleeding. In some populations the virus causes mass mortality followed by population recovery, in others the disease is recurrent with long-term population declines of up to 80% (Teacher et al. 2010). Survival time of the virus outside a host is unknown and so equipment should be disinfected to prevent the spread of the disease.
There is additional literature examining the effectiveness of using a range of disinfectants to kill ranavirus. For example, a study found that chlorhexidine, household bleach and Virkon S, but not potassium permanganate, were effective at inactivating ranavirus when used at certain concentrations (Bryan et al. 2009).
Studies investigating prevention of the spead of chytridiomycosis are discussed in ‘Chytridiomycosis – Use gloves to handle amphibians’ and ‘Chytridiomycosis – Sterilize equipment when moving between amphibian sites’.

817: Deepen, de-silt or re-profile ponds
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
If ponds dry out, breeding habitat may be lost which could have a significant impact on amphibian populations. It may be possible to restore ponds by deepening or de-silting them. Re-profiling ponds can also make them more suitable for amphibians. Ponds should ideally contain a range of microhabitats, which can be achieved with a range of depths, an irregular shape and gently sloping sides to encourage a diversity of plants and invertebrates.
Studies that investigated the restoration of ponds using a combination of interventions including deepening, de-silting or re-profiling ponds are discussed in ‘Restore ponds’.
 

Key Messages:

Two before-and-after studies in France and Denmark found that pond deepening and enlarging or re-profiling resulted in the establishment of a breeding population of great crested newts or translocated garlic toads. Two studies (including one replicated, controlled study) in the UK and Denmark found that pond deepening and enlarging or dredging increased a population of common frogs or numbers of calling male tree frogs.
Four before-and-after studies in Denmark and the UK found that pond deepening, along with other interventions, maintained newt populations and increased populations of European fire-bellied toads or natterjack toads.

818: Pay farmers to cover the costs of conservation measures
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Agri-environment schemes are government or inter-governmental schemes designed to compensate farmers financially for changing agricultural practice to be more favourable to biodiversity and landscape. In Europe, agri-environment schemes are an integral part of the European Common Agricultural Policy and Member States devise their own agri-environment prescriptions to suit their agricultural economies and environmental contexts.
Financial incentives to undertake specific management actions with the aim of increasing biodiversity on farmland may also be provided by governmental departments or non-governmental organisations.
Payments to farmers can be provided for many different specific interventions, and where a study’s results can be clearly assigned to a specific intervention, they also appear in the appropriate section. This section includes evidence about the success of the actions for amphibian populations following payments.
 
 

Key Messages:

Three studies (including one replicated study) in Denmark, Sweden and Taiwan found that payments to farmers created amphibian breeding habitat or increased frog or toad populations. However, a second study in Taiwan found that payments did not maintain green tree frog habitat.
One replicated, site comparison study in the Netherlands found that ditches managed under agri-environment schemes had higher numbers of amphibian species and higher abundance than those managed conventionally.

820: Protect habitats for amphibians
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
The effectiveness of protecting areas for amphibian populations is rarely assessed. For example, since 2005, Conservation International and the Amphibian Specialist Group have partnered in the creation of 14 new protected areas in Africa, Asia and Latin  America. These cover 22,000 ha and support 55 Threatened or endemic amphibian species (Moore 2011). However, the effectiveness of these protected areas has not been monitored.
A modelling study of the distribution of endemic Mexican amphibians found that 65% of species may have less than 20% of their range protected and 20% are not protected by governmental Protected Areas (Ochoa-Ochoa et al. 2009). Private and community conservation areas were also found to play a role in protecting endemic Mexican species, with 73% of species represented within those areas (Ochoa-Ochoa et al. 2009). Another modelling study reported that the range of 50% of threatened amphibian species in Australia was not considered to be adequately covered by the protected area system (Watson et al. 2010).

822: Remove or control invasive Cuban tree frogs
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Invasive amphibians such as Cuban tree frogs Osteopilus septentrionalis can have significant impacts on native amphibian species if they compete for resources. For example, a study found that survival and growth rates of tadpoles of the dominant native species, southern toad Bufo terrestris, decreased significantly in the presence of Cuban tree frog tadpoles and that the invasive tadpoles became dominant (Smith 2006). The same study found that the effects of Cuban tree frogs on southern toads were reduced if predatory eastern newts were also present.

Background information and definitions:
Non-native plant species can be introduced into or naturally invade terrestrial habitat or water bodies, where they can out-compete native species altering the habitats. For example, in the UK swamp stonecrop Crassula helmsii can out-compete native plant species and form thick mats covering whole ponds. In parts of the USA, invasive reed canarygrass Phalaris arundinacea is widespread and develops dense, tall stands in shallow wetland habitats. Invasive water fern Azolla filiculoides has been found to cause declines in amphibian populations (Gratwicke & Marshall 2003) and Japanease knotweed Fallopia japonica to reduce foraging success of green frogs Rana clamitans (Maerz et al. 2005).

824: Reduce impact of amphibian trade
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Amphibians are traded for a number of reasons including consumption, the pet trade, for zoo animals and scientific purposes. For example, it was estimated that 15 million live, wild-caught amphibians entered the USA legally in 1998–2002, millions of which were for the pet trade (Schlaepfer et al. 2005). Removal of large numbers of amphibians from the wild can have significant effects on populations.
The movement of animals also increases the risk of spreading infectious diseases. For example, there is increasing evidence that trade is partly responsible for the recent spread of chytridiomycosis Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis and amphibian ranaviruses (e.g. Daszak et al. 2003; Gratwicke et al. 2009; Schloegel et al. 2009).

825: Remove or control invasive bullfrogs
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
The American bullfrog Rana catesbeiana has been introduced to many parts of the world. The species is relatively large and adaptable and has significant effects on some native species through competition for resources and predation.
There is additional literature that is not included here examining the success of controlling bullfrogs, which may be undertaken for the conservation of a range of taxa including amphibians (e.g. Banks et al. 2000; Orchard 2011; Louette 2012). For example, one modelling study found that culling bullfrog metamorphs in autumn was the most effective method of decreasing population growth rate (Govindarajulu et al. 2005). A review suggested that an indirect approach, by managing habitat rather than directly controlling bullfrogs, may be a more effective way to reduce the effects of bullfrogs on native amphibians (Adams & Pearl 2007). For the success of control of American bullfrogs see the Control of Freshwater Invasive Species synopsis.

Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Predatory fish can have negative impacts on amphibian populations, often through direct predation on embryos and larvae. This is particularly the case if the fish are invasive species, often introduced for fishing. For example, a systematic review found that evidence indicates that newts, salamanders and some frog species are less likely to be found in water bodies stocked with salmonids, such as salmon and trout than those with no stocking (Stewart et al. 2007).

831: Raise awareness amongst the general public through campaigns and public information
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Raising awareness about amphibians, the threats that they face and about their conservation can help to change public perceptions and therefore have an indirect effect on the conservation of amphibians.
This intervention involves general information and awareness campaigns in response to a range of threats. Studies describing educational and data collection programmes are described in ‘Provide education programmes about amphibians’ and ‘Engage volunteers to collect amphibian data’.
There are a number of studies that describe projects that involve raising awareness in which measures of success such as uptake or impacts on amphibian populations have not been monitored (e.g. Zippel et al. 2002; Griffiths et al. 2004). Examples of global campaigns are the ‘Year of the Frog’ in 2008 and the ‘Search for Lost Frogs’. The ‘Year of the Frog’ was led by Amphibian Ark and raised awareness among governments, media, educators and the general public, and raised funds for amphibian conservation programmes (Pavajeau et al. 2008). The ‘Search for Lost Frogs’ campaign was launched in 2010 and supported expeditions to 21 countries across five continents to search for species not seen for a decade or more.

Background information and definitions:
Agricultural land often receives high chemical inputs to control pests, weeds and fungal infections. These chemicals also enter water bodies through spray drift or run-off. With both aquatic and terrestrial life stages, amphibians can be exposed to toxicants in two environments. These pollutants can have significant effects on populations. For example, atrazine is one of the most commonly used herbicides in the world. One study found that atrazine caused 10–92% of wild male leopard frogs Rana pipiens tested across the USA to have abnormal reproductive organs including slowed development and development of egg cells within their testes (Hayes et al. 2002).

Background information and definitions:
Drying of amphibian breeding sites before terrestrial life stages have developed can have significant detrimental effects on populations. In some cases it may be possible to maintain water levels until after metamorphosis by using a local water source or by bringing in water from an outside source.
Occasional drying of breeding sites can increase diversity, as it can help control predators, non-native species or more dominant species.

834: Use artificial fertilization in captive breeding
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Reproductive technologies such as artificial fertilization are techniques that can be used in an attempt to achieve or increase breeding success by captive amphibians. Many amphibians have external fertilization, making this technique relatively simple. However, consideration must be given to the storage and ratio of sperm and eggs, effects of temperature, solution strength and egg jelly on the potential for fertilization. 
 

Key Messages:

Three replicated studies (including two randomized studies) in Australia and the USA found that the success of artificial fertilization depended on the type and number of doses of hormones used to stimulate egg production.

835: Captive breeding frogs
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Captive breeding involves taking wild animals into captivity and establishing and maintaining breeding populations. It tends to be undertaken when wild populations become very small or fragmented or when they are declining rapidly. Captive populations can be maintained while threats in the wild are reduced or removed and can provide an insurance policy against catastrophe in the wild. Captive breeding also potentially provides a method of increasing reproductive output beyond what would be possible in the wild. The aim is usually to release captive-bred animals back to natural habitats, either to original sites once conditions are suitable, to reintroduce species to sites that were occupied in the past or to introduce species to new sites. Some captive populations may also be used for research to benefit wild populations.
Amphibians possess a number of traits that make them potentially suitable for captive breeding programmes. They reach breeding age relatively quickly and are fertile and so captive populations can, in theory, be expanded quickly. Also their small body size and low maintenance requirements allow viable populations to be managed much more cost-effectively than many larger animals. However, captive breeding can result in problems associated with inbreeding depression, removal of natural selection and adaptation to captive conditions.
Studies in which amphibians were treated with hormones to induce sperm or egg release, or eggs were fertilized artificially are discussed in separate sections below.
Studies that investigate the effectiveness of releasing of captive-bred amphibians are discussed in ‘Release captive-bred individuals’. Those studies are not included in this section, unless specific details about captive breeding were included.

Thirty-three studies investigated the success of breeding frogs in captivity.
Twenty-three of 33 studies, three of which were reviews and 30 replicated studies, across the world found that amphibians produced egg in captivity, in four cases by captive-bred females. Seven found mixed results, with some species of frogs or 17–50% of captive populations  reproducing successfully in captivity, but with other species difficult to maintain or raise to adults. One found that frogs did not breed successfully in captivity and another that all breeding frogs died. Seventeen of the studies found that captive-bred frogs were raised successfully to hatching, tadpoles, froglets or adults in captivity. One found that froglet survival was low and another that three species were not successfully raised to adulthood.
Four replicated studies (including one small study) in,Canada, Fiji, Hong Kong and Italy found that 30–88% of eggs hatched or survival to metamorphosis was 75%, as froglets was 17–51% or to adults was 50–90% in captivity.
One review and four replicated studies (including two small studies) in Germany, Italy and the USA found that reproductive success of frogs in captivity depended on temperature or a simulated wet and dry season, but not on whether frogs were housed in high or low maintenance facilities. Three replicated studies (including one small study) in Germany, Australia and Canada found that egg or tadpole development in captivity was affected by parental care, density or temperature.

Key Messages:

Four of six replicated studies (including four small studies) in Japan, Germany, the UK and USA found that eggs were produced successfully in captivity, in one case by one captive-bred female. Two found that production of eggs depended on tank habitat or was more successful in semi-natural compared to laboratory conditions. Captive-bred salamanders were raised to yearlings or a small number of larvae or adults in captivity. One review found that four salamander species bred successfully in captivity, but slimy salamanders produced eggs that did not hatch.
One replicated study in Japan found that 60% of Japanese giant salamander eggs survived to hatching in captivity. Two replicated studies (including one small study) in Mexico and the USA found that larval development, body condition and survival of captive-bred amphibians were affected by water temperature, density and whether they were raised under laboratory or semi-natural conditions.

840: Restore habitat connectivity
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Habitat destruction and fragmentation are important factors in the decline of amphibian populations. Small patches of habitat support smaller populations and if individuals are unable to move to other suitable areas, populations become isolated. This can make them more vulnerable to extinction. Restoring corridors of native vegetation between patches of suitable habitat may help to maintain amphibian populations.
Studies investigating the effects of restoring habitat connectivity with wildlife tunnels are discussed in ‘Threat: Transportation and service corridors – Install culverts or tunnels as road crossings’.
 

Key Messages:

One before-and-after study in Italy found that restoring connectivity between two wetlands by raising a road on a viaduct, significantly decreased deaths of migrating amphibians.

843: Leave coarse woody debris in forests
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Coarse woody debris consists of fallen dead trees and cut branches (&gt; 10 cm diameter) that are left during harvesting. Coarse woody debris increases the structural diversity at the forest floor and provides a valuable microhabitat for animals that are moisture and temperature sensitive such as amphibians.
Studies investigating the effect of adding woody debris to forests are discussed in ‘Habitat restoration and creation – Create refuges’.
 

Key Messages:

Two replicated, controlled studies in the USA found that there was no significant difference in abundance in clearcuts with woody debris retained or removed for eight of nine amphibian species, but that the overall response (population, physiological and behavioural) of amphibians was more negative where woody debris was retained.
Two replicated, controlled studies in the USA and Indonesia found that the removal of coarse woody debris from standing forest did not decrease amphibian diversity or overall amphibian abundance, but did reduce species richness in one study.
One replicated, controlled study in the USA found that migrating amphibians used clearcuts where woody debris was retained more than where it was removed.
One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that within clearcut forest, survival of juvenile amphibians was significantly higher in piles of woody debris than in open areas, and was similar in wood piles to unharvested forest.

844: Harvest groups of trees instead of clearcutting
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be ineffective or harmful
Background information and definitions:
Forests naturally undergo disturbances such as storms and lightning that can create open patches. Similarly, harvesting groups of trees rather than clearcutting forest creates a mix of different habitats, allowing a greater range of species to survive in a forest.
 

Key Messages:

Three studies (including two randomized, replicated, controlled, before-and-after studies) in the USA found that compared to clearcutting, harvesting trees in small groups did not result in higher amphibian or salamander abundance. A meta-analysis of 24 studies in North America found that partial harvest, which included harvesting groups or individual trees, thinning and shelterwood harvesting, resulted in smaller reductions in salamander populations than clearcutting
Two studies (including one randomized, replicated, controlled, before-and-after study) in the USA found that compared to no harvesting, harvesting trees in small groups significantly decreased salamander abundance and changed species composition.
One randomized, replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that compared to unharvested plots, the proportion of female salamanders carrying eggs were similar and proportion of eggs per female and juveniles similar or lower in harvested plots that included harvest of groups of trees.

845: Leave standing deadwood/snags in forests
Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Snags or standing dead trees and other dead wood can provide shelter for amphibians within forest. Retaining these within clearcut forest may help to maintain amphibian populations.
Studies investigating the effect of leaving coarse woody debris during harvest are discussed in ‘Leave course woody debris in forests’.
 

Key Messages:

One randomized, replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that compared to total clearcutting, leaving dead or wildlife trees did not result in higher abundances of salamanders. 
Two studies (including one randomized, replicated, controlled, before-and-after study) in the USA found that compared to no harvesting, leaving dead or wildlife trees during clearcutting did not prevent a decrease in salamander abundance or change in species composition. 
One randomized, replicated, controlled study in the USA found that numbers of amphibian species and abundance were similar with removal or creation of dead trees within forest. 
One randomized, replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that compared to unharvested plots, the proportion of female salamanders carrying eggs, eggs per female or proportion of juveniles were similar or lower in harvested plots that included plots where dead and wildlife trees were left during clearcutting, depending on species and time since harvest.

846: Use leave-tree harvesting instead of clearcutting
Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Leave-tree harvest retains a low density of high-quality trees uniformly through the forest stand. Trees can be retained in groups or dispersed and may contain trees with structural characteristics important to wildlife. Compared to clearcutting, this type of management can help maintain forest species.
 

Key Messages:

Two studies (including one randomized, replicated, controlled, before-and-after study) in the USA found that compared to clearcutting, leaving a low density of trees during harvest did not result in higher salamander abundance.

847: Use patch retention instead of clearcutting
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Patch retention harvesting may be used as an alternative to a total clearcutting in commercial forests exploited for timber. Typically, around 10% of trees are retained in patches within a clearcut area. These retained patches can help maintain characteristic forest species and act as reservoirs for recolonization by forest dependent species.
 

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effect of retaining patches of trees rather than clearcutting on amphibian populations.
One replicated study in Canada found that although released red-legged frogs did not show significant movement towards retained tree patches, large patches were selected more and moved out of less than small patches.

Background information and definitions:
As there is a larger literature for Mallorcan midwife toads Alytes muletensis and for harlequin toads Atelopus sp. than other species, evidence is considered in separate sections for these species. 
 

Key Messages:

Ten replicated studies (including three small studies) in Germany, Italy, Spain, the UK and USA found that toads produced eggs in captivity, in one case by second generation captive females. Eight found that captive-bred toads were raised successfully to tadpoles, toadlets or adults in captivity. Two found that most toads died after hatching or after metamorphosis. Two reviews found mixed results with four species of toad or 21% of captive populations of Puerto Rican crested toad breeding successfully in captivity.
Four replicated studies in Germany, Spain and the USA found that reproductive success of captive toads was affected by tank humidity or was higher in outdoor enclosures than indoor tanks. One replicated study in Germany found that survival of European red-bellied toad eggs, tadpoles and juveniles was higher in captivity than the wild.

Background information and definitions:
Vegetation can be replanted to replace habitat that has been lost.
Studies that investigated the effect of replanting as one of a combination of interventions during the restoration of wetlands are discussed in ‘Restore wetland’.
 

Key Messages:

Three studies (including two replicated studies) in Australia, Canada and Spain found that amphibian abundance or community composition was similar to natural sites following tree planting, or became more similar with time since grassland reseeding. One before-and-after study in Australia found that numbers of frog species increased following restoration that included planting shrubs and trees.
One replicated, site comparison study in Canada found that following logging, amphibian abundance was lower or similar in forests that were planted and had herbicide treatment compared to those left to regenerate naturally, depending on species and forest age.
Four studies (including one replicated study) in Australia, Spain and the USA found that amphibians colonized replanted forest, reseeded grassland and seeded and transplanted upland habitat. Three of the studies investigated restoration following mining. One site comparison study in the USA found that wetlands within reseeded grasslands were used more frequently than those within farmland, but less than those in natural grasslands.

Background information and definitions:
Retaining areas of natural or semi-natural vegetation around core habitats can help to protect the habitat and wildlife that it supports from the detrimental effects of habitat loss or disturbance.
Studies that investigated retaining buffer zones within harvested forests are discussed in ‘Threat: Biological resource use – Logging & wood harvesting – Retain riparian buffer strips during timber harvest’. Buffer zones provided by excluding livestock from water bodies are discussed in ‘Threat: Agriculture – Exclude domestic animals or wild hogs by fencing’ and those created by planting are described in ‘Threat: Pollution – Agricultural pollution – Plant riparian buffer strips’.
 

Key Messages:

One before-and-after study in Australia found that grassland restoration that included leaving unmown buffers around ponds increased numbers of frog species.
One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that retaining buffers along ridge tops within harvested forest increased Red Hills salamander abundance, body condition and genetic diversity. One replicated, controlled study in the USA found that retaining unmown buffers around ponds had mixed effects on tadpole survival and mass depending on species and site.
One replicated study in the USA found that 30 m buffer zones around wetlands were not sufficient to protect marbled salamanders.

851: Use shelterwood harvesting instead of clearcutting
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Shelterwood harvesting is a management technique designed to obtain even-aged timber without clearcutting. It involves harvesting trees in a series of partial cuttings, with trees removed uniformly over the plot, which allows new seedlings to grow from the seeds of older trees. This can help maintain characteristic forest species and increase structural diversity of stands. 
 

Key Messages:

Three studies (including two randomized, replicated, controlled, before-and-after studies) in the USA found that compared to clearcutting, shelterwood harvesting resulted in higher, similar or initially higher and then similar salamander abundance. A meta-analysis of 24 studies in North  America found that partial harvest, which included shelterwood harvesting with three other types, resulted in smaller reductions in salamander populations than clearcutting
Two of three studies (including two randomized, replicated, controlled, before-and-after studies) in the USA found that compared to no harvesting, shelterwood harvesting decreased salamander abundance and changed species composition. One found that shelterwood harvesting did not affect salamander abundance.
One randomized, replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that compared to unharvested plots, the proportion of female salamanders carrying eggs, eggs per female or proportion of juveniles were similar or lower in harvested plots that included shelterwood harvested plots, depending on species and time since harvest.

852: Thin trees within forests 
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be ineffective or harmful
Background information and definitions:
Thinning of trees, that is removal of trees to reduce density (by up to 50%), is undertaken in commercial forestry such as in plantations to ensure that stands are made up of healthy, evenly spaced trees. However, it can also be used as a conservation management practice to restore more natural open woodland. It can also increase structural diversity of young even-aged stands and promote development of late-successional characteristics such as larger trees, multi-level canopies and understory vegetation. Such features are often lost due to active fire suppression or loss of populations of large mammal grazers and browsers.
 

Key Messages:

Five studies (including four replicated and/or controlled studies) in the USA compared amphibians in thinned to unharvested forest. Two found mixed effects of thinning on abundance, depending on amphibian species and time since harvest. One found that amphibian abundance increased, except for ensatina salamanders. One found a negative overall response (population, physiological and behavioural) of amphibians and one found that thinning did not affect abundance. A meta-analysis of 24 studies in North America found that partial harvest, which included thinning with three other types, decreased salamander populations. One controlled, before-and-after site comparison study in the USA found that high volumes of pre-existing downed wood prevented declines in amphibian populations following thinning.
Four studies (including two replicated, controlled studies) in the USA compared amphibians in thinned to clearcut forest. Two found higher amphibian abundance, apart from ensatina salamanders, or a less negative overall response (population, physiological and behavioural) of amphibians in thinned forest. Two found mixed effects on abundance depending on species, life stage and time since harvest. A meta-analysis of 24 studies in North America found that partial harvest, which included thinning with three other types, resulted in smaller reductions in salamander populations than clearcutting.
One randomized, replicated, controlled study in the USA found that migrating amphibians used thinned forest a similar amount, or for one species more than unharvested forest and that emigrating salamanders, but not frogs, used it significantly more than clearcuts.
One site comparison study in the USA found that thinning decreased the body condition of ensatina salamanders 10 years after harvest.

853: Retain connectivity between habitat patches
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Habitat destruction and fragmentation are important factors in the decline of amphibian populations. Small patches of habitat support smaller populations and if individuals are unable to move to other suitable areas of habitat, populations become isolated. This can make them more vulnerable to extinction. On a smaller scale, amphibians often occupy two distinct types of habitat, aquatic and terrestrial. They therefore require suitable habitat to enable them to migrate between these different areas. A study found that as the amount of connecting habitat decreased, so did the diversity of amphibian species with aquatic larvae (Becker et al. 2007). Retaining corridors of native vegetation between suitable habitat patches may help to maintain amphibian populations. 
Studies investigating the effect of restoring connectivity are discussed in ‘Habitat restoration and creation – Restore habitat connectivity’ and ‘Threat: Transportation and service corridors – Install culverts or tunnels as road crossings’.

854: Translocate amphibians
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Animals are translocated either to reintroduce species to sites that were occupied in the past, introduce species to new sites or to increase population numbers where the species is already present. The strategy can help to rescue populations from threats such as development, maintain or restore a species’ historical range or increase the total number of viable populations, to safeguard against loss of other populations. When translocating animals, consideration should be given to within-species diversity and local adaption, particularly when mixing populations in order to ensure that diversity and adaptive potential is not lost (Ficetola & De Bernardi 2005).
The majority of studies translocated amphibians to sites that had been occupied in the past but had no current population or to new sites. A smaller number of studies translocated animals to sites with an existing population.

Key Messages:

Overall, three global reviews and one replicated, before-and-after study in the USA found that 35 of 54 (65%) amphibian translocations that could be assessed resulted in established breeding populations or substantial recruitment to the adult population. A further two translocations resulted in breeding and one in survival following release.
One review found that translocations of over 1,000 animals were more successful, but that success was not related to the source of animals (wild or captive), life-stage, continent or reason for translocation.

Background information and definitions:
The natterjack toad Bufo calamita has declined, particularly in the UK where the species is now endangered. The decline is largely due to habitat destruction and the acidification of breeding sites. In Britain, attempts to reintroduce the species to sites where they had recently gone extinct started in the 1970s. 
 

Key Messages:

Three studies (including one review) in France and the UK found that translocated natterjack toad eggs, tadpoles, juveniles or adults established breeding populations at one site or in 30–70% of cases, some of which also released head-started or captive-bred animals or included habitat management. The review found that re-establishing toads on dune or saltmarsh habitat was more successful than on heathland. One replicated study in the UK found that natterjack toad populations increased at sites established by translocations, particularly with replicated translocations of wild rather than captive-bred toads.
Two replicated, before-and-after studies in Estonia and the UK found that translocating natterjack toad eggs or tadpoles resulted in breeding at 8–70% of sites, some of which had been restored.

Key Messages:

Four before-and-after studies (including one replicated study) in Germany, the UK and USA found that translocated and naturally colonizing toads established breeding populations in created ponds, or in one case 33% of created ponds. Two before-and-after studies (including one replicated study) in Denmark and Switzerland found that common toads and midwife toads naturally colonized 29–100% of created ponds, whereas captive-bred garlic toads did not colonize. One before-and-after study in Denmark found that creating and restoring ponds, along with head-starting, increased populations of European fire-bellied toads.
One replicated, before-and-after study in Switzerland found that midwife toads reproduced in 16% of created ponds.

869: Create ponds for amphibians
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Many ponds have been lost as land has been converted for agriculture or development, and with the intensification of agriculture, for example. Creation of additional breeding habitat may help to replace some of that lost and therefore help to maintain and increase amphibian populations. Different pond types can be created and some may be beneficial to certain species but not to others.  Also new ponds may promote establishment of non-target species, such as the American bullfrog Lithobates catesbeianus or predatory fish, which can compromise the aims of the project.
Evidence from studies that monitored colonization of created ponds by amphibians in general is combined. Studies that targeted specific species have been separated into separate sections. Some of the targeted species may have colonized ponds monitored in the general amphibian section and vice versa. Study ‘ponds’ and ‘pools’ have been referred to as ‘ponds’ within this section.
There is additional literature that shows that 40–75% of garden ponds are used as breeding sites by amphibians (Beebee 1979, 1984; Banks et al. 1986). Common species were found to have colonized naturally, rather than been introduced, in 47–77% of cases (Banks et al. 1986). There is also some literature describing the presence of amphibians in urban stormwater ponds and Sustainable Urban Drainage systems designed to intercept and process pollutants and storm water (Bray et al. 2001; Powell et al. 2001; Scher et al. 2005; Simon et al. 2009; O’Brien 2015).

Key Messages:

Twenty-eight studies investigated the colonization of created ponds by amphibians in general (rather than by targeted species, which are discussed below). All of the studies found that amphibians used some or all created ponds.
Nine site comparison studies (including seven replicated studies) in Australia, Canada, Spain, the UK and USA compared amphibian numbers in created and natural ponds. Five found that numbers of species or breeding species were similar or higher in created ponds, and numbers of ponds colonized were similar. Four found that species composition differed, and comparisons between abundance of individual species, juvenile productivity and size at metamorphosis differed depending on species. One found that numbers of species were similar or lower depending on the permanence of created water bodies. One found that populations in created ponds were less stable.
One review and two replicated, before-and-after studies in Denmark and the USA found that amphibians established stable populations in 50–100% of created ponds. Six replicated studies (including one randomized study) in France, the Netherlands, UK and USA found that amphibians used 64–100% and reproduced in 64–68% of created ponds, or used 8–100% and reproduced in 2–62% depending on species. One review and 15 studies (including 12 replicated studies, one of which was randomized) in Europe and the USA found that created ponds were used or colonized by up to 15 naturally colonizing species, up to 10 species that reproduced, as well as by captive-bred amphibians. Five replicated studies (including three site comparison studies) in Denmark, Estonia, France, Italy and the USA found that pond creation, and restoration in three cases, maintained and increased amphibian populations or increased numbers of species.
Seven studies (including one review) in Austria, Denmark, Poland, the Netherlands and USA found that use or colonization of or reproductive success in created ponds was affected by pond age, permanence, vegetation cover, surrounding landscape, distance to existing ponds and presence of fish.

As there is a larger literature for green and golden bell frogs Litoria aurea than other species, evidence is considered in a separate section. 
 

Key Messages:

Four of five studies (including one replicated study and one review) in Europe, Hong Kong and the USA found that captive-bred frogs released as tadpoles, juveniles or adults established populations or stable breeding populations at 88-100% of sites, and in some cases colonized new sites. One study found that stable breeding populations were not established. One before-and-after study in Spain found that released captive-bred, captive-reared and translocated frogs established breeding populations at 79% of sites.
Three replicated studies in Australia and the USA found that a high proportion of captive-bred frogs released as eggs survived to metamorphosis, some released as tadpoles survived at least the first few months or few released as froglets survived. Three studies (including two replicated studies) in Australia, Italy and the UK and a review in the USA found that captive-bred frogs reproduced at all or 31–33% of release sites, or that there was very limited breeding by released frogs.

871: Release captive-bred amphibians
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Captive breeding is usually undertaken to provide individuals for release into the wild, either to reintroduce the species to part of their former range, or to increase the size of an existing population.
Amphibians possess a number of traits that make them potentially suitable for captive breeding and reintroduction programmes. They reproduce relatively quickly and their small size and low maintenance requirements allow viable populations to be managed much more cost-effectively than many larger animals. Also unlike higher vertebrates that possess many learned behaviours that may reduce survival in the wild, the hard-wired physiology and behaviour of amphibians means that pre- and post-release training are not required. However, before release consideration must be given to genetic management, health screening, acclimation of animals, long-term monitoring and involvement of local stakeholders.
Studies investigating captive breeding and release of specific groups of amphibians are discussed in separate sections. Studies investigating captive breeding are discussed in ‘Breed amphibians in captivity’.
 

Key Messages:

One review found that 41% of release programmes of captive-bred or head-started amphibians showed evidence of breeding in the wild for multiple generations, 29% showed some evidence of breeding and 12% evidence of survival following release.

876: Freeze sperm or eggs for future use
Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Conservation breeding programmes are being used more frequently for threatened amphibian species. However, captive breeding often results in loss of genetic variation. This can mean that animals that were bred for release back in to the wild have reduced fitness. Freezing, or ‘cryopreservation’, of sperm and eggs, allows them to be stored until they are needed. Gene banks can therefore be created for amphibians ensuring that species’ genetic variation is preserved. It also means that the number of a particular species needed in captivity can be reduced and genes can be swapped between captive facilities. Fewer animals in captivity means that fewer amphibians need to be taken from the wild. Freezing can damage cells and so a cryoprotectant, such as dimethyl sulphoxide or glycerol is usually required to protect the cells.
 

Key Messages:

Nine replicated studies (including three controlled studies) in Austria, Australia, Russia, the UK and USA found that following freezing frog and toad sperm viability depended on species and/or cryoprotectant used. One found that although sperm viability was low following freezing, it could be frozen for up to 58 weeks. Five of the studies and one additional replicated study in Australia found that following freezing, viability of sperm and in one case eggs, also depended on storage temperature, storage method, freezing or thawing rate.
Seven replicated studies (including three controlled studies) in Austria, Australia, the UK and USA found that frog and toad sperm viability was greatest following freezing with the cryoprotectant dimethyl sulfoxide, glycerol, sucrose or dimethyl formamide.

877: Use prescribed fire or modifications to burning regime in forests
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be ineffective or harmful
Background information and definitions:
Prescribed fires are undertaken to reduce the amount of combustible fuel to attempt to reduce the risk of more extensive, potentially more damaging 'wildfires'. They may also be used in the maintenance or restoration of habitats historically subject to occasional ‘wildfires’ that have been suppressed through management.
In forests, fires may remove large amounts of woody material from the understory and result in increased grasses and herbaceous vegetation. Such changes can affect forest amphibians. For example, one study found that frog and toad species richness was not affected by the interval between fires, but six species showed some response to the number of fires at the site (Westgate et al. 2012).
Westgate M.J., Driscoll D.A. & Lindenmayer D.B. (2012) Can the intermediate disturbance hypothesis and information on species traits predict anuran responses to fire? Oikos, 121, 1516–1524.
 

Key Messages:

Eight of 14 studies (including three randomized, replicated, controlled studies) in Australia, North America and the USA found no effect of prescribed forest fires on amphibian abundance or numbers of species. Four found that forest fires had mixed effects on amphibian abundance depending on species, species and year or season of burn. Three found that fires increased amphibian abundance or numbers of species. One found that abundance decreased with fires.
Two studies (including one randomized, replicated, controlled study) in the USA found that numbers of amphibian species and abundance increased or abundance decreased with time since prescribed forest fires.
One before-and-after study in the USA found that spotted salamander hatching success increased following a prescribed forest fire.

878: Restore ponds
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Ponds are often drained, left to dry or degraded during the development of agriculture or expansion of urban areas or other land uses. Although some amphibians are relatively tolerant of poor pond conditions, breeding is likely to be more successful in better quality ponds. Restoration of ponds may therefore help to increase populations of amphibians.
Studies included here investigated the restoration of ponds using a combination of interventions. Studies that investigated pond restoration using one specific action are discussed under the relevant intervention, i.e. ‘Deepen, de-silt or re-profile ponds’, ‘Add specific plants to aquatic habitats’, ‘Remove specific aquatic plants’ and ‘Remove canopy to reduce pond shading’. For removal or control of fish populations see ‘Threat: Invasive alien and other problematic species – Reduce predation by other species’.
Studies investigating the restoration of wetlands are discussed in ‘Restore wetlands’.
 

Key Messages:

Fifteen studies investigated the effectiveness of pond restoration for amphibians.
One replicated, before-and-after study in Denmark found that pond restoration had mixed effects on European tree frog population numbers depending on site. One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the UK found that pond restoration did not increase great crested newt populations. Six replicated, before-and-after studies (including one controlled and one site comparison study) in Denmark, Estonia, Italy and the UK found that pond restoration and creation increased numbers of amphibian species, maintained or increased populations, or increased pond occupancy and ponds with breeding success. One found that numbers of species did not increase. Two before-and-after studies (including one replicated study) in Estonia found that pond restoration, along with terrestrial habitat management, maintained or increased populations of natterjack toads. One systematic review in the UK found that there was no conclusive evidence that mitigation, which often included pond restoration, resulted in self-sustaining great crested newt populations.
One small, replicated study in the USA found that pond restoration had mixed effects on spotted salamander hatching success depending on restoration method.
One replicated, before-and-after study in the UK found that restoration increased the number of ponds used by breeding natterjack toads. One replicated study in Sweden found that following restoration green toads only reproduced in one of 10 ponds. Three before-and-after studies (including one replicated, controlled study) in Denmark and Italy found that restored and created ponds were colonized by 1–7 species, with 6–65% of ponds colonized and 35% used for breeding.

879: Restore wetland
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Wetland habitats are often drained or degraded during the development of agriculture or expansion of urban areas or other land uses. Restoration of these important amphibian habitats can help to increase local amphibian species richness and abundance. 
Studies included here tended to investigate the restoration of wetlands using a combination of interventions. Studies investigating the restoration of individual ponds are discussed in ‘Restore ponds’. Study ‘ponds’ and ‘pools’ have been referred to as ‘ponds’ within this section.
 

Key Messages:

Seventeen studies investigated the effectiveness of wetland restoration for amphibians.
Ten site comparison studies (including eight replicated studies) in Canada and the USA compared amphibian numbers in restored and natural wetlands. Eight found that amphibian abundance, numbers of species and species composition were similar. Two found that the number of species or abundance was lower and species composition different in restored wetlands. One found that restored wetlands were used more or less depending on the habitat surrounding natural wetlands. One global review found that in 89% of cases, restored and created wetlands had similar or higher amphibian abundance or numbers of species to natural wetlands.
Seven of nine studies (including six site comparison and/or replicated studies) in Canada, Taiwan and the USA found that wetland restoration increased numbers of amphibian species, with breeding populations establishing in some cases. Three found that numbers of species or abundance did not increase with restoration. Two found mixed effects, with restoration maintaining or increasing abundance of individual species. Three replicated studies (including two site comparison studies) in the USA found that numbers of species in restored wetlands were affected by wetland size, proximity to source ponds and seasonality, but not wetland age.
Three studies (including two replicated, site comparison studies) in Taiwan and the USA found that restored wetlands were colonized by three to eight amphibian species. One before-and-after study in the USA found that three target species did not recolonize restored wetlands.

880: Create wetland
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Loss and degradation of wetlands are two major factors contributing to the global decline of amphibians. Many wetlands have been drained and altered to allow for agriculture and urban development. It has been estimated that the number of wetlands had declined by 33–90% depending on the region of the world (Mitsch & Gosselink 2007).
Creation of wetlands may help to replace some of the habitat lost and therefore help to maintain and increase amphibian populations. However, wetland dynamics are complex and the success of created wetlands depends on many factors such as vegetation, geomorphology and hydrology.
There is additional literature describing the presence of amphibians in agricultural and mine-drainage treatment wetlands designed to intercept and process pollutants (Lacki et al. 1992; Smiley et al. 2011). Use by wildlife is not typically considered in the design of treatment wetlands and wildlife may be restricted using exclusion barriers, trapping or other habitat modifications. Therefore, these studies are not included here.
Study ‘ponds’ and ‘pools’ have been referred to as ‘ponds’ within this section. Studies investigating the creation of individual ponds are discussed in: 'Create ponds for amphibians', 'Create ponds for frogs', 'Create ponds for toads', 'Create ponds for natterjack toads', 'Create ponds for green toads', 'Create ponds for salamanders (including newts)' and 'Create ponds for great crested newts'.

Key Messages:

Fifteen studies investigated the effectiveness of creating wetlands for amphibians.
Five site comparison studies (including four replicated studies) in the USA compared created to natural wetlands and found that created wetlands had similar numbers of amphibian species, amphibian abundance or communities depending on depth as natural wetlands. Two of the studies found that created wetlands had fewer amphibian species or lower abundance and different communities compared to natural wetlands. One site comparison study in the USA found that created wetlands had similar numbers of species to adjacent forest. One global review and two site comparison studies (including one replicated study) in the USA combined created and restored wetlands and compared them to natural wetlands and found that numbers of amphibian species and abundance was higher or similar, or higher in 54% of studies and similar in 35% of studies reviewed compared to natural wetlands. Three site comparison studies (including one replicated study) in the USA found that certain amphibian species were only found in created or natural wetlands. 
One before-and-after study in Australia found that captive-bred green and golden bell frog tadpoles released into a created wetland did not establish a self-sustaining population.
Five studies (including two replicated studies) in Kenya and the USA that investigated colonization of created wetlands found that four to 15 amphibian species used or colonized the wetlands. One global review and three studies (including two replicated studies) in the USA found that numbers of amphibian species and amphibian abundance in created wetlands were affected by wetland design, vegetation, water levels, surrounding habitat, fish presence and distance to source wetlands.

881: Head-start amphibians for release
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Head-starting is a management technique that raises early stage amphibians (eggs, larvae, juveniles) to later life stages (sub-adults, adults) in captivity before releasing them into native habitats. The early life stages may either have been collected in the wild or have been bred in captivity. Here we only include those that were collected from the wild. For those that were bred in captivity see ‘Breed amphibians in captivity’ and ‘Release captive-bred individuals’.
 

Key Messages:

Twenty-two studies head-started amphibians from eggs and monitored them after release.
Six of 10 studies (including five replicated studies) in Denmark, Spain, the UK and USA and a global review found that released head-started tadpoles, metamorphs or juveniles established breeding frog populations or increased populations of frogs or toads. Two found mixed results with breeding populations established in 12 of 17 studies reviewed or at two of four sites. Two found that head-started metamorphs or adults did not prevent a frog population decline or establish a breeding toad population. For five of the studies, release of captive-bred individuals, translocation or habitat management were also carried out.
Nine of 10 studies (including nine replicated studies) in Australia, Canada, Europe and the USA found that head-started amphibians released as tadpoles, metamorphs or adults metamorphosed successfully, tended to survive the first season, winter or year or bred successfully. One found adult survival was 1–17% over four years and one found limited breeding following the release of adults.
Four replicated studies in Australia, the UK and USA found that frog survival to metamorphosis and size at metamorphosis was greater and time to metamorphosis shorter in head-started compared to wild animals. One replicated study in Canada found that young head-started leopard frogs were smaller than those in the wild. One replicated study in Australia found that corroboree frog tadpoles released earlier had higher survival, but metamorphosed two weeks later than those released a month later.
Three studies (including one replicated study) in the USA only provided results for head-starting in captivity. Two found that Houston toad eggs could be captive-reared to tadpoles, but only one successfully reared adults. Three studies (including two replicated studies) in Canada and the USA found that during head-starting, amphibian growth rate, size, stress levels and survival was affected by the amount of protein provided, housing density or enclosure location. One found that mass, stress levels and survival were not affected by the amount of food or habitat complexity.

Background information and definitions:
Effective treatments for chytridiomycosis, caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, are vital to ensure the success of amphibian captive-breeding programmes. Also, to reduce the risk of spreading the disease when animals are moved between breeding facilities, released or translocated between field sites.
 

Key Messages:

Twelve of 16 studies (including four randomized, replicated, controlled studies) in Europe, Australia, Tasmania, Japan and the USA found that antifungal treatment cured or increased survival of amphibians with chytridiomycosis. Four studies found that treatments did not cure chytridiomycosis, but did reduce infection levels or had mixed results.
Six of the eight studies (including two randomized, replicated, controlled studies) in Japan, Tasmania, the UK and USA testing treatment with itraconazole found that it was effective at curing amphibians of chytridiomycosis. One study found that it reduced infection levels and one found mixed effects.
Six studies found that specific fungicides caused death or other negative side effects in amphibians.

883: Use hormone treatment to induce sperm and egg release during captive breeding
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Captive animals do not always breed successfully under artificial conditions. Reproductive technologies such as hormone treatment to induce ovulation or sperm production are techniques that can be used in an attempt to achieve or increase breeding success by amphibians in captive facilities. Hormone stimulation protocols are often species specific.
 

Key Messages:

One review and nine of 10 replicated studies (including two randomized, controlled studies) in Austria, Australia, China, Latvia, Russia and the USA found that hormone treatment of male amphibians stimulated or increased sperm production (Mansour, Lahnsteiner & Patzner 2010, Silla 2011) or resulted in successful breeding in captivity. One found that hormone treatment of males and females did not result in breeding. Four found that the amount and viability of sperm produced was affected by the type, amount or number of doses of hormone.
One review and nine of 14 replicated studies (including six randomized and/or controlled studies) in Australia, Canada, China, Ecuador, Latvia and the USA found that hormone treatment of female amphibians had mixed results, with 30–71% of females producing viable eggs following treatment, or with egg production depending on the combination, amount or number of doses of hormones. Three found that hormone treatment stimulated egg production or successful breeding in captivity. Two found that hormone treatment did not stimulate or increase egg production.
Five replicated studies (including one controlled study) in Canada, Latvia and the USA found that eggs induced by hormone treatment were raised successfully to tadpoles, toadlets or froglets in captivity. Two replicated studies, one of which was small, in Ecuador and the USA found that most toads died before or soon after hatching.

884: Install culverts or tunnels as road crossings
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Roads and traffic can have major impacts on amphibian populations. This is particularly the case if they cut across annual migration routes between hibernation and breeding habitats. Underpasses can be installed to try to reduce mortality on the road. Unlike methods such as toad patrols and road closures, which tend to target breeding adults, tunnels could help reduce deaths of dispersing juveniles. Tunnels may be designed specifically for amphibian migrations, wildlife pipes over land, wildlife culverts over water channels designed for small- to medium-sized animals or drainage culverts that were engineered for water passage, but that can be modified to encourage wildlife passage.
Culverts or tunnels are usually associated with barrier walls that prevent amphibians reaching the road and direct them towards tunnels. Studies that specifically investigated the effect of barrier fencing along roads are discussed in ‘Install barrier fencing along roads’.
 

Key Messages:

Thirty-two studies investigated the effectiveness of installing culverts or tunnels as road crossings for amphibians.
Six of seven studies (including three replicated studies) in Canada, Germany, Italy, Hungary and the USA found that installing culverts or tunnels significantly decreased amphibian road deaths; in one study this was the case only when barrier fencing was also installed. One found no effect on road deaths.
Fifteen of 24 studies (including one review and 17 replicated studies) in Australia, Canada, Europe and the USA found that culverts/tunnels were used by amphibians, by 15–85% of amphibians or 3–15 species, or that 23–100% of culverts or tunnels were used by amphibians or used in 12 of 14 studies reviewed. The majority of culverts/tunnels had barrier fencing to guide amphibians to entrances. Four found mixed effects depending on species, or for toads depending on the site or culvert type. Five found that culverts were used by less than 10% of amphibians or were not used. The use of culverts/tunnels was affected by diameter in three of six studies, with wider culverts used more, length in one of two studies, with long culverts avoided, lighting in all three studies, with mixed effects, substrate in three of six studies, with natural substrates used more, presence of water in two of three studies, with mixed effects, entrance location in one and tunnel climate in one study.
Six studies (including one replicated, controlled study) in Canada, Spain, the Netherlands and USA investigated the use of culverts with flowing water and found that they were used by amphibians, or rarely used by salamanders or not used, and were used more or the same amount as dry culverts.
Certain culvert designs were not suitable for amphibians; one-way tunnels with vertical entry chutes resulted in high mortality of common toads and condensation deposits from steel culverts had very high metal concentrations. One study found that thousands of amphibians were still killed on the road.
