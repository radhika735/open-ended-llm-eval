711: Encourage foraging waterfowl
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
The primary goal of rice producers after the rice has been harvested is to remove rice straw (crop remains) over the winter fallow period, before preparations for the next growing season begin. In a bid to reduce air pollution in the region, farmers are now required to adopt alternative methods of reducing rice crop remains other than burning the rice straw. Many farmers now flood their land, providing winter habitat for waterfowl (in this case ducks). The ducks crush and tear at the rice crop remains while searching for insects and bits of grain.
 

Key Messages:
One controlled, replicated experiment from the USA found increased straw decomposition when ducks were allowed to forage.

Background information and definitions:
Alluvial soil is a fine-grained fertile soil deposited by water flowing over flood plains or in river beds.

Key Messages:
Five studies in Slovakia, Kenya and Thailand measured the effects of planting grass or shrub hedgerows on soil animals and soil fertility. All five found hedgerows to maintain or improve soil fertility and soil animal activity. Of these, three replicated studies found reduced soil erosion and higher soil organic matter levels. Another replicated trial found a higher diversity of soil animals near to the hedgerows. One of the replicated studies and one review found that adding woody species to the hedgerows improved many factors contributing to soil fertility.

857: Use crop rotation
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Many different measures are used to determine the health or structure of soil. Soil porosity is the volume of air in soil (or number of pores) and high porosity indicates good soil structure, as does high microbial biomass, and low penetration resistance. Often with low penetration resistance comes higher hydraulic conductivity, which is the ease with which a fluid (usually water) can move through pore spaces. Soil microbial biomass is the amount of tiny living organisms within a given area or amount of soil. Soil penetration resistance is the soil’s ability to withstand penetration by water or roots. Soil aggregates are groups of soil particles held together by moist clay, organic matter (such as roots), organic compounds (from bacteria and fungi) or fungal hyphae (long, branching structure of a fungus). Some soil particles fit closely together, some do not, creating different-sized spaces. These spaces, or pores, within and between soil aggregates can store air and water, microbes, nutrients and organic matter. Large aggregations of particles retain the most nutrients.

Key Messages:
Biodiversity: Four randomized, replicated trials from Canada, Portugal and Zambia measured the effect of including legumes in crop rotations and found the number of microbes and diversity of different soil animals increased.
Erosion: One randomized, replicated trial from Canada found that including forage crops in crop rotations reduced rainwater runoff and soil loss, and one replicated trial from Syria showed that including legumes in rotation increased water infiltration (movement of water into the soil).
Soil organic carbon: Four studies from Australia, Canada, and Denmark (including two controlled replicated trials and one replicated site comparison study), found increased soil organic carbon under crop rotation, particularly when some legumes were included.
Soil organic matter: Three of five replicated trials from Canada, Portugal and Syria (one also randomized, one also controlled and randomized), and one trial from the Philippines found increased soil organic matter, particularly when legumes were included in the rotation. One study found lower soil organic matter levels when longer crop rotations were used. One randomized, replicated study found no effect on soil particle size.

887: Add mulch to crops
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
For this synopsis we consider higher numbers and a higher diversity of microorganisms as indicators of healthy soil. Protozoa are single-celled organisms which can move around, feed on organic matter (carbon and nitrogen compounds) and often also photosynthesise, which means they can fix carbon into organic compounds, providing food sources for other organisms. Nematodes are tiny, often microscopic worms. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are a group of fungi that live around the roots of plants. By living together, the fungi and host plant benefit each other: the fungi can live in a habitat without having to compete for resources and have a supply of carbon from the plant, while they provide an enhanced supply of nutrients to the plant, improving plant growth, the ability to reproduce and tolerance to drought. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonise a wide variety of host plants including grasses, herbs, agricultural crops and legumes (Bardgett 2005).
Soil aggregates are groups of soil particles that bind to each other more strongly than to adjacent particles. Aggregate stability is the ability of soil aggregates to resist disintegration when disruptive forces associated with tillage and water or wind erosion are applied. Soil stability can is the ability of a soil to resist damage and chemical and physical change.

Key Messages:
Biodiversity: Three replicated trials from Canada, Poland and Spain (including one also controlled, one also randomized and one also controlled and randomized) showed that adding mulch to crops (whether shredded paper, municipal compost or straw) increased soil animal and fungal numbers, diversity and activity. Of these, one trial also showed that mulch improved soil structure and increased soil organic matter.
Nutrient loss: One replicated study from Nigeria found higher nutrient levels in continually cropped soil. 
Erosion: Five studies from India, France, Nigeria and the UK (including one controlled, randomized, replicated trial, one randomized, replicated trial, two replicated (one also controlled), and one controlled trial) found that mulches increased soil stability, and reduced soil erosion and runoff. One trial found that some mulches are more effective than others.
Drought: Two replicated trials from India found that adding mulch to crops increased soil moisture.
Yield: Two replicated trials from India found that yields increased when either a live mulch or vegetation barrier combined with mulch was used.

Background information and definitions:
Soil microbial biomass is the amount of tiny living organisms within a given area or amount of soil. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are a group of fungi that live around the roots of plants. By living together, the fungi and host plant benefit each other: the fungi can live in a habitat without having to compete for resources and have a supply of carbon from the plant, while they benefit the plant with an enhanced supply of nutrients, improved growth and ability to reproduce, and tolerance to drought. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonise a wide variety of host plants, including grasses, herbs, agricultural crops and legumes (Bardgett 2005). They are associated with extensively managed and undisturbed soils. Functional diversity is the value and range of functional roles (or ‘traits’) that organisms play in a given ecosystem (Tilman 2001), in this case the agro-ecosystem. Highly diverse and active soil organisms indicate good soil health. Functional diversity tends to be measured using indexes based on the number of species, or the number of different groups that perform different functions within the ecosystem, for example (there are more). Nematodes play important roles in soil nutrient cycling by feeding on microorganisms. They can be good indicators of ecosystem health as they feed on a wide range of organisms and their community structure reflects the health of their environment.

Background information and definitions:
Organic nitrogen is found in plants and other living organisms. Inorganic or mineral nitrogen is a form of nitrogen available to plants to take up. Mineralisation is the release of nutrients such as nitrogen (changing it to inorganic or mineral nitrogen) when plants and other organic matter decomposes. Soil aggregates are groups of soil particles that bind to each other more strongly than to adjacent particles. Aggregate stability refers to the ability of soil aggregates to resist disintegration when disruptive forces associated with tillage and water or wind erosion are applied. Wet aggregate stability suggests how well a soil can resist raindrop impact and water erosion.

The Shannon diversity index or diversity indices generally are a measure of how many different species there are in a given sample, and how many individuals are present in each species. Soil pore interconnectivity is a measure of how connected air spaces in the soil are. High pore interconnectivity is an indicator of good soil health. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are a group of fungi that live around the roots of plants. By living together, the fungi and host plant benefit each other: the fungi can live in a habitat without having to compete for resources and have a supply of carbon from the plant, while they provide an enhanced supply of nutrients to the plant, improving plant growth, the ability to reproduce and tolerance to drought. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonise a wide variety of host plants, including grasses, herbs, agricultural crops and legumes (Bardgett 2005). Measuring the level of arbuscular mycorrhizal proteins present in the soil enables us to estimate how abundant it is. Soil microbial respiration is the production of carbon dioxide (CO₂) when soil organisms respire (breaking down molecules to produce energy),and can be used to measure microbial activity.

Background information and definitions:
This agroforestry intervention grows crops between hedgerows or tree lines planted at regular intervals across crop fields or along slope contours. Hedges may be pruned and the foliage used as mulch or green manure on the adjacent crop alleys. The technique may control weeds and insect pests in a number of ways, for example by modifying the field’s climate, disrupting pest movement and weed growth, increasing crop vigour, providing habitat for natural enemies and using the insecticidal properties of hedgerow foliage. Studies that plant/allow trees around the edges of fields are included in 'Plant new hedges'. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are a group of fungi that live around the roots of plants. By living together, the fungi and host plant benefit each other: the fungi can live in a habitat without having to compete for resources and receive a supply of carbon from the plant, while they give an enhanced supply of nutrients back to the plant, improving plant growth, the ability to reproduce and tolerance to drought. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonise a wide variety of host plants, including grasses, herbs, agricultural crops and legumes (Bardgett 2005).

906: Change tillage practices
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
There are several ways of tilling the soil in preparation for crop planting. Harrowing and ploughing are also known as conventional tillage. Harrowing is the disturbing or breaking up of soil using an agricultural implement with spike-like teeth (tines) or upright discs. Mouldboard ploughing involves using a plough that turns the soil. Both methods plough to 20 cm depth or more. Shallow tillage uses the same techniques as conventional tillage, but involves only tilling to 15 cm or less in depth. Conservation tillage comprises several methods of soil tillage which leave a minimum of 30% of crop residue on the soil surface. No-tillage involves direct drilling of crops straight into the soil, or leaving fields fallow without disturbing the soil.
Many different measures can be used to determine the health of the soil. Soil porosity is a measure of the volume of air in soil (an indicator of good soil structure, which tends to occur in healthy soils). Bulk density is a measure of the density of the soil. Unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is the ability of the soil to transmit water when a hydraulic (water) gradient is applied. Soil microbial biomass is the amount of tiny living organisms in a given amount of soil. Nematodes are tiny, often microscopic worms. Having high numbers of microbes or nematodes in the soil is generally an indicator of good soil health. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are a group of fungi that live around the roots of plants. By living together, the fungi and host plant benefit each other: the fungi can live in a habitat without having to compete for resources and have a supply of carbon from the plant, while they provide an enhanced supply of nutrients to the plant, improving plant growth, the ability to reproduce and tolerance to drought. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonize a wide variety of host plants, including grasses, herbs, agricultural crops and legumes (Bardgett 2005).

Key Messages:
Biodiversity loss: Eleven studies from Canada, Europe, Mexico, or the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil animals or microbes. Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.
Compaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. 
Drought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. 
Erosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.
Soil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.
Soil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.
Yield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done. One randomized, replicated study from Portugal found no effect of tillage treatment on yield.

907: Retain crop residues
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Crop residues are the remains of the crop after the valuable part has been harvested. For this intervention, residue retention is considered to be crop remains which are left in the field, rather than crop remains which are brought in from elsewhere and added to the soil (see ‘Amend the soil with fresh plant material or crop remains’). Soil aggregates are groups of soil particles held together by moist clay, organic matter (such as roots), organic compounds (from bacteria and fungi) or fungal hyphae (long, branching structures of a fungus). Some soil particles fit closely together, some do not, creating different-sized spaces. These spaces (or pores) within and between soil aggregates can store air and water, microbes, nutrients and organic matter. Large aggregations of particles retain the most nutrients. Soil penetration resistance is the soil’s ability to withstand penetration by water or roots. Often with low penetration resistance comes higher hydraulic conductivity, which is the ease with which a fluid (usually water) can move through pore spaces in the soil. A healthy soil has good hydraulic conductivity. Soil microbial biomass is the amount of tiny living organisms within a given area or amount of soil and is measured by levels of carbon or nitrogen in the soil.
 

Key Messages:
Biodiversity: One replicated study from Mexico found higher microbial biomass when crop residues were retained.  
Erosion: One review found reduced water runoff, increased water storage and reduced soil erosion. One replicated site comparison from Canada found mixed effects on soil physical properties, including penetration resistance and the size of soil aggregates. One replicated study from the USA found that tillage can have mixed results on soil erosion when crop remains are removed.
Soil organic matter: Two randomized, replicated trials from Australia and China found higher soil organic carbon and nitrogen when residues were retained. One trial found this only when fertilizer was also applied.
Yield: Two randomized, replicated trials from Australia and China found higher yields when residues were retained. One trial found this only when residue retention was done combination with fertilizer application and no-tillage.

Background information and definitions:
Water potential measures the tendency of water to move from one area to another due to osmosis, gravity, mechanical pressure, or other effects. Water potential is useful in understanding water movement within plants, animals, and soil. If possible, water will move from an area of higher water potential (lots of water molecules per given volume) to an area that has a lower water potential (fewer water molecules per given volume).
Most slow-release fertilizers release nutrients gradually over time and at specific soil temperatures. Quick-release fertilizers are useful for plants which require higher amounts of nutrients, or a quick supply due to a nutrient deficiency. They tend to break down in the soil much more quickly than slow-release fertilizers. Ammonium-N is often added to soils as a fertilizer for crops. When added to the soil, soil bacteria convert it to nitrate (nitrification). If plants do not take up the ammonium-N immediately it gets converted to nitrate and can be lost from the soil (leaching). A nitrification inhibitor stops or slows down this conversion, and can reduce the loss of nitrate from the soil.
 

Key Messages:
Nutrient loss: Three of five replicated trials from New Zealand and the UK measured the effect of applying nitrification inhibitors to the soil and three found reduced nitrate losses and nitrous oxide emissions, although one of these found that the method of application influenced its effect [Thompson]. One trial found no effect on nitrate loss. One trial found reduced nutrient and soil loss when aluminium sulphate was applied to the soil.
Soil organic matter: Five of six studies (including three controlled, randomized and replicated and one randomized and replicated) from Australia, China, India, Syria and the UK testing the effects of adding chemical compounds to the soil showed an increase in soil organic matter or carbon when nitrogen or phosphorus fertilizer was applied. One site comparison study showed that a slow-release fertilizer resulted in higher nutrient retention. One study found higher carbon levels when NPK fertilizers were applied with straw, than when applied alone, and one replicated study from France found higher soil carbon when manure rather than chemical compounds were applied.
Yield: One replicated trial from India and a trial from the Philippines showed that maize, wheat and rice yield increased with increased fertilizer application.
Soil types covered: clay, fine loamy, gravelly-sandy loam, loam, loamy sand, sandy loam, silty, silty-clay, silt-loam.

910: Amend the soil with fresh plant material or crop remains
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
This intervention refers to plant material and crop remains which have been brought in from elsewhere, rather than being left as ‘residues’ in the soil or on the soil surface after harvest of the valuable crop part (see also ‘Retain crop remains’). Soil microbial biomass is the amount of tiny living organisms in a given amount of soil and is measured by the amount of carbon or nitrogen they release into the soil. Soil aggregates are groups of soil particles held together by moist clay, organic matter (such as roots), organic compounds (from bacteria and fungi) or fungal hyphae (long, branching structures of a fungus). Some soil particles fit closely together, some do not, creating different-sized spaces. These spaces (or pores) within and between soil aggregates can store air and water, microbes, nutrients and organic matter. Large aggregations of particles retain the most nutrients. Nitrogen immobilisation (or demineralisation) is the conversion of inorganic compounds (e.g. nitrogen) to organic compounds by micro-organisms (e.g. incorporating it into cells), making it unavailable to plants. In this intervention, immobilisation is being encouraged after cropping to reduce nitrogen leaching. Macroorganic matter is defined as the fraction of soil organic matter with particles larger than 150 μm, made up of fragmented plant residues and microbial debris. Although a small component of soils (macroorganic matter makes up 3-6% of total soil organic matter), it is often called the ‘active’ fraction as it is linked to water availability and nutrient supply for both plants and microorganisms.
 

Key Messages:
Biodiversity: One randomized, replicated experiment from Belgium found increased microbial biomass when crop remains and straw were added.
Compaction: One study from India found improved soil structure when straw was incorporated. One before-and-after trial from the UK found that incorporating straw residues by discing (reduced tillage) did not improve anaerobic soils (low oxygen levels) in compacted soils.
Erosion: Two randomized, replicated studies from Canada and India measured the effect of incorporating straw on erosion. One found straw addition reduced soil loss, and one found mixed effects depending on soil type.
Nutrient loss: Four replicated studies from Belgium, the UK and the USA (one also controlled, one also randomized, and two also controlled and randomized) reported higher soil nitrogen levels when compost or straw was applied, but mixed results when processed wastes were added. One also found reduced nitrate leaching when straw was incorporated. One replicated study from China and the Philippines found mixed results depending on site.
Soil organic carbon: Six studies from China, Denmark and India measured the effect of incorporating plant material into the soil. All (including one replicated, two randomized, replicated studies, one controlled, randomized, replicated studies and one controlled before-and-after site comparison) found higher carbon levels when plant material was added. One found higher carbon levels when straw was applied along with NPK fertilizers. One also found larger soil aggregates. One replicated study from China and the Philippines found mixed results depending on site.
Yield: One replicated trial from Denmark found higher barley yield when straw was incorporated. One trial from the Philippines found higher grain yields when crop remains were incorporated earlier in the season.
 
Soil types covered: clay, clay loam, fine loam, loam/sandy loam, loamy sand, sandy, sandy clay loam, sandy loam, sandy-silt, silt loam, silty, silty-clay.

911: Amend the soil with manures and agricultural composts
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Soil microbial biomass is the amount of tiny living organisms in a given amount of soil.  Soil microbial respiration is the production of carbon dioxide (CO2) when soil organisms respire (breaking down molecules to produce energy). Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are a group of fungi that live around the roots of plants. By living together, the fungi and host plant benefit each other: the fungi can live in a habitat without having to compete for resources and have a supply of carbon from the plant, while benefit the plant with an enhanced supply of nutrients, improved growth and ability to reproduce, and tolerance to drought. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonise a wide variety of host plants, including grasses, herbs, agricultural crops and legumes (Bardgett 2005). They are associated with less intensively cultivated and undisturbed soils.
Soil aggregates are groups of soil particles held together by moist clay, organic matter (such as roots), organic compounds (from bacteria and fungi) or fungal hyphae (long, branching structures of a fungus). Some soil particles fit closely together (high soil density), some do not (low density), creating different-sized spaces. These spaces (or pores) within and between soil aggregates can store air and water, microbes, nutrients and organic matter. Large aggregations of particles retain the most nutrients. Since organic amendments act as strong binding agents between particles, mean weight diameter (MWD) of the aggregates (in mm) soils are likely to increase with applications of organic material such as manures and composts. Soil penetration resistance MPa is the soil’s ability to withstand penetration by water or roots. Often with low penetration resistance comes higher hydraulic conductivity, which is the ease with which a fluid (usually water) can move through pore spaces in the soil. Higher hydraulic conductivity is an indicator of a healthy soil.
Excess levels of soluble salts in the soil can adversely affect plant life by changing a plant’s water balance and basic function, resulting in wilting or scorching. Electrical conductivity is a general measure of the soluble salt content or nutrient level of a soil (high conductivity values typically indicate high salt levels). Good quality topsoil should have an electrical conductivity value within the range of 100-1500 microSiemens/cm (μS/cm). Ceramic cup sampling measures the electrical conductivity of a soil, using a vacuum is connected to tubes in the soil. On the end of the tubes are small ceramic cups which filter moisture from the soil when suction is applied.
Ammonium-nitrate is often added to soils as a fertilizer and if plants do not take it up immediately, the ammonium-nitrate gets converted to nitrate by soil bacteria (nitrification) and can be lost from the soil (leaching). A nitrification inhibitor stops or slows down this conversion, and can reduce the loss of nitrate from the soil.

Key Messages:
Biodiversity loss: Three controlled, replicated studies from the UK and USA found higher microbial biomass when manure or compost was applied, and higher microbial respiration when poultry manure was applied.
Erosion: One controlled, randomized, replicated study from India found lower soil loss and water runoff with manure application in combination with other treatments.
Nutrient management: Four studies from Canada, Spain, the UK and the USA measured the effect of a variety of manure types on soil nutrient levels. Of these, three randomized, replicated studies (two also controlled) found reduced nutrient loss and higher nitrogen levels when farmyard or poultry manure was applied. One also found lower nutrient loss when farmyard manure (rather than poultry manure or slurry) was applied in winter rather than autumn. One controlled replicated study found higher nitrate leaching.
Soil organic carbon: Four studies (including three controlled, replicated studies (one also randomized) and a review) from India, Japan and the UK found higher carbon levels when manures were applied.
Soil organic matter: One controlled, randomized, replicated study from Turkey found higher organic matter, larger soil aggregations and a positive effect on soil physical properties when manure and compost were applied. Two studies from Denmark and Germany found no effect of manure on organic matter levels.
Yield: Four controlled, replicated studies (including three also randomized) from India, Spain and Turkey found higher crop yields when manures or compost were applied. One study found higher yields when manure were applied in combination with cover crops.
Soil types covered: Clay loam, fine sandy-silty loam, loam, loamy, sandy loam, sandy clay loam, silty loam, and sandy silt loam.
