3477: Protect greenfield sites or undeveloped land in urban areas
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
‘Greenfield sites’ are areas of previously undeveloped land within urban areas, such as agricultural and amenity land, forests, parks and gardens. Such sites may provide important habitat for wildlife and act as wildlife corridors. However, greenfield sites are frequently built upon with the growing pressure for urban development.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of protecting greenfield sites or undeveloped land in urban areas on reptile populations.

3480: Create suitable habitats to offset habitat lost within development footprint
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Development activity may be accompanied by a biodiversity ‘offsetting’ strategy that aims to compensate for the loss of existing habitat and associated species by protecting other sites or creating new sites of equal value to the lost habitat (e.g. Bull et al. 2014, Ives & Bekessy 2015). Offsetting may be ‘in-kind’, whereby new habitat is similar to that lost (for example creating ponds to replace ponds lost elsewhere), or ‘out-of-kind', whereby the new habitat is different (for example creating rock outcrops to replace lost grasslands elsewhere). Existing green spaces such as golf courses — known to support substantial wildlife numbers, especially urban-adapted species (Hodgkison et al. 2007) — have been proposed as potential sites for biodiversity offsets (Burgin & Wotherspoon 2009). Studies describing habitat restoration that is not compensatory for urban development or is carried out retrospectively rather than planned alongside the development, are summarized under Habitat restoration and creation.

3485: Engage landowners and volunteers to manage land for reptiles
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Only around 15% of land and 4% of oceans are protected worldwide (UNEP WCMC & IUCN 2016), which means that it is vital to engage effectively with landowners so that they manage their land in ways that help to maintain reptile populations. Volunteers can also make a valuable contribution to the management of habitats for reptiles, on private and public land. In some cases, the long-term success of habitat management can depend on the involvement of local people.
As well as the direct effects from habitat restoration, volunteer programmes help raise awareness about reptiles and the threats that they face. For example, a study found that participants with high levels of engagement in conservation projects learned more (Evely et al. 2011). For interventions that involve engaging volunteers to help manage or monitor reptile populations see actions relating to Education and awareness raising.

3486: Pay farmers to cover the costs of conservation measures
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Financial incentives to undertake specific management actions with the aim of increasing biodiversity on farmland may be provided by government or non-governmental organisations. For example, agri-environment schemes are government or inter-governmental schemes designed to compensate farmers financially for changing agricultural practices to be more favourable to biodiversity and the landscape. Agri-environment schemes include many different specific interventions relevant to conservation. Where a study describes a specific intervention, e.g. Create uncultivated margins around arable or pasture fields, it is summarized under that specific action. Here we include studies that describe the effectiveness of payments such as those included in agri-environment policies where specific actions are not clearly defined.

Key Messages:
  

One study evaluated the effects of paying farmers to cover the costs of conservation measures on reptiles. This study was in Australia.

3488: Manage tillage practices
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Conventional ploughing or tilling disturbs the soil to about 25–35 cm (Tebrügge & Düring 1999). Ploughing can impact reptiles when individuals are buried by ploughing activity (Saumure et al. 2007), or when ploughing destroys nesting sites (Hódar et al. 2000). A number of methods can be used to reduce the depth or intensity of ploughing such as layered cultivation, non-inversion tillage and conservation tillage. Such practices have been found to be beneficial for some farmland biodiversity (Holland & Luff 2000). ‘Conservation agriculture’ attempts to alter the soil profile as little as possible by direct sowing and/or leaving the soil protected with plant residues (García-Torres et al. 2002).

Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Grazing by livestock changes habitats by reducing vegetation height and ground cover, altering plant abundance and diversity, creating openings for seed growth and preventing reed or shrub growth.  While heavy grazing by some wild grazers can have detrimental effects on reptile populations (Howland et al. 2014), the result of different grazing regimes on reptiles will likely depend on the reptile species, grazing intensity and the timing of grazing activity. Studies included in this intervention measure the impacts of varying intensities of grazing or different types of grazing regimes on reptiles. Studies that just compare the effect of stopping all grazing to continued grazing are included under the intervention Cease livestock grazing.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (8 STUDIES)

Community composition (4 studies): Two of four site comparison studies (including two replicated studies) in Austalia and Spain found that restored mining areas hosted different reptile communities than unmined areas. One study found that reptile communities in the oldest restored areas were most similar to unmined areas. The other study found that restored mining areas that were seeded or received topsoil had similar community composition compared to surrounding unmined forests.
Richness/diversity (5 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies and one review in Australia found that restored mining sites had lower reptile species richness than unmined sites. One replicated, before-and-after, site comparison study in Spain found that after restoration, reptile species richness increased steadily over a six-year period. One replicated, site comparison study in Australia found that restored areas supported most of typical reptile species found in the wider habitat.

POPULATION RESPONSE (8 STUDIES)

Abundance (7 studies): Five of six replicated, site comparison studies and one review in Australia found that in restored mining areas reptiles tended to be less abundant than in unmined areas. The other study found mixed effects of restoration on reptile abundance. One replicated, controlled study in Australia found that restored areas that were thinned and burned 10–18 years after restoration began had higher reptile abundance than restored areas that were not thinned and burned.
Reproductive success (2 studies): One review in Australia found that one study reported reptiles breeding in restored mining areas. One study on Reunion Island found that four of 34 and eight of 40 artificial egg laying sites in restored mining areas were used by Reunion day geckos nine months and two years after installation respectively.
Condition (1 study): One review of restoration of mining sites in Australia found that three of three studies indicated that reptile size or condition was similar in restored mines and undisturbed areas.

BEHAVIOUR (5 STUDIES)

Use (4 studies): Three studies (including one replicated, site comparison study) in Australia and the USA found that restored mining areas were occupied by up to 14 snake, five turtle and one lizard species, or that generalist reptile species colonized restoration sites more quickly than did specialist species. One replicated, controlled study in Australia found that Napoleon’s skinks reintroduced to a restored mining site all moved to an unmined forest within one week of release.

One replicated, randomized, site comparison study in the USA found that areas with fencing that excluded both grazing and recreational vehicle use had more Agassiz’s desert tortoises than areas with less restrictions on grazing or vehicle use.
Survival (2 studies): One of two replicated studies (including one controlled study) in the USA found that areas with fencing that excluded grazing and recreational vehicle use had lower death rates of Agassiz’s desert tortoises than areas with less restrictions on grazing or vehicle use. The other study found that in areas where grazing was ceased and where grazing was rotational, survival of Texas tortoises was similar.
Condition (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in the USA found that in areas where grazing was ceased and where grazing was rotational, size and growth of Texas tortoises was similar.

3499: Use fencing to prevent reptiles from accessing facilities
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
There is a risk to reptiles from becoming trapped, falling into mining pits or being electrocuted in mining or energy production facilities. Fencing may be used around such sites to deter reptile entry. As well as reducing direct risks to reptiles, if successful the intervention may also reduce the need to carry out lethal control of reptiles on such sites.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on reptile populations of using fencing to prevent reptiles from accessing facilities.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.

3500: Install barriers along roads/railways 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Wildlife barriers aim to prevent animals from crossing roads. They are typically wire mesh fences running parallel to the road. Although fencing may protect wildlife from traffic, it should not create an absolute barrier that prevents migration, isolates populations, fragments habitat, causes injuries, or traps reptiles (e.g. Barton & Kinkead 2005, Wilson & Topham 2009, Kapfer & Paloski 2011, Ferronato et al. 2014). Wildlife fencing is therefore usually combined with safe crossing opportunities such as wildlife underpasses and overpasses (see Install overpasses over roads/railways and Install tunnels/culverts/underpasses under roads/railways).
Studies included here are those that specifically assess barrier effectiveness, sometimes in combination with other collision reduction actions, but not where effects of fencing cannot be separated from effects of road underpasses. For these interventions combined, see Install barriers and crossing structures along roads/railways.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Survival (3 studies): One before-and-after study in the USA found that following installation of a barrier fence, along with creating artificial nest mounds on the non-road side of the fence, and actively moving turtles off the road, fewer turtles were found dead on the road. One before-and-after study in the USA found that following installation of a roadside barrier with nest boxes along with a warning sign, fewer female diamondback terrapins were killed while crossing the road compared to before installation. One study in Canada found that dead snakes were found in the vicinity of a barrier fence up to 11 years after it was installed.

BEHAVIOUR (4 STUDIES)

Use (4 studies): One controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that following installation of a roadside barrier with nest boxes, fewer diamond-backed terrapin crossed the road compared to before installation. One replicated study in the USA found that after installing barriers, diamondback terrapins laid more nests on the marsh-side of the fence than on the road-side. The study also found that terrapins were less likely to breach barriers with smaller gaps at the bottom. One replicated study in the USA found that desert tortoises were effectively blocked by a concrete barrier. One replicated study in the USA found that taller fences were better at excluding painted and snapping turtles than lower ones.
Behaviour change (1 study): One replicated study in the USA found that desert tortoises interacted less with solid compared to non-solid barriers.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
High vehicle speed is generally considered to be a substantial contributing factor in wildlife-vehicle collisions. Slower road speeds allow drivers to identify and avoid wildlife, as well as allowing reptiles the time necessary to cross roads. Speed limits can be reduced in areas where there are high numbers of collisions, either permanently or during seasonal migrations.

3507: Install barriers and crossing structures along roads/railways
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Schemes designed to reduce collisions between vehicles and reptiles may use multiple interventions. Two of the most common ones, installing barrier fencing and providing routes for reptiles to travel underneath or over roads, are often employed within the same scheme. This may entail regular roadside fencing with entrances to underpasses set further back away from the road or fencing may be designed to adjoin the sides of under or overpass entrances. Sometimes, fencing may be installed to form a funnel leading towards under or overpass entrances.
This intervention includes studies where these two actions are in place at the same site. In most studies, all under or overpasses (where there are multiple crossings) are beneath stretches or roads that have barrier fencing. In a minority, just some of the under or overpasses monitored are along stretches with barrier fencing. Studies included use of either conventional fencing, electric fences or other barriers, such as walls. Most studies report solely on the use of crossings or trends in numbers of reptiles killed on roads. There is an absence of studies reporting on wider population-level effects of the presence of these structures.
See Install tunnels/culverts/underpasses under roads/railways or Install overpasses over roads/railways for studies where under or overpasses are either installed without use of barriers or where it is not clear from the study that barriers were installed. See also Install barriers along roads/railways for studies where the specific effect of barriers was evaluated.

Key Messages:

Sixteen studies evaluated the effects of installing barriers and crossing structures along roads/railways on reptile populations. Five studies were in the USA, three were in each of Spain, Australia and Canada and one was in each of France and South Africa.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (8 STUDIES)

Survival (8 studies): Four of seven studies (including one randomized, controlled, before-and-after study and one review) in the USA, Australia, Canada and South Africa found that installing fencing and crossing structures did not reduce road mortalities of reptiles, and in one case the percentage of mortalities may have increased. Two studies found that areas with fencing and crossing structures had fewer road mortalities of turtles and overall reptiles. One study found that reptile road mortalities still occurred in in areas with roadside barrier walls and culverts. One replicated, before-and-after study in Canada found that following installation of tunnels and guide fencing, along with signs for motorists, there were fewer road mortalities of eastern massasauga rattlesnakes.

BEHAVIOUR (12 STUDIES)

Use (12 studies): Six studies (including two replicated studies and one review) in Spain, France, the USA and Australia found that crossing structures with fencing that were not specifically designed for wildlife were used by lizards, snakes, tortoises, turtles and alligators and ophidians. One study also found that the addition of fencing around crossing structures did not affect the number of reptile crossings. Three studies (including one replicated and one before-and-after study and one review) in the USA and Spain found that wildlife crossing structures with fencing were used by gopher tortoises and 12 snake species, American alligators and lacertid lizards. One study also found that an American alligator did not use the wildlife crossing structure. Two before-and-after studies (including one controlled study) in Canada found mixed effects of installing roadside fencing and culverts on road use by turtles and snakes. One replicated study in Spain found that use of different crossing structures depended on species group. One replicated study in Australia found that reptiles used wildlife underpasses or culverts for only 1% of road crossings. One replicated, before-and-after study in Canada found that following installation of tunnels and guide fencing, along with signs for motorists, fewer eastern massasauga rattlesnakes were found crossing the road.

3508: Install tunnels/culverts/underpasses under roads/railways
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Tunnels, culverts and underpasses may provide safe crossing points for reptiles. A range of different tunnels can be used, including purpose-built wildlife tunnels, culverts that assist with drainage and which can also be used by wildlife, and large passages beneath elevated road sections which may sometimes also be used for local vehicle access. Culverts may be round (pipes) or square (box) and may or may not have natural substrate (sand or stones) on the bottom.
Underpasses are frequently installed in conjunction with wildlife barrier fencing which funnels animals towards the tunnel and prevents them from accessing the road or railway. For this combined intervention, see Install barriers and crossing structures along roads/railways. See also Install barriers along roads/railways and Install overpasses over roads/railways.
Studies included here are those where barrier fencing is not installed or not explicitly referred to in the study methods or where at least some underpasses were in unfenced areas. Most studies here report solely on the use of these structures, such as the number of crossings made. There is an absence of studies reporting on wider population-level effects of the presence of these structures.

Key Messages:

Fifteen studies evaluated the effects of installing tunnels/culverts/underpasses under roads/railways on reptile populations. Four of the studies were in the USA, four were in Australia, three were in Spain, two were in Canada and one was in each of Australia, Europe and North America and South Africa.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Survival (3 studies): Two site comparison studies (including one before-and-after study) in Australia and South Africa found a similar number of reptile road mortalities with or without culverts or wildlife underpasses. One replicated study in Spain found that the number of underpasses in an area did not affect the number of reptile road mortalities.

BEHAVIOUR (12 STUDIES)

Use (12 studies): Six studies (including four replicated studies and one replicated, before-and-after study) and one review in Spain, Australia, the USA and Australia, Europe and North America found that crossing structures, including tunnels, culverts, underpasses, pipes and trenches under roads and railways were used by reptiles, lizards, snakes and/or tortoises. One review in Australia, Europe and North America also found that wildlife underpasses were used by reptiles in only one of 13 studies. Three of four replicated studies (including one before-and-after study) in the USA and Canada found that desert tortoises, painted and snapping turtles and rattlesnakes and garter snakes showed a willingness to enter some, or all types of tunnel. The other study found that only 9% of painted turtles entered a culvert during a choice experiment. One site comparison study in Australia found that the area under an overpass was used by five reptile species.

3510: Install overpasses over roads/railways
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
To mitigate the effects of roads on wildlife vegetated, vehicle-free overpasses may be constructed. These tend to be constructed for mammals but could also be designed for or used by reptiles.
Wildlife overpasses are constructed to provide safe road and rail crossing opportunities for wildlife. A range of different structures can be used as overpasses including purpose-built “green bridges”, on which natural vegetation is established, through to general purpose crossing structures that are accessible to both wildlife and vehicles. Overpasses are often used in combination with wildlife barriers that prevent animals accessing the road and which funnel animals toward the overpasses (see Install barriers and crossing structures along roads/railways). Studies summarized within this intervention cover both overpasses created specifically for wildlife and those that were created for other purposes but where information about use of such structures by reptiles is included. Studies mostly report on the use of such structures, such as the number of crossings made, rather than on wider population-level effects of their presence.
See also: Install tunnels/culverts/underpass under roads/railways.

Key Messages:

Five studies evaluated the effects of installing overpasses over roads/railways on reptile populations. Three studies were in Spain, one was a review of studies in Australia, Europe and North America and one study was in Australia.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Two replicated studies in Spain found that wildlife overpasses were used by lizards and Ophidians (snakes and legless lizards), and one review in Australia, Europe and North America found that one of 10 wildlife overpasses were used by reptiles. One review of road crossing structures in Australia, Europe and North America found that a rope bridge was not used by reptiles.

3511: Cease livestock grazing: Forest, open woodland & savanna
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Grazing by livestock reduces vegetation height and ground cover, alters plant abundance and diversity, creating openings for seed growth and preventing reed or shrub growth. These changes can have beneficial (Tesauro & Ehrenfeld 2007) or detrimental effects (Howland et al. 2014) on reptile populations depending on the reptile species, grazing intensity, timing and conjunction with burning regimes. Studies included in this intervention measure the impact of ceasing grazing on reptiles. Studies that compare the effects of varying intensities of grazing or different types of grazing regimes on reptiles are included under the intervention Modify grazing regime.
Due to the number of studies found, this action has been split by habitat type. See here for Grassland & shrubland or Wetland.

Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Vegetation height is important in determining the value of cropland and grassland to wildlife. High vegetation can provide more complex environments and more habitats, while short vegetation may increase the risk of predation. Cutting of crops or pasture can kill or maim reptiles causing mutilations, crushing, and other lethal injuries. It is possible that mortalities and injuries could be reduced by raising the height of cutting machinery above the soil (Saumure et al. 2007).

3519: Provide or maintain hedgerows on farmland
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Agricultural intensification, including increases in field sizes and pesticides use, has resulted in a loss of field boundary habitats, such as hedgerows. These features can provide a relatively undisturbed habitat for wildlife in intensively managed agricultural landscapes. Hedge planting and maintenance of existing hedges has, therefore, been proposed as a means of preserving and enhancing biodiversity. Such management is sometimes funded through agri-environmental schemes.
This action does not include studies on the effect of uncultivated margins, which are included in Create uncultivated margins around arable or pasture fields.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Allocation of some farmland to set-aside (fields taken out of production) was compulsory under European Union agricultural policy from 1992 until 2008. The idea was to reduce production. However, set-aside has also been promoted as a method of enhancing biodiversity on farmland. Set-aside can be rotational (in a different place every year or two) or non-rotational (same place for 5–20 years) and fields can either be sown with fallow crops or left to naturally regenerate. Unlike fallow land, set-aside is not ploughed or harrowed except for the purpose of sowing. However, set-aside often is managed by cutting and/or spraying. In some cases, set-aside land has had wildflowers sown on it.

3524: Use signage to warn motorists about wildlife presence
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Wildlife crossing signs alert drivers to the potential presence of wildlife on or near a road. They are designed to encourage drivers to be more alert and/or reduce the speed of their vehicle, with the goal of reducing animal-vehicle collisions. Motorists may become habituated to signs if they are present all year round, are too common or look similar to other signs. Solutions may be to use temporary seasonal signs, animated signs, flashing lights or flags to catch the attention of drivers. 

Key Messages:

Five studies evaluated the effects of using signage to warn motorists of wildlife presence on reptile populations. Three studies were in the USA and one was in each of Dominica and Canada.

Survival (5 studies): One of two before-and-after studies (one replicated and controlled) in the USA found that installing road signs reduced road mortalities of massasaugas in autumn but not summer. The other study found that installing road signs did not reduce road mortalities of painted or Blanding’s turtles. Two before-and-after studies (one replicated) in Canada and the USA found that a combination of installing road signs with either fencing and tunnels or a hybrid nestbox-fencing barrier resulted in fewer road mortalities of massasaugas and diamondback terrapins. One before-and-after study in Dominica found that a combination of using road signs and running an awareness campaign resulted in fewer road mortalities of Antillean iguanas.

3526: Diversify ground vegetation and canopy structure in the habitat around woody crops
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Agricultural intensification methods of large area woody crops (e.g. olives, almonds, coffee) has led to an increase in bare ground (through increased tilling or herbicide) and lack of overstorey surrounding the crop trees. This loss of soil, herbaceous covering and canopy layers has been implicated in losses of wildlife diversity in agricultural systems.
For example, coffee is a small tree or shrub that naturally grows in the forest understory and may be grown commercially under trees that provide shade. In the 1970s, sun-tolerant coffee plants were developed in response to fungal diseases and many plantations removed all canopy trees. These high-yield cultivation practices are considered unsustainable and many coffee plantations, are switching to shade-grown varieties.
Diversifying the habitats where woody crops are grown with respect to both ground and canopy vegetation may increase available habitat for reptile communities within these agricultural systems.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects of diversifying ground vegetation and canopy structure in the habitat around woody crops on reptile populations. One study was in Puerto Rico and the other was in Spain.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, paired, site comparison study in Spain found that olive groves with natural ground cover had higher reptile species richness and diversity than those with bare ground, but groves planted with a single species as ground cover had similar richness and diversity as those with bare ground.

POPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Abundance (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in Puerto Rico found that two of three lizard species were less abundant in shade-grown coffee plantations than in sun-grown plantations. One replicated, paired, site comparison study in Spain found that olive groves with ground cover had more reptiles than groves with bare ground.

Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Agricultural intensification, which includes increasing field size and pesticide use, has resulted in a loss of shelter and food resources for wildlife, such as that provided by areas of trees. These features can provide a relatively undisturbed habitat for wildlife in intensively managed agricultural landscapes. Tree planting may therefore diversify habitat availability and, in younger plantations, may also provide areas of longer uncut grass than is available elsewhere in the landscape.
 

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects of planting trees on farmland to benefit reptiles. Both studies were in Australia.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Richness/diversity (2 studies): One replicated, paired sites study in Australia found that pastures with tree plantings had similar rare reptile species richness compared to pastures with no trees, but that more rare species were present with 50% canopy cover compared to 5% cover. One replicated, site comparison study in Australia found that farms with restoration planting (of native ground cover and trees) had lower reptile species richness than farms with remnant vegetation (of old growth woodland or natural regrowth).

3532: Install and maintain anti-predator systems around aquaculture that prevent entanglement of reptiles
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Marine aquaculture (mariculture) includes the breeding, rearing, and harvesting of ocean-based aquatic plants and animals in ocean-based cages or spat lines. Marine aquaculture produces many of the shellfish (e.g. oysters, clams, mussels), prawn and shrimp, as well as salmon (Salmonidae spp.) and other marine fish consumed by humans. Leatherback turtles Dermochelys coriacea are known to have become entangled in mussel farm lines and spat lines in Canada resulting in fatalities and with the anchoring line of a mussel farm in the North Atlantic (Price et al. 2016). Lines made of stiff material have been proposed to prevent entanglement (Price & Morris 2013). Interventions to reduce bycatch in marine fishing nets are discussed in Threat: Biological resource use.
Freshwater aquaculture involves the breeding, rearing and harvesting of freshwater species in ponds. Freshwater aquaculture is used to produce commercial quantities of freshwater crayfish, prawns, turtles and fish (e.g. carp and trout). As with marine aquaculture, there is little documented evidence of how reptiles interact with these freshwater fish farms, although freshwater turtles undoubtedly compete with fish for food in these systems. Interventions to reduce bycatch in freshwater fishing nets are discussed in Threat: Biological resource use.

Background information and definitions:
The harvesting of reptiles and their eggs may be regulated by preventing trade altogether, or by setting harvesting and export quotas that are designed to enable the population to reach or remain at a particular level. However, it should be noted that in some cases the basis for determining such quotas is not clear, and numbers may not be evidence based (Auliya 2010). Whilst many hunting systems use quotas, the studies included here are those based on species with particular conservation concerns rather than where quotas are based purely on maximising the harvest.

Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Wildlife breeding farms are sometimes used with the goal of alleviating the pressure of harvesting or collecting on wild reptile populations. However, if not carefully regulated, breeding farms may be used to ‘launder’ illegally harvested reptiles, thereby allowing illegal trade to continue (Lyons & Natusch 2011).
To be included, ideally studies should have tested the impact of commercial breeding on wild populations, and this should be taken into account when considering the effectiveness of this action. However, often the effects on wild populations are not explicitly or directly tested.

3541: Patrol or monitor nesting beaches
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Female sea turtles are vulnerable to poaching during the nesting season. Human presence on beaches at night can prevent female sea turtles from emerging from the sea to nest or interrupt females while egg laying so that they return to sea.  Once laid, nests are vulnerable to human disturbance and illegal egg collection. Patrols may be carried out at frequent intervals specifically to deter human activities. Scientific monitoring programmes may function as a similar deterrent through the regular presence of officials on a beach.
Many studies report anecdotal evidence of reduced poaching while beaches are being patrolled, but few studies actually test the effect of patrols formally.
See also: Threat: Human intrusions and disturbance – Use nest covers to protect against human disturbance.

3547: Deploy fishing gear at different depths
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Deploying fishing gear at different depths may reduce interactions with aquatic reptiles and subsequent entanglements and unwanted catch (‘bycatch’). For example, nets may be partially submerged and allow access to the surface, or lines may be set at depths outside of the foraging range of key species. However, the feasibility of this intervention will depend on the type of fishery and the ecology of the target species.
See also: Modify fishing gear to reduce mortality in the event of unwanted catch.

Key Messages:

Three studies evaluated the effects of deploying fishing gear at different depths on reptile populations. One study was in each of Canada, off the coast of Mexico and the Atlantic.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Survival (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired study in Canada found that no turtles died in floated nets, but some died in submerged nets.
Condition (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired study in Canada found that turtles caught in floated nets were less at risk of drowning than those caught in submerged nets.

BEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)
OTHER (3 STUDIES)

Unwanted catch (3 studies): Two of three studies (including two replicated studies) in Canada, Mexico and the Atlantic found that bottom-set fishing nets with fewer buoys caught fewer sea turtles than standard nets or that fewer loggerhead turtles were caught when longline hooks were set below 22 m deep, but the number of leatherback turtles caught was unaffected by hook depth. The other study found that floated and submerged nets caught a similar number of turtle species.

3548: Set commercial catch quotas
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Commercial fishing and harvest quotas (such as ‘Total Allowable Catch’) are a means by which many governments and local regulatory bodies regulate biological resources i.e. species stocks. Setting catch quotas for specific fisheries (for instance cod), can potentially reduce the pressure on other species not targeted by the fishery but commonly affected or caught during fishing operations.
See also: Set unwanted catch quotas.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on reptile populations of setting commercial catch quotas.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.

3549: Set unwanted catch quotas
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Fishing can impact reptiles by catching individuals unintentionally or causing injury or death through entanglements in fishing gear. Unwanted catch (‘bycatch’) quotas are used to set catch limits for unwanted species. When the quota for a particular species is reached, the fishery may be closed to all forms of fishing likely to catch that species. This may reduce the pressure on populations of reptiles that are caught accidentally and allow time for populations to recover.
See also: Set commercial catch quotas.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of setting unwanted catch quotas on reptile populations. This study was in the USA.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Survival (1 study): One study in the USA found that following the re-opening of a swordfish long-line fishery with turtle catch limits in place, loggerhead turtle bycatch reached the annual catch limit in two of three years, and when the limit was reached the fishery was closed for the rest of the year.

3552: Reduce duration of time fishing gear is in the water
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Reducing the length of time that the gear is left in the water (‘soak time’) reduces the opportunity for aquatic reptiles to become entangled in fishing gear. It may also reduce mortality rates, because when reptiles become entangled they are unable to reach the surface to replenish oxygen levels and so may drown.
See also: Limit the number of fishing vessels or fishing days in an area and Limit the length of fishing gear or density of traps in an area.

Key Messages:

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Retaining buoys and lines at the sea floor or riverbed when not hauling may reduce the risk of marine and freshwater reptiles becoming entangled in vertical lines within the water column. Buoy lines may be kept coiled on the fishing pot or trap until they are remotely released to the surface by fishers for hauling (e.g. Partan & Ball 2016). Automatic or timed-release systems may also be used.

3556: Retain offal on fishing vessels instead of discarding overboard
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Many fishing boats prepare fish onboard, after catching them, in order to maximise the catch that can be stored. The offal (waste) is then normally discarded overboard. Discarding offal overboard during fishing may attract aquatic reptiles and increase the risk of entanglement or capture in gear. Retaining offal on board or disposing of offal at locations and times away from fishing operations may reduce this risk.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on reptile populations of retaining offal on fishing vessels instead of discarding overboard.

Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Fishers commonly share information through social relationships, and this may lead to increased fishing success (Turner et al. 2014). However, knowledge exchange between fishers could also be used as a tool to help promote sustainable practices, particularly if the central fishers in information-sharing networks can be identified and co-opted to assist managers in the spreading of conservation information (Mbaru & Barnes 2017).

3559: Use circle hooks instead of J-hooks
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Sea turtles are vulnerable to being hooked in the mouth or swallowing hooks on longline fishing hooks when foraging for bait attached to the hooks. They may also be hooked in the body or become entangled in the longlines when swimming in the vicinity of lines that have been set.
Three main types of fishing hooks are typically used in longline fisheries: J-hooks, tuna hooks, and circle hooks. J-hooks are shaped like a ‘J’, with the hook point parallel to the hook shaft. Circle hooks are more rounded than J-hooks with the hook point turned in so that it is at right-angles to the hook shaft (FAO 2009). Tuna hooks are shaped in between a J-hook and a circle hook.
Using circle hooks may reduce unwanted catch compared to J-hooks because they are wider and so may be less likely to fit into a turtle’s mouth. They may also reduce the incidences of turtles swallowing hooks, thereby increasing the chances of turtles surviving after being caught and released (Ryder et al. 2006).
This action includes studies that discuss comparisons between different types of circle hook with different types of J-hook. See Use non-offset hooks, Use non-ringed hooks, and Use larger hooks for studies that specifically test these variations in hook design. See also Modify number of hooks between floats on longlines.

Survival (3 studies): Two studies (including one replicated, controlled, paired study) off the coast of Hawaii and in the north-east Atlantic Ocean found that survival of loggerhead and leatherback turtles and leatherback and hard-shell sea turtles caught by circle hooks or J-hooks was similar. One review of studies in five pelagic longline fisheries found that fewer sea turtles died when circle hooks were used compared to J-hooks in four of five fisheries.
Condition (3 studies): Two replicated, controlled studies in the Mediterranean Sea and south-western Atlantic Ocean found that fewer immature loggerhead turtles and loggerhead turtles swallowed circle hooks compared to J-hooks. One before-and-after study off the coast of Hawaii found that a lower percentage of loggerhead and leatherback turtles were deeply hooked by circle hooks compared to J-hooks.

OTHER (11 STUDIES)

Unwanted catch (11 studies): Seven of 10 studies (including six replicated, controlled studies) in the Pacific, Atlantic, Atlantic and North Pacific and Mediterranean and one review of studies in five pelagic longline fisheries found that circle hooks or circle hooks and tuna hooks caught fewer sea turtles than J-hooks, or that non-offset G-style circle hooks caught fewer leatherback and hard-shell sea turtles that offset J-Hooks. One of these studies also found that circle hooks caught slightly larger loggerhead turtles than J-hooks, and one also found that offset Gt-style circle hooks caught a similar number of leatherback and hard-shell sea turtles compared to offset J-hooks. One study found that circle hooks caught a similar number of leatherback, green and olive ridley turtles compared to J-hooks. One study found that fish-baited circle hooks caught fewer loggerhead and leatherback turtles than squid-baited J-hooks. The review found mixed effects of using circle hooks compared to J-hooks on unwanted catch of sea turtles depending on the fishery. The other study found mixed effects of using circle hooks or J-hooks in combination with squid or fish bait on the number of loggerhead and leatherback turtles that were caught.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Abandoned, lost or otherwise discarded fishing gear (or ‘ghost’ gear) is a major threat to aquatic reptiles. Sea turtles in particular are at risk of becoming entangled in ‘ghost’ gear, such as nets, lines and ropes resulting in injury or death (Stelfox et al. 2016). Synthetic materials used for fishing gear, such as nylon, may persist for decades leading to an accumulation of ‘ghost’ gear in marine and freshwater environments. Biodegradable fishing gear, which is naturally broken down by microbes or ultraviolet light, may offer an alternative to traditional materials (Kim et al. 2016) and help to reduce the impact of ‘ghost’ gear on reptiles. The degraded products of biodegradable materials (carbon dioxide, methane, water) also have no impact on marine ecosystems, unlike synthetic materials which eventually degrade into microplastics.

The hook points on non-offset hooks lie along the same plane as the hook shaft, whereas the points on offset hooks are bent sideways and out of alignment with the hook shaft (usually within 25ᵒ). As a result, offset hooks may be more likely to catch turtles in the mouth or on the body than non-off set hooks.
Studies in this action specifically test whether non-offset hooks are more, or less likely to catch sea turtles than offset hooks. For studies that compare using different types of circle hooks to different types of J-hooks, see: Use circle hooks instead of J-hooks.
See Use non-ringed hooks and Use larger hooks for studies that specifically test the effect of using these variations in hook design. See also See also Modify number of hooks between floats on longlines.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Oil spills are an obvious threat in marine and aquatic environments because the oil spreads quickly through the water column and can contaminate beaches and other coastal habitats.  There are a number of different methods that can be used in an attempt to contain or recover the spill including: open-water mechanical recovery using booms and skimmers, offshore dispersant application using chemical dispersants, off-shore in situ burning, manual and mechanical clean-up to collect and dispose of contaminated sand or soil, and bioremediation using nutrients, aeration or bacteria to speed up natural breakdown of the oil (Huff & Shigenaka 2003). Different methods vary in number of ways, including cost, efficiency, time taken, amount of oil recovered, as well as impact on wildlife (Dave & Ghaly 2011).

3575: Rehabilitate reptiles following oil spills
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Oil spills are an obvious threat in marine and aquatic environments because the oil spreads quickly through the water column. The oil clings to animals, remains long-term in the environment, and is often ingested. Heavily oil-covered or chronically oil-exposed turtles may have respiratory, skin and shell problems. Oiled turtles are also known to have increased white blood cell counts, reduced red blood cell counts, increased numbers of immature red blood cells, acute inflammation of skin and mucosal surfaces (Lutcavage et al. 1995).  Long-term consequences of oil exposure are not well understood, but a high incidence of embryo deformity is known from turtle populations with chronic oil exposure (Bell et al. 2006). Other long-term indirect problems may include delayed mortality due to hindgut bacterial death in marine iguanas (Wikelski et al. 2002) and an increase in disease (Milton et al. 2003).
Reptiles may be rescued, rehabilitated and released back into the wild following oil spills to mitigate the negative effects of exposure.

Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Ringed hooks are made of two parts: the hook itself which is connected to a separate ring that attaches to the line. Non-ringed hooks are in one piece that attaches directly to the line. Ringed hooks tend to be more mobile when underwater and this added mobility may increase the likelihood of sea turtles being caught.
Studies in this action specifically test whether non-ringed hooks are more or less likely to catch sea turtles than ringed hooks. For studies that compare using different types of circle hooks to different types of J-hooks, see: Use circle hooks instead of J-hooks.

3584: Install exclusion devices on fishing gear: Sea turtles
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Aquatic reptiles may become trapped or entangled in fishing nets (e.g. trawl nets, hoop nets, fyke nets) and traps. Exclusion devices, such as grids, mesh, funnels, rings, or rectangular inserts, can be installed in an attempt to reduce the number of non-target animals that are caught.
Due to the number of studies found, this action has been split by species group. See here for: Tortoises, terrapins, side-necked & softshell turtles; Snakes & lizards or Crocodilians.
For studies that discuss the effect of using devices that allow reptiles to escape from fishing gear, see Install escape devices on fishing gear, and for studies on the effect of using a combination of exclusion and escape devices see Install exclusion and escape devices on fishing gear.

3585: Reduce pesticide, herbicide or fertilizer use 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Agricultural land often receives high chemical inputs to control pests, weeds and fungal infections, and to fertilize crops. These chemicals also enter water bodies through spray drift or run off. These chemicals may impact reptiles through reducing plant and insect diversity, direct toxicity, and endocrine disruption.
The toxic effects of many organochlorine pesticides are well-studied in reptiles (e.g. DDT, diazion). Turtle species may be most risk from pesticide use because of their long life-span leading to bioaccumulation effects (Wagner et al. 2015). Endocrine disruptors in the environment are usually associated with polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) contamination, both of which have been banned in many parts of the world. There are strong associations between organochlorine contamination and feminisation in alligators Alligator mississippiensis (Guillette et al. 1994) and mortality in turtles (Eisenreich et al. 2009). Despite the bans, problems for wildlife have continued due to the persistence of the contaminants in the environment.
The direct impact of fertilizers on reptiles may very between species (e.g. Marco et al. 2004; De Solla & Martin 2007), but by altering plant communities in waterways and other surrounding habitats, they may have important indirect impacts on reptile populations.
Organic farming, an agricultural system that excludes the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides and relies on techniques such as crop rotation, compost and biological pest control, is included within this intervention.

Background information and definitions:
Intensive agriculture constitutes a major source of pollution to marine and freshwater environments. Agricultural waste and pollutants can enter rivers and other watercourses and be discharged into the sea. Excess nutrients from agricultural waste can lead to diminished water quality and eutrophication events, including harmful algal blooms. Some species used in aquaculture can naturally improve water quality through feeding (e.g. filter feeding species, such as mussels) or through photosynthesis (e.g. algae species). Establishing certain types of aquaculture near polluted areas may help to remove excess nutrients (Duarte & Krause-Jensen 2018).

Metals and trace elements from fly-ash may be accumulated in the bodies of a range of reptile species with potentially harmful effects (Rowe et al. 2002). Removing the waste from coal combustion may help to reduce the exposure of reptiles to these harmful pollutants.

3595: Set regulatory ban on marine burial of persistent environmental pollutants, including nuclear waste
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Historically, a range of persistent environmental pollutants have been intentionally disposed of in the marine environment.  The disposal of nuclear and radioactive waste at sea was practised by 13 countries from 1946 until 1993, and other pollutants, including the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), have been disposed of at sea in large quantities. A range of national laws and international treatise have sought to end the disposal of such pollutants into the marine environment, though enforcement is lacking in parts of the world, where illegal dumping is reported to occur. Setting pre-emptive regulatory bans on the sub-sea burial of persistent environmental pollutants may help prevent the occurrence of associated threats to aquatic and semi-aquatic reptiles.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on reptile populations of setting regulatory bans on marine burial of persistent environmental pollutants, including nuclear waste.

3616: Change hook baiting technique
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
How bait is connected to a hook may affect the likelihood of reptiles swallowing the bait and hook together. Changing the baiting technique may involve using whole bait instead of smaller chunks or changing the way that the bait is threaded onto a hook. Single baiting involves putting a fishing hook once through the bait item, whereas thread baiting involves threading the hook through the bait multiple times. As a result, it may be easier for reptiles to strip bait off fishing gear without swallowing the hooks when single baiting is used. Similarly, whole bait rather than chunks of bait may be more easily removed by reptiles.

3622: Modify fishing gear to reduce reptile mortality in the event of unwanted catch
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Reptiles are vulnerable to drowning when caught in fishing gear and unable to escape. Modifying gear to allow reptiles to reach the surface may keep reptiles alive should they be caught incidentally in fishing gear.
For studies describing the effects of modifying the depth at which fishing gear is deployed, see Deploy fishing gear at different depths.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on reptile populations of using modified gear to reduce reptile mortality in the event of unwanted catch. This study was in the USA.

3623: Use low intensity lighting
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Sea turtle hatchlings generally orient away from high silhouettes (dunes, trees) and towards brighter, lower horizons (light reflecting on the ocean). Artificial light is generally brighter than natural light from the moon and stars and not scattered by the atmosphere and thus interferes with the sea-orienting behaviours of sea turtle hatchlings. Using lower intensity lighting may mitigate some of the impact of increased levels of ambient artificial light near to nesting beaches.
See also: Change the colour (spectral composition) of lighting.

Four studies evaluated the effects of using low intensity lighting on reptile populations. Three studies were in the USA1-3 and one was in Malaysia4.

BEHAVIOUR (4 STUDIES)

Behaviour change (4 studies): One replicated, controlled study in the USA1 found that reducing the intensity of light sources did not improve loggerhead turtle hatchling seaward orientation. One replicated, site comparison study in Malaysia4 found that green turtle hatchlings in low and moderate ambient artificial light took more direct crawl routes to the sea than hatchlings released in high ambient artificial light. One replicated, controlled study in the USA3 found that in laboratory trials, loggerhead and green turtle hatchlings showed reduced preference for lower intensity light sources. One replicated, site comparison study in the USA2 found mixed effects of embedding streetlights in the road on seaward orientation of loggerhead turtle hatchlings compared to overhead lighting depending on shading by shrubs and weather and lunar phase.

3624: Release accidentally caught (‘bycatch’) reptiles
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
After reptiles have become caught in nets or traps, or hooked on lines, it may be possible to rehabilitate and release individuals depending on the extent or severity of any injuries incurred. Ideally rehabilitation and releases would follow established best practice guidelines to maximise survival rates and ensure each individual is sufficiently healthy prior to release. 
For studies that test different methods for safely releasing accidentally captured reptiles, see also Establish handling and release procedures for accidentally captured or entangled (‘bycatch’) reptiles. For studies where injured reptiles were rehabilitated prior to release, see Species management – Rehabilitate and release injured or accidentally caught individuals.

Key Messages:

Three studies evaluated the effects on reptile populations of releasing accidentally caught reptiles. One study was in each of the Caribbean Sea, Costa Rica and the Republic of Korea.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Survival (2 studies): One replicated study in the Caribbean Sea found that from a released group of green turtles that included some accidentally caught and some head-started individuals, some survived for at least several months in the wild. One replicated study in the Republic of Korea found that green turtles caught in pound nets all survived for at least two weeks to a year after release.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)

Behaviour change (1 study): One controlled study off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica found that the behaviour of longline-caught sea turtles following release was broadly similar to free-swimming turtles.

3627: Thin trees within forests
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Thinning is a forestry practice where selective removal of trees is used to increase the size and health of remaining trees in both wild-harvested and plantation forests. Ecological thinning (pre-commercial thinning) is a variant of thinning used in forest conservation where the primary aim is to increase growth of trees, but the secondary aim is to develop or improve wildlife habitat (e.g. hollows, sun gaps).
For studies of the effect of prescribed fires on their own and in combination with vegetation cutting, see Threat: Natural system modifications – Use prescribed burning and Use prescribed burning in combination with vegetation cutting; Use prescribed burning in combination with herbicide application and Use prescribed burning in combination with grazing.

Key Messages:

Six studies evaluated the effects of thinning trees within forests on reptile populations. Three studies were in the USA and one was in each of Brazil, Spain and Australia.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Richness/diversity (3 studies): Two replicated, controlled studies (including one randomized study) in the USA and Spain found that areas of thinned forest had similar reptile species richness compared to areas with no thinning. One study also found that thinned areas had lower species richness than areas of open habitat. One replicated, controlled study in Australia found that areas of forest thinned 8–20 years previously had higher diversity of reptiles than areas thinned less than eight or more than 20 years previously, or than areas with no thinning.

POPULATION RESPONSE (6 STUDIES)

Abundance (6 studies): Two of four replicated, controlled studies (including two randomized studies) in Brazil, the USA, and Spain found that areas of thinned forest had a similar abundance of reptiles compared to areas with no thinning. One study found mixed effects of thinning trees on the abundance of three lizard species. The other study found that areas of thinned forest had a higher abundance of reptiles than areas with no thinning. That study also found that areas with the most thinning had a similar abundance of reptiles compared to areas of open habitat. One replicated, controlled study in Australia found that areas of forest thinned 8–20 years previously had a higher abundance of reptiles than areas thinned at other times or areas with no thinning. One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the USA found that areas of thinned forest had a higher abundance of snakes than clearcut forest.

Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Sea turtle hatchlings generally orient away from high silhouettes (dunes, trees) and towards brighter, lower horizons (light reflecting on the ocean). Artificial light is generally brighter than natural light from the moon and stars and not scattered by the atmosphere and so may interfere with the sea-orienting behaviours of sea turtle hatchlings. Changing the spectral composition of artificial light, for example using yellow rather than white lighting, may therefore mitigate some of the impact of increased levels of ambient light near to nesting beaches.

3629: Coppice trees
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Coppicing is a management practice typical of Eurasian northern temperate zone deciduous woodlands and wood pastures, in which stems of tree species, such as hazel Corylus avellana and sweet chestnut Castanea sativa, are cut near ground level once every few years, often in defined coppice compartments. These then regrow from the cut ‘stool’ giving a sustainable yield of woody material harvested on a rotational basis. Coppicing maintains a mosaic of woodland areas with differing amounts of daylight reaching the forest floor and, therefore, promotes a variety of ground vegetation conditions. This may benefit reptiles that require either open canopy woodland or a mix of open and more closed woodland in close proximity. Coppicing has declined over the last century and some former coppice woodlands are no longer actively managed.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of coppicing trees on reptile populations. This study was in the UK.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the UK found that no slow worms or common lizards were found in coppiced areas of woodland, whereas they were found in open areas maintained by vegetation cutting.

3630: Retain riparian buffer strips during timber harvest
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Retaining forest strips along water courses or around ponds during timber harvest can help mitigate the effects of habitat loss and disturbance for forest species. They can also help sustain the microclimate and reduce potential problems such as soil erosion. Retained habitat strips also provide corridors for dispersal.

3634: Use patch retention harvesting instead of clearcutting
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Removing trees, through clearcutting or clearfelling is likely to have substantial effects on reptiles, through alteration of habitat and removal of food and shelter. Patch retention is the act of leaving groups of trees during harvesting, which may act as refugia to support forest fauna and enable its recolonization of the remainder of the forest as it regrows.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of using patch retention harvesting instead of clearcutting on reptile populations.

3636: Use shelterwood harvesting
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Shelterwood harvesting is a management technique designed to obtain even-aged forests. It involves harvesting trees in a series of partial cuts, with trees removed uniformly over the plot. This allows new seedlings to grow from the seeds of older trees. This can help to maintain distinctive forest species and increase forest structural diversity.

3637: Use selective logging
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Selective logging is a more ecologically sustainable practice than clearcutting, which entails removing all trees at the same time. The idea behind selective logging is to maintain an uneven or all-aged forest of trees varying not only in age, but in size and species as well. Selective logging of mature forest involves targeting the harvest of trees based on specific criteria. This might be based on size of tree, tree health, or tree species, for example.

Key Messages:

Three studies evaluated the effects of using selective logging in forests on reptile populations. One study was in each of Brazil, the USA and Mexico.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Mexico found that areas with low intensity selective logging tended to have similar reptile species richness compared to areas with high intensity selective logging.

POPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Abundance (2 studies): One of two replicated, randomized, controlled studies (including one before-and-after study) in Brazil and the USA found that selective logging intensity had mixed effects on the abundance of three lizard species. The other study found that areas with selective logging had similar reptile abundance compared to areas with combined clearcutting and thinning.

Background information and definitions:
The effects of summer (e.g. Moore et al. 2006) or winter (Sato et al. 2013) human recreational activity on reptiles can be negative (Larson et al. 2016). Different reptile species may tolerate different levels of disturbance, but it may lead to behaviour changes (Nyhof et al. 2015), nest abandonment (Moore et al. 2006), physical damage to reptiles or nests, or the displacement of individuals or populations.  For vulnerable species or nests it may be possible to reduce the impacts of human disturbance using signs or access restrictions in areas subject to high use. Reducing access may also help reduce the risk of human introduction of non-native plants, animals or disease.

3646: Use prescribed burning: Forest, open woodland & savanna
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Fire is an integral part of the management and natural dynamics of some ecosystems. Some habitats are naturally fire-prone, and others have been shaped by long-term use of prescribed burning (Bowman 1998). Prescribed burns are undertaken to reduce the amount of combustible fuel in an attempt to reduce the risk of more extensive, potentially more damaging, ‘wildfires’. They may also be used in the maintenance or restoration of habitats historically subject to occasional wildfires that have been suppressed through management or with the expressed purpose of enhancing wildlife habitat (Russell et al. 1999). Whilst burning can have a dramatic effect on the landscape, reducing cover and short-term food resources, the intensity of the fire may influence the response of reptiles to the prescribed burn–low-intensity fires may reduce shelters and prey availability while high-intensity fires may increase prey food items but reduce over wintering sites (Pearson et al. 2005). The impact of prescribed burning on habitats and their associated reptile populations are likely to vary depending on whether the vegetation is dominated by woody species, or by grasses and other herbaceous plants. As such, the impact of prescribed burning on reptile populations may vary in different habitats.
Due to the number of studies found, this action has been split by habitat type. See here for: Grassland & shrubland or Wetland. 
For studies that assess the affect of burning in combination with other actions see Use prescribed burning in combination with vegetation cutting; Use prescribed burning in combination with herbicide application and Use prescribed burning in combination with grazing.

Background information and definitions:
Global warming is prompting poleward and uphill shifts in species’ ranges (e.g. Chen et al. 2011). Species reliant on particular habitats may suffer population declines if they are unable to move towards higher latitudes and if there is no suitable habitat available at higher altitudes. Protecting habitat along elevational gradients may allow reptiles to naturally expand their ranges with climatic changes.

3651: Use prescribed burning: Grassland & shrubland
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Fire is an integral part of the management and natural dynamics of some ecosystems. Some habitats are naturally fire-prone, and others have been shaped by long-term use of prescribed burning (Bowman 1998). Prescribed burns are undertaken to reduce the amount of combustible fuel in an attempt to reduce the risk of more extensive, potentially more damaging, ‘wildfires’. They may also be used in the maintenance or restoration of habitats historically subject to occasional wildfires that have been suppressed through management or with the expressed purpose of enhancing wildlife habitat (Russell et al. 1999). Whilst burning can have a dramatic effect on the landscape, reducing cover and short-term food resources, the intensity of the fire may influence the response of reptiles to the prescribed burn–low-intensity fires may reduce shelters and prey availability while high-intensity fires may increase prey food items but reduce over wintering sites (Pearson et al. 2005). The impact of prescribed burning on habitats and their associated reptile populations are likely to vary depending on whether the vegetation is dominated by woody species, or by grasses and other herbaceous plants. As such, the impact of prescribed burning on reptile populations may vary in different habitats.
Due to the number of studies found, this action has been split by habitat type. See here for: Forest, open woodland & savanna or Wetland.
For studies that assess the affect of burning in combination with other actions see Use prescribed burning in combination with vegetation cutting; Use prescribed burning in combination with herbicide application and Use prescribed burning in combination with grazing.

Key Messages:

Fourteen studies evaluated the effects of using prescribed burning in grassland and shrubland on reptile populations. Seven studies were in the USA, four were in Australia and one was in each of South Africa, Argentina and France.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (6 STUDIES)

Community composition (1 study): One replicated, before-and-after study in Australia found that reptile species composition was different before and immediately after burning in three grass types and remained different after vegetation grew back in one of three grass types.
Richness/diversity (5 studies): Two of three studies (including one replicated, controlled, before-and-after study) in South Africa, Argentina and the USA found that areas with annual burning had similar reptile species richness and diversity compared to unburned areas or that richness was similar across areas with a range of burn frequencies. The other study found that burned areas had higher reptile species richness than unburned areas. One replicated, site comparison study in Australia found that areas burned 1–4 years earlier had lower reptile species richness than areas burned 11–15 years earlier. One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that areas with different burn frequencies had similar reptile species richness and diversity.

Two studies found that burning had mixed effects on the abundance of different reptile species and western yellow-bellied racer snakes.The other study found that burned areas had more eastern massasauga rattlesnakes than unburned areas. One replicated, site comparison study in Australia found that areas burned 1–4 years earlier had a lower abundance of reptiles than areas burned 11–15 years earlier. One controlled before-and-after study in the USA found that a burned area had a similar number of four snake species compared to when the area was managed by mowing. One site comparison study in France found that one reptile species was less abundant in areas managed by burning than areas grazed by sheep, whereas the abundance of five other species was similar in all areas. One replicated, before-and-after study in Australia found that immediately after burning, the abundance of reptiles was lower than before burning, but was similar after vegetation grew back. One replicated, randomized, site comparison study in Australia found that small-scale patch burning was associated with increased abundance of sand goanna burrows.

In some environments, fires can damage important habitats, particularly if habitat patches are small or fragmented, meaning that entire patches can be destroyed in fires. Fire breaks are ploughed, open or unplanted gaps of land around the perimeters of, or spaced within, areas of forest, grassland or farmland intended to prevent the spread of fire, thereby protecting important habitats.  While the primary purpose of creating firebreaks may be top prevent the spread of fire, the open areas created could act as suitable habitat for some species, or present barriers to the movement of others.

3659: Put out wildfires
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
In some environments, fires can damage important habitats, particularly if habitat patches are small or fragmented, meaning that entire patches can be destroyed in fires. The impacts of large-scale wildfires may result in significant changes to species diversity and community composition in those areas that are affected (Rochester et al. 2010), though the effects of fires and differing fire histories on reptile species, species richness and community composition can be variable and difficult to predict (Lindenmayer et al. 2008 and references therein).
Testing this intervention may present a number of challenges, not least the potential need to allow some wildfires to burn that would have otherwise been put out. Practitioners should therefore carefully consider the harms that could be caused to people’s health and livelihoods by allowing wildfires to burn, as well as the harms to other species and habitats.

Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Legally protecting habitat may reduce its conversion and degradation by humans. This may in turn serve to maintain or slow the decline of the abundance and diversity of reptiles that make use of that habitat.
Assessing the effectiveness of protected areas is particularly difficult. For example, protected and unprotected areas used for comparison might start off with different quality habitats (protection often being granted to the best quality habitat). Protected areas are also more likely to be in remote areas, so less accessible to threats such as harvesting (Joppa & Pfaff 2009). Finally, effectiveness is best monitored over long timescales, but this increases the chance that other factors influence the ecosystem. The most reliable studies would compare similar quality protected and unprotected areas over time, and possibly correct for some of the biases.
Due to the number of studies found, this action has been split by species group. See here for sea turtles.

POPULATION RESPONSE (16 STUDIES)

Abundance (13 studies): Six of 11 studies (including five replicated, site comparison studies) in the USA, Canada, Hong Kong, Mexico, Australia, South Africa, Argentina, the border of Zambia and Zimbabwe and Pakistan found that protected areas had a higher abundance of reptiles, tortoises, Nile crocodiles and combined reptiles and amphibians than areas with less or no protection. Four studies found mixed effects of protection on the abundance of reptiles and big-headed turtles. The other study found that water bodies in protected areas had fewer eastern long-necked turtles than those in suburban areas. One site comparison study in Brazil found that areas with community-based management of fishing practices, which included protecting river turtle nesting beaches, had more river turtles than areas that did not manage fishing practices. One site comparison study in Madagascar found that the abundance of different sized radiated tortoises in a protected area was more similar to that of an exploited population than to an unexploited population.
Occupancy/range (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in Argentina found that Argentine tortoises were found in one of two protected areas and two of three unprotected areas. One before-and-after study in Brazil found that most reptile species were still present 20 years after an area was protected.
Survival (2 studies): One replicated, randomized, site comparison study in the USA found that in areas with greater protections, survival of Agassiz’s desert tortoises was higher than in areas with less protections. One replicated, site comparison study in Spain found that roads running through protected areas had more reptile road deaths than roads in unprotected areas.

3663: Retain connectivity between habitat patches 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Habitat fragmentation, as well as destruction, may be an important driver of population declines. Small areas hold fewer species than large ones and if individuals are unable to cross areas of converted habitat then populations in separate habitat patches will become isolated. This potentially makes them more vulnerable to extinction, from natural variations in birth and death rates or sex ratios, from inbreeding depression and from outside pressures, both natural (such as storms or wildfires) and man-made (such as hunting or continued habitat loss), although the precise effects of habitat fragmentation, as opposed to loss, are debated (e.g. Fahrig 1997).
Theoretically, the number of species surviving in a habitat fragment is determined by its size and its effective distance to other habitat patches (MacArthur & Wilson 1967). Maintaining habitat connectivity is therefore often seen as a way to increase the viability of populations, but there is considerable debate as to the effectiveness of such ‘wildlife corridors’ (e.g. Beier & Noss 1998).
Studies describing the effects of creating or restoring habitat, rather than retaining what is already there, are in Habitat restoration and creation.

3669: Restore or maintain beaches (‘beach nourishment’)
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Building soft structures (‘beach nourishment’) such as sand dunes, or filling in eroded beaches with replacement sand may counteract coastal erosion, increase resilience to storms and protect wildlife (Nordstrom et al. 2000, Klein et al. 2001). Nourished beaches may also provide nesting sites for sea turtles and so the construction process and the type of fill should be carefully considered to as to maintain the natural beach erosion cycle and provide suitable habitat (e.g. Speybroeck et al. 2006).

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that gopher tortoise densities were higher and numbers occupying burrows similar on constructed sand dunes compared to natural dunes.
Reproductive success (2 studies): Two controlled, before-and-after studies in the USA found that one year after adding sand to beaches, nesting activity decreased more for loggerhead turtles, and loggerhead and green turtles compared to on unmodified beaches. Two years after nourishment, both studies found that loggerhead nesting activity had increased, and in one study nesting had returned to pre-nourishment levels.

BEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)

Use (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that burrows on a constructed dune were discovered by gopher tortoises after three months.
Behaviour change (1 study): One controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that one year after adding sand to beaches, loggerhead turtles made more non-nesting crawls than on unmodified beaches, but the difference was smaller two years after nourishment.

3670: Armour shorelines to prevent erosion
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Shorelines are armoured to prevent shoreline retreat, a natural process where waves erode coastlines. These physical structures range from relatively temporary systems such as sandbags to permanent structures such as rock walls, seawalls, living seawalls and offshore breakwaters. Armouring shorelines may benefit reptiles if it leads to the protection of habitats used by reptiles (e.g. nesting beaches) that would otherwise be lost to erosion.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of armouring shorelines to prevent erosion on reptile populations.

Background information and definitions:
Predators can drive declines or local extinctions of vulnerable reptile species. Non-native predators may be a particular problem for native reptiles that lack sufficient predator avoidance behaviours. Native predators can also threaten populations of reptiles that persist in low numbers. Removing or controlling predators, especially native predators, for the benefit of their wild prey species can be a controversial management strategy. Nonetheless, there is potential for such management to lead to increases in the abundance, survival or reproductive success for species of conservation concern.
Due to the number of studies found, this action has been split by species group, though no studies were found for amphisbaenians.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (4 STUDIES)

Reproductive success (4 studies): Two before-and-after studies (including one controlled study) in the USA found that on islands where raccoons and feral pigs or only feral pigs were eradicated, fewer loggerhead and loggerhead and green turtle nests were predated than before predator control began. One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the USA found that controlling raccoons on short sections of a beach resulted in similar predation of loggerhead turtle nests compared to in sections of the beach with no control. One before-and-after study in the USA found that disruptions to a programme controlling raccoons and armadillos resulted in more predation of loggerhead, leatherback and green turtle nests.

Reproductive success (7 studies): Six of seven studies (including four replicated, controlled studies) in Australia and the USA found that in areas with mammal or fire ant control, and in two cases with fencing, fewer tortoise, turtle and terrapin nests were predated compared to areas with no control, or before control began. Two studies also found that predation increased again a year after control or in the second year of control. The other study found that following short-term fox control, a similar number of artificial eastern long-necked turtle nests were predated by foxes compared to before control began.
Survival (3 studies): Two of three replicated, controlled studies (including one before-and-after study and one randomized study) in Australia and the USA found that in a fenced area with mammal or fire ant control, more gopher tortoise hatchlings survived for one year or at least 150 days compared to fenced areas with no control. The other study found mixed effects of fox control on survival of Murray short-necked turtles and broad-shelled turtles depending on turtle species, age and sex.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)

3682: Use education and/or awareness campaigns to improve behaviour towards reptiles and reduce threats
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Education programmes or awareness raising campaigns may be devised to address some of the threats posed to reptiles by humans. Such programmes may be aimed at a wide range of audiences, such as tourists, local residents, farmers or other businesses, and may tackle a wide range of threats, from exploitation through hunting, to the trade in exotic pets. In some cases, reptiles are protected by regulations and laws, but these may be difficult to enforce. Some infringements may be difficult to detect, whilst in other cases, people may be unaware of their responsibilities under such rules. Campaigns may be designed to increase compliance with laws, to encourage reporting of infringements (e.g. illegal hunting) or to reduce behaviours that can be a threat to reptiles (e.g. consumption of products derived from wild reptiles). Interventions may be carried out at a range of scales, from specific groups, largely through one-to-one interactions and targeted education programmes, through to large scale campaigns that spread awareness through broadcast and social media, signs and leaflets.
The effects of programmes may be measured in terms of the response of target species or in terms of changes in human behaviour that directly impact the magnitude of the threat.

Reproductive success (15 studies): Eight of 14 studies (including 10 replicated, controlled studies) in the USA, Turkey, Qatar, Indonesia, Cape Verde, Australia and Costa Rica found that sea turtle, loggerhead, hawksbill and artificial sea turtle nests with artificial covers were predated less frequently than nests with no covers. Three studies found that covering sea turtle nests had mixed effects on predation, depending on predator species or year. One study found that loggerhead turtle nests with artificial covers were predated more frequently than nests with no covers. One study found that olive ridley turtle nests with and without artificial covers were all predated. The other study found that predation attempts of green and hawksbill turtle nests with artificial covers were similar compared to nests with no cover, but that predation success was affected by the cover design. Three studies also found that sea turtle and loggerhead turtle nests with artificial covers had higher hatching success than nests with no covers. One study also found that loggerhead turtle nests with artificial covers had similar hatching and emergence success compared to nests with no covers. One replicated, controlled study in Greece found that covering loggerhead turtle nests had mixed effects on hatching success compared to nests with no covers.

POPULATION RESPONSE (7 STUDIES)

Reproductive success (7 studies): Two replicated studies (including one controlled study) in the Galápagos and the USA found that Galápagos giant tortoise nests surrounded by rock-walled corrals and bog turtle nests covered with cages were predated less frequently than unprotected nests. Two replicated studies (including one randomized, controlled study) in Canada and the USA found that nests of painted and snapping turtles and bog turtles covered with cages had similar hatching success compared to nests left uncovered. One of two replicated controlled studies (including one randomized study) in Canada and the USA found that painted and snapping turtle nests protected by three different cage types were predated a similar amount. The other study found mixed effects of different cage designs on predation rate of artificial nests at a diamondback terrapin nesting site. One replicated, before-and-after study in the USA found that diamondback terrapin nests covered by a nest box with an electrified wire were predated less frequently than nests under a box with no wire. One before-and-after study in the USA found that over half of eggs from bog turtle nests covered with cages in an area grazed by cattle hatched successfully. One replicated, controlled study in the USA found that diamondback terrapin nests covered with cages had hatching success of 55–93%, and 83–100% of uncaged nests were predated.

Background information and definitions:
Invasive plants can out compete established plant species and alter habitat structure. This may alter resource availability for reptiles. Some reptile species may benefit but, for others, invasive plants may reduce available food or shelter or change the nature of the environment such that they are at increased risk of predation. Removal or control of non-native invasive plants may be carried out in an attempt to reverse these effects.

Invasive amphibians such as the cane toad Bufo marinus pose a threat to predatory reptiles (including crocodiles, snakes, varanid and scincid lizards) due to their toxicity (Shine & Wiens 2010). Reductions of predatory reptiles caused by cane toads may also have knock-on effects that lead to wider changes in native reptile communities (Feit et al. 2020).

3700: Use conditioned taste aversion to prevent carnivorous reptiles from eating toxic invasive cane toads 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Conditioned taste aversion as a conservation tool was originally developed to protect eggs and nests of birds and reptiles from predation (Maguire et al. 2010). In such cases, chemicals are placed on or near either real or artificial eggs or nests with the aim of teaching a predator population that eggs are distasteful or cause sickness. More recently, a novel use of conditioned taste aversion has been used in the case of native carnivorous reptiles and mammals eating the introduced and highly toxic cane toad Rhinella marina in Australia. In this case, conditioned taste aversion has been used with the aim of teaching the native populations that cane toads are distasteful or cause sickness and thus are not prey items. For other uses of conditioned taste aversion, see Protect nests and nesting sites from predation using conditioned taste aversion.

3705: Legally protect reptile species 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Legal protection can be given to species on a national or international scale. Levels of protection vary for species and may include protection against killing, capturing, disturbing or trading, or damaging or destroying breeding sites or resting places. Legal protection may be complete (for example no take) or partial (for example limitations to harvest that are seasonal or location specific).
Depending on the level of protection, individual species protection may mean that habitats are also protected. This means that activities such as development that are likely to affect protected species and their habitat may be against the law and require licences from a government licensing authority.
Other studies that discuss legal protection of reptiles are included in Threat: Biological resource use – Regulate wildlife harvesting and Habitat protection – Protect habitat. For studies that look at the effect of specific action plans for species recovery see Develop/implement species recovery plans.

3706: Translocate adult or juvenile reptiles: Sea turtles
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Translocations involve the intentional capture, movement and release of wild-caught reptiles into the wild to re-establish a population that has been lost, or to augment an existing population. This can reduce the risk of inbreeding; help safeguard small populations from extinction due to catastrophic events and/or increase the occupied range. Translocations can also be used to move reptiles to areas where threats have been removed, such as islands where invasive predators have been eradicated. However, translocations are typically expensive and may risk spreading pathogens to previously unexposed areas.
Release techniques vary considerably, from ‘hard releases’ involving the simple release of individuals into the wild, to ‘soft releases’ that involve a variety of adaptation and acclimatisation techniques before release or post-release feeding and care.
This action includes studies which may combine different release techniques, but studies that explicitly test these different techniques are summarized separately under Use holding pens or enclosures at release site prior to release of wild reptiles; Use holding pens or enclosures at release site prior to release of captive-bred reptiles and Release reptiles into burrows.
This action includes the translocation of wild juvenile or adult reptiles. Relocations of eggs and nests, releases of captive bred individuals and releases of head-started individuals (reptiles of wild-origin reared in captivity prior to release) are discussed under: Relocate nests/eggs; Release captive-bred reptiles into the wild; Head-start wild-caught reptiles for release and Release reptiles born/hatched in captivity from wild-collected eggs/wild-caught females without rearing. For studies that release reptiles outside of their native range see Release reptiles outside of their native range.
Translocations that are carried out to mitigate against specific threats (for example translocating problem individuals away from a specific area, or translocating individuals away from development areas) are summarized under Mitigation translocations – Translocate problem reptiles; Translocate reptiles away from threats and Temporarily move reptiles away from short-term threats.
Due to the number of studies found, this action has been split by species group, though no studies were found for amphisbaenians. See here for: Tortoises, terrapins, side-necked & softshell turtles; Snakes; Lizards; Crocodilians or Tuatara.

This action includes studies which may combine different release techniques, but studies that explicitly test these different techniques are summarized separately under Use holding pens or enclosures at release site prior to release of wild reptiles; Use holding pens or enclosures at release site prior to release of captive-bred reptiles and Release reptiles into burrows.
This action includes the translocation of wild juvenile or adult reptiles. Relocations of eggs and nests, releases of captive bred individuals and releases of head-started individuals (reptiles of wild-origin reared in captivity prior to release) are discussed under: Relocate nests/eggs; Release captive-bred reptiles into the wild; Head-start wild-caught reptiles for release and Release reptiles born/hatched in captivity from wild-collected eggs/wild-caught females without rearing. For studies that release reptiles outside of their native range see Release reptiles outside of their native range.
Translocations that are carried out to mitigate against specific threats (for example translocating problem individuals away from a specific area, or translocating individuals away from development areas) are summarized under Mitigation translocations – Translocate problem reptiles; Translocate reptiles away from threats and Temporarily move reptiles away from short-term threats.
Due to the number of studies found, this action has been split by species group, though no studies were found for amphisbaenians. See here for: Sea turtles; Snakes; Lizards; Crocodilians or Tuatara.

Key Messages:

Twenty-six studies evaluated the effects of translocating tortoises, terrapins, side-necked & softshell turtles on their populations. Sixteen studies were in the USA, two were Global and one was in each of Italy, the Seychelles, Madagascar, Cameroon, Egypt, China, Jordan and France.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (24 STUDIES)

Abundance (4 studies): One replicated study and one of two global reviews reported that three of eight translocations of turtles resulted in established populations and 15 of 47 reptile translocations resulted in stable or growing populations (review included both wild-caught and captive bred animals). The other review (both wild-caught and captive bred animals) reported that one of five translocation of tortoises and snapping turtles was unsuccessful and four had unknown outcomes. One study in the Seychelles found that 47% of translocated Aldabra giant tortoises were found 12 years after releaser.
Reproductive success (5 studies): One global review reported that successful reproduction was found in three of five translocations of tortoises and snapping turtles (review included both wild-caught and captive bred animals). Two of three studies (including one replicated, randomized study) in the USA, Italy and Madagascar reported successful reproduction in translocated populations of gopher tortoises and radiated tortoises. The other study reported no evidence of reproduction for three years following a translocation of European pond turtles. One replicated study in the USA found that translocated female Agassiz’s desert tortoises bred successfully following release, but all hatchlings were sired by resident tortoises, not translocated males.
Survival (16 studies): Two of four controlled studies (including one replicated study) in the USA found that translocated eastern box turtles and Eastern painted turtles had lower survival than resident turtles. The other two studies found that translocated desert tortoises and musk turtles had similar survival to that of resident turtles. One replicated study in the USA found that translocated gopher tortoises released into temporary enclosures had similar survival compared to head-started tortoises also released into temporary enclosures over four years. Five of 11 studies (including two replicated, controlled studies) in the USA, Italy, Cameroon, Egypt, China, Jordan and France reported that 69–100% of 3–40 translocated individuals survived for monitoring periods of one month to two years. Four studies reported that 19–43% of 15–109 translocated individuals survived for 2–3 years. The other two studies reported that 0–1% of 15 and 249 translocated individuals survived for up to a year.
Condition (3 studies): One controlled study in the USA found that translocated Eastern painted turtles lost more body mass than resident turtles. One controlled, before-and-after, replicated study in the USA found that translocated desert tortoises had similar stress levels compared to resident tortoises. One study in the USA found that one translocated Blanding’s turtle grew over a two-year period following release.

BEHAVIOUR (9 STUDIES)

Use (2 studies): Two replicated studies (including one controlled study) in the USA found that one of 13 translocated gopher tortoises returned to its point of capture, and no Agassiz’s desert tortoises translocated &gt;5 km returned to their point of capture.
Behaviour change (7 studies): Two of six studies (including three replicated, controlled studies) in the USA and Jordan found mixed effects on the movement of translocated red-eared slider turtles in spring or autumn and on the movement and home range size of translocated eastern box turtles compared to residents. Two studies found that four measures of behaviour of translocated musk turtles and home range size of translocated spur-thighed tortoises were similar to residents. One study found that translocated gopher tortoises moved more and had larger home ranges than resident tortoises. The other study found that after ephemeral ponds dried up, translocated Eastern painted turtles did not move to new ponds whereas resident turtles did. One replicated study in France found that the home ranges of translocated European pond turtles were smaller in the year after release compared to the year they were released.

3710: Release animals that modify landscapes (e.g. ecological engineers)
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Some species modify landscapes (‘ecosystem engineers’) through browsing, grazing, trampling (e.g. African elephants Loxodonta africana) or intentionally redesigning the physical environment (e.g. European beavers Castor fiber). African elephants maintain open wooded grasslands through damage to trees, which increases crevice availability and possibly insect prey for the arboreal gecko Lygodactylus keniensis (Pringle 2008), while black-tailed prairie dog Cynomys ludovicianus and European rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus burrows provide habitat for reptiles (Kretzer & Cully 2001, Bravo et al. 2009). Reintroducing ecosystem engineers where they have become locally extinct may support reptile species that depend on the habitats that these species provide.
In some situations (e.g. where species lost from landscapes have gone extinct) releasing replacement species may be the only option. For example, giant tortoises may be introduced to islands to restore habitat and ecosystem function in the place of the extinct native species (Griffiths et al. 2009). However, releasing non-native species is an inherently risky process, and the potential for negative consequences caused by such releases should be carefully considered beforehand.

3711: Manage vegetation using livestock grazing 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Using grazing to manage vegetation can limit succession that would otherwise lead to an increase in woody plant species and may create microhabitat diversity through trampling. This may help to increase the abundance of reptile species that depend on early-succession and diverse habitats.
Here we present studies that use grazing to target both native and non-native species.
For studies discussing the impacts of different grazing regimes in agricultural environments, see Threat: Agriculture – manage grazing regime: Wetlands and Forest, open woodland & savanna and Threat: agriculture – cease livestock grazing.
For studies discussing the effects of managing vegetation by cutting, using herbicide or by hand, see Manage vegetation by cutting or mowing; Manage vegetation using herbicides and Manage vegetation by hand (selective weeding).

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects of managing vegetation using livestock grazing on reptile populations. One study was in France and one was in the USA.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Abundance (1 study): One site comparison study in France found that one reptile species was more abundant in areas grazed by sheep than in areas managed by burning, whereas the abundance of five other species was similar in all areas.
Reproductive success (1 study): One before-and-after study in the USA found that after grazing cattle to restore bog turtle habitat, along with providing artificial nest covers, more bog turtle eggs were laid and hatching success was higher than before.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)

3712: Manage vegetation using herbicides
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Herbicides can be used as a substitute for prescribed fire to eliminate competing mid-story or ground vegetation. Although herbicides do not have the multiple ecosystem functions provided by fire, they have some advantages such as increased selectivity and decreased risk of offsite fire damage.
Here we present studies that remove both native and non-native species. Studies that investigate the effects of removing vegetation as one of a combination of restoration management actions are discussed in the actions under the subsection Whole habitat restoration.
For studies that use herbicide in combination with prescribed burning, see Threat: Natural system modifications – Use prescribed burning in combination with herbicide application.
For studies discussing the effects of grazing as part of habitat restoration, see Manage vegetation using livestock grazing. For studies discussing the effects of managing vegetation by cutting or by hand, see Manage vegetation by cutting or mowing and Manage vegetation by hand (selective weeding).

Key Messages:

Seven studies evaluated the effects of managing vegetation using herbicides on reptile populations. Four studies were in the USA, two were in Australia and one was in the US Virgin Islands3.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Community composition (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after study in Australia found that areas where an invasive shrub was sprayed with herbicide had similar composition of reptile species compared to unsprayed areas.
Richness/diversity (3 studies): Three replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after studies in Australia and the USA found that areas where vegetation was treated with herbicides had similar richness of reptile species or combined reptile and amphibian species compared to areas not treated with herbicide.

POPULATION RESPONSE (6 STUDIES)

Abundance (4 studies): Three of four studies (including three replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after studies) in the USA and Australia found that areas where vegetation was treated with herbicides had similar abundance of all or most reptiles compared to areas not treated with herbicide. The other study found that after glyphosate was applied to pond vegetation, fewer mangrove salt marsh snakes were found compared to immediately before application.
Reproductive success (2 studies): One of two controlled studies (including one replicated study and one randomized study) in the USA and US Virgin Islands found that exposure of red-eared slider eggs to high levels of glyphosate caused a reduction in hatching success. The other study found that leatherback turtle nests in areas treated with herbicide had similar hatching and emergence success compared to nests in untreated areas.
Survival (1 studies): One randomized, controlled study in the US Virgin Islands found that in areas treated with herbicide, fewer leatherback turtle hatchlings became entangled in vegetation than in untreated areas.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)

Use (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in Australia found that pink-tailed worm-lizards were not found in restored rocky areas treated with herbicide, but were found in restored areas not treated with herbicide.

3713: Manage vegetation by cutting or mowing
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Vegetation may be managed by cutting or mowing as part of habitat restoration to reduce shading or prevent natural succession where specific habitat types are desired, or where invasive species are out-competing native species. A range of tools may be used for such management, from machetes and billhooks, to chainsaws, strimmers and brush cutters.
Removing vegetation may also be used as a substitute for prescribed fire to eliminate competing mid-storey or ground vegetation. Although this technique does not have the multiple ecosystem functions provided by fire, it has advantages, such as increased selectivity and decreased risk of offsite fire damage.
Here we present studies that remove both native and non-native species, ranging from grasses and other herbaceous plants, to woody shrubs and canopy vegetation. Studies that investigate the effects of removing vegetation as one of a combination of restoration management actions are discussed in the actions under the subsection Whole habitat restoration.
For studies that combine cutting or mowing vegetation with prescribed burning, see Threat: Natural system modifications – Use prescribed burning in combination with vegetation cutting.
For studies discussing the effects of grazing as part of habitat restoration, see Manage vegetation using livestock grazing. For studies discussing the effects of managing vegetation by hand or using herbicides, see Manage vegetation by hand (selective weeding) and Manage vegetation using herbicide.

Key Messages:

POPULATION RESPONSE (5 STUDIES)

Abundance (4 studies): Three of four replicated, controlled studies (including three randomized studies) in the USA found that areas where vegetation was managed by cutting had similar reptile abundance compared to areas with no cutting. The other study found that densities of eastern Massassauga rattlesnakes were higher after cutting during the first three years, but similar after four years.
Condition (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after study in Spain found that an adapted brush cutter caused less damage to tortoise carcasses than a conventional brush cutter.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDIES)

Use (2 studies): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in Australia found that after cutting back canopy vegetation, reptiles used unshaded rocks more often than shaded rocks in winter but not spring.

3715: Clear or open patches in forests
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Clearings in forests and woodland can be natural features that add diversity to the habitat. They can be created by natural events, such as mature trees falling, and maintained by grazing animals. In absence of natural clearings (such as in a younger forest) artificially removing canopy vegetation may mimic the same conditions.

Key Messages:

Six studies evaluated the effects of removing canopy to create clearings on reptile populations. Two studies were in the USA and one was in each of Sweden, Australia, the UK and France.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in Australia found that rocky outcrops where trees were removed had higher reptile species richness than overgrown outcrops, and similar richness to outcrops that were naturally sun exposed.

POPULATION RESPONSE (5 STUDIES)

Abundance (4 studies): One of four replicated studies (including three controlled studies) in Sweden, Australia, the UK and the USA found that after clearings and sand patches were created, sand lizard colonized, abundance then declined, but then increased once more, larger clearings were created. One study found that more slow worms and common lizards were found in open areas of woodland maintained by vegetation cutting compared to in coppiced areas. One study found that areas with reduced canopy had more eastern Massassauga rattlesnakes in the first three years after cutting than uncut areas, but similar numbers after four years. The other study found that removing trees from rocky outcrops had mixed effects on reptile abundance.
Occupancy (1 study): One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in France found that forest areas where the canopy had been opened up were more likely to be occupied by asper vipers than areas with closed canopy.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)

Behaviour change (1 study): One before-and-after study in the USA found that clearing a patch of canopy in a forest did not affect spotted turtle home range size.

3716: Translocate adult or juvenile reptiles: Snakes
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Translocations involve the intentional capture, movement and release of wild-caught reptiles into the wild to re-establish a population that has been lost, or to augment an existing population. This can reduce the risk of inbreeding; help safeguard small populations from extinction due to catastrophic events and/or increase the occupied range. Translocations can also be used to move reptiles to areas where threats have been removed, such as islands where invasive predators have been eradicated. However, translocations are typically expensive and may risk spreading pathogens to previously unexposed areas.
Release techniques vary considerably, from ‘hard releases’ involving the simple release of individuals into the wild, to ‘soft releases’ that involve a variety of adaptation and acclimatisation techniques before release or post-release feeding and care.
This action includes studies which may combine different release techniques, but studies that explicitly test these different techniques are summarized separately under Use holding pens or enclosures at release site prior to release of wild reptiles; Use holding pens or enclosures at release site prior to release of captive-bred reptiles and Release reptiles into burrows.
This action includes the translocation of wild juvenile or adult reptiles. Relocations of eggs and nests, releases of captive bred individuals and releases of head-started individuals (reptiles of wild-origin reared in captivity prior to release) are discussed under: Relocate nests/eggs; Release captive-bred reptiles into the wild; Head-start wild-caught reptiles for release and Release reptiles born/hatched in captivity from wild-collected eggs/wild-caught females without rearing. For studies that release reptiles outside of their native range see Release reptiles outside of their native range.
Translocations that are carried out to mitigate against specific threats (for example translocating problem individuals away from a specific area, or translocating individuals away from development areas) are summarized under Mitigation translocations – Translocate problem reptiles; Translocate reptiles away from threats and Temporarily move reptiles away from short-term threats.
Due to the number of studies found, this action has been split by species group, though no studies were found for amphisbaenians. See here for: Sea turtles; Tortoises, terrapins, side-necked & softshell turtles; Lizards; Crocodilians or Tuatara.

The other review reported that the outcome of one indigo snake reintroduction was unknown. One replicated study in the USA found that five of 13 translocations of snakes resulted in established populations. Three studies in Canada and Antigua reported that 3–7 years after translocations of red-sided garter snakes and Antiguan racer snakes, greater numbers were counted.
Reproductive success (3 studies): One global review reported that breeding occurred in nine of 22 reptile translocations (of both wild-caught and captive bred animals). Two studies in Antigua reported successful reproduction in translocated populations of Antiguan racer snakes three years after release.
Survival (8 studies): Three controlled studies in the USA and Australia found that translocated timber rattlesnakes, northern water snakes and dugite snakes had lower survival than resident snakes, and in one study no translocated snakes survived a year. One controlled study in the USA found that ratsnakes held in captivity for 1–7 years before release had lower survival compared to snakes held for 7–18 days or resident snakes. Four studies (including one replicated, controlled study) in Canada, the USA and South Korea reported that 12–45% of snakes survived for three months to eight years after release.

POPULATION RESPONSE (16 STUDIES)

Abundance (10 studies): Three of four reviews that were global and in New Zealand and the Caribean reported that 13–32% of reptile or lizard translocations resulted in stable or growing populations (both wild-caught and captive bred animals). The other review reported that populations from eight of 13 iguana translocations survived for at least 5–20 years. Two of six studies (include one site comparison study) in St. Lucia, the Bahamas and New Zealand reported that translocated lizard populations increased over 3–10 years. Two studies reported that translocated populations remained stable for one and 6–12 years. One study reported that a translocated population declined over 1–2 years.

BEHAVIOUR (9 STUDIES)

Use (9 studies): Nine studies (including one replicated, controlled study and one randomized, controlled study) in the USA, the UK, Australia, New Zealand and Italy found that artificial refuges were used by reptiles, common lizards, adders, common geckos, species of skinks, and by an ocellated lizard to lay a clutch of eggs. Four of the studies also found that some reptiles showed a preference for refuges with certain designs or construction materials.

3722: Translocate adult or juvenile reptiles: Crocodilians
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Translocations involve the intentional capture, movement and release of wild-caught reptiles into the wild to re-establish a population that has been lost, or to augment an existing population. This can reduce the risk of inbreeding; help safeguard small populations from extinction due to catastrophic events and/or increase the occupied range. Translocations can also be used to move reptiles to areas where threats have been removed, such as islands where invasive predators have been eradicated. However, translocations are typically expensive and may risk spreading pathogens to previously unexposed areas.
Release techniques vary considerably, from ‘hard releases’ involving the simple release of individuals into the wild, to ‘soft releases’ that involve a variety of adaptation and acclimatisation techniques before release or post-release feeding and care.
This action includes studies which may combine different release techniques, but studies that explicitly test these different techniques are summarized separately under Use holding pens or enclosures at release site prior to release of wild reptiles; Use holding pens or enclosures at release site prior to release of captive-bred reptiles and Release reptiles into burrows.
This action includes the translocation of wild juvenile or adult reptiles. Relocations of eggs and nests, releases of captive bred individuals and releases of head-started individuals (reptiles of wild-origin reared in captivity prior to release) are discussed under: Relocate nests/eggs; Release captive-bred reptiles into the wild; Head-start wild-caught reptiles for release and Release reptiles born/hatched in captivity from wild-collected eggs/wild-caught females without rearing. For studies that release reptiles outside of their native range see Release reptiles outside of their native range.
Translocations that are carried out to mitigate against specific threats (for example translocating problem individuals away from a specific area, or translocating individuals away from development areas) are summarized under Mitigation translocations – Translocate problem reptiles; Translocate reptiles away from threats and Temporarily move reptiles away from short-term threats.
Due to the number of studies found, this action has been split by species group, though no studies were found for amphisbaenians. See here for: Sea turtles; Tortoises, terrapins, side-necked & softshell turtles; Snakes; Lizards or Tuatara.

3724: Use holding pens or enclosures at release site prior to release of wild reptiles
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Holding pens or enclosures at release sites may be used (sometimes termed ‘soft release’) to enable reptiles to become accustomed to new surroundings before release and may contain some natural habitat and burrows. Pens or enclosures may increase the chance that released animals will settle at the release site, potentially increasing the chance that the release will be successful.
This action discusses studies that test the effectiveness of placing wild-caught translocated individuals into holding pens prior to release. See also: Use holding pens or enclosures at release site prior to release of captive-bred reptiles.

Key Messages:

Seven studies evaluated the effects of using holding pens or enclosures at release sites prior to release of wild reptiles. Four studies were in the USA and one study was in each of Australia, New Zealand and the UK.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (5 STUDIES)

Reproductive success (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in New Zealand found that in a site where jewelled geckos were translocated into holding pens prior to release, more gravid females were found compared to a site where holding pens were not used.
Survival (4 studies): Two of three controlled studies (including one replicated study) in the USA and the UK found that gopher tortoises translocated into holding pens with artificial burrows prior to release or viviparous lizards released into an enclosure had higher survival (recaptured) or assumed survival (dug burrows) than individuals released without pens or enclosures. The other study found that translocating eastern box turtles into holding pens, or keeping them in pens for longer, did not affect post-release survival. One replicated study in the USA found that survival of Florida sand skinks within holding pens with different combinations of habitat features (trees, shade cloth, woody debris) ranged from 49–79% over two years.
Condition (1 study): One randomized, controlled study in the UK found that viviparous lizards released into an enclosure had similar body condition compared to those released without an enclosure.

BEHAVIOUR (4 STUDIES)

Behaviour change (4 studies): Two of three controlled studies (including two replicated studies) in the USA and New Zealand found that gopher tortoises and jewelled geckos translocated into holding pens prior to release dispersed away from the release site less frequently than those not held in pens. One study also found that the activity area of tortoises held in pens was smaller in the year of release, but similar in the year after release, compared to those not held in pens. The other study found that translocating eastern box turtles into holding pens, or keeping them in pens for longer, did not affect post-release dispersal behaviour. One controlled study in Australia found mixed effects on a range of behavioural measures of translocating pygmy bluetongue lizards into holding pens with artificial burrows for one day compared to five days.

Background information and definitions:
Some reptiles rely on burrows to provide shelter from predators or weather extremes. Providing burrows as part of releasing translocated reptiles increases the suitability of the release habitat and reduces the immediate requirements on individuals (which may already be stressed from the translocation process) to find suitable shelter in a novel environment.

3727: Translocate problem reptiles
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Some species may come into conflict with humans due to real or perceived risks of interacting with them (e.g. venomous or carnivorous reptiles) or due to nuisance behaviours. Retaliation by humans may limit the persistence of these species close to human settlements. Relocating individuals to alternative locations where the potential for interaction with humans is reduced may be desirable in situations where the alternative is euthanasia. Typically, mitigation translocations of problem individuals involve moving low numbers of animals a minimum necessary distance away from where they were collected.

Key Messages:

Seven studies evaluated the effects on reptile populations of translocating problem individuals. Two studies were in each of Australia and Canada, one was in each of the USA and Hong Kong and one was conducted across multiple countries.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (6 STUDIES)

Abundance (1 study): One global review found that when using recruitment to the adult population as a measure of success, mitigation translocations (of both problem reptiles and moving away from threats) failed more often than those carried out for conservation or research purposes.
Survival (5 studies): Two of four controlled studies (including two replicated studies) in Australia, Canada and Hong Kong found that survival of translocated problem tiger snakes and massasauga rattlesnakes was similar to resident snakes for six months or until hibernation. One study found that more translocated problem dugite snakes died within two months than resident snakes. The other study found mixed effects on survival of translocating problem white-lipped pit vipers compared to resident snakes. One controlled study in the USA found that two of seven translocated problem Gila monsters died within 1–24 months of translocation.

BEHAVIOUR (4 STUDIES)

Behaviour change (4 studies): Two controlled studies (including one replicated study) in Australia found mixed effects on movement behaviour and home range size of translocating problem tiger snakes and dugite snakes compared to resident snakes. One randomized, controlled study in Canada found that translocated massasauga rattlesnakes moved further from release points after two days than snakes released at their point of capture, but distances were similar after 18 days. One controlled study in the USA found that the home ranges of problem Gila monsters translocated &gt;1 km were similar in size to those translocated &lt;1 km.

OTHER (5 STUDIES)

Human-wildlife conflict (5 studies): Three of five controlled studies (including three replicated studies) in the USA, Australia, Canada and Hong Kong of translocations of problem Gila monsters, tiger snakes and western rattlesnakes found that at least some returned to their point of capture or moved in to adjacent suburban areas within a month. One of the studies found that while all problem Gila monsters translocated &lt;1 km returned to their point of capture, none of those translocated &gt;1 km returned. The other two studies found that no massasauga rattlesnakes or problem white-lipped pit vipers returned to their point of capture.

3728: Translocate reptiles away from threats: Sea turtles
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Translocations are sometimes carried out to remove individuals from specific threats within their range, for example away from development areas (‘mitigation translocation’). Mitigation translocations may be carried out as a preventative measure to protect individuals but have been criticized for prioritising the process of removing individuals above establishing viable populations of translocated individuals in the destination location (Sullivan et al. 2014). A number of issues should be carefully considered before carrying out such translocations, including whether the proposed release site contains suitable habitat; whether the release of additional animals at an occupied site could negatively impact on the resident population; and whether a translocation alone can mitigate the impact of losing suitable habitat due to a development or other threat.
Due to the number of studies found, this action has been split by species group, though no studies were found for amphisbaenians. See here for: Tortoises, terrapins, side-necked & softshell turtles; Snakes & lizards; Crocodilians or Tuatara.

Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Ponds are often drained, left to dry or degraded during the development of agriculture or expansion of urban areas or other land uses. Ponds created to improve wildlife habitat, e.g. for fish or frogs, may also used by reptiles such as snakes and turtles (Adams & Saenz 2011). Restoration of ponds may therefore help to increase populations of reptiles that are dependent on ponds. Ponds may be restored (or maintained to prevent desiccation) by deepening, de-silting, or re-profiling activities, planting new or managing existing vegetation to provide appropriate shading levels and basking sites for reptiles, and adding woody debris.

Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Rock outcrops are home to a diverse range of highly specialised species (Goldingay & Newall 2017) but may be removed or degraded. Retaining rocky outcrops or structures is important for rock-dwelling reptiles as rocks provide a variety of microhabitats, including crevices, overhangs and suitable temperature shelter sites (Michael et al. 2010). Where rocks or rock piles have been removed they may be rebuilt and restored, and sometimes artificial rocks are used.

They are home to high levels of biodiversity; however biodiversity is disproportionately threatened on islands compared to continental areas, with 61% of all extinct and 37% of all critically endangered species endemic to islands (Tershy et al., 2015).  Restoration efforts often incorporate multiple actions such as: native vegetation planting, removal of invasive species, beach restoration and translocating native or surrogate fauna to re-establish ecosystem function across the whole island. The outcomes of island restoration are often realised over long timescales and study results should be considered with this in mind.
This action includes studies that have carried out a large combination of different interventions to restore the whole island ecosystem, including both plant and animal communities.
Studies discussing the effectiveness of individual actions or actions carried out on only parts of an island are covered elsewhere. For example, replanting vegetation (Plant native species), removing invasive or problematic species (Threat: Invasive or problematic species), or species reintroductions (Species Management).

Key Messages:

Three studies evaluated the effects of restoring island ecosystems on reptile populations. One study was in each of the Seychelles, the USA and the US Virgin Islands.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Occupancy/range (1 study): One study in the US Virgin Islands found that following translocation to a restored island, St. Croix ground lizards expanded their range during the fifth to seventh year after release.
Reproductive success (2 studies): One study in the Seychelles found that following a range of interventions carried out to restore an island ecosystem, the number of hawksbill and green turtle nests increased. One replicated study in the USA found that during and after an island was rebuilt, diamondback terrapins continued to nest on the island.

3737: Create or restore grasslands 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Many grasslands have been lost to agricultural intensification through conversion to cropland or through agricultural abandonment, which may result in colonization by scrub or woodland. Agri-environment schemes in Europe and North America support the preservation or restoration of grasslands for agricultural, conservation and carbon storage reasons. Restoration of these grasslands may benefit some reptile species that are associated with them.

Key Messages:

Four studies evaluated the effects of creating or restoring grasslands on reptile populations. One study was in each of South Africa, China, Australia and the USA.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Richness/diversity (2 studies): One replicated, controlled study in Mongolia found that areas of restored grassland had similar species richness compared to unrestored areas. One replicated, site comparison study in South Africa found that an area of restored grassland had lower species richness than natural grassland in three of four comparisons.

POPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Abundance (3 studies): One of two replicated, controlled studies (including one paired study) in Mongolia and the USA found that areas of restored grassland had higher lizard abundance than unrestored areas. The other study found that areas of restored grassland had fewer snakes than unrestored areas. One replicated, site comparison study in South Africa found that an area of restored grassland had a similar abundance of reptiles compared to two areas of natural grassland.

3738: Release reptiles outside of their native range
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Releasing species outside of their native range can be controversial, though may be considered when the former range has become unsuitable, or when populations are unable track changing environmental conditions. In addition, it may be appropriate to release animals outside of their original native range in order for them to act as ecological surrogates for analogous species that have become extinct.
This action includes studies involving translocations of wild reptiles and releases of captive-bred reptiles.

Key Messages:

Seven studies evaluated the effects of releasing reptiles outside of their native range on their populations. Three studies were in the US Virgin Islands and one was in each of the USA, Mauritius, the Galápagos and New Zealand.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (7 STUDIES)

Abundance (1 study): One replicated study in the US Virgin Islands found that following a translocation of St. Croix ground lizards to a new island, the population grew over a 10-year period.
Occupancy/range (2 studies): One replicated, randomized study in the US Virgin Islands found that following a release outside of their native range, St. Croix ground lizards were still present five years later. One randomized study in the US Virgin Islands found that following a release outside of their native range, the area occupied by a population of St. Croix ground lizards increased from the 5th to 7th year following release.
Reproductive success (3 studies): Three studies (including two replicated studies) in Maritius, the US Virgin Islands and New Zealand found that following releases outside of their native ranges, there was evidence of reproduction in released populations of Aldabra giant tortoises and Madagascar radiated tortoises, St. Croix ground lizards and Otago skinks after 11 months and 5–7 years.
Survival (3 studies): Two studies (including one replicated, before-and-after study) in the Galápagos and New Zealand found that following releases outside of their native ranges, 77% of sterilized Galápagos giant tortoises and 63% of Otago skinks survived for 11 months or one year. One study in the USA found that annual survival of a second group of gopher tortoises translocated to an island was lower for newly released tortoises compared to established individuals from a previous release when the island had been outside of the native range.
Condition (1 study): One replicated, before-and-after study in the Galápagos found that sterilized Galápagos giant tortoises translocated outside of their native range as part of an ecological replacement gained weight during the first year following their release as.

3740: Rehabilitate and release injured or accidentally caught individuals: Sea turtles
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Reptiles that are injured, sick or found in a weak condition are sometimes taken in by wildlife rehabilitators, to be treated and released back into the wild. Animals may be injured or weakened due to direct interactions with human threats, for example entanglement in fishing gear, or due to natural threats such as extremes of weather caused by climate change (for example sea turtles may become ‘cold-shocked’ due to sudden severe cold weather). Often rehabilitation is carried out more for animal welfare reasons than for species conservation. However, for rare species it may be essential to preserve populations and release of such animals may provide opportunities for choosing where to augment populations. The success of such programmes can be difficult to judge without benchmark data for survival of wild-reared reptiles. It is also important to note that some of the studies summarized below have small sample sizes, and that unsuccessful attempts are less likely to have been reported.
Due to the number of studies found, this action has been split by species group, though no studies were found for amphisbaenians. See here for: Tortoises, terrapins, side-necked & softshell turtles; Snakes & lizards; Crocodilians or Tuatara.
For studies evaluating the effect of releasing reptiles that were accidentally caught in fishing gear, see Threat: Biological resource use – Establish handling and release procedures for accidentally captured or entangled (‘bycatch’) reptiles and Release accidentally caught (‘bycatch’) reptiles.

Survival (4 studies): One study in the Philippines and one controlled study in the western Mediterranean found that of 79 rehabilitated sea turtles two were found dead and two alive within 1–5 months of release, and six rehabilitated loggerhead turtles survived for at least five months following release. Two studies in the USA found that around one third of stranded sea turtles and 96% of sea turtles caught in fishing gear could be rehabilitated and released. One study also found that the chance of surviving the rehabilitation process varied with species.

Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Captive breeding involves taking wild animals into captivity and establishing and maintaining breeding populations. It tends to be undertaken when wild populations become very small or fragmented or when they are declining rapidly. Captive populations can be maintained while threats in the wild are reduced or removed and can provide an insurance policy against catastrophe in the wild. Captive breeding also potentially provides a method of increasing reproductive output beyond what would be possible in the wild. However, captive breeding can result in problems associated with inbreeding depression, removal of natural selection and adaptation to captive conditions. The aim is usually to release captive-bred animals back to natural habitats, either to original sites once conditions are suitable, to reintroduce species to sites that were occupied in the past or to introduce species to new sites. Some captive populations may also be used for research to benefit wild populations.
Due to the number of studies found, this action has been split by species group, though no studies were found for amphisbaenians. See here for other species groups.

3752: Restore beaches
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Beach restoration may include vegetation management or removal of debris to maximise nesting site availability and access for reptiles. The process of dune re-mobilization is one commonly used management technique, though data is often insufficient for evaluating the impact of this intervention on reptile populations (e.g. Hill et al. 2018).
Studies that discuss physical rebuilding of beaches, for example by bringing sand to replenish a beach (‘beach nourishment’) are discussed in Threat: Natural system modifications – Restore or maintain beaches (‘beach nourishment’). Studies that discuss beach stabilization to protect against severe weather are discussed in Threat: Natural system modifications – Armour shorelines to prevent erosion.

3753: Breed reptiles in captivity: Snakes – Vipers
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Captive breeding involves taking wild animals into captivity and establishing and maintaining breeding populations. It tends to be undertaken when wild populations become very small or fragmented or when they are declining rapidly. Captive populations can be maintained while threats in the wild are reduced or removed and can provide an insurance policy against catastrophe in the wild. Captive breeding also potentially provides a method of increasing reproductive output beyond what would be possible in the wild. However, captive breeding can result in problems associated with inbreeding depression, removal of natural selection and adaptation to captive conditions. The aim is usually to release captive-bred animals back to natural habitats, either to original sites once conditions are suitable, to reintroduce species to sites that were occupied in the past or to introduce species to new sites. Some captive populations may also be used for research to benefit wild populations.
Due to the number of studies found, this action has been split by species group, though no studies were found for amphisbaenians. See here for other species groups.

3754: Create or restore waterways 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Streams may be drained or redirected during the development of agriculture or expansion of urban areas or other land uses. Many waterways have been cleared of submerged wood (‘desnagging’) for recreational purposes (e.g. fishing) or to allow boat access or protect against perceived flooding risks.
River restoration projects often include returning large woody material into streams and rivers (‘resnagging’), to slow down river flow, provide shelter for native fishes and increase basking areas for reptiles, especially freshwater turtles (Bodie 2001). Other restoration activities may include planting new or managing existing vegetation to provide appropriate shading levels for reptiles, and redirecting water flows.

3755: Create or restore wetlands
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Loss and degradation of wetlands are a major factor contributing to the global decline in reptiles (Gibbons et al. 2000). Many wetlands have been drained and altered to allow for agricultural and urban development. Creating new or restoring wetlands may replace some of the habitat lost and therefore help to maintain and increase populations of reptile species that rely on wetlands.
Creating wetlands for wildlife may involve excavating holes in the ground and damming streams (Adams & Saenz 2011) and bespoke design and planning of different wetland zones, water depths and nutrient flows (Mitsch et al. 1998). Restoring wetlands may involve tree planting, vegetation management to optimise shading and provide basking sites, and/or water flow management.
Studies investigating the creation of individual ponds or waterways are discussed in Create or restore ponds and Create or restore waterways.

Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
During programmes to rear endangered animals in captivity, in preparation for reintroductions into the wild, artificial insemination may be used to initiate pregnancies. The technique may be used instead of natural mating in situations where animals are being kept at different facilities; to increase pregnancy rates; or where natural mating has failed. It may also be carried out using preserved sperm for purposes of maintaining genetic diversity.
Studies included here are those identified by our searches of conservation journals. It is likely that other relevant studies exist in biological journals that specialize in reproduction.

3760: Freeze sperm or eggs for future use
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Captive breeding may result in loss of genetic variation, such that animals that were bred for release back into the wild have reduced fitness. Freezing, or ‘cryopreservation’, of sperm and eggs, allows them to be stored until they are needed. Gene banks can therefore be created for reptiles, ensuring that species’ genetic variation is preserved. It also means that the number of a particular species needed in captivity can be reduced and genes can be swapped between captive facilities. Fewer animals in captivity means that fewer retiles need to be taken from the wild. Freezing can damage cells and so a cryoprotectant, such as dimethyl sulphoxide or glycerol is usually required to protect the cells.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of freezing sperm or eggs for future use on reptile populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.

Incubation temperatures (for example warmer or cooler, constant or fluctuating) can influence the sex, size, shape, colour, behaviour, movement ability and post-hatching growth of reptile hatchlings and newborns (Booth et al. 2006). Practitioners carrying out conservation activities aimed at maximising hatching success, such as relocating eggs for artificial incubation or to on-beach hatcheries, will therefore need to consider the potential impact of temperature during incubation on hatchlings and populations. Human-induced climate change may also influence the sex ratios of some species of reptiles and limit the viability of populations over time.  It may be possible to counter the impacts of climate change on affected populations by managing temperatures during incubation to create appropriate sex ratios.

Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Captive animals do not always breed successfully under artificial conditions. Reproductive technologies such as treatment with hormones or other drugs to induce ovulation or sperm production are techniques that can be used in an attempt to increase breeding success by reptiles in captive facilities. It may be appropriate in some circumstances to use hormone or other treatments on wild individuals, for example when it is not desirable to bring them into captivity. Hormone stimulation protocols are often species specific.

Key Messages:

Nine studies evaluated the effects on reptile populations of using hormones and/or other drugs during captive-breeding programmes to induce reproduction/birth. Three studies were in each of the USA and New Zealand and one study was in each of the Netherlands, China and Japan.

POPULATION RESPONSE (9 STUDIES)

Reproductive success (9 studies): Three of four replicated, controlled studies (including one before-and-after study) in the USA and China found that plains gartersnakes, eastern painted turtles and red-eared sliders induced with oxytocin produced a similar percentage of live young compared to individuals that were not induced and laid eggs with similar hatching success or laid a similar number of eggs compared to what was observed in wild nests. The other study found that 25% of eggs from hormone-injected (luteinizing hormone and gonadotropin) four-eyed turtles were fertile, compared to 7–52% for females that were not injected or injected with a saline solution. One study also found mixed effects of different combinations of hormones and other drugs on inducing 13 turtle species. Five studies (including one before-and-after study) in the Netherlands, New Zealand and Japan found that oxytocin, arginine vasotocin and follicle-stimulating hormone induced egg laying/birth in yellow-headed box turtles, tuatara and common geckos or ovulation in hawksbill turtles. One study also found that only one yellow-headed box turtle female produced fertile eggs.

3768: Release captive-bred reptiles into the wild: Sea turtles
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Captive breeding is normally used to provide individuals that can then be released into the wild (often called ‘reintroduction’) to either re-establish a population that has been lost, or to augment an existing population (‘restocking’).
Release techniques vary considerably, from ‘hard releases’ involving the simple release of individuals into the wild to ‘soft releases’ which involve a variety of adaptation and acclimatisation techniques before release, or post-release feeding and care.
This action includes studies describing the effects of release programmes for captive-bred reptiles that do not specifically test the effectiveness of specific release techniques. For studies that compare specific release techniques see Use holding pens or enclosures at release site prior to release of captive-bred reptiles; Use holding pens or enclosures at release site prior to release of wild reptiles and Release reptiles into burrows.
Due to the number of studies found, this action has been split by species group, though no studies were found for amphisbaenians. See here for: Tortoises, terrapins, side-necked & softshell turtles; Snakes & lizards; Crocodilians or Tuatara.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Reptile nests/eggs may be relocated away from specific threats (e.g. egg collecting, flooding, erosion, predation, or being crushed on roads) and reburied in an alternative suitable natural setting where the threat is lower or non-existent. Consideration must be given to the potential impacts of different environmental conditions in the destination location (for example temperature and humidity) on the sex, size, shape, colour, behaviour, movement ability and post-hatching growth of reptile hatchlings (Warner & Andrews 2002, Booth et al. 2006).
Due to the number of studies found, this action has been split by species group, though no studies were found for amphisbaenians. See here for: Sea turtles; Tortoises, terrapins, side-necked & softshell turtles; Crocodilians or Tuatara.
This action does not include studies on the effect of relocating nests/eggs to on-beach hatcheries, which are designated locations on a beach that are often fenced and patrolled, and where larger numbers of nests/eggs tend to be reburied at relatively high densities. Studies on the effect of moving eggs to on-beach hatcheries are discussed in Relocate nests/eggs to a hatchery.
For studies on the effect of relocating eggs into artificial settings, including in polystyrene boxes and other containers, see Relocate nests/eggs for artificial incubation.
Depending on the threat to nests, practitioners may consider other actions such as Threat: Invasive alien and other problematic species – Protect nests and nesting sites from predation and Threat: Biological resource use – Patrol or monitor nesting beaches.

Abundance (1 study): One global review found that when using recruitment to the adult population as a measure of success, 32% of reptile translocations/releases (releases of captive individuals were 7% of total projects) were successful.
Occupancy/range (1 study): One review in Australia found that two of three releases of captive-bred Western swamp tortoises were classified as successful.
Reproductive success (2 studies): Two studies (including one replicated study) in Italy reported evidence of a gravid female and successful reproduction following release of captive-bred European pond turtles.
Survival (11 studies): Six of nine studies (including two replicated, controlled studies) in Madagascar, the Seychelles, the USA and Italy reported that 66–100% of 5–80 captive-bred tortoises and turtles released into the wild survived over monitoring periods of six months to two years. Two studies reported that 16–20% of 5 and 246 individuals survived over two years. The other study reported that some of over 250 individuals (number not given) were recaptured over a year of monitoring. One study also found captive-bred alligator snapping turtles that were older at their time of release had higher survival than younger turtles. One replicated study in Italy found that annual survival of released captive-bred European pond turtles was 67–91%. One replicated study in Spain and Minorca found that survival of captive-bred Hermann’s tortoises was higher after three years after release into the wild compared to 1–2 years after release. The study also found that after three years, survival of released tortoises was similar to that of wild tortoises in one population, but lower in a second population.
Condition (2 studies): One of two controlled studies (including one replicated study) in the USA found that released captive-bred juvenile alligator snapping turtles grew at a similar rate and achieved higher body condition than juveniles that remained in captivity. The other study found that released alligator snapping turtles had similar body conditions compared to individuals that remained in captivity.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)

Behaviour change (1 study): One randomized study in the USA found that captive-bred Blanding’s turtles released into open water habitat had larger home ranges than those released into places dominated by cattail or willows.

3774: Use holding pens or enclosures at release site prior to release of captive-bred reptiles
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Holding pens or enclosures at release sites (sometimes termed ‘soft release’) may be used to enable reptiles to become accustomed to new surroundings before release and may contain some natural habitat and burrows. Pens or enclosures may increase the chance that released animals will settle at the release site, potentially increasing the chance that the release will be successful. Captive-bred, naïve animals in particular may benefit from the acclimation period that holding pens provide.
This action discusses studies that test the effectiveness of placing captive-bred individuals into holding pens at the release site prior to release. See also: Use holding pens or enclosures at release site prior to release of wild reptiles.

3775: Head-start wild-caught reptiles for release: Sea turtles
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Head-starting is a specialized management technique that raises early-stage reptiles (eggs, hatchlings and/or juveniles) to later life stages (juvenile, sub-adult or adult) in captivity before releasing them into the wild. Rearing animals beyond their most vulnerable stages may increase the chance of survival following release, and as such improve the chances of reintroduction success.
Here we only include those studies where eggs or juveniles were collected from the wild; for those that were bred in captivity see Breed reptiles in captivity and Release captive-bred reptiles in to the wild. See also Release reptiles born/hatched in captivity from wild-collected eggs/wild-caught females without rearing.

Reproductive success (2 studies): Two studies (including one replicated, before-and-after study) in Mexico and the USA found that all 11 head-started Kemp’s ridley turtles bred in the wild following release and head-started turtles that were allowed to crawl to the sea before recapture began laying nests on their beach of origin 10–12 years after release.
Survival (4 studies): One of four studies (including two replicated and two controlled studies) in the Caribbean Sea, Torres Strait near Australia, Gulf of Mexico and Japan reported that all 11 head-started Kemp’s ridley turtles survived at least 11–19 years following release. Two of the studies reported that 1–16% of sea turtles were recaptured 10–27 month or 0.5–13 months following release. The other study found that four head-started hawksbill turtles survived at least 4–9 days, and one survived at least 10 months following release.

Two of the studies reported that annual survival was 80–100% or 3–100% in the year following release but 82–100% in subsequent years. The other study reported that some giant sideneck river turtles survived up to 14 years. Two studies also reported that survival during the captive phase was 91–100%. One study also found that more tortoises head-started in outdoor seaside pens died than did those from indoor pens. One replicated, controlled study in Venezuela found that survival of Arrau turtles during the captive phase was lower for turtles from relocated nests compared to those from nests that were not moved.
Condition (5 studies): One of two replicated studies in the USA found that two-year-old head-started gopher tortoises were larger at their time of release than two-year-old tortoises released in to the wild directly after hatching. The other study found that Agassiz’s desert tortoise hatchlings grew more slowly in captivity than tortoises in the wild. Two studies (including one replicated study) in the USA found that Alabama red-bellied cooters and wood turtles grew during 12–16 months in captivity, and wood turtles showed no signs of shell malformation.

Here we only include those studies where eggs or juveniles were collected from the wild; for those that were bred in captivity see Breed reptiles in captivity and Release captive-bred reptiles in to the wild. See also Release reptiles born/hatched in captivity from wild-collected eggs/wild-caught females without rearing.
Due to the number of studies found, this action has been split by species group, though no studies were found for amphisbaenians. See here for: Sea turtles; Tortoises, terrapins, side-necked & softshell turtles; Snakes & lizards or Crocodilians.

3780: Release reptiles born/hatched in captivity from wild-collected eggs/wild-caught females without rearing
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
In some circumstances, it may be desirable to release hatchlings born in captivity from wild-collected eggs or wild-caught females soon after hatching/birth, rather than rearing them in captivity (see Head-start wild-caught reptiles).
This action includes studies that discuss the outcomes for hatchlings after they have been released. For studies that discuss the effects of relocating eggs or nests for artificial incubation, or relocating nests to on beach hatcheries, see Relocate nests/eggs for artificial incubation; Relocate nests/eggs to a nearby natural setting (not including hatcheries) and Relocate nests/eggs to a hatchery.

Key Messages:

Five studies evaluated the effect on reptile populations of releasing reptiles born/hatched in captivity from wild-collected eggs/wild-caught females without rearing. Four studies were in the USA and one was in Australia.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (5 STUDIES)

Reproductive success (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in the USA found that for plains gartersnakes released as newborns, two of over 350 released snakes were found to be gravid two years after release.
Survival (5 studies): One before-and-after study in the USA found that survival of captive-born desert tortoises released as hatchlings was similar over six months compared to hatchlings that were head-started in indoor or outdoor enclosures. One replicated, controlled study in the USA found that alligator hatchlings released into their mother’s home range had higher survival than those released outside her home range. Three replicated studies (including one controlled study) in Australia and the USA found that 11% of Murray short-necked turtles and 7% of plains gartersnakes survived for 1–3 years after release, and first year survival of gopher tortoise hatchlings released into a predator proof enclosure was around 30%.
Condition (2 studies): One before-and-after study in the USA found that captive-born desert tortoises released as hatchlings grew more slowly over six months than hatchlings head-started in an indoor enclosure. One replicated, controlled study in the USA found mixed effects on growth of alligator hatchlings released inside or outside of their mother’s home range compared to wild hatchlings.

POPULATION RESPONSE (12 STUDIES)

Reproductive success (12 studies): Four of 12 controlled studies (including three replicated, randomized studies) in the USA, Suriname, US Virgin Islands, Costa Rica, Ascension Island, Brazil and Cape Verde found that relocated sea turtle nests had lower hatching success than natural nests in six of seven years, in 26 of 29 years, or lower hatching success than nests laid above the tidal zone, or that nests relocated &gt;10 days after being laid had lower hatching and emergence success than natural nests or nests relocated within 12 hours. One of those studies also found that relocating nests within 12 hours had mixed effects on hatching and emergence success compared to natural nests. One study also found that two different egg collecting methods resulted in either more dead early stage or late-stage embryos. Four of the studies found that relocated sea turtle nests had similar hatching and emergence success or hatching success compared to natural nests and specifically compared to those laid in safer parts of the beach or above the high tide line. One of those studies also found that relocated nests experienced similar levels of predation by ghost crabs as natural nests. One of the studies also found that fewer relocated nests failed completely due to tidal flooding compared to natural nests. One of the studies found that relocated loggerhead turtle nests had higher hatching success than natural nests. One of the studies found that relocated leatherback turtle nests had higher hatching success compared to natural nests that were washed over by sea swells, but similar hatching success compared to natural nests that were not washed over by sea swells. The other two studies found that relocating sea turtle nests had mixed effects on hatching or hatching and emergence success compared to natural nests. One of those studies also found that in years when leatherback turtle nests were relocated, fewer were lost to erosion than when no relocations took place.
Condition (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the USA found that hatchlings from relocated loggerhead turtle nests were a similar size to hatchlings from natural nests.

3785: Relocate nests/eggs to a hatchery: Sea turtles
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Reptile nests may be relocated away from specific threats (e.g. egg collecting, flooding, erosion, predation, or being crushed on roads) and reburied in an organised ‘hatchery’. Hatcheries consist of a defined location on or near the nesting beach, well above the high tide line, that is often fenced and patrolled. Nests/eggs collected from the beach are then reburied within the hatchery, where they can be closely monitored.
Burying a potentially large number of nests/eggs within a relatively small area may present a number of risks, and the consequences of disturbances such as flooding or poaching could be particularly severe. Other environmental variables at the hatchery location (e.g. temperature and humidity) may also impact on the sex, size, shape, colour, behaviour, movement ability and post-hatching growth of the hatchlings (Warner & Andrews 2002, Booth et al. 2006), and should be carefully considered when selecting the location.
Due to the number of studies found, this action has been split by species group, though no studies were found for amphisbaenians. See here for: Tortoises, terrapins, side-necked & softshell turtles; Snakes & lizards; Crocodilians; Tuatara.

Key Messages:

Twenty-two studies evaluated the effects on sea turtle populations of relocating nests/eggs to a hatchery. Four studies were in each of Malaysia, Mexico and Costa Rica, three studies were in Brazil, two studies were in Cape Verde and one study was in each of the USA, Turkey, Greece, Indonesia and Mauritius.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (22 STUDIES)

Reproductive success (19 studies): Four of 10 studies (including seven replicated, controlled studies) in Brazil, Mexico, Greece, Cape Verde, Costa Rica, Indonesia found mixed effects on hatching success in sea turtle nests relocated to hatcheries compared to natural nests. Three studies found that sea turtle nests relocated to hatcheries had similar hatching or emergence success compared to natural nests, and specifically those laid in safe locations or those that were camoflaged. Two studies found that nests relocated to hatcheries had higher hatching success than natural nests, and in one case all the natural nests were predated. The other study found that nests relocated to a hatchery had lower hatching success than natural nests in six of seven seasons. Two of the studies also found that fewer nests relocated to hatcheries were lost to erosion or predation compared to natural nests. One of the studies also found that hatching success was similar following immediate relocation compared to delayed but careful relocation. Four studies (including one replicated, randomized study) in Malaysia, Mexico, Costa Rica and Mauritius reported that hatching success of sea turtle eggs and nests relocated to hatcheries ranged from 35–78%. One study also found that hatching success was not affected by the number of eggs in the nest. Three studies (including one randomized replicated study) in the USA, Malaysia and Mexico found that sea turtle nests relocated to hatcheries had similar hatching success compared to those relocated for artificial incubation. One study also found that handling eggs during the first five days did not affect hatching success. One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in Costa Rica found that leatherback turtle nests relocated to a hatchery or to other parts of the beach (results combined) had similar hatching success compared to natural nests. One replicated, controlled study in Turkey found that hatching success was similar if nests were relocated 0–18 h after laying.
Survival (2 studies): Two studies in Costa Rica and Mauritius found that 77% of olive ridley turtle hatchlings and 89% of green turtle hatchlings from hatcheries successfully reached the ocean.
Condition (4 studies): Two randomized studies (including one replicated, controlled, before-and-after study) in Mexico found that relocating olive ridley turtle nests to a hatchery had mixed effects on size or size, movement and condition of hatchlings compare to hatchlings that were artificially incubated or from natural nests. One study also found that hatchery hatchlings had higher stress hormone levels than hatchlings from natural nests after emergence, and a different stress response to reaching the ocean compared to hatchlings from natural nests. One replicated, randomized study in Malaysia found that green turtle hatchlings released from hatcheries immediately after emergence moved faster than hatchlings held in the hatchery for 1–6 hours and had better body condition than hatchlings held for 3–6 hours. One replicated study in Malaysia found that excavating green turtle hatchlings in a hatchery immediately after the main clutch emerged resulted in better movement and body condition compared to hatchings excavated five days later.

3786: Provide supplementary food or water 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Providing supplementary food could have a positive effect on wild reptile populations, particularly where natural food sources in the wider environment are scarce. Supplementary food may be used to support small, vulnerable populations, including in the context of translocations and reintroductions. Translocated or released reptiles may be especially vulnerable immediately after release, while they struggle to find natural food in an unfamiliar area. Furthermore, if the time they spend looking for food is increased, this may make them more vulnerable to predation. Hence, providing supplementary food and/or water at and after the period of release may improve longer term survival.
Supplementary food may also be provided in the context of wildlife tourism operations. However, under these circumstances care should be taken to ensure that the provision of potentially unnecessary food does not lead to unintended negative consequences for wild populations.

Behaviour change (3 studies): One of two controlled studies (including one replicated, before-and-after study) in the USA and Australia found that that Pygmy bluetongue lizards translocated into enclosures and given supplementary food showed differences in three behaviour measures compared to lizards given no food. The other study found that fed and unfed Western diamond-backed rattlesnakes showed similar behaviours across four measures. One replicated, controlled study in the USA found that translocated desert tortoises given supplementary water moved longer distances than those given no supplementary water.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Reptiles may be attracted to canals, drains and ditches for drinking, or may need to cross such obstacles while dispersing through the landscape. When such waterways have steep sides, reptiles may fall in and be unable to escape, or aquatic reptiles may enter deliberately but struggle to exit the water. Escape routes may be installed to enable reptiles that have fallen in or otherwise entered the water to escape back onto land. These may take the form or ramps, ladders, shallow inlets or other structures that reptiles could use to climb out.

Sometimes it may be necessary to bring all reptiles from a single population into captivity, temporarily or permanently, as a last resort to prevent a species from becoming extinct in the wild. These captive populations are often called ‘captive assurance colonies’ (Buhlmann et al. 2012). Consideration must be given to maintaining captive assurance colonies as genetically-viable breeding groups in order to maximise the chance of the species surviving.

3793: Relocate nests/eggs to a hatchery: Crocodilians
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Reptile nests may be relocated away from specific threats (e.g. egg collecting, flooding, erosion, predation, or being crushed on roads) and reburied in an organised ‘hatchery’. Hatcheries consist of a defined location on or near the nesting beach, well above the high tide line, that is often fenced and patrolled. Nests/eggs collected from the beach are then reburied within the hatchery, where they can be closely monitored.
Burying a potentially large number of nests/eggs within a relatively small area may present a number of risks, and the consequences of disturbances such as flooding or poaching could be particularly severe. Other environmental variables at the hatchery location (e.g. temperature and humidity) may also impact on the sex, size, shape, colour, behaviour, movement ability and post-hatching growth of the hatchlings (Warner & Andrews 2002, Booth et al. 2006), and should be carefully considered when selecting the location.
Due to the number of studies found, this action has been split by species group, though no studies were found for amphisbaenians. See here for: Sea turtles; Tortoises, terrapins, side-necked & softshell turtles; Snakes & lizards or Tuatara.
For studies that discuss moving nests/eggs to other locations on the beach, but not to a hatchery, see Relocate nests/eggs to a nearby natural setting (not including hatcheries), and for those that discuss the effects of relocating eggs into artificial settings, including into polystyrene boxes and other containers, see Relocate nests/eggs for artificial incubation.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (12 STUDIES)

Reproductive success (12 studies): One of four controlled studies (including three replicated studies) in Suriname, the Dominican Republic, the USA found that kemp’s ridley nests relocated for artificial incubation had higher hatching success than natural nests. One of the studies found that leatherback turtle nests relocated for artificial incubation had lower hatching success than natural nests. One of the studies found that hawksbill turtle nests relocated for artificial incubation had similar hatching success compared to natural nests. The other study found that hatching success of leatherback and green turtle nests relocated for artificially incubation was similar to natural nests above the high tide line and may have been higher than for natural nests washed over by sea swells. This study also found higher embryo mortality in artificially incubated nests compared to natural nests. Three studies (including one randomized, controlled study) in the USA, Mexico and Malaysia found that loggerhead, olive ridley and leatherback turtle nests relocated for artificial incubation had similar hatching success compared to nests relocated to an on-beach hatchery. One study also found that careful handling of eggs during the first five days of incubation did not affect hatching success. Four studies (including one replicated study) in Surinam, Ascension Island and Costa Rica, the Cayman Islands, the USA and Mexico reported that hatching success of green, loggerhead and olive ridley turtle nests relocated for artificial incubation varied from 26% to &gt;90%. One study also reported that hatching success from two trials was 30% and 58% in foam-packed boxes and 26% and 48% in sand-packed boxes. One study also reported that hatching success was 60–89% in 14 of 18 years. One replicated, randomized, controlled study in Costa Rica found that olive ridley turtle eggs artificially incubated in low oxygen conditions had lower hatching success than those in normal oxygen conditions.
Condition (2 studies): One replicated, controlled study in Suriname found that leatherback and green turtle nests relocated for artificial incubation had more instances of embryo deformities than natural nests. One randomized, controlled study in Mexico found that relocating olive ridley nests for artificial incubation had mixed effects on hatchling size and movement compared to those relocated to an on-beach hatchery.

Reproductive success (16 studies): Two of three replicated controlled studies (including one randomized study) in Brazil, Venezuela and the USA found that Hilaire’s side-necked turtle and bog turtle nests relocated for artificial incubation had higher hatching success, or likely had higher success, than natural nests.The other study found that yellow-headed sideneck turtle nests relocated for artificial incubation had lower hatching success than natural nests and nests moved to an on-beach hatchery. One replicated study in the Galápagos reported that hatching success of five subspecies of giant tortoise nests relocated for artificial incubation was 35–100%, compared to 76–85% for natural nests of two sub species. Six of eight studies (including four replicated studies) in the USA and China reported that hatching success for artificially incubated eggs, including eggs recovered from road-killed turtles, was 60–97%, or that 314 hatchlings emerged, and 14 eggs did not hatch. One study also found that eggs collected from the wild had similar hatching success compared to oxytocin-induced eggs. The other two studies reported that hatching success of eggs or clutches was 39–54%. One replicated study in the Galápagos reported that hatching success of giant tortoise nests relocated for artificial incubation may have been higher for nests relocated longer after laying. One replicated study in the USA found that high levels of CO2 during artificial incubation of pond slider and Mississippi map turtle eggs resulted in lower hatching success compared to low CO2. One replicated, randomized study in China found that hatching success of artificially incubated Chinese three-keeled pond turtle eggs was similar across all temperatures tested. One randomized study in the USA found that hatching success of artificially incubated snapping turtle eggs was highest at intermediate levels of soil moisture.
Survival (3 studies): Two studies (including one replicated study) in the USA reported that after relocating smooth softshell turtle and gopher tortoise nests for artificial incubation, two of 314 and three of 36 hatchlings died soon after emergence. One randomized study in the USA found that survival of artificially incubated snapping turtle hatchlings was lower at high soil moisture levels compared to intermediate moisture levels.
Condition (4 studies): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in Brazil found that Hilaire’s side-necked turtle nests relocated for artificial incubation produced heavier hatchlings that were larger in four of five measures compared to hatchlings from natural nests. Two replicated studies (including one randomized study) in China found that modifying incubation temperatures of Chinese three-keeled pond turtle or Asian yellow pond turtle eggs had mixed effects on hatchling size and mobility or different effects on growth depending on the population eggs were sourced from. One replicated study in Thailand found that artificially incubating snail-eating turtle eggs at higher temperatures resulted in more embryos with physical deformities.
