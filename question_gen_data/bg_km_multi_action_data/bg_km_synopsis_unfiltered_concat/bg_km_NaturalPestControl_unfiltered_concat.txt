717: Convert to organic farming
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Organic farming is a set of actions that namely involves avoiding synthetic pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers (using organically derived chemicals and materials instead) and is often combined with different crop rotations and farming practices. Studies determining the individual effects of these actions are summarised separately for each action, but studies testing the whole suite of actions together are included here. Ground-dwelling invertebrates (such as ground beetles and spiders) are frequently surveyed using pitfall traps – small pots buried in the ground up to their rim and left empty or filled with liquid preservatives or water. Studies refer to ‘activity densities’ as pitfall trap measurements relate to both the abundance of beetles and their levels of activity on the ground (and therefore to the type of ground cover too).
This synopsis includes only those studies that experimentally tested organic farming, not those that compared existing organic systems. Experimental studies were typically conducted at laboratory, plot or field scales (17 of 19 studies presented here), but evidence for the effect of organic farming at the farm and landscapes scales (two studies here) is important and future synopses will also include comparative studies. Meta-analyses have found effects on pests and natural enemies can differ between field and farm scales (Bengtsson et al. 2005; Garratt et al. 2011).
Here we present evidence from 19 of 37 studies experimentally testing organic farming.

Key Messages:
This synopsis includes experimental tests of organic farming only. Comparative studies of existing organic systems are not included.
Parasitism and mortality (caused by natural enemies): One of five studies (three replicated, controlled tests and two also randomised) from Europe, North America, Asia and Australasia found that organic farming increased parasitism or natural enemy-induced mortality of pests. Two studies found mixed effects of organic farming and two randomised, replicated, controlled studies found no effect. Natural enemies: Eight of 12 studies (including six randomised, replicated, controlled tests) from Europe, North America Asia and Australasia found more natural enemies under organic farming, although seven of these found effects varied over time or between natural enemy species or groups and/or crops or management practices. Three studies (one randomised, replicated, controlled) found no or inconsistent effects on natural enemies and one study found a negative effect. Pests and diseases: One of eight studies (including five randomised, replicated, controlled tests) found that organic farming reduced pests or disease, but two studies found more pests. Three studies found mixed effects and two studies found no effect. Crop damage: One of seven studies (including five randomised, replicated, controlled tests) found less crop damage in organic fields but two studies found more. One study found a mixed response and three studies found no or inconsistent effects. Weed seed predation and weed abundance: One randomised, replicated, controlled study from the USA found mixed effects of organic farming on weed seed predation by natural enemies. Three randomised, replicated, controlled studies from the USA found more weeds in organically farmed fields, but in one of these studies this effect varied between crops and years. One study found no effect. Yield and profit: Six randomised, replicated, controlled studies measured yields and found one positive effect, one negative effect and one mixed effect, plus no or inconsistent effects in three studies. One study found net profit increased if produce received a premium, but otherwise profit decreased. Another study found a negative or no effect on profit.
 
Crops studied were apple, barley, beans, cabbage, carrot, gourd, maize, mixed vegetables, pea, pepper, safflower, soybean, tomato and wheat.

718: Use alley cropping
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This agroforestry intervention grows crops between hedgerows or tree lines planted at regular intervals across crop fields or along slope contours. Hedges may be pruned and the foliage used as mulch or green manure on the adjacent crop alleys. The technique may control weeds and insect pests in a number of ways, for example by modifying the field’s climate, disrupting pest movement and weed growth, increasing crop vigour, providing habitat for natural enemies and using the insecticidal properties of hedgerow foliage. Studies that plant/allow trees around the edges of fields are included in 'Plant new hedges'.
Here we present eight of 10 studies testing this intervention.

Key Messages:
Parasitism, infection and predation: Two of four studies from Kenya and the USA (including three randomised, replicated, controlled trials) found that effects of alley cropping on parasitism varied between study sites, sampling dates, pest life stages or the width of crop alleys. Two studies found no effect on parasitism. One study found mixed effects on fungal infections in pests and one study found lower egg predation. Natural enemies: One randomised, replicated, controlled study from Kenya found more wasps and spiders but fewer ladybirds. Some natural enemy groups were affected by the types of trees used in hedges. Pests and crop damage: Two of four replicated, controlled studies (two also randomised) from Kenya, the Philippines and the UK found more pests in alley cropped plots. One study found fewer pests and one study found effects varied with pest group and between years. One study found more pest damage to crops but another study found no effect. Weeds: One randomised, replicated, controlled study from the Philippines found mixed effects on weeds, with more grasses in alley cropped than conventional fields under some soil conditions. Yield: One controlled study from the USA found lower yield and one study from the Philippines reported similar or lower yields. Costs and profit: One study from the USA found lower costs but also lower profit in alley cropped plots.
Crops studied were alfalfa, barley, cowpea, maize, pea, rice and wheat.

719: Use crop rotation in potato farming systems
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
 
Crop rotation involves alternating between two or more commercial arable crops in successive growing seasons. It may also include ley or fallow periods, as long as at least two crops are involved. Growing different crops each year may help avoid the build-up of crop-specific pests and pathogens.
The studies presented for this synopsis are only those that test rotations including potato Solanum tuberosum. We have found approximately 200 further studies on crop rotation in other crop types which will be summarised in the future.

Here we present evidence from 10 of 32 studies testing this intervention for potatoes.

Key Messages:
Pests: Nine studies from Canada and the USA, and one review, investigated the effect of crop rotation on pest or pathogen populations in potato. Three studies (including two replicated studies of which one randomised and one controlled) and a review found crop rotation reduced pest populations and crop diseases in at least one year or at least one site. One paired study (including one replicated, randomised, controlled trial) found pest populations increased in crop rotation. Four studies (including one replicated, randomised, controlled trial) found increases and decreases in pest populations depending on rotation crops used and other treatments. One replicated, randomised, controlled study found no effect. Yield: Three out of five studies (all replicated, controlled, two also randomised) from Canada and the USA, found that crop rotation increased crop yield in some years or with certain rotation crops. The two other studies (both replicated, one also randomised and one replicated) found yield increases and decreases depending on rotation crops used. Profit: One replicated, controlled study found that crop rotation increased profit.Insecticides: Two studies (one replicated, controlled) found that fewer insecticide treatments were needed on rotated plots.
Crops studied were alfalfa, barley, broccoli, brown mustard, buckwheat, cotton, lupins, maize, oats, pearl millet, peas, potato, rye, sorghum, soybean, sugar beet, timothy grass, wheat and yellow sweet clover.

720: Allow natural regeneration of ground cover beneath perennial crops
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This includes studies allowing the natural regeneration of weeds beneath perennial crops to enhance natural enemy populations. This includes studies testing the impact of tillage versus no tillage (or other types of soil disturbance) and herbicide versus no herbicide under perennial crops, where these practices are used to control weeds. Studies using naturally regenerated ground cover as a control treatment to compare with other interventions (e.g. 'Grow plants that provide nectar or pollen resources' and 'Grow plants that provide supplementary prey for natural enemies') are not included here. Ground-dwelling invertebrates are frequently surveyed using pitfall traps – small pots buried in the ground up to their rim and left empty or filled with liquid preservatives or water.

Key Messages:
Natural enemies on crop trees and vines: Five studies (including one replicated, randomised, controlled test) from Australia, China, Italy and Portugal compared natural and bare ground covers by measuring numbers of natural enemies in fruit tree or vine canopies. Three found effects varied between groups of natural enemies, two found no difference. Two studies from Australia and France compared natural to sown ground cover and found no effect on enemies in crop canopies. Natural enemies on the ground: Five studies (including three replicated, randomised, controlled trials) from Australia, Canada, China, France, and Spain compared natural and bare ground covers by measuring natural enemies on the ground. Two studies found more natural enemies in natural ground cover, but in one the effects were only short-term for most natural enemy groups. Three studies found mixed effects, with higher numbers of some natural enemy groups but not others. Two studies compared natural and sown ground covers, one study found more natural enemies and one found no effect. Pests and crop damage: Four studies (three controlled, one also replicated and randomised) from Italy, Australia and China measured pests and crop damage in regenerated and bare ground covers. Two studies found fewer pests, whilst two studies found effects on pests and crop damage varied for different pest or disease groups. One study found more pests in natural than in sown ground covers.
Crops studied were apple, grape, lemon, olive and pear.

721: Use mixed pasture
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be ineffective or harmful
Background information and definitions:
This involves growing more than one species of forage crop (grasses and legumes) in a pasture to control invertebrate or weed pests in pastoral farmland. The use of mixed pastures to suppress pests in arable crops is not included here but relevant to other actions, e.g. ‘Include plants that are repellent or suppressive to pests in crop rotations’ and ‘Grow cover crops that are repellent or suppressive to pests when the field is empty’ (for inclusion in a future synopsis).
Here we present evidence from seven of 10 studies testing this intervention.

Key Messages:
Weeds: Two of two studies (both randomised, replicated trials, one also controlled) from the USA found reduced weeds in mixed compared to monoculture pasture. Pests: Five studies from North America measured pests including four randomised, replicated, controlled tests. One study found fewer pests and two studies found reductions in some pest groups or in some pasture mixes. One study found no effect and another found more pests, although the effect was potentially inseparable from grazing treatments. Crop mortality: One randomised, replicated study from the USA found no effect on forage crop mortality caused by nematodes.Yield: Two of five studies (including two randomised, replicated, controlled tests) from North America found increased forage crop yields and two studies found mixed effects depending on the crop type and year. One study found no effect.
Crops studied were alfalfa, bird’s-foot trefoil, chicory, cicer milkvetch, clovers, fescues, oats, ryegrass, other grasses, other legumes, rapeseed and turnip.

722: Grow plants that compete with damaging weeds
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves planting species that out-compete damaging weeds, suppressing them by reducing their ground cover, growth or reproduction rate, or by increasing their mortality. The intervention is generally applied to pastureland or uncropped areas such as field margins and buffer strips. Plants grown to suppress weeds on large parts of arable land are not included here but are relevant to cover cropping actions, e.g. ‘Grow cover crops when the field is empty’, ‘Grow cover crops beneath the main crop (living mulches) or between crop rows’, ‘Grow crops in strips within a cover crop’ and ‘Incorporate leys into crop rotation’ (actions for inclusion in a future synopsis).
Here we present evidence from nine of 13 studies testing this intervention.

Key Messages:
Weed weight and cover: Nine studies from Australia, Slovakia, the UK and the USA tested the effects of planting species to compete with weeds. All (including four replicated, randomised, controlled trials) found reduced weed plant weight or ground cover, although two found this only in some years or conditions. Weed reproduction and survival: Five studies (including three replicated, randomised, controlled trials) also found that competition reduced weed reproduction, survival or both. One of these found an effect only in one year only.
Crops studied were clovers, fescues, ryegrass, other grasses and turnip.

723: Alter the timing of insecticide use
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This involves applying insecticides at different dates in the growing season or at different times during the cropping cycle. Sprays can be reduced or avoided during periods of natural enemy vulnerability to reduce impacts on the ecosystem service they provide, although many studies test different dates simply to time spraying with periods of likely pest abundance or crop damage. Some of the evidence relates to chemicals now widely removed from use, and readers should bear in mind that using more selective insecticides may also allow greater flexibility in the timing of applications (‘Use more selective pesticides’ will be included in future synopses). Using historical information on pest population characteristics and crop susceptibility to time insecticide applications is included here. Informing spraying decisions by monitoring pests or crop damage within the present cropping season is included in 'Use pesticides only when pests or crop damage reach threshold levels'.
Here we present evidence from five of 13 studies testing this intervention.

Key Messages:
Natural enemies: One controlled study from the UK reported more natural enemies when insecticides were sprayed earlier rather than later in the growing season. Pests: Two of four studies from Mozambique, the UK and the USA found fewer pests or less disease damage when insecticides were applied early rather than late. Effects on a disease-carrying pest varied with insecticide type. Two studies (one a randomised, replicated, controlled test) found no effect on pests or pest damage. Yield: Four studies (including one randomised, replicated, controlled test) from Mozambique, the Philippines, the UK and the USA measured yields. Two studies found mixed effects and one study found no effect on yield when insecticides were applied early. One study found higher yields when insecticides were applied at times of suspected crop susceptibility.Profit and costs: One controlled study from the Philippines found higher profits and similar costs when insecticides were only applied at times of suspected crop susceptibility.
Crops studied were aubergine, barley, maize, pear and stringbean.

724: Grow non-crop plants that produce chemicals that attract natural enemies
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves growing non-crop plants which produce volatile chemicals (quickly evaporating scents or odours) that attract natural enemies, thereby encouraging the enemies to the main crop. Non-crop plants could be grown in field margins or interspersed into the main crop. Lab studies demonstrating an attractive effect of a plant species or variety to a natural enemy are also included.
Here we present evidence from four of six studies testing this intervention.

Key Messages:
Natural enemies: Four studies from China, Germany, India and Kenya tested the effects of growing plants that produce chemicals that attract natural enemies. Three (including one replicated, randomised, controlled trail) found higher numbers of natural enemies in plots with plants that produce attractive chemicals, and one found that the attractive plant also attracted natural enemies in lab studies. One found no effect on parasitism but the plant used was found not to be attractive to natural enemies in lab studies. Pests: All four studies found a decrease in either pest population or pest damage in plots with plants that produce chemicals that attract natural enemies. Yield: One replicated, randomised, controlled study found an increase in crop yield in plots with plants that produce attractive chemicals.
Crops studied were lettuce, orange, safflower and sorghum.

725: Leave part of the crop or pasture unharvested or uncut
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves harvesting or cutting part of a crop field or pasture, often by leaving uncut strips. In pasture, fodder or perennial crops, these strips may be harvested later in a rotation system. The uncut areas provide a refuge for predators from harvesting itself, as well as providing habitat once the rest of the field is cut. This maintains predator populations and enables them to recolonise the following crop.
Here we present evidence from eight of 12 studies testing this intervention.

Key Messages:
Natural enemies: We found eight studies from Australia, Germany, Hungary, New Zealand, Switzerland and the USA that tested leaving part of the crop or pasture unharvested or unmown. Three (including one replicated, controlled trial) found an increase in abundance of predatory insects or spiders in the crop field or pasture that was partly uncut, while four (including three replicated, controlled trials) found more predators in the unharvested or unmown area itself. Two studies (one replicated and controlled) found that the ratio of predators to pests was higher in partially cut plots and one replicated, controlled study found the same result in the uncut area. Two replicated, controlled studies found differing effects between species or groups of natural enemies. Predation and parasitism: One replicated, controlled study from Australia found an increase in predation and parasitism rates of pest eggs in unharvested strips. Pests: Two studies (including one replicated, controlled study) found a decrease in pest numbers in partially cut plots, one of them only for one species out of two. Two studies (one replicated, the other controlled) found an increase in pest numbers in partially cut plots, and two studies (including one replicated, controlled study) found more pests in uncut areas.
Crops studied were alfalfa and meadow pasture.

726: Incorporate parasitism rates when setting thresholds for insecticide use
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This involves monitoring parasitism rates of pests by natural enemies and adjusting thresholds for insecticide use accordingly. Conventional threshold-based insecticide use (such as in integrated management) monitors pest populations or crop damage to schedule insecticide applications, but may not consider the action of natural enemies. Parasitoids can reduce pest populations, but there may be a lag between pest population increase and parasitoid population increase. If pests are killed by insecticides during this lag period, parasitoids may also be killed, preventing the parasitoid population from increasing and limiting the ecosystem service they provide. Monitoring parasitism rates to decide whether or not and when to spray is intended to avoid this and reduce unnecessary use of insecticides.

Key Messages:
Pest damage: One controlled study from New Zealand found using parasitism rates to inform spraying decisions resulted in acceptable levels of crop damage from pests. Effects on natural enemy populations were not monitored.
The crop studied was tomato.

727: Delay mowing or first grazing date on pasture or grassland
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves delaying mowing or the onset of grazing on grasslands until later in the year. This may reduce damage to insect and spider natural enemy populations (or increase damage to pests) at sensitive points in their lifecycles, such as before overwintered individuals begin breeding. Ground-living invertebrates can be sampled by suction sampling, using a vacuum to suck-up and collect specimens for a given time or area of ground.

Key Messages:
Natural enemy abundance: One replicated, randomised, controlled study found fewer predatory spiders with delayed cutting. Three studies from the UK (two of them replicated, randomised and controlled) found no change in insect predator numbers and one replicated study from Sweden found mixed effects between different predator groups. Natural enemy diversity: One replicated study from Sweden found a decrease in ant diversity with delayed cutting and one replicated, randomised, controlled study from the UK found no effect on spider and beetle diversity. Pests: One of two replicated, randomised, controlled studies from the UK and USA found more pest insects in late-cut plots and one found no effect. Insects in general: Four replicated, randomised, controlled studies measured the abundance of insect groups without classifying them as pests or natural enemies. One UK study found lower numbers in late-cut plots, while two found effects varied between groups. Two studies from the UK and USA found no effect on insect numbers.
Crops studied were barley, bird’s-foot trefoil, clovers, fescues, rapeseed, ryegrass, other grasses and wheat.

728: Incorporate plant remains into the soil that produce weed-controlling chemicals
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be ineffective or harmful
Background information and definitions:
Weeds can be suppressed by amending the soil with plant remains (residues) that produce allelopathic chemicals (biological chemicals that affect the growth of other organisms) as they decay. Plant residues are typically incorporated into soils by ploughing or rotavation. In some cases allelopathic plants may be grown as cover crops prior to being incorporated into the soil (green manuring). We consider this to be part of the ecosystem service where these plants can be grown in the ecosystem in question (for example on farms in that region). Applying plant residues to the soil surface is part of the action 'Add mulch to crops' and incorporating plant residues for inducing soil suppression of pests and pathogens is considered part of 'Amend the soil with fresh plant material or crop residues' (actions for inclusion in future synopses).

Key Messages:
Weeds: Six studies (including six randomised, replicated, controlled tests) from Asia, Europe and North America examined the effect of allelopathic plant remains on weeds by comparing amended soils with weeded controls. Three studies found a reduction in weed growth, and three found effects varied between years, weed groups, or the type of weeding method in controls.Four studies from Asia  and North America examined the effect on weeds by comparing amended soils with unweeded controls. Two studies found a reduction in weed growth, but one found that residues applied too far in advance of crop planting had the reverse effect. Two studies found that effects varied between trials, weed species or the type of residue used.Two studies, including one randomised, replicated, controlled laboratory study, found that the decrease in weeds did not last beyond a few days or weeks after residue incorporation. Pests: One randomised, replicated, controlled study in the Philippines found mixed effects on pests. Crop growth: Two of three studies found crop growth was inhibited by allelopathic plant remains, but this could be minimised by changing the timing of application. One study found effects varied between years. Yield: Three randomised, replicated, controlled studies compared yields in amended plots with weeded controls and found positive, negative and mixed effects. Three studies compared amended plots with unweeded controls, two found positive effects on yield and one found mixed effects (depending on the crop). Profit: One study found that amending soils increased profit compared to unweeded controls, but not compared to weeded controls.
 
Crops studied were beans, cotton, maize, rice and wheat.

729: Create beetle banks
Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Beetle banks are raised strips which run through a field, typically planted with grasses. They primarily serve as an overwintering habitat for beetles, which provide pest control in the spring, but may also harbour other natural enemies. By dividing the field, beetle banks reduce the distance that predators have to travel to reach the centre of the crop, a potential problem if overwintering habitat occurs only at the field edge. Beetles are frequently surveyed using pitfall traps, but these measurements relate to both the abundance of beetles and their levels of activity on the ground; pitfall trap data therefore refer to ‘activity densities’.

Key Messages:
Natural enemies in fields: Six studies from Canada, the UK and USA (three replicated, controlled, of which two were also randomised) examined the effects on predator numbers in adjacent crops. A review found that predators increased in adjacent crops, but one study found effects varied with time and another found no effect. Two studies found small or slow movements of predators from banks to crops. One study found greater beetle activity in fields but this did not improve pest predation. Natural enemies on banks: Four studies and a review found more invertebrate predators on beetle banks than in surrounding crops, but one of these found that effects varied with time. Eight studies from the UK and USA (including two randomised, replicated, controlled trials and two reviews) compared numbers of predatory invertebrates on beetle banks with other refuge habitats. Two studies found more natural enemies on beetle banks, but one of these found only seasonal effects. One review found similar or higher numbers of predators on beetle banks and four studies found similar or lower numbers. Pests: A replicated, randomised study and a review found the largest pest reductions in areas closest to a beetle bank or on the beetle bank itself. One review found fewer pests in fields with than without a beetle bank. Economics: One replicated, randomised, controlled trial and a review showed that beetle banks could make economic savings if they prevented pests from reaching a spray threshold or causing 5% yield loss. Beetle bank design: Two studies from the UK found certain grass species held higher numbers of predatory invertebrates than others.
Crops studied were barley, field bean, maize, oats, pea, radish, rapeseed, soybean, wheat and pasture.

750: Use pesticides only when pests or crop damage reach threshold levels
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This involves switching from conventional, preventative pesticide applications (e.g. spraying every week, month or season) to a regime that monitors pest numbers or crop damage and applies pesticides only when these reach economically damaging levels (thresholds). Spraying regimes can be evaluated by assessing the number of occasions on which pests reached economically damaging levels after decisions to spray/not spray. Strategically timing insecticide sprays to coincide with periods of likely pest abundance or natural enemy susceptibility (anticipated in advance based on prior knowledge, experience or predictive models) is included in 'Alter the timing of insectide use'. We use the term ‘pesticide’ to refer to insecticides (covering the majority of the evidence), fungicides and other chemicals to control non-plant organisms.
Here we present evidence from 14 of 29 studies testing this intervention.

Key Messages:
Natural enemies: One randomised, replicated, controlled study from Finland found that threshold-based spraying regimes increased numbers of natural enemies in two of three years but effects lasted for as little as three weeks. Pests and disease: Two of four studies from France, Malaysia and the USA reported that pests were satisfactorily controlled. One randomised, replicated, controlled study found pest numbers were similar under threshold-based and conventional spraying regimes and one study reported that pest control was inadequate. A randomised, replicated, controlled study found mixed effects on disease severity. Crop damage: Four of five randomised, replicated, controlled studies from New Zealand, the Philippines and the USA found similar crop damage under threshold-based and conventional, preventative spraying regimes, but one study found damage increased. Another study found slightly less crop damage compared to unsprayed controls. Yield: Two of four randomised, replicated, controlled studies found similar yields under threshold-based and conventional spraying regimes. Two studies found mixed effects depending on site, year, pest stage/type or control treatment. Profit: Two of three randomised, replicated, controlled studies found similar profits using threshold-based and conventional spraying regimes. One study found effects varied between sites and years. Costs: Nine studies found fewer pesticide applications were needed and three studies found or predicted lower production costs.
Crops studied were barley, broccoli, cabbages, cauliflower, celery, cocoa, cotton, grape, peanut, potato, rice, tomato and wheat.

752: Plant new hedges
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Hedges or windbreaks are lines of trees or shrubs grown along the margins of crop and pasture fields or along orchard and plantation boundaries. Growing trees in rows within fields is included under 'Use alley cropping'. Ground-dwelling invertebrates (such as ground beetles and spiders) are frequently surveyed using pitfall traps – small pots buried in the ground up to their rim and left empty or filled with liquid preservatives or water. Pitfall trap measurements relate to both the abundance of beetles and their levels of activity on the ground, therefore studies refer to ‘activity densities’.
Here we present evidence from four of six studies.

Key Messages:
Natural enemies: One randomised, replicated, controlled study from China compared plots with and without hedges and found no effect on spiders in crops. One of two studies from France and China found more natural enemies in a hedge than in adjacent crops while one study found this effect varied between crop types, hedge species and years. Two randomised, replicated, controlled studies from France and Kenya found natural enemy abundance in hedges was affected by the type of hedge shrub/tree planted and one also found this effect varied between natural enemy groups. Pests: One randomised, replicated, controlled study from Kenya compared fallow plots with and without hedges and found effects varied between nematode (roundworm) groups.
Crops studied were barley, beans, maize and wheat.

753: Combine trap and repellent crops in a push-pull system
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Push-pull systems involve intercropping the main crop with plants that are repellent to pests (the ‘push’) while also growing plants (trap crops) that are attractive to pests around the main crop (the ‘pull’). This combination of repellent and attractive companion plants keeps invertebrate pests away from the crop and may provide additional benefits through improved habitat and resources for natural enemies. Push-pull systems can also be designed to suppress weeds at the same time as controlling pests. Ground-dwelling invertebrates are frequently surveyed using pitfall traps – small pots buried in the ground up to their rim and left empty or filled with liquid preservatives or water.
Here we present evidence from 10 of 13 studies testing this intervention.

Key Messages:
Parasitism: Two randomised, replicated, controlled studies from Kenya found that push-pull cropping systems increased parasitism of stem borer larvae. One of the studies found no effect on egg parasitism. Natural enemies: Two randomised, replicated, controlled studies from Kenya and South Africa found push-pull systems had more natural predators, both in overall totals and the abundance of different predator groups. Pests: Two of three studies (two randomised, replicated, controlled) in Ethiopia, Kenya and South Africa found fewer pests. One study found no effect on pest infestation, but pests were scarce throughout. Two replicated, controlled studies (one also randomised) found fewer witchweeds. Crop damage: Two of three replicated, controlled studies (one also randomised) found less pest damage, but one study (where pest numbers were low) found effects varied between years and types of damage symptom. Yield: Four of five replicated, controlled studies (two also randomised) found higher yields and one found no effect. Profit and cost: Two studies in Kenya and a review found greater economic benefits. One study found higher production costs in the first year, but equal or lower costs in the following five years.
Crops studied were maize and beans.

754: Use chemicals to attract natural enemies
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This involves using chemicals to lure natural enemies into a crop. Communication chemicals of insects and plants (known as pheromones and volatiles, respectively) can be manufactured and deployed to manipulate invertebrates. Examples include the volatiles produced when plants are attacked by pests (e.g. methyl salicylate) and the alarm and sex pheromones of pests or natural enemies, as well as organic extracts from crop or plant leaves. Chemicals are sprayed onto crops or deployed in dispensers placed at regular intervals in the crop. Many studies have tested the efficacy of chemicals by applying them as baits in insect traps such as delta traps (plastic structures hung from branches or posts containing a sheet of sticky paper). Ground-living invertebrates can be sampled by suction sampling, using a vacuum to suck-up and collect specimens for a given time or area of ground.

Key Messages:
Parasitism and predation (by natural enemies): One review and two of five studies from Asia, Europe and North America found that attractive chemicals increased parasitism. Two studies, including one randomised, replicated, controlled trial, found greater parasitism for some but not all chemicals, crops, sites or years and one study found no effect. One study showed that parasites found pests more rapidly. One study found lower egg predation by natural predators. Natural enemies: Five of 13 studies from Africa, Asia, Australasia, Europe and North America found more natural enemies while eight (including seven randomised, replicated, controlled trials) found positive effects varied between enemy groups, sites or study dates. Four of 13 studies (including a meta-analysis) found more natural enemies with some but not all test chemicals. Two of four studies (including a review) found higher chemical doses attracted more enemies, but one study found lower doses were more effective and one found no effect. Pests: Three of nine studies (seven randomised, replicated, controlled) from Asia, Australasia, Europe and North America found fewer pests, although the effect occurred only in the egg stage in one study. Two studies found more pests and four found no effect. Crop damage: One study found reduced damage with some chemicals but not others, and one study found no effect. Yield: One study found higher wheat yields.
Crops studied were apple, banana, bean, broccoli, Chinese cabbage, cotton, cowpea, cranberry, grape, grapefruit, hop, maize, oilseed, orange, tomato, turnip and wheat.

773: Isolate colonies of beneficial ants
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves pruning perennial crop trees to isolate ant colonies living in the tree canopy. Where ants act as natural predators, this action may improve pest control by reducing the time, energy and ant population losses incurred when rival ant colonies interact and viciously fight each other. This differs from the action 'Exclude ants that protect pests' for managing ants that limit rather than benefit natural pest control (for inclusion in a future synopsis).

Key Messages:
Natural enemies: One replicated, controlled study from Australia found predatory ants occupied more cashew trees when colonies were kept isolated. Pest damage and yield: The same study found lower pest damage to cashews and higher yields.
The crop studied was cashew.

774: Delay herbicide use
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Delaying herbicide application dates within a growing season may improve natural pest control as this encourages weeds to grow early in the season, providing habitat and resources to help natural enemy populations develop. These weeds may also divert generalist pests (those with broad habitat or resource requirements) that would otherwise reach the crop.

Key Messages:
Natural enemies: Two randomised, replicated, controlled trials from Australia and Denmark found more natural enemies when herbicide treatments were delayed. One of the studies found some but not all natural enemy groups benefited and fewer groups benefitted early in the season. Weeds: One randomised, replicated, controlled study found more weeds when herbicide treatments were delayed. Insect pests and damage: One of two randomised, replicated, controlled studies from Canada and Denmark found more insect pests, but only for some pest groups, and one study found fewer pests in one of two experiments and for one of two crop varieties. One study found lower crop damage in some but not all varieties and study years. Yield: One randomised, replicated, controlled study found lower yields and one study found no effect.
Crops studied were beet and oilseed.

775: Use mass-emergence devices to increase natural enemy populations
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Mass-emergence devices are containers giving natural enemies a sheltered environment and a food or prey source (such as pollen or pests on infested foliage), enabling enemy numbers to establish before emerging from the device and dispersing into the crop. Designs may include size-selective exits, preventing pests but allowing natural enemies (such as parasitoid wasps) to leave and disperse. Conventional practices of removing and destroying pest-infested crop foliage can reduce natural enemy numbers, but using the foliage in mass-emergence devices instead may relocate natural enemies back into the crop.
We found no studies testing this action in a farmed environment, but one study of urban trees is presented here as preliminary evidence.

Key Messages:
Parasitism: One randomised, replicated, controlled study in Switzerland found higher parasitism at one site but no effect at another site when mass-emergence devices were used in urban areas. Pest damage: The same study found no effect on pest damage to horse chestnut trees

885: Use grazing instead of cutting for pasture or grassland management
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be ineffective or harmful
Background information and definitions:
Natural pest control in pastures can be affected by different methods of management and harvesting. Grazing may be less damaging to natural enemies and more suitable for some pest- or disease-resistant crop varieties than cutting. Direct effects of domestic livestock on pests (e.g. mortality by grazing and trampling) are not considered part of the natural ecosystem service of pest control but are summarised here if studies measured these effects while carrying out the intervention. The intensity of grazing and frequency of cutting are often important factors and the actions ‘Reduce grazing intensity on grassland’ and ‘Reduce frequency of cutting on grassland or grass margins’ will be covered in future synopses. Ground-living invertebrates can be sampled by suction sampling, using a vacuum to suck-up and collect specimens for a given time or area of ground.

Key Messages:
Natural enemies: Two studies (one before-and-after and one replicated trial) from Australia and the UK found grazing instead of cutting had mixed effects on natural enemies, with some species and groups affected on some dates but not others. One replicated study from New Zealand found no effect. Pests and diseases: One of five studies (including three replicated trials) from Australia, New Zealand, the UK and the USA found more pests, and two studies found effects varied between pest groups and sampling dates. Two studies found no effect on pests. One study found no effect on disease when grazing was used in addition to cutting. Pasture damage and plant survival: One randomised study found more ryegrass shoots were attacked by pests. One study found lower survival of alfalfa plants but another found no effect. Yield: One of four randomised, replicated studies (one also controlled) found lower yields and two found no effect. One study found lower ryegrass and higher clover yields, but no difference between clover varieties. Another randomised study found more ryegrass shoots.
Crops studied were alfalfa, cock’s-foot, perennial ryegrass, other grasses and white clover.

886: Exclude ants that protect pests
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This involves applying adhesive substances or chemicals to the trunks of perennial crop trees, preventing pest-protecting ants from reaching the branches. Many ants form mutualistic relationships with insect pests (e.g. feeding on honeydew secreted by bugs (Hemiptera) such as aphids), defending them from predators and parasitoids. Excluding these ants may therefore increase predation and parasitism rates by beneficial invertebrates. See also 'Isolate colonies of beneficial ants' for managing ants that act as natural predators and improve pest control.

Key Messages:
Parasitism: One of two replicated, controlled studies (one also randomised) from Japan and the USA found greater parasitism of pests by natural enemies when ants were excluded from trees. The other study found greater parasitism at one site but no effect at another. Natural enemies: Five studies (including four randomised, replicated, controlled trials) from Japan, Switzerland and the USA found effects varied between natural enemy species and groups, sampling dates, sites, crop varieties and ground cover types beneath trees. Pests: Three of seven studies (including four randomised, replicated, controlled trials) found fewer pests and another found fewer pests at times of peak abundance only. One study found mixed effects depending on date and other actions taken simultaneously (predator attractant and ground cover treatments). One study found no effect. Damage and tree growth: One study found no effect on damage to tree foliage but one study found greater tree growth. Ants: Six studies found that glue or pesticide barriers reduced ant numbers in tree or vine canopies. One study found that citrus oil barriers had no effect.
Crops studied were cherimoyas, cherry, grape, grapefruit, orange, pecan and satsuma mandarin.
