3831: Legally protect habitat 
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
The legal protection of important habitat is a commonly used conservation tool, and has been suggested as a major action for threatened butterflies and moths at both national and international level (Patrick 2004, van Swaay & Warren 2006). However, the establishment of reserves specifically for invertebrates, including butterflies and moths, is rare (Douglas 2004). Moreover, legally protected habitat may still need to be well managed, and the protection enforced, in order for the area to conserve populations of threatened butterflies and moths (van Swaay et al. 2012). In addition to the protection of public reserves, private protection of habitat, alongside suitable management, could improve butterfly and moth conservation.

Key Messages:

Ten studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of legally protecting habitat. Six studies were in the UK and one was in each of Australia, Singapore and Ireland and the USA. Three of the studies used data from the same national monitoring scheme across different years.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Richness/diversity (3 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in Singapore found that protected primary or secondary forest reserves had a higher species richness of butterflies than unprotected forest fragments. One replicated, paired, site comparison study in Ireland reported that raised bogs protected as Special Areas of Conservation (where restoration had sometimes taken place) had a similar species richness of moths to unprotected bogs. One replicated, site comparison study in the UK found that, in the first three years after protection as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), woodland, grassland and heathland sites lost a similar proportion of 29 threatened butterfly species to unprotected sites.

POPULATION RESPONSE (8 STUDIES)

Abundance (7 studies): Three of five site comparison studies (including four replicated studies and one before-and-after study) in the UK and Ireland found that sites protected as National Nature Reserves or Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) (in one case also managed by coppicing), or surrounded by SSSIs, had a higher abundance of heath fritillary, all butterflies and 30/57 species of butterfly than unprotected sites. However, one of these studies only found the result using one of two sets of sites. The other two studies found that grasslands protected as National Nature Reserves or SSSIs and raised bogs protected as Special Areas of Conservation had a similar total abundance of moths, and change in abundance of chalkhill blue butterflies, to unprotected sites. However, one of these studies found mixed results for individual moth species. One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that, at sites with the highest levels of protection, abundances of Karner blue, frosted elfin and Persius duskywing did not change over time, whereas they decreased at sites with lower levels of protection. One replicated, site comparison study in the UK found that protected grasslands assessed as being in “Favourable” habitat condition had worse population trends for 4/8 butterfly species but better for 1/8 species than grasslands in “Unfavourable” condition. One study in Australia reported that after a grassland was designated as a local reserve, populations of golden sun-moth and pale sun-moth persisted for at least four years.

3832: Retain connectivity between habitat patches 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Habitat connectivity is important for enabling animals to colonize new sites, and can be important for the persistence of a population which exists in fragmented sites across a landscape (Johansson et al. 2017, van Langevelde & Wynhoff 2009). Small habitat patches are more likely to be occupied if they are located close to larger, occupied patches (Sinclair 2002, Thomas & Harrison 1992). Fragmented habitats attract fewer butterflies than more intact habitats (Summerville & Crist 2001), and retaining connectivity may increase habitat use by butterflies and moths.

3833: Retain buffer zones around core habitat 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
The edges of habitat patches, where they meet heavily modified landscapes such as agricultural fields or urban areas, often suffer from a number of “edge effects”. This can include an increase in exposure to pollution, such as noise, light or chemicals, produced and released from human landscapes, or changes to natural rhythms, such as higher or more variable temperatures, which are a result of the more open structure of human landscapes. Retaining buffer zones around core habitat, even if the buffers themselves are of lower quality habitat, may reduce the impact of edge effects on butterfly and moth populations.
For studies testing actions to tackle pollution directly, see “Threat - Pollution”.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of retaining buffer zones around core habitat.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches.

3834: Practise ‘wildlife gardening’ 
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Within urban areas, public parks and private gardens represent a significant area of potential habitat. Wildlife-friendly gardening could include a number of independent actions for butterflies and moths, such as planting nectar-rich flowers or native plant species, reducing the frequency of weeding or cutting, and reducing chemical impacts, as well as actions aimed at other wildlife. This action includes studies where two or more of these are carried out together, as well as less frequently tested actions.
This action includes studies where non-native plants are used to provide nectar resources. For studies exclusively testing the planting of native species, see “Plant parks and gardens with appropriate native species”. See also “Alter mowing regimes on greenspaces and road verges”, “Pollution – Stop using herbicides on pavements and road verges” and “Pollution – Stop using pesticides as seed dressings and sprays in flower beds and greenspace”.

Key Messages:

Four studies evaluated the effects of practising wildlife gardening on butterflies and moths. Two were in the UK and one was in each of France and the USA.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in the USA found that areas with reduced frequency weeding had a similar species richness of adult butterflies compared to areas with conventional weeding.

POPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Abundance (3 studies): Two replicated studies (including one paired, controlled study) in the UK and the USA found that increasing the number and age of potted nettle plants in gardens and weeding less frequently did not increase abundance of butterflies, all caterpillars and caterpillars and eggs of four target species. One replicated, site comparison study in France found that gardens where insecticides and herbicides were not used and where there were natural features had a higher abundance of butterflies, but gardens where fungicides and snail pellets were not used had a lower abundance of butterflies.

BEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)

Use (2 studies): One replicated study in the UK reported that caterpillars only occasionally used potted nettle plants in gardens. One site comparison study in the UK found that planted buddleia and marjoram were visited by adult butterflies and moths more frequently than other plant species.

3835: Protect or restore brownfield or ex-industrial sites 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Ex-industrial, or brownfield, sites can provide important early-successional habitat for a range of species, including butterflies and moths. However, such sites are often targeted for urban development (Robins et al. 2013) or fertilized and planted to accelerate succession (Tropek et al. 2010). Legal protection which prevents development may be required to retain such sites, and restoration which maintains a state of early succession may be important for rare and sensitive species (Tropek et al. 2010).

Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Planting rooftops in urban areas, and growing plants up vertical structures such as walls and lamp-posts, often termed “green infrastructure”, is becoming increasingly popular, and is usually done with the aim of reducing pollution and run-off, or to improve building insulation (Dunnett & Kingsbury 2008). However, they may also be put in place to increase biodiversity, by providing habitat for a range of species (Oberndorfer et al. 2007), including nectar resources or egg-laying sites for butterflies and moths.

3838: Plant trees to reduce temperatures in cities 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Cities generate large amounts of heat, and as a result are often warmer than surrounding areas of natural habitat, a phenomenon known as the ‘urban heat island effect’ (Kleerekoper et al. 2012). For species which are otherwise able to survive in cities, higher temperatures may cause problems for survival and reproduction. Planting trees within cities provides shade, and actively cools the environment by increasing evapotranspiration (Kleerekoper et al. 2012). This may provide benefits for temperature-sensitive butterflies and moths, but could be detrimental if the trees replace other important habitats.

3839: Apply ecological compensation for developments 
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Development projects destroy or disturb natural habitats, displacing animals living there. Ecological compensation for developments aims to create new habitat, or improve the condition of existing habitat, outside of the development area, to replace that which is lost (Kleintjes et al. 2003). This intervention tests whether these compensation areas are effective for butterflies and moths.

3840: Require developers to complete Environmental Impact Assessments when submitting planning applications
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Any new residential or commercial development is likely to impact butterflies and moths through either habitat destruction or disturbance. However, by assessing the risk to species populations in advance, and making changes to the plans, it may be possible for careful planning of necessary developments to minimize these negative impacts. Legal requirements for developers to complete Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs), if independently produced, reviewed and enforced, may be beneficial to butterfly and moth conservation. For example, see DFFE (2021).

3841: Alter mowing regimes on greenspaces and road verges  
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Greenspaces and road verges offer potential habitat patches and corridors for butterflies and moths. However, management of these spaces must be carefully planned. Mowing may be required to keep vegetation down, but also reduces the availability of nectar resources, inhibits the growth of host plants used by caterpillars, reduces the structural diversity of the vegetation, and poses a risk from direct mortality, especially to eggs, caterpillars and pupae (Hopwood et al. 2015). Road verges with a higher species richness of plants attract more butterflies, and yet have fewer butterflies killed by traffic than less diverse road verges (Skórka et al. 2013). Therefore, altering mowing regimes to encourage plant growth and diversity may benefit butterfly and moth populations in urban areas.

Key Messages:

Seven studies evaluated the effects of altering mowing regimes on greenspaces and road verges on butterflies and moths. One study was in each of Finland, the Netherlands, Poland, Germany, the UK, Canada and Sweden.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Richness/diversity (3 studies): Two replicated, paired, controlled studies in Germany and the UK found that less frequently mown or unmown urban greenspaces had a higher species richness and diversity of butterflies and moths than more frequently mown areas. One replicated, site comparison study in Canada found that the management of road verges (and land under power lines) did not affect the species richness of butterflies.

POPULATION RESPONSE (4 STUDIES)

Abundance (3 studies): Two replicated studies (including one paired, controlled study) in the UK and Canada found that unmown public parks and road verges (and land under power lines) had a higher abundance of all adult butterflies and pearl crescent and northern pearl crescent butterflies than regularly mown areas, but the abundance of other butterflies on the road verges (and under power lines) was similar between mown and unmown areas in the second study. One study in Finland found that roadsides mown in late summer had more ringlet butterflies than those mown in mid-summer.
Survival (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Poland found that road verges mown less frequently, or later in summer, had fewer dead butterflies killed by traffic than more frequently or earlier mown verges.

BEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)

Use (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in Sweden reported that less frequently mown urban grasslands were more frequently occupied by scarce copper butterflies than more frequently mown grasslands. One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the Netherlands found that butterflies were recorded on verges which were mowed once or twice a year and those which were not mowed, but on mowed verges butterflies were only recorded on those where hay was removed.

3842: Plant parks, gardens and road verges with appropriate native species 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Non-native ornamental plants dominate urban and suburban landscapes. A large number of butterflies and moths have specialist feeding requirements, and can only feed as caterpillars, or occasionally adults, on plants which they have evolved with (Burghardt et al. 2008). Therefore, butterfly and moth species richness often correlates with the number of potential larval host plant species present in urban parks (Koh & Sodhi 2004), and planting more native species may benefit a wide range of butterflies and moths. Moreover, caterpillar growth and survival can vary between different host plant species (Pocius et al. 2017), so the choice of host species for planting may be important.
Note that some non-native plants may still provide important nectar resources for butterflies and moths. For studies which include deliberate planting of non-native species, see “Practise ‘wildlife gardening’”.

Eight studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of planting parks and gardens with appropriate native species. Seven were in the USA and one was in Germany.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (5 STUDIES)

Richness/diversity (5 studies): Three of five replicated studies (including three paired, three controlled and two site comparison studies) in Germany and the USA found that gardens and road verges planted with native species had a greater species richness of butterfly and moth adults and caterpillars than gardens or verges with mixed or exclusively non-native plant species. The other two studies found that the species richness of adult butterflies was similar in areas planted with native or non-native flowers.

POPULATION RESPONSE (6 STUDIES)

Abundance (4 studies): Two of three replicated studies (including two paired and two controlled studies) in the USA found that gardens planted with native species had a higher abundance of butterfly and moth caterpillars than gardens with mixed or exclusively non-native plant species. The third study found that the abundance of adult butterflies was similar in areas planted with native or non-native flowers. One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the USA found that when taller native milkweed species were planted, they had a higher abundance of monarch butterfly eggs and caterpillars than shorter milkweed species.
Survival (2 studies): One of two replicated, site comparison studies in the USA found that the survival of pipevine swallowtail eggs and caterpillars was lower on California pipevine planted in gardens than in natural sites. The other study found that the survival of monarch butterfly caterpillars was similar on common milkweed planted in gardens and meadows.

3843: Remove or change turbine lighting to reduce insect attraction 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Wind turbines, like other large structures, are illuminated at night to alert aircraft to their presence. However, lighting attracts nocturnal moths, reducing their ability to forage as well as causing direct mortality (van Langevelde et al. 2017). The colour or type of lighting used also affects how attractive lights are to moths, with shorter wavelength light (ultraviolet, blue and green) being more attractive than longer wavelengths (red and yellow; van Langevelde et al. 2011). Removing or changing the lighting used on turbines may therefore reduce their impact on moth populations.
For studies on reducing light pollution generally, see “Threat: Pollution”.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Like all insects, butterflies and moths are attracted to colours, but show greater attraction to some colours than others (Kevan 1983). Common wind turbine colours (white and grey) have been found to attract more insects, including butterflies and moths, than other colours such as purple (Long et al. 2011). Therefore, painting turbines in less attractive colours may reduce the disturbance caused to butterfly and moth behaviour.

Prospecting for underground products, such as oil and gas, can require the destruction of habitat on the surface. Minimizing the footprint of these operations may reduce the disturbance to sensitive species. Note that smaller individual disturbances may require more patches of disturbance across the landscape, and therefore may not reduce the total area disturbed (Riva et al. 2018).

There are a wide variety of actions which may be implemented on farmland to try and improve habitat quality for butterflies and moths (see actions under “Agriculture & Aquaculture”), and agri-environment schemes are increasingly including options and packages designed to support pollinators, including butterflies and moths. Even on nature reserves, getting the right balance of habitat management can be difficult. For species with particular habitat requirements which are difficult to achieve, such as a structural diversity of grassland swards, training events for land managers and conservation staff may help to improve habitat quality for butterflies and moths (Parsons 2004).

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Threats to butterflies and moths, as well as actions for their conservation, can come from members of the public. Therefore, raising awareness of the impact of individual actions on species conservation may improve butterfly and moth conservation outcomes. Behaviours and beliefs which create threats, and which awareness raising should aim to minimize, could include the use of insecticides, the release of non-native animals and plants into the wild (for example from gardens), and a general fear of invertebrates or of moths specifically. Conversely, behaviours which awareness raising may wish to encourage could include planting nectar and pollen-rich native plants, or reducing weeding or mowing, in gardens.

3848: Increase consideration of butterflies and moths in international, national and local conservation plans 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Conservation planning, particularly at higher levels, traditionally focuses on charismatic vertebrate species. Despite being among the best studied and widely recognized invertebrates, explicit conservation plans for butterflies, and particularly moths, remain rare. The inclusion of butterflies and moths in conservation plans may help to raise awareness of the species, which may be important for stimulating research into their requirements, or funds for the protection and management of important sites for their conservation (Parsons 2004).

3850: Restrict recreational activities to particular areas 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Many outdoor areas, particularly those with public access, are managed for a variety of recreational activities alongside nature conservation. This may include walking, cycling or riding trails, adventure sports or camping. These activities are likely to have a detrimental effect on many species of butterfly and moth, by increasing disturbance and making some areas of habitat unsuitable. Restricting recreational activities to specific areas of a park or reserve may help to minimize these impacts, by limiting the area of disturbance and allowing species to survive in the remaining, undisturbed areas.

The construction of new roads can not only destroy tracts of habitat, but fragment remaining areas into smaller, more isolated blocks. However, more careful planning may allow impacts to be reduced by routing new roads around, rather than through, important habitat. This could conserve larger patches of habitat for butterflies and moths.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Illuminating roads at night is an important part of traffic and pedestrian safety, but poses a risk to moths which are attracted to artificial lights, and therefore disrupted from their natural behaviours such as feeding and reproduction. Minimizing lighting on roads, either by reducing the number or intensity of lights, restricting the timing of lighting, or using motion-sensitive lighting which only activates when required, may help to reduce the impacts on moth populations.
For studies on reducing the impacts of lighting generally, see actions under “Threat: Pollution”.

3853: Use infrastructure to reduce vehicle collision risk along roads 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Collisions with vehicles on roads represent a serious mortality risk for butterflies and moths, especially for low-flying species which rarely go above the height of standard cars. For example, between 1 and 11% of 95 road crossings by Oregon silverspot Speyeria zerene hippolyta resulted in mortality (Zielin et al. 2016). Artificial structures may be used to try to encourage butterflies and moths to fly higher before crossing the road, therefore reducing the chances of collisions with vehicles.

3854: Restore or maintain species-rich grassland along road/railway verges 
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Grass verges beside transportation corridors may offer an opportunity to provide habitat patches in their own right, as well as to connect larger areas of grassland across the landscape (Munguira & Thomas 1992), although the butterfly community found in remnant habitat along road verges may differ from that found in large blocks of native habitat (Davis et al. 2008). However, roads pose a risk of mortality due to collision with vehicles, a risk which may be higher for smaller species (Skórka et al. 2013). Road verges with more native plant species have a greater abundance and species richness of native butterflies (Skórka et al. 2013, Leston & Koper 2016), although this can also increase the number of butterflies which fly into the road (Zielin et al. 2016). However, the number of individuals killed on the road may be lower next to verges which have a higher species richness of plants (Skórka et al. 2013). This suggests that restoring or maintaining species-rich grassland may provide an opportunity to conserve butterflies and moths along transportation corridors.

Key Messages:

Eight studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of restoring or maintaining species-rich grassland along road or railway verges. Three studies were in the USA and one was in each of Germany, the UK, Finland, Poland, and Canada.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (6 STUDIES)

Richness/diversity (6 studies): Four replicated, site comparison studies (including one paired study) in Germany, the UK, the USA and Finland found that restored roadside prairies, verges sown with native wildflowers, with more butterfly species’ larval food plants, with more species of plants and with more plants in flower had a higher species richness and diversity of butterflies, day-flying moths, burnet moths and meadow-specialist moths than verges dominated by non-native vegetation or with fewer butterfly species’ larval food plants, fewer plant species, and fewer plants in flower. However, one of these studies also found that verges sown with more plant species did not have higher species richness of meadow-specialist butterflies. One replicated, site comparison study in Canada found that road verges and land under power lines managed by mowing once or twice a year, or not at all, had a similar species richness of butterflies to remnant prairies. One replicated, site comparison study in Poland found that wide road verges had a higher species richness of butterflies than narrow road verges.

POPULATION RESPONSE (7 STUDIES)

Abundance (5 studies): Two of three replicated, site comparison studies (including one paired study) in the UK, the USA and Finland found that restored roadside prairies and verges sown with more butterfly species’ larval food plants had a greater abundance of butterflies and burnet moths than verges dominated by non-native vegetation or with fewer butterfly species’ larval food plants. However, one of these studies also found that verges with more plants in flower did not have a greater abundance of butterflies and burnet moths than verges with fewer plants in flower. The other study found that verges sown with more plant species did not have a greater abundance of meadow-specialist butterflies or moths. One replicated, site comparison study in Canada found that road verges and land under power lines managed by mowing once or twice a year, or not at all, had a similar abundance of butterflies to remnant prairies. One replicated, site comparison study in Poland found that wide road verges had a greater abundance of butterflies than narrow road verges.
Survival (3 studies): One of two replicated, site comparison studies (including one paired study) in the USA found that restored prairie road verges had a lower mortality risk for butterflies than verges dominated by non-native grasses. The other study found more dead butterflies and moths on roads with tall meadow verges than on roads with frequently mown, non-native, short grass verges or wooded verges. This study also found more dead butterflies and moths on roads with habitat in the central reservation than on roads without habitat in the central reservation. One replicated, site comparison study in Poland found that less frequently mown road verges, and verges mown later in the summer, had fewer dead butterflies than verges which were mown more frequently or earlier in the summer.
Condition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that monarch caterpillars living on road verges mown once or twice a year had a similar number of parasites to caterpillars living in mown and unmown prairies.

3855: Manage land under power lines for butterflies and moths 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Land under power lines offers a number of conservation opportunities. Management must maintain early successional habitats by suppressing the growth of woody species, to prevent interference with the electric lines. This could have benefits for butterflies and moths, which often favour these lightly disturbed habitats (Forrester et al. 2005). In addition, by running across the landscape, power lines may provide connectivity between other patches of suitable habitat. However, the methods used to control vegetation – primarily herbicide application or cutting – may affect the quality of the habitat created (Smallidge et al. 1996), while the frequency of management may be important for maintaining stretches of habitat in optimal conditions (Ravenscroft 2006).

Key Messages:

Six studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of managing land under power lines for butterflies and moths. Two studies were in each of the USA and Finland, and one was in each of the UK and Canada.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Richness/diversity (3 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies (including one paired study) in Finland found that land under power lines managed by mechanical cutting had a higher species richness of butterflies than unmanaged land, and butterfly species richness was highest 2–4 years after scrub and trees were cleared. One replicated, site comparison study in Canada found that the species richness of butterflies was similar under power lines and on road verges mown once or twice a year, or left unmown.

POPULATION RESPONSE (6 STUDIES)

Abundance (6 studies): One of two replicated, site comparison studies (including one paired study) in Finland and Canada found that land under power lines managed by mechanical cutting had a higher abundance of butterflies than unmanaged land. The other study found that land under power lines and on road verges managed by mowing had a lower abundance of pearl crescent and northern pearl crescent butterflies, and a similar abundance of other butterflies, to those left unmown. Two of three site comparison studies (including two replicated studies) in the USA, the UK and Finland found that the time since management under power lines did not affect the abundance of Karner blue butterflies or small pearl-bordered fritillaries, but chequered skipper abundance was higher in areas cleared ≤2 years ago than in areas cut ≥4 years earlier. The other study found that power lines cleared of trees and scrub 2–4 years earlier had a higher abundance of butterflies than power lines cleared 1 year or 6–8 years earlier. Two site comparison studies in the USA found that land under power lines managed by cutting or herbicide application, and by mowing or cutting, had a similar abundance of Karner blue butterflies and six other butterfly species, but the abundance of frosted elfin was higher under power lines managed by mowing than those managed by cutting.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)

Use (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the UK reported that pearl-bordered fritillaries used areas under power lines where scrub had been cleared one or two years earlier, but not under power lines cleared three or more years ago.

3856: Protect and connect habitat along elevational gradients 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Climate change threatens butterfly and moth species by shifting areas of suitable climatic conditions away from species’ historic ranges. For montane species, this leads to areas at lower elevations becoming less climatically suitable, and areas at higher elevations becoming more suitable (Franco et al. 2006). To survive, butterfly and moth populations must be able to move uphill along elevational gradients, but this movement is hindered by habitat loss and fragmentation. Protecting and connecting habitat along elevational gradients may enable species to move, and adapt their distribution to cope with climate change.

For most species, this leads to areas at lower latitudes becoming less climatically suitable, and areas at higher latitudes becoming more suitable (Mason et al. 2015).

3858: Manage natural waterbodies in arid areas to prevent desiccation 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Climate change is altering rainfall patterns globally, leading to increasingly frequent or severe droughts in some areas. Access to water is important for some species of butterfly and moth, including those where the adults gather nutrients by “mud-puddling” (Thomas & Lewington 2016). Droughts can also lead to the desiccation of caterpillar food plants, which in turn may kill caterpillars if the drought coincides with their period of growth and reliance on the plant. Managing natural waterbodies, from small pools to larger areas, may help to protect butterflies and moths by maintaining water availability in the environment.

3859: Create microclimate and microhabitat refuges 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Climate change threatens butterfly and moth species by shifting areas of suitable climatic conditions away from species’ historic ranges. For species with poor dispersal ability, tracking suitable climate across long distances is likely to be difficult, or even impossible. However, landscapes with more diverse microclimates are able to preserve species, by providing cooler climatic refuges (Suggitt et al. 2015, 2018). Therefore, increasing microclimate diversity by, for example, creating topographic features or increasing the structural diversity of habitats, may enable temperature sensitive species to persist (Davies et al. 2006, Suggitt et al. 2018). Improving habitat suitability more generally may also reduce the overall stress on populations, and increase their ability to cope with climatic changes (Walsh 2017). These features may also enable species which are shifting their ranges polewards to colonize new areas more quickly.

3861: Retain or plant trees to act as windbreaks 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Even under normal weather conditions many species of butterfly and moth, particularly those which are weak fliers, show a preference for sheltered areas (Hayes et al. 2018). However, during extreme weather events, high winds are a particular problem as they prevent adults from being able to fly, and therefore potentially find food, defend territories, or mate. Retaining or planting trees, which act as wind breaks, may enable butterflies and moths to maintain activity during higher winds, reducing the impact of extreme weather events resulting from climate change.

3862: Restore or create new habitats after mining and quarrying  
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Former mining and quarrying sites are often hostile environments for butterflies and moths, as large areas of bare ground may remain sparsely vegetated for many decades (Rowe et al. 2006). However, many former extraction sites have been turned into important nature reserves over time since their abandonment (e.g. Turner et al. 2009). Restoration of such sites may involve a number of different actions, such as introducing soil or nutrients, planting desired vegetation communities, flooding areas or landscaping new features. A common approach for the restoration of post-mining sites is “technical reclamation”, whereby the uneven surface is flattened by heavy machinery, before fertile soil is added and sown with grasses and herbs, and planted with trees. However, by accelerating succession, such an approach can reduce habitat availability for species which depend on disturbed, early successional habitats (Moradi et al. 2018).

Background information and definitions:
Historically, the widespread collection of butterflies and moths by private collectors was a popular activity, and may have contributed to the decline of some rarer species (Collins & Morris 1985, Duffey 1968). Today, collecting is illegal in many parts of the world, and rarer species are often subject to specific legal protection. However, it should be noted that for understudied species, carefully regulated collection for scientific research can yield valuable insights into species’ diversity, ecology and conservation. This action is for studies testing the impact of legal protection on wild populations of butterflies and moths, either across all species, or using species-specific legislation.

3864: Use education programmes and local engagement to reduce persecution or exploitation of species 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Although many species of butterflies and moths are among the most popular insects, others are maligned as crop pests or clothes-eaters, or misunderstood simply because they are nocturnal. Increasing public understanding of the importance and beauty of butterflies and moths can counteract this, reducing the frequency of negative behaviours towards them, or even raising funds for their conservation. On the other hand, some rare species of butterfly and moth are still threatened by collecting, and in this case, education may be used to raise awareness of the species’ plight with the aim of changing behaviour. This action is for studies which test the impact of either type of education programmes on butterfly and moth populations.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of using education programmes and local engagement to reduce persecution or exploitation of butterflies and moths.

3865: Legally protect large native trees 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Trees, in particular large, old individuals of native species, provide a range of important resources for butterflies and moths. Many species feed on trees as caterpillars, or nectar from them as adults, and trees also provide perches from which they can defend territories, or shelter where they can rest (Thomas & Lewington 2016). However, trees may take 100 years or more to reach large sizes, making them functionally irreplaceable components of the landscape. Therefore, when harvesting trees for commercial use, legally mandating the protection of large, native individuals may have a disproportionate impact on the conservation of butterflies and moths which rely on them.

3866: Strengthen cultural traditions such as sacred groves that prevent timber harvesting 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Forests have important cultural value in many societies around the world, which has led to many areas being protected under local tradition or law. As the surrounding forest is logged or managed, these cultural sites may become increasingly important for conservation, as they preserve intact, primary forest. However, national Governments or logging companies which do not respect local traditions may seek to exploit these sites and, if offered enough money or improvements to their livelihoods, local people may agree or be forced to accept this. Strengthening cultural traditions which protect forests, either within local communities or by lobbying national Governments, may help to prevent exploitation of these important sites.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of strengthening cultural traditions that prevent timber harvesting.

3867: Use selective or reduced impact logging instead of conventional logging
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Harvesting timber within forests can be carried out by clearcutting sites or by various methods of harvesting a proportion of trees. Selective logging is the removal of selected trees within a forest based on criteria such as diameter, height, or species. Remaining trees are left in the stand, as opposed to conventional clearcutting where all trees are felled. Reduced impact logging is a sustainable harvesting and management method that aims to minimize ecological disturbance. It involves selective logging as well as other practices such as mapping large target trees prior to felling, limiting the number of trees which can be felled/hectare, pre-cutting heavy vines and controlling the direction in which trees fall to minimize collateral damage, and planning the routes of access roads to reduce disturbance (Montejo-Kovacevich et al. 2018, Ribeiro & Freitas 2012). The aim is to preserve the integrity of the forest structure, which may also be termed “continuous cover forestry” if the canopy remains intact.
For other options for harvesting timber, see “Harvest groups of trees or use thinning instead of clearcutting”, “Use patch retention harvesting instead of clearcutting”, “Use leave-tree harvesting instead of clearcutting”, “Use shelterwood harvesting instead of clearcutting” and “Retain riparian buffer strips during timber harvest”.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Community composition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Brazil found that forests managed by reduced impact logging at different intensities had a different community composition of fruit-feeding butterflies to pristine forest.
Richness/diversity (3 studies): One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that forests harvested by single tree selection had a similar species richness of moths to forests managed by group selection harvesting or clearcutting, but a lower species richness than unharvested forest. One site comparison study in Brazil found that a forest managed by reduced impact logging had a similar species richness and diversity of butterflies to primary forest. One replicated, site comparison study in Brazil found that forests managed by reduced impact logging at different intensities had a similar species richness of fruit-feeding butterflies.

POPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Abundance (3 studies): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in Sweden found that selectively logged forests had a higher abundance of exposed moth caterpillars, but a similar abundance of concealed moth caterpillars, to clearcut forests, and a similar abundance of all moth caterpillars to undisturbed forests.

3868: Harvest groups of trees or use thinning instead of clearcutting 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Harvesting of timber within forests can be carried out by clearcutting sites or by various methods of harvesting a proportion of trees. Forests naturally undergo disturbances such as storms and lightning that can create open patches. Similarly, group selection harvesting and thinning are harvest methods designed to reduce the density of trees within a forest, without removing substantial areas of canopy cover, and may create a mix of different habitats which suit different species of butterflies and moths.
Note that by thinning, rather than felling a whole forest, larger areas would need to be managed in order to achieve the same timber harvest, though some degree of forest cover can be retained over that area.
For other options for harvesting timber, see “Use selective or reduced impact logging instead of conventional logging”, “Use patch retention harvesting instead of clearcutting”, “Use leave-tree harvesting instead of clearcutting”, “Use shelterwood harvesting instead of clearcutting” and “Retain riparian buffer strips during timber harvest”.

Key Messages:

Three studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of harvesting groups of trees or using thinning instead of clearcutting. All three studies were in the USA.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Richness/diversity (3 studies): One controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that the species richness of macro-moths was higher after a forest was harvested by thinning, than after harvest by patch-cutting or clearcutting, and the richness in the thinned forest was similar to an unharvested forest. One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that forests managed by group selection harvesting had a similar species richness of moths to forests managed by single tree harvesting or clearcutting, but a lower species richness than unharvested forest. One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that moth species richness recovered at a similar rate after management by group selection harvesting or clearcutting, but recovery in both was slower than after shelterwood harvesting.

3869: Use patch retention harvesting instead of clearcutting 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Harvesting of timber within forests can be carried out by clearcutting sites or by various methods of harvesting a proportion of trees. Patch retention harvesting may be used as an alternative to a total clearcutting in commercial forests. Typically, around 10% of trees are retained in patches within a clearcut area. These retained patches can help maintain characteristic forest species and act as reservoirs for recolonization by forest dependent species.
For other options for harvesting timber, see “Use selective or reduced impact logging instead of conventional logging”, “Harvest groups of trees or use thinning instead of clearcutting”, “Use leave-tree harvesting instead of clearcutting”, “Use shelterwood harvesting instead of clearcutting” and “Retain riparian buffer strips during timber harvest”.

3870: Use leave-tree harvesting instead of clearcutting 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Harvesting of timber within forests can be carried out by clearcutting sites or by various methods of harvesting a proportion of trees. Leave-tree harvest retains a low density of high-quality trees uniformly through the forest stand. Trees can be retained in groups or dispersed and may contain trees with structural characteristics important to wildlife. Compared to clearcutting, this type of management can help maintain forest species.
For other options for harvesting timber, see “Use selective or reduced impact logging instead of conventional logging”, “Harvest groups of trees or use thinning instead of clearcutting”, “Use patch retention harvesting instead of clearcutting”, “Use shelterwood harvesting instead of clearcutting” and “Retain riparian buffer strips during timber harvest”.

3871: Use shelterwood harvesting instead of clearcutting 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Harvesting of timber within forests can be carried out by clearcutting sites or by various methods of harvesting a proportion of trees. Shelterwood harvesting is a management technique designed to obtain even-aged timber without clearcutting. It involves harvesting trees in a series of partial cuttings, with trees removed uniformly over the plot, which allows new seedlings to grow from the seeds of older trees. This can help maintain characteristic forest species and increase structural diversity of stands.
For other options for harvesting timber, see “Use selective or reduced impact logging instead of conventional logging”, “Harvest groups of trees or use thinning instead of clearcutting”, “Use patch retention harvesting instead of clearcutting”, “Use leave-tree harvesting instead of clearcutting” and “Retain riparian buffer strips during timber harvest”.

Key Messages:

Three studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of using shelterwood harvesting instead of clearcutting. All three studies were in the USA.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Richness/diversity (3 studies): One controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that the species richness of macro-moths was higher after a forest was managed by shelterwood harvesting, than after harvest by patch-cutting or clearcutting, and the richness in the shelterwood harvested forest was similar to a thinned forest and an unharvested forest. One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that forests managed by shelterwood harvesting had a similar species richness of moths to forests managed by single tree harvesting, group selection harvesting or clearcutting, but a lower species richness than unharvested forest. One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that moth species richness recovered faster after shelterwood harvesting than after group selection harvesting or clearcutting.

3872: Retain riparian buffer strips during timber harvest 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Retaining riparian forest buffer strips along water courses or around ponds can help to shield waterways from the negative impacts of tree harvesting, such as sedimentation, by reducing soil erosion. It can also help to mitigate the effects of habitat loss and disturbance for forest butterflies and moths by retaining suitable habitat patches and favourable microclimates. Retained habitat strips can also provide corridors for dispersal through a disturbed landscape (see “Habitat protection – Retain connectivity between habitat patches”).

3873: Create or retain deadwood in forest management 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
In conventionally managed forests deadwood is often cleared out, either to use, or for safety, accessibility or aesthetic reasons. Although most butterflies and moths will not use deadwood directly, woodlands managed in a more natural way, with deadwood retained or added, may support a more diverse ecosystem. For example, the presence of deadwood should encourage a greater abundance and diversity of fungi, on which some species of moth depend (Bury et al. 2014).

3874: Re-plant native trees in logged areas 
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Logging of native forest or plantations causes a dramatic change in the structure of the landscape. Planting native trees in logged areas of natural forest may help to speed up the process of succession and redevelopment of the forest structure, while planting native trees in logged plantations may encourage the restoration of native forest in the area. Note that many species of butterfly and moth do well in early successional woodland after disturbance, but these species may represent a different community to those found in established, pristine forest.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of replanting native trees in logged areas. The study was in Ghana.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Richness/diversity (1 study): One site comparison study in Ghana found that nine years after an area was replanted with native trees after logging it had similar species richness but lower diversity for two of three metrics compared to naturally regenerating secondary forest.

3875: Reduce planting density to create warmer woodlands 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Although many species of butterfly and moth are associated with woodland, they often prefer openings within the forest where sunlight penetrates the canopy and creates warmer patches for basking. Replanted woodlands, whether young plantations or native forests, often have trees planted at very high density, which may be unsuitable for warmth-loving butterflies and moths. Reducing the density at which trees are planted may provide habitat for more butterfly and moth species in woodlands.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of reducing planting density to create warmer woodlands.

3876: Encourage natural regeneration in former plantations or logged forest 
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Logging of native forest or plantations causes a dramatic change in the structure of the landscape. Encouraging natural woodland regeneration in logged forest may enable the redevelopment of the forest structure, while encouraging natural regeneration in former plantations may encourage the restoration of native forest in the area. This action includes studies comparing naturally regenerating forest to plantations, continually managed natural forests, or pristine forests (which represent the end goal of regeneration). Note that many species of butterfly and moth do well in early successional woodland after disturbance, but these species may represent a different community to those found in established, pristine forest.

Key Messages:

Four studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of encouraging natural regeneration in former plantations or logged forest. One study was in each of Côte d’Ivoire, Japan, Ghana and Uganda.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (4 STUDIES)

Community composition (3 studies): One site comparison study in Côte d’Ivoire found that rarer species of fruit-feeding butterfly were more frequently caught in a naturally regenerating forest than in a forest still managed by thinning. One replicated, site comparison study in Japan found that the moth community was different between naturally regenerating forests of different ages. One site comparison study in Ghana found that a naturally regenerating forest had a butterfly community more similar to forest replanted nine years ago than a primary forest or a clear-cut area.
Richness/diversity (4 studies): One site comparison study in Côte d’Ivoire found that a naturally regenerating forest had a similar species richness and diversity of fruit-feeding butterflies to a forest still managed by thinning. One replicated, site comparison study in Japan found that naturally regenerating forests had a greater species richness of moths than plantations. One site comparison study in Ghana found that a naturally regenerating forest had lower butterfly species richness than a primary forest, but similar richness to a clear-cut area and a nine-year old replanted forest, and lower community diversity than a primary forest and a clear-cut area. One replicated, site comparison study in Uganda found that naturally regenerating forests had a similar species richness of butterflies to pristine forests, but richness was highest 12–25 years after felling.

3877: Use prescribed fire to maintain or restore disturbance in forests
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Although many species of butterflies and moths are found in woodland, most prefer areas with open glades or a sparse understorey, where light can penetrate and enable flowering plants to grow, as well as providing areas for basking. One option for opening up dense areas of woodland is to use prescribed burning. Although destructive in the short-term, with likely loss of butterflies and moths through direct mortality or reductions in food availability (Glaves et al. 2013), burning may have long-term benefits by creating a more favourable, open habitat (Bubová et al. 2015). However, the impact of fires can vary depending on their exact characteristics, such as the frequency, temperature, ground surface intensity, time and size of burning compared to the surrounding unburned areas (Swengel 2001, Tucker 2003, New et al. 2010), and caution should be taken before instigating fire in place of alternative management options such as grazing or cutting.

Open habitats, such as grassland, heathland, peatland and fynbos, require disturbance processes to prevent them undergoing succession to scrub or woodland. One option for preventing succession and opening up areas of habitat is to use prescribed burning.

Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Open habitats, such as grassland, heathland, peatland and fynbos, require disturbance processes to prevent them undergoing succession to scrub or woodland. One option for preventing succession and opening up areas of habitat is to use prescribed burning. However, burning is likely to be destructive in the short-term, because of either direct mortality or a reduction in food availability for butterflies and moths (Glaves et al. 2013). Leaving some areas unburned within a prescribed burn, in particular habitat patches which currently support a high abundance of sensitive species (Kwilosz & Knutson 1999), may help populations to survive the fire and recolonize the newly created habitat over the following weeks, months or years. Unburned patches may be part of the burning rotation, or remain permanently unburned and managed by other, non-fire management options such as grazing or haying.

3880: Use fire suppression/control 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Wildfires are part of a natural disturbance process in many habitats, and help to retain open landscapes such as grasslands and savannas. However, fire is destructive, and in the short-term will destroy habitat and kill butterflies and moths (Glaves et al. 2013). In areas occupied by sensitive and range-restricted species, it may therefore be necessary to suppress or control fires – whether natural or anthropogenic – to reduce their impact to small areas. This may be achieved by using herbicides or manual vegetation clearance to reduce the fuel-load in fire-prone areas, or deliberately burning small areas to reduce the risk of large wildfires.
For studies on creating fire breaks to restrict the spread of wildfires, see “Mechanically remove mid-storey or ground vegetation to create fire breaks”.

Background information and definitions:
Wildfires can spread quickly through dry landscapes, in particular where flammable vegetation has accumulated. This can pose a threat to both wildlife and people. One option for pre-empting the control of wildfires is to create “fire breaks” in the landscape, where vegetation is cleared to prevent future fires from spreading between adjacent areas. Fire breaks may also be created prior to prescribed burning, to contain the burn within a desired area. In addition to any benefits from the reduction in the spread of the fire, breaks may create suitable habitat for butterflies and moths in their own right. Both outcomes are considered in studies in this action.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of mechanically removing mid-storey or ground vegetation to create fire breaks. One study was in Portugal and the other was in France.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Richness/diversity (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in Portugal found that cork oak woodlands with more recent or more regular mechanical clearance of woody understorey vegetation had a greater species richness of butterflies than woodlands cleared less frequently or longer ago. One replicated, paired, controlled study in France reported that shrublands where trees and/or bushes were mechanically cleared to create firebreaks had a similar species richness of butterflies to a shrubland where grazing was used to suppress vegetation.

POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Portugal found that cork oak woodlands with more recent or more regular mechanical clearance of woody understorey vegetation had a higher abundance of butterflies than woodlands cleared less frequently or longer ago.

3882: Use prescribed fire to maintain or restore disturbance in grasslands or other open habitats
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Open habitats, such as grassland, heathland, peatland and fynbos, require disturbance processes to prevent them undergoing succession to scrub or woodland. One option for preventing succession and opening up areas of habitat is to use prescribed burning. Although destructive in the short-term, with likely loss of butterflies and moths through direct mortality or reductions in food availability (Glaves et al. 2013), burning may have long-term benefits by creating a more favourable, open habitat (Bubová et al. 2015), with increases in structural diversity (Glaves et al. 2013) or flower density (Vogel et al. 2010). In particular, fires which move quickly across the site and burn some areas more than others may be important for creating a diverse habitat structure (Kwilosz & Knutson 1999). However, the impact of fires can vary depending on their exact characteristics, such as the frequency, temperature, ground surface intensity, time and size of burning compared to the surrounding unburned areas (Swengel 2001, Tucker 2003, New et al. 2010) and caution should be taken before instigating fire in place of alternative management options such as grazing or cutting.
For studies on further manipulations to burning regimes, including using different frequencies or timing of prescribed burning, see “Use rotational burning”, “Change season/timing of prescribed burning” and “Leave some areas unburned during prescribed burning”. For studies using prescribed burning in forests, see “Use prescribed fire to maintain or restore disturbance in forests”.

Key Messages:



Thirteen studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of using prescribed fire to maintain or restore disturbance in grasslands or other open habitats. Eight studies were in the USA, three were in the UK, one was in South Africa and one was a review across Europe.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Community composition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that pastures managed by patch-burning had a similar butterfly community to rotationally or continuously grazed pastures.
Richness/diversity (3 studies): Two replicated, before-and-after studies (including one randomized, controlled study and one paired sites, site comparison study) in the USA found that shrubland plots and grass field margins managed by burning had a similar species richness of butterflies to those which were unburned. One replicated, site comparison study in the USA reported that pastures managed by patch-burning had a lower species richness of butterflies than rotationally grazed pastures, a similar richness to rotationally grazed and mown pastures, and a higher species richness than continuously grazed pastures.

POPULATION RESPONSE (12 STUDIES)

Abundance (12 studies): Four of nine studies (including six replicated studies, two randomized studies, two paired sites studies, three controlled studies, two before-and-after studies, and five site comparison studies) in the UK, South Africa and the USA found that the abundance of heath fritillary adults, marsh fritillary caterpillar webs and Fender’s blue caterpillars and eggs was higher (sometimes after initial reductions in abundance) on heathland, fen meadows and prairies one or more years after management by burning than before burning, or compared to unburned or grazed land, although the total population of Fender’s blue declined in adjacent burned and unburned areas. Three studies found that the abundance of Brenton blue butterfly eggs and adults, rosy marsh moth caterpillars and regal fritillary adults was lower on a bog and prairies managed by burning than on unburned land, at least one and five years after burning. One study found that grass field margins managed by burning had a similar abundance of butterflies to unburned field margins. The seventh study found that abundance of Powershiek skipperling to burning, along with haying and idling, depended on the site’s vegetation characteristics. Two replicated, site comparison studies in the USA found that two prairie specialists (regal fritillary and arogos skipper) and three out of nine butterfly species were less abundant in prairies or pastures managed by burning than in prairies managed by haying or grazed pastures. These studies also found that the abundance of generalist and migrant species, and of purplish copper, was higher in burned prairies or pastures than hayed prairies or grazed pastures. One review across Europe reported that occasional burning on grassland benefitted 10 out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern.
Survival (1 study): One replicated, paired sites, controlled study in the USA found that in prairie plots burned one year before, Fender’s blue butterfly caterpillars had lower survival than in unburned plots.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)

Use (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the UK found that a similar proportion of fen meadows were occupied by marsh fritillary caterpillars whether they were managed by burning, grazing or were unmanaged.

3883: Use rotational burning 
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Open habitats, such as grassland, heathland, peatland and fynbos, require disturbance processes to prevent them undergoing succession to scrub or woodland. One option for preventing succession and opening up areas of habitat is to use prescribed burning. However, burning is likely to be destructive in the short-term, because of either direct mortality or a reduction in food availability for butterflies and moths (Glaves et al. 2013). Rotational burning, where sites are burned once every few years, may allow time for habitat patches to recover to the optimal condition for butterflies and moths in the period between burns, while maintaining a dynamic patchwork of suitable habitat across a site. However, the impact of fires can vary depending on their exact characteristics, such as the frequency, temperature, ground surface intensity, time and size of burning compared to the surrounding unburned areas (Swengel 2001, Tucker 2003, New et al. 2010) and caution should be taken before instigating fire in place of alternative management options such as grazing or cutting.
For studies on the impact of single prescribed burns, see “Use prescribed fire to maintain or restore disturbance in grasslands or other open habitats”. For studies of other changes to the burning regime, see “Change season/timing of prescribed burning” and “Leave some areas unburned during prescribed burning”.

Key Messages:

Seventeen studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of using rotational burning. Twelve studies were in the USA, one was in South Africa and one was in Japan.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (5 STUDIES)

Community composition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that prairies managed by rotational burning (every 1–6 years) and grazing had a different community composition of butterflies to prairies managed by rotational burning or grazing alone.
Richness/diversity (5 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies in the USA and Japan found that pine-oak barrens and semi-natural grasslands managed by rotational burning every 2 years or 2–5 years (sometimes combined with rotational mowing) had a higher species richness of butterflies than unmanaged sites or sites managed by annual burning or mowing. However, one of these studies also found that the species richness of grassland butterflies was lower in prairies managed by rotational burning than in unmanaged prairies in one of two regions. Two replicated, site comparison studies in the USA found that the species richness of butterflies was higher on prairies burned more than one or four years ago than on prairies burned in the last one or two years under rotational burning management. One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that prairies managed by rotational burning (every 1–6 years) and grazing had a similar species richness of butterflies to prairies managed by rotational burning or grazing alone, but a lower diversity of butterflies than sites managed by rotational burning only. One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the USA found that species richness of butterflies did not differ between prairies managed with annual rotational burning or complete burning.

POPULATION RESPONSE (15 STUDIES)

Abundance (15 studies): Four replicated studies (including one paired, controlled study and three site comparison studies) in the USA found that under rotational burning management the total abundance of prairie specialist, grassland and all butterflies, and of most insects including butterflies and moths, was higher on prairies burned more than one, two or four years ago, or longer ago, than on prairies burned in the last one or two years, or recently. One of these studies also found that the abundance of grassland and generalist butterflies was highest in the third year after burning, and migrant butterflies in the first year after burning. Two of these studies6,8, and an additional replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that the total abundance of butterflies, and of most insects including butterflies and moths, was higher in pine-oak barrens and prairies managed by rotational burning every 2–5 years, 2–3 years or 1–6 years than at unmanaged sites or sites managed by rotational burning or grazing alone. One of these studies also found that the abundance of butterflies was lower in prairies managed by rotational burning than in unmanaged prairies in one of two regions. Four of six replicated studies in the USA (including five site comparison studies and one randomized, controlled study) found that rotational burning in prairies, pine barrens and grasslands had mixed effects on butterflies, compared to unmanaged, hayed, grazed, mowed or completely burned sites. The fifth study found that prairies managed by rotational burning had more strongly declining populations of grass-skipper butterflies than unmanaged pine barrens or lightly managed fields. The sixth study found that for three fritillary species rotational burning in prairies did not affect abundance, but for three others, in at least one region surveyed, abundance was lower in prairies managed by rotational burning, sometimes in combination with haying, grazing and/or mowing, than in prairies managed with only haying or grazing, or in unmanaged prairies. One replicated, site comparison study in the USA reported that Karner blue butterfly abundance was similar in rotationally burned and unmanaged oak savannas and prairies. One site comparison study in the USA reported that regal fritillary abundance was higher in grasslands and oak barrens managed by rotational burning every three years (following restoration by seeding) than on unmanaged sites or remnant prairies. One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that the abundance of regal fritillary was higher in rotationally burned prairies four years after the last burn than one or eight years after the last burn. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the USA found that, in June, the abundance of regal fritillaries in prairies burned on rotation that spring was lower than in prairies burned 1–2 years ago, but in July the abundance was higher in recently burned prairies.
Survival (1 study): One replicated study in South Africa found that populations of Karkloof blue persisted for at least a year following rotational burning.

3884: Remove or control non-native predators 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Non-native predators, introduced outside of their natural range, can cause problems for native prey species, such as butterflies and moths, which are not adapted to cope with the additional predation pressure. The ideal conservation outcome is often to entirely remove non-native species, but this may not be possible if the species has become too widespread or abundant, or is difficult to catch and kill. However, where removal is not possible, on-going control of the non-native species may allow native butterflies and moths to persist alongside them.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of removing or controlling non-native predators.

3886: Replant alternative host plants or disease resistant individuals to combat losses to disease 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Butterflies and moths rely on particular host plants for the growth and survival of their caterpillars, with some caterpillars able to feed on only one or two plant species. They are therefore vulnerable to sudden declines in the host plant population caused by disease. Planting alternative host plant species (where available) or disease resistant individuals of the affected plant species may help to buffer butterfly and moth populations against the threat of host plant disease.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of replanting alternative host plants or disease resistant individuals to combat losses to disease.

3887: Increase biosecurity checks 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Butterflies and moths may be vulnerable to non-native diseases, parasites, predators or competitors introduced by international trade, in particular of live plants and fresh food. Since many problematic species will themselves be small invertebrates, detecting and removing them after they have been released into a new location is likely to be almost impossible. Therefore, increasing biosecurity checks on shipments may help to identify and remove potentially invasive species before they arrive in new locations, preventing them from having the opportunity to survive and spread.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of increasing biosecurity checks.

Many non-native species of plant and animal are sold commercially in garden centres and pet shops. If seeds or individuals of non-native species escape into the wild, they may invade native ecosystems, altering habitat structure or directly competing with, predating or parasitizing native butterflies and moths. Regulating the sale of potentially problematic species may help to reduce the number which are accidentally released, and reduce the chances of an invasion happening.

Background information and definitions:
Native predators of butterflies and moths (such as mammals, birds or other insects), although part of the natural ecosystem, can become problematic for threatened species if either the abundance of the predator has been increased by human activities, or the abundance of the butterfly or moth species has been reduced by human activities. In these scenarios, the removal, control or exclusion of native predators from an important area, such as around host plants used for breeding, may be necessary to enable the focal species to establish or recover.

Survival (5 studies): Three of five replicated studies (including one randomized, paired, controlled study and three paired, controlled studies) in the UK, Kenya and the USA found that using mesh cages, net sleeves and sticky resin to exclude predators (including birds and mammals and spiders and ants) increased the survival of large copper caterpillars, Boisduval silkworm eggs and caterpillars and Appalachian brown eggs and juveniles. The other two studies found that using cages or water and chemicals to exclude vertebrate or terrestrial predators (mainly ants) did not increase the survival of monarch caterpillars.

Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Invasive or dominant native plant species can alter habitat structure, outcompeting the host plants of butterflies and moths, or making the habitat otherwise unsuitable (Sinclair 2002). Removal of problematic plants may be conducted by hand, with machinery, or by targeted herbicide application (e.g. Glaeser & Schultz 2014). This action includes studies which have tested any of these methods, alone or in combination.
Note that herbicide application may also have negative effects on butterflies and moths (Russell & Schultz 2010) and the choice of which herbicide to use may be important for minimising harms (Schultz et al. 2016). For studies testing the effect of reducing herbicide application, see “Restrict certain pesticides or other agricultural chemicals” and “Reduce fertilizer, pesticide or herbicide use generally”.

Key Messages:

Nine studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of removing or controlling non-native or problematic plants. Five studies were in the USA and one was in each of Poland, South Africa, Australia and Mauritius.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Richness/diversity (2 studies): Two studies (including one replicated, paired, site comparison study and one controlled study) in Mauritius and the USA found that sites where invasive plants were removed by weeding or cutting and applying herbicide (in one case along with fencing to exclude non-native pigs and deer) had a greater species richness of butterflies than untreated sites. One of these studies also found that sites where Chinese privet was removed had a similar species richness of butterflies to sites which had not been invaded.

POPULATION RESPONSE (8 STUDIES)

Abundance (7 studies): Four of six studies (including three controlled studies, one before-and-after study and two site comparison studies) in Poland, South Africa, the USA and Mauritius found that sites where trees and shrubs were removed or invasive plants were cut to a similar height to native plants, or removed by weeding or cutting and applying herbicide (in one case along with fencing to exclude non-native pigs and deer), had a greater abundance of Apollo butterflies, a higher density of Fender’s blue eggs, or higher total abundance of butterflies, compared to before removal or untreated sites. One of these studies also found that sites where Chinese privet was removed had a similar abundance of butterflies to sites which had not been invaded. The fifth study found that in plots where herbicide was applied to control invasive grasses, the abundance of Columbia silvery blue eggs and caterpillars was similar to unsprayed plots. The sixth study found that, after prescribed burning, an area where bracken fern was also removed had fewer Brenton blue butterfly eggs than an area without removal. One study in Australia reported that a population of purple copper butterfly caterpillars translocated to an area where invasive plants had been removed, along with host plant translocation and other habitat management, increased in number compared to at the time of translocation.


Survival (2 studies): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the USA found that in plots where herbicide was applied to control invasive grasses, the survival of Columbia silvery blue eggs and caterpillars was similar to unsprayed plots. One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the USA found that one herbicide commonly used to control invasive grasses reduced the survival of snowberry checkerspot caterpillars, but two other herbicides did not affect the survival of snowberry checkerspot, Edith’s checkerspot or Baltimore checkerspot caterpillars.

BEHAVIOUR (4 STUDIES)

Use (3 studies): Two of three randomized, controlled studies (including two replicated, paired studies and one before-and-after study) in the USA found that sites where invasive oat-grass was cut to a similar height to native plants, or where Eastern white pine was removed, were used more by Fender’s blue and frosted elfin butterflies than untreated sites. The third study found that habitat use by Columbia silvery blue butterflies was similar in plots where herbicide was applied to control invasive grasses and in unsprayed plots.
Behaviour change (1 study): One before-and-after study in Poland found that removal of trees and shrubs, in addition to the release of captive bred adults and pupae, allowed adults from two previously separated populations of Apollo butterflies to mix.

3891: Remove, control or exclude vertebrate herbivores 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Vertebrate herbivores can have a large impact on habitat structure, in turn affecting butterfly and moth communities. This can be particularly pronounced where wild herbivores are able to persist at artificially high densities owing to the absence or control of their predators in the landscape, where domestic herbivores are kept at high density, or where non-native herbivores have been introduced (Sinclair 2002). This intervention includes studies investigating the impact of completely excluding wild or domestic herbivores, or of reducing their population density enough to allow vegetation to recover.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (6 STUDIES)

Richness/diversity (6 studies): Two of four replicated studies (including three controlled studies and one site comparison study) in the USA, Mauritius and Canada found that forest plots fenced to exclude, or reduce the density of, non-native pigs and deer (in one case along with weeding of invasive plants) had a greater species richness of butterflies and macro-moths than unfenced plots. The other two studies found that forest plots fenced to exclude elk had mixed effects on the species richness of butterflies and arthropods including moths depending on fire intensity and year. One of these studies also found that grassland plots fenced to exclude elk had a similar species richness of butterflies to unfenced plots in all years. One global systematic review found that reducing or removing grazing or browsing by wild or domestic herbivores in temperate and boreal forests did not affect the species richness of butterflies and moths.

POPULATION RESPONSE (10 STUDIES)

Abundance (9 studies): Five of eight studies (including five controlled studies, one before-and-after study, and two site comparison studies) in the UK, the USA, Mauritius, Canada and Japan found that forest and grassland plots fenced to exclude, or reduce the density of, deer, sheep, pigs and large herbivores (in one case along with weeding of invasive plants) had a higher abundance of butterflies, moths, caterpillars, rare macro-moths and New Forest burnet moths than unfenced plots. One of these studies also found that the total abundance of macro-moths was similar in fenced and unfenced plots. Two studies found that forest plots fenced to exclude elk had mixed effects on the abundance of butterflies and arthropods including moths depending on fire intensity and year. One of these studies also found that grassland plots fenced to exclude elk had a similar abundance of butterflies to unfenced plots in all years. The eighth study found that a forest fenced to exclude sika deer had a similar abundance of all moths, but a lower abundance of tree-feeding moths, than unfenced forest. One global systematic review found that reducing or removing grazing or browsing by wild or domestic herbivores in temperate and boreal forests increased the abundance of butterflies and moths.
Survival (1 study): One paired, controlled study in the Netherlands reported that all Glanville fritillary caterpillar nests survived in grassland fenced to exclude sheep, compared to 88% in a grazed area.
Condition (1 study): One paired, controlled study in the Netherlands found that fewer Glanville fritillary caterpillar nests were damaged in grassland fenced to exclude sheep than in a grazed area.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Potentially hazardous substances, such as pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers, are sold commercially for use in agriculture as well as privately. This facilitates widespread use over a large area which, even if low level or infrequent, can harm or kill butterflies and moths, and may have contributed to population declines (Gilburn et al. 2015). Using legislation to restrict the sale and application of the most dangerous chemicals could reduce their use, and help threatened butterfly and moth populations to recover.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
In conventional farming, a wide range of chemicals are commonly applied for pest control or fertilization, but these can have lethal or sub-lethal effects on farmland wildlife, including butterflies and moths (Russell & Schultz 2010, Schultz et al. 2016). Chemicals can spread easily from farmland into adjacent habitats, either by drifting on the wind during spraying, or by leaching through the soil in water. Physical barriers may be used to reduce the spread of chemicals from farmland on to neighbouring habitats.
For studies on restricting chemical applications next to adjacent habitat, or at the edge of crops, see “Provide buffer strips to reduce pesticide and nutrient run-off into margins, waterways and ponds” and “Leave headlands in fields unsprayed (conservation headlands)”.

In conventional farming, a wide range of chemicals are commonly applied for pest control or fertilization, but these can have lethal or sub-lethal effects on farmland wildlife, including butterflies and moths (Russell & Schultz 2010, Schultz et al. 2016). Chemicals can spread easily from farmland into adjacent habitats, either by drifting on the wind during spraying, or by leaching through the soil in water. Providing buffer strips with reduced or no chemical applications may reduce run-off into neighbouring habitats, as well as providing additional habitat in their own right.

For studies on restricting chemical applications across the farm, see “Reduce fertilizer, pesticide or herbicide use generally”. For studies on physically preventing chemicals from spreading to adjacent habitats, see “Use fencing to reduce pesticide and nutrient run-off into margins, waterways and ponds”.

3895: Use genetically modified crops which produce pesticide to replace conventional pesticide application 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Drift of insecticides with aerial application, such as Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), has been recorded as far as 3 km downwind, and spraying reduces the abundance and survival of a wide range of butterflies and moths (Scriber 2004). The use of genetically modified crops, which can produce pesticides themselves, reduces the need for chemical applications, and may result in an overall reduction in the harm caused to non-target species, including butterflies and moths (Scriber 2004).
Note that genetically modified plants which produce pesticides are still harmful to butterflies and moths (see Scriber 2004 for examples).

3896: Restrict certain pesticides or other agricultural chemicals 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
In conventional farming, a wide range of chemicals are commonly applied for pest control. Specific pesticides (including insecticides, herbicides or fungicides) vary in their ability to specifically target certain species, and the extent of their wider, detrimental effects on other species, including butterflies and moths (Russell & Schultz 2010, Schultz et al. 2016). Therefore, restricting the use of specific, more toxic, chemicals, may benefit species living on farmland.
This action includes studies where the use of a specific, named chemical has been reduced or stopped. For studies on a general reduction of multiple or unnamed chemicals, either without cessation or across a small area, see “Reduce fertilizer, pesticide or herbicide use generally”. For studies on the complete cessation of chemical applications across an entire farm, see “Convert to organic farming”.

Key Messages:

Eleven studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of reducing fertilizer, pesticide or herbicide use generally. Three studies were in the UK, two were in each of the USA and Germany, one was in each of Spain, Mexico and Switzerland, and one was a systematic review across Europe.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (10 STUDIES)

Richness/diversity (10 studies): Eight studies (including one replicated study, two controlled studies, one randomized study, five site comparison studies, and one systematic review) in the USA, Europe, the UK, Spain, Mexico and Switzerland found that orchards, crop edges, farms, vineyards, replanted Douglas fir stands, coffee plantations and agricultural landscapes managed with less frequent, reduced or no pesticide, herbicide, fertilizer or unspecified chemical input (sometimes along with other agri-environment scheme options or less intensive management) had a greater species richness of adult butterflies and moths, or caterpillars (in one case along with other leaf-eating arthropods), than areas with more frequent or conventional chemical applications. However, one of these studies found that species richness was not affected by the number of pesticide applications in the year of study, only in the previous three years, and another of the studies also found that vineyards managed with reduced insecticide and herbicide application had a similar species richness of moths to conventionally managed vineyards. Two replicated studies (including one randomized, controlled study and one site comparison study) in the UK and Germany found that unfertilized grassland had a similar species richness of butterflies and moths, but greater species richness of specialist moths, to fertilized grassland.

POPULATION RESPONSE (9 STUDIES)

Abundance (9 studies): Six studies (including one replicated study, one controlled study, one randomized study, four site comparison studies, and one systematic review) in Europe, the UK, Germany, Mexico and Switzerland found that crop edges, farms, a hay meadow, coffee plantations and agricultural landscapes managed with less frequent, reduced or no pesticide, insecticide, fungicide, herbicide, fertilizer or unspecified chemical input (sometimes along with other agri-environment scheme options or less intensive management) had a higher abundance of adult butterflies and moths, or caterpillars, than areas with more frequent or conventional chemical applications. However, one of these studies found that abundance was not affected by the number of pesticide applications in the year of study, only in the previous three years, and another of these studies also found that a hay meadow with no herbicide applications had a similar abundance of caterpillars to a meadow where herbicide was used, and a meadow with no fertilizer applications had a lower abundance of caterpillars than a meadow where fertilizer was applied in one of two sampling sessions. Three replicated studies (including two randomized, controlled studies and one site comparison study) in the UK, Germany and the USA found that unfertilized grassland and replanted Douglas fir stands with limited or no herbicide applications had a similar abundance of adult butterflies and caterpillars, and adult moths, to fertilized grassland and stands with more herbicide applications.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Richness/diversity (2 studies): Two replicated, paired, controlled studies in the UK and the Netherlands found that unsprayed headlands in arable fields had a greater species richness of butterflies than headlands sprayed with herbicide and insecticide.

POPULATION RESPONSE (5 STUDIES)

Abundance (5 studies): Four of five replicated, controlled studies (including one randomized study) in the UK and the Netherlands found that unsprayed headlands in arable and pasture fields had a greater abundance of butterflies and caterpillars than headlands sprayed with herbicide and insecticide. The other study found that unsprayed headlands in arable fields had a similar abundance of caterpillars to headlands sprayed with herbicide.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)

Use (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in the UK found that large white, small white and green-veined white butterflies spent more time in unsprayed arable headlands than adjacent hedgerows, but more time in the hedgerows when adjacent headlands were sprayed with herbicide. The same study found that gatekeepers spent more time in hedgerows than headlands regardless of whether the headlands were unsprayed or sprayed.
Behaviour change (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in the UK found that large white, small white and green-veined white butterflies spent more time feeding and interacting, or had slower flight speeds, in unsprayed arable headlands than in headlands sprayed with herbicide. However, the same study found that male gatekeepers spend less time feeding and interacting, and had faster flight speeds, in unsprayed headlands than in sprayed headlands.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Artificial lighting disrupts the activity of nocturnal moths. For example, even when offered a food source, moths spend less time feeding in the presence of artificial light than when kept in complete darkness (van Langevelde et al. 2017). Attraction to artificial lights may also limit moths’ dispersal ability and mate-finding behaviour. One option to reduce this impact is to protect areas with natural light regimes, by reducing the time that lights are on, or removing unnecessary lights entirely (Gaston et al. 2012).

Artificial lighting disrupts the activity of nocturnal moths, for example altering feeding behaviour (van Langevelde et al. 2017). Brighter, higher intensity lights are likely to be more attractive, or to disrupt individuals over a wider area as the light reaches further into the darkness. Reducing the intensity of lights used at night may help to minimize the impact on moths, while maintaining lighting for people in key areas (Gaston et al. 2012).

However, three of these studies only found this in intensively managed not in more diverse landscapes,only in the first of three study years, and in farms managed organically for &lt;6 years but not 15–23 years. Four of the studies found that organic arable and mixed farms had a similar species richness of macro-moths and butterflies to conventionally managed farms. Two of these studies also found that on organic and conventionally managed farms within a landscape with a high proportion of organic farms there was higher species richness of butterflies and burnet moths than either type of farm in a landscape with a high proportion of conventional farms. One before-and-after study in the UK found that within 4 years after a mixed farm converted to organic management (along with increasing the proportion of grassland and reducing grazing intensity) the species richness of large moths increased. One replicated, site comparison study in Sweden found that organic mixed farms had a more consistent species richness of butterflies across the farm, but a similar consistency through the summer and between years, compared to conventional farms.

Species-rich, semi-natural grassland represents an important habitat for butterflies and moths, particularly in agricultural areas. Such grasslands can be maintained either by extensive livestock grazing, or by infrequent (often annual) cutting for hay (Dover et al. 2011). This intervention includes studies which compare the maintenance of grasslands under these two management techniques, as well as comparisons between semi-natural grassland and other agricultural grasslands.

Key Messages:

Nineteen studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of maintaining species-rich, semi-natural grassland. Five studies were in Germany, four were in the USA, two were in each of Switzerland and the Czech Republic, and one was in each of Finland and Russia, China, Italy, Spain, Hungary and Austria.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (12 STUDIES)

Community composition (6 studies): Four replicated, site comparison studies in the USA, the Czech Republic, Austria and Germany found that the community composition of butterflies, day-flying moths and nocturnal moths was different between summer cattle-grazed, early-mown and late-mown grassland, between mown and grazed grassland, and between prairies managed by cattle grazing and/or rotational burning. However, one of these studies found that the community composition of butterflies was similar in mown and grazed grassland. Two replicated, site comparison studies in the Czech Republic and Germany found that species-rich grassland managed by grazing or mowing had a similar community composition of butterflies and burnet moths to abandoned grassland. One replicated, site comparison study in Switzerland found that meadows managed by mowing at least twice/year after mid-June had a different community composition of butterflies to sown wildflower strips.
Richness/diversity (11 studies): Three of six site comparison studies (including five replicated studies) in Germany, the USA, Russia and Finland, Italy and the Czech Republic found that the species richness of butterflies was similar on semi-natural grassland managed by light grazing or by annual mowing in July or August, and on prairies managed by cattle grazing and/or rotational burning. One study found that the species richness of butterflies was higher in grassland managed by sheep and cattle grazing than in grassland mown annually for hay in June. One study found that the species richness of moths was higher in grassland managed by annual mowing than grassland managed by grazing, and the species richness of butterflies was highest in grasslands where mowing was staggered throughout the year, with some areas left uncut. The sixth study found that in some areas, the species richness of specialist and grassland butterflies was higher in prairies managed by two-year rotational haying, and in other areas it was higher in prairies managed by grazing, but in all cases richness was higher at sites longer after they were last managed. Two replicated, site comparison studies in Germany found that species-rich grasslands managed by summer-grazing, grazing or mowing had a similar species richness of butterflies and burnet moths and nocturnal moths to unmanaged grassland. However, one of these studies also found that grasslands managed by mowing had a lower species richness of nocturnal moths than unmown grassland. Two replicated, site comparison studies in Germany and Hungary found that old meadows mown in July and lightly grazed or annually mown meadows had a higher species richness of adult butterflies and caterpillars than recently established set-aside or cereal crops. One replicated, site comparison study in Switzerland found that meadows mown at least twice/year after mid-June had a similar species richness of butterflies to sown wildflower strips.

POPULATION RESPONSE (16 STUDIES)

Abundance (16 studies): Five of ten site comparison studies (including nine replicated studies) in Germany, the USA, Russia and Finland, Italy, Spain and the Czech Republic found that semi-natural grasslands had a similar abundance of butterflies generally, and individual species of butterflies and moth caterpillars, when managed by extensive sheep, sheep and goat, cattle or livestock grazing compared to annual or occasional mowing, or rotational mowing or burning. Four of these studies found that grasslands managed by cattle, sheep or livestock grazing had a higher abundance of butterflies generally, and individual species of butterflies and moth caterpillars, than grasslands managed by annual mowing, rotational burning or unmanaged grasslands. Three of these studies found that grasslands managed by haying had a higher abundance of individual butterfly species than grasslands managed by grazing or burning or unmanaged grasslands. Four of these studies found that specific butterfly species and all butterflies were less abundant in mown, grazed or rotationally burned grassland than in unmanaged, rotationally burned or grazed and burned grassland. The ninth study found that in some areas, the abundance of specialist and grassland butterflies was higher in prairies managed by two-year rotational haying or by grazing, but in all cases abundance was higher at sites longer after they were last managed. One of three replicated, site comparison studies in Germany and Switzerland found that traditional hay meadows mown once/year in June or July had a higher abundance of heath fritillary adults and caterpillars than old, abandoned meadows. One study found that summer-grazed or mown grasslands had a higher abundance of farmland butterflies and burnet moths, but a lower abundance of woodland butterflies and burnet moths, than abandoned grasslands. The third study found that mown grasslands had a lower abundance of moths than unmown grasslands, but grazed grasslands had a similar abundance of moths to ungrazed grasslands. Two replicated, site comparison studies in China and Switzerland found that semi-natural grasslands managed by grazing or cutting twice/year after mid-June had a lower abundance of marsh fritillary eggs and caterpillars and adult butterflies than ungrazed margins and intercrops or sown wildflower strips. One replicated, site comparison study in Hungary found that semi-natural grasslands managed by either light grazing or mowing once/year in May or June had a higher abundance of butterflies than conventional wheat fields.
Survival (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in China found that marsh fritillary eggs had a similar survival rate in uncultivated, grazed meadows and cultivated, ungrazed field margins and intercrops, but the survival of caterpillars was higher in the grazed meadows.

BEHAVIOUR (5 STUDIES)
Use (5 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies in Austria and Germany found that 14 species of moth preferred grazed pastures while 24 others avoided them, and three species of butterfly and ten nocturnal moths preferred mown meadows, while 19 nocturnal moth species avoided them. One replicated, site comparison study in Spain found that meadows managed by summer-grazing or hay-mowing were more likely to be occupied by grizzled skipper and painted lady than unmanaged meadows, but small pearl-bordered fritillary occurred less frequently in grazed meadows than in hay meadows or abandoned meadows. One replicated, site comparison study in Finland and Russia found that three of 37 butterfly species preferred meadows which were mown annually in July or August to cattle-grazed pasture, but the other 34 species showed no preference. One replicated, site comparison study in China found that uncultivated, grazed meadows were less likely to be occupied by marsh fritillary eggs and caterpillars than cultivated field margins and intercrops.

3909: Translocate to re-establish populations in known or believed former range  
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Many species of butterfly and moth have severely declined or gone extinct in parts of their former range, particularly in areas where high rates of habitat conversion have occurred (Fox et al. 2010, Maes & Van Dyck 2001, van Swaay 1990). Given the poor dispersal ability of many species, and the highly fragmented nature of many landscapes, the transportation of individuals to suitable sites may be the only means by which a species is able to recolonize. Releases could be composed of translocated animals (caught in the wild at another site) or captive-bred animals (bred from captive populations over one or more generations, see “Rear declining species in captivity” and “Release captive-bred individuals to the wild”), and individuals at any life stage (adult, egg, caterpillar or pupa) may be used for capture and release.
Note that restoring habitat quality prior to the release of translocated butterflies and moths is likely to be an important factor determining the success of reintroduction projects (Schultz et al. 2008). Furthermore, for parasitic species such as the large blues Phengaris (Maculinea) spp., which rely on specific hosts (ants Myrmica spp.) for survival, the translocation of ant colonies from the same source site as the butterflies may increase caterpillar survival (Witek et al. 2016).
CAUTION: Before translocating butterflies and moths, the impact of the removal of individuals from the donor site must be considered, to avoid harming existing populations.

Key Messages:

Sixteen studies evaluated the effects of translocating butterflies and moths to re-establish populations within their former range. Seven studies were in the UK, two were reviews across the UK and Ireland, two studies were in Finland and one study was in each of the USA, Australia, the Netherlands, Belgium and the Netherlands and the UK and Sweden.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (16 STUDIES)

Abundance (13 studies): Eight studies in the UK, Finland, the USA, Australia, the Netherlands and Belgium and the Netherlands reported that translocated populations of adult butterflies and Fisher’s estuarine moth eggs persisted for 2–12 years and increased in abundance (sometimes in areas where coppicing, selective felling, planting, fencing, host plant translocation, invasive plant removal, sheep grazing, scrub clearance or unspecified habitat restoration were conducted before or after release). Three studies (including two replicated studies) in the UK and Finland reported that some translocated populations of silver-studded blue and clouded Apollo adults, and belted beauty moth eggs and caterpillars, persisted for 1–49 years (in one case where vegetation had been removed before release), increased in abundance and colonized new sites, but other populations died out within 0–7 years. One of two reviews across the UK and Ireland found that 25% of translocated and released captive-bred butterfly populations survived for at least three years, but 38% died out in that time, and only 8% were known to have survived for more than 10 years. The other review reported that translocated populations of large copper adults and/or caterpillars (sometimes to areas planted with great water dock or where bushes had been cleared, or alongside the release of captive-bred individuals) survived for up to 38 years, but ultimately died out or had to be supplemented by further releases.
Survival (2 studies): Two site comparison studies (including one replicated, paired study) in the UK found that the survival of large blue caterpillars was higher when translocated into Myrmica sabuleti nests without queen ants present than with queens present, and the survival of translocated large copper caterpillars was higher than the survival of released, captive-bred caterpillars.
Condition (1 study): One site comparison in the UK and Sweden found that 19 years after translocation, large blue butterflies in the UK had similar genetic diversity to their Swedish source population.

3910: Increase or maintain the proportion of natural or semi‐natural habitat in the farmed landscape 
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
The presence of natural or semi-natural habitat within farmland may protect butterflies and moths in intensively farmed landscapes, either because the habitat itself supports remnant populations of species which cannot survive on farmland, or because it allows individuals to move through the landscape more easily, reducing isolation. For example, the presence of woodland or scrub correlates with a higher abundance of butterflies on farmland (Pywell et al. 2004).
Pywell R.F., Warman E.A., Sparks T.H., Greatorex-Davies J.N., Walker K.J., Meek W.R., Carvell C., Petit S. & Firbank L.G. (2004) Assessing habitat quality for butterflies on intensively managed arable farmland. Biological Conservation, 118, 313–325.

Key Messages:

Twelve studies evaluated the effects of increasing or maintaining the proportion of natural or semi-natural habitat in the farmed landscape on butterflies and moths. Three studies were in Switzerland, two were in each of Germany, Sweden and the UK, and one was in each of the USA, Malaysia, and New Zealand.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (11 STUDIES)

Richness/diversity (11 studies): Nine of eleven studies (including one replicated, randomized, controlled study, one before-and-after study and eight replicated, site comparison studies) in Germany, Sweden, Malaysia, Switzerland, the UK, and New Zealand found that the species richness of butterflies, burnet moths and all moths was higher on farms with a greater proportion of semi-natural habitat or with a greater proportion of woodland in the surrounding landscape, or after semi-natural habitat had been created, compared to conventional farmland or farmland with a greater proportion of arable land in the surrounding landscape. One study found that species richness of butterflies in oil palm plantations was higher where ground coverage of weeds had been maintained but similar whether or not epiphyte or fern coverage was maintained. The eleventh study found that the species richness of butterflies was similar on farms with different proportions of semi-natural habitat.

POPULATION RESPONSE (8 STUDIES)

Abundance (8 studies): Six replicated studies (including one randomized, controlled study and five site comparison studies) in Sweden, the UK, New Zealand, and Switzerland found that the abundance of butterflies and moths was higher on farms with a greater proportion of semi-natural habitat, or in semi-natural habitat compared to conventional farmland. One of two replicated, site comparison studies in the USA and Sweden found that the abundance of four out of eight species of butterflies was higher on farms surrounded by woodland, but the abundance of least skipper was lower on farms with more semi-natural habitat. The other study found that overall butterfly abundance was similar on farms surrounded by different proportions of woodland and arable land.

3911: Translocate to establish populations outside of known range 
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Climate change is increasingly reducing the suitability of habitat within species’ historic ranges, while a combination of habitat fragmentation and poor dispersal ability can limit species’ ability to colonize new areas which have become more climatically suitable. Translocation of butterflies and moths to areas outside of their previously recorded range could be used to seed new populations in more climatically suitable areas, which species may struggle to colonize on their own (Willis et al. 2009). This action includes translocations to areas outside of a species’ native range, whether or not done explicitly for climate change adaptation, but only if the translocation was within the same biogeographic region (e.g. translocations between continents are not included).
CAUTION: Before translocating butterflies and moths, the impact of the removal of individuals from the donor site must be considered, to avoid harming existing populations.

POPULATION RESPONSE (4 STUDIES)

Abundance (3 studies): Two of three studies in the USA and the UK reported that populations of Gillette’s checkerspot, small skipper and marbled white translocated outside of their native range as eggs or adults (in one case including captive-bred individuals) persisted and increased in abundance over eight and 28 years. The third study reported that a population of Gillette’s checkerspot adults, eggs and caterpillars translocated outside their native range died out within one year.
Condition (1 study): One study in the Czech Republic found that 69 years after translocation, an introduced population of the small mountain ringlet butterfly had similar genetic diversity to its source population, and higher genetic diversity than a small native population.

3912: Introduce mated females to increase genetic diversity 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Small, remnant populations of butterflies and moths, which are isolated from other populations, may begin to suffer from reduced genetic diversity arising from inbreeding. The release of mated females from other populations should introduce more genetic diversity into a small population, and this may reduce the extinction risk of the focal population.
CAUTION: Remnant populations can benefit from local genetic adaptation to their environment, and the introduction of genetic diversity from other populations may dilute the local adaptation. Individuals from other populations may also carry diseases or parasites to the remnant population. Both factors could put the remnant population at risk, so care should be taken when considering this action. In addition, before translocating butterflies and moths, the impact of the removal of individuals from the donor site must be considered, to avoid harming existing populations.
For studies on the release of translocated or captive-bred butterflies and moths to areas where the species does not occur, see “Translocate to re-establish populations in known or believed former range”, “Translocate to establish populations outside of known range” and “Release captive-bred individuals to the wild”.

3913: Manage host species’ populations for the benefit of dependent parasite/mutualist species 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Some butterflies, in particular the large blues Phengaris (Maculinea) spp., are parasites of ant colonies of the genus Myrmica, and depend upon just one or two host ant species for their caterpillars to develop. Other species of blue butterfly, such as the chalkhill blue Polyommatus coridon, have mutualistic relationships with ants, whereby the caterpillar excretes a sugary secretion which is eaten by the ants, which in turn protect the caterpillar (Thomas & Lewington 2016). Therefore, effective conservation for these butterflies depends not just on habitat management for the requirements of the butterfly, but also for the requirements of the Myrmica ants and (in some cases) the suppression of the more competitive black ant Lasius niger (Wynhoff et al. 2011, Wynhoff et al. 2017). For example, the translocation of sods from fen meadows to restoration areas encouraged colonization by Myrmica scabrinodis (Wynhoff et al. 2017). Myrmica scabrinodis is further supported by early or late season mowing, while Myrmica rubra nests should be undisturbed in summer, and mown in late autumn (Wynhoff et al. 2011).
Studies are only included here if they record the outcome on a species of butterfly or moth, not just on the host or mutualist species.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (12 STUDIES)

Abundance (10 studies): Six studies (including one before-and-after study) in the UK, the USA and Poland and Slovakia reported that captive-bred butterfly populations released as eggs, caterpillars, pupae and adults (sometimes into managed habitat or alongside translocated individuals) persisted for 2–28 years and increased in abundance (sometimes with continued captive-rearing of wild-laid caterpillars or supplemented by further releases). Two studies (including one review) in the UK reported that captive-bred large copper and belted beauty moth populations released as caterpillars (sometimes into managed habitat) died out one, two or 12 years after release, or required further releases to survive. One replicated study in the UK reported that three of 10 captive-bred barberry carpet moth populations released as caterpillars (and in one case as adults) established, and at least one persisted for five years. One review across the UK and Ireland found that 25% of captive-bred and translocated butterfly populations survived for &gt;3 years, but 38% died out in that time, and only 8% were known to have survived for &gt;10 years.
Reproductive success (2 studies): One study in the UK reported that after the release of a captive-bred population of large copper, the number of eggs laid/female increased over the first three years. One before-and-after study in the UK reported captive-bred adult pearl-bordered fritillaries released into coppiced woodland successfully bred at least once.
Survival (3 studies): Three studies (including two replicated, site comparison studies and one review) in the UK and the UK and the Netherlands found that released, captive-bred large copper caterpillars had a lower survival rate than captive, wild or translocated caterpillars.

3915: Pay farmers to cover the costs of conservation measures (as in agri-environment schemes or conservation incentives) 
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Implementing conservation actions can be costly for landowners, either because of the direct management costs or due to the loss of income from other possible land uses, such as farming. Payments may be offered by Governments or inter-Governmental schemes to compensate landowners for these costs, and encourage more wildlife-friendly habitat management and creation on private land. In Europe, agri-environment schemes (AES) are an integral part of the European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and Member States devise their own AES prescriptions to suit their agricultural economies and environmental contexts. In the United States, these are often called conservation incentive payments and are mostly implemented through the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (known as the Farm Bill, for example Kleintjes Neff & Mader 2013). Most schemes focus on reducing the intensity of farm management, or creating other habitats within the farmed landscape, but payments may also be made for managing other habitats such as woodland (in the USA often called agroforestry) or heathland on private land. As well as attempting to provide more favourable habitat, coordinated planning of the schemes may be important to ensure that a variety of habitats are created across the farmed landscape throughout the year.
This intervention includes any studies where landowners were paid to carry out an action in any habitat, but excludes studies testing AES options which were conducted outside of an AES (e.g. on research farms or nature reserves). Since AES represent many different specific interventions relevant to conservation, where a study’s results can be clearly assigned to a specific intervention, the study is also summarized in the appropriate section. This section, meanwhile, includes evidence about the success of agri-environment or conservation incentive policies overall.

Key Messages:

Thirty-two studies evaluated the effects of paying farmers to cover the costs of conservation measures on butterflies and moths. Eighteen studies were in the UK, eight were in Switzerland two were in Finland, and one was in each of Sweden, the Czech Republic, the USA and Germany.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (18 STUDIES)

Community composition (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in Switzerland found that the community composition of butterflies on grasslands that farmers were paid to manage for wildlife was similar to intensively managed grasslands.
Richness/diversity (19 studies): Twelve of 15 studies (including eight controlled, one before-and-after and five site comparison studies) in Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Sweden found that the species richness or diversity of butterflies and moths on grassland, field margins, wildflower strips or whole farms managed under agri-environment schemes was higher than on conventional fields or farms. The other three studies found that the species richness of butterflies and micro-moths on grassland, field margins, wildflower strips or whole farms managed under agri-environment schemes was similar to conventional fields or farms. One of two replicated, site comparison studies in Switzerland found that the species richness of butterflies was higher in landscapes with a greater proportion of land managed under agri-environment schemes than in landscapes with a smaller proportion of agri-environment schemes, but the other study found that species richness of butterflies was similar on individual farms with more land managed under agri-environment schemes than on farms with smaller areas of agri-environment schemes. One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that the species richness of butterflies on grassland sown under a conservation incentive program was similar to that on native prairie. One replicated, site comparison study in Finland found that the species richness of butterflies and day-flying moths on grassland managed under an agri-environment scheme was lower than on abandoned, unmanaged grassland.

POPULATION RESPONSE (27 STUDIES)

Abundance (27 studies): Seventeen of 19 studies (including seven controlled studies, one replicated, site comparison study, two before-and-after studies, and eight site comparison studies) in the UK, Sweden, Switzerland and Germany found that the abundance of butterflies and moths overall, and of specific species of butterflies or moths, in woodland, grassland, field margins, wildflower strips or whole farms managed under agri-environment schemes was higher than in unmanaged woodland or conventional fields or farms. The other two studies found that the abundance of butterflies and macro-moths on field margins managed under agri-environment schemes was similar to conventional margins. Three of four replicated studies (including one controlled and three site comparison studies) in the UK and Switzerland found that the abundance of butterflies was higher on farms or in landscapes with a higher proportion of land managed under agri-environment schemes than in areas with less land in agri-environment schemes. The other study found that the abundance of some species was higher, but others were lower, on farms with enhanced agri-environment management compared to simple management. Three studies (including one before-and-after and two replicated, site comparison studies) in Finland and the Czech Republic found that grassland grazed or restored under agri-environment scheme prescriptions had a lower abundance of all but three butterfly and day-flying moth species compared to unmanaged grassland, and that Danube clouded yellow abundance declined after agri-environment scheme mowing was initiated on abandoned grasslands. One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that the abundance of butterflies on grassland sown under a conservation incentive program was lower than on native prairie.

3916: Rear declining species in captivity 
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Captive-breeding can be an important method for boosting small population sizes, or for ensuring the continued persistence of a species while its habitat is restored to a suitable condition in the wild (Schultz et al. 2008). It is likely to be more successful if founding individuals are taken from large populations, and the size of the captive population remains stable over time (Crone et al. 2007).
CAUTION: Before removing butterflies and moths from the wild to take into captivity, the impact of the removal of individuals from the donor site must be considered, to avoid harming existing populations.

Reproductive success (5 studies): One controlled study in the UK reported that female large copper laid more eggs, and these eggs had a higher hatching success, in a cage kept in a greenhouse than in a cage kept outside. One study in South Africa reported that a Dickson’s copper butterfly laid eggs in captivity in the presence of black cocktail ants from the site where she emerged but not from 10 km away. One study in the UK found that female large white from a population kept in captivity for &gt;25 years laid more eggs than females from a population in its third generation in captivity. One study in the UK reported that Fisher’s estuarine moths successfully bred in captivity. One study in South Africa reported that wild-caught, gravid scarce mountain copper butterflies laid eggs but none hatched.
Survival (14 studies): Five of six studies (including one replicated, controlled study, four controlled studies and one site comparison study) in the UK, the UK and France, Spain, Belgium and Poland found that large copper, large blue, mountain Alcon blue, cranberry fritillary and scarce large blue caterpillars had higher survival rates when reared on plants or in ant nests at a lower than higher density, in ant nests without queens or with winged females present than with queens or without winged females, when reared at 20 °C than 25 °C, and when reared with ants collected from sites where parasitic butterfly species occur than from sites where parasites do not occur. The sixth study found that mountain Alcon blue caterpillars had a similar survival rate in ant nests with or without queens present. Two of these studies, and one replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the USA, found that the survival of large blue, mountain Alcon blue and monarch caterpillars differed when reared in ant nests of different species or on different species of milkweed. Two site comparison studies in the UK and the USA found that large copper and Puget blue eggs had a similar survival rate to the caterpillar and adult stage whether they were laid in captivity or collected from the wild and reared in captivity. One of these studies also found that Puget blue caterpillars kept in refrigerators while overwintering had a lower survival than caterpillars kept in environmental chambers or outside. Three of four studies in South Africa and the UK reported that some wild-collected Brenton blue butterfly, Karkloof blue butterfly and Fishers’ estuarine moth eggs hatched, survived as caterpillars for three months or to adulthood, bred in captivity and the resulting captive population survived for at least eight generations. The other study reported that wild-collected Brenton blue butterfly eggs hatched in captivity and those caterpillars reared with only Pyllanthus incurvatus leaves died whereas all caterpillars also given Indigofera erecta leaves survived to the fourth instar of development. One study in South Africa reported that wild-caught final instar Cape Peninsula butterfly caterpillars reared in an artificial pugnacious ant nest successfully pupated and became adults, but captive-hatched first instar Cape Peninsula and Riley’s skolly butterfly caterpillars placed next to a nest did not survive to pupation.
Condition (5 studies): Two studies (including one controlled study) in the UK and the USA found that adult large white from a population kept in captivity for &gt;25 years were heavier, and had smaller wings, than individuals from a population in its third generation in captivity, and captive-reared Puget blue adults were smaller than wild-caught butterflies. One of these studies also found that Puget blue caterpillars raised in environmental chambers or outdoor enclosures reached a similar size as adults. One replicated, controlled study in Spain found that mountain Alcon blue caterpillars reared in ant colonies with winged females were lighter than caterpillars reared in colonies without winged females. One replicated, controlled study in Israel found that spring webworm caterpillars fed vegetation from cattle-grazed pasture had a similar growth rate to caterpillars fed vegetation from an ungrazed paddock. One study in South Africa reported that Brenton blue butterfly caterpillars reared on Indigofera erecta leaves with no ants became dwarf adults, but those reared on whole Indigofera plants with an ant colony became full-sized adults.

3917: Maintain traditional orchards to benefit butterflies and moths 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Traditional orchards, with large numbers of veteran trees and managed with no chemical inputs, can support a diverse community of invertebrates, including butterflies and moths. For example, 12% of all British butterfly and moth species were recorded in a single summer in three small, traditionally managed orchards (Smart & Winnall 2006). However, the dual threats of intensification and abandonment have led to the loss of many traditionally managed orchards. Restoring and maintaining extensive, low-input management of orchards – including pruning trees, occasional mowing or light grazing between the trees, and limiting the application of pesticides and herbicides – may benefit a large number of butterfly and moth species.

3918: Manage perennial bioenergy crops to benefit butterflies and moths 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Bioenergy crops are grown to produce oil, which is used as fuel in place of traditional fossil fuel derivatives. Perennial bioenergy crops, such as grasses, can be sown once and harvested for multiple years, which creates opportunities to establish grassland ecosystems, unlike annual cropping systems. Management of perennial bioenergy crops to benefit butterflies and moths may include changing the mix of seeds planted, altering the timing or frequency of harvest, or limiting the application of chemicals to the crop.
Studies on annual bioenergy crops are included within actions for annual crops, for example “Increase crop diversity across a farm or farmed landscape”, “Plant more than one crop per field (intercropping)”, “Leave uncropped, cultivated margins or plots” and “Leave unharvested crop headlands within arable fields”. For studies which test reductions in chemical application alone, see “Threat: Pollution”.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of managing perennial bioenergy crops to benefit butterflies and moths. This study was in the USA.

3919: Manage vineyards to benefit butterflies and moths 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
As perennial crops, vineyards form large areas of consistent agricultural habitat across Mediterranean-type landscapes. Like other perennial crops, this creates opportunities to manage vineyards as complete ecosystems, by providing the resources which butterflies and moths need within the crop. This could include encouraging native plant species to grow around the vines, altering the timing or frequency of management such as pruning and tillage, or reducing the application of chemicals to the vines or surrounding habitat.
For studies which test reductions in chemical application alone, see “Threat: Pollution”.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of managing vineyards to benefit butterflies and moths. One study was in each of the USA and Spain.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Richness/diversity (2 studies): One of two replicated, site comparison studies (including one paired study) in the USA and Spain found that grass strips between vine rows had a greater species richness of butterflies than the vine rows themselves, and vineyards managed with fewer chemicals had a greater species richness of butterflies than conventionally managed vineyards. The other study found that vineyards managed to encourage native plants, and where insecticide was rarely used, had a similar species richness of butterflies to conventionally managed vineyards.

3920: Grow native trees within perennial crop plantations 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Perennial crops, such as coffee, chocolate, oil palm and vines, are planted and left in place for many years, with harvest taking place from mature plants. Many of these species are grown both within and outside their native ranges, but in all cases are often farmed in monocultures. However, it is possible to allow or encourage other plant species to grow among perennial crops, which may provide benefits in terms of natural pest control or disease resistance, as well as allowing native animals, including butterflies and moths, to persist among the crop.
See also “Produce coffee in shaded plantations”.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of growing native trees within perennial crop plantations. This study was in Costa Rica.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Costa Rica found that coffee farms with a native and a non-native tree species growing within them had a higher diversity of butterflies than coffee farms with a single non-native tree species, but a similar diversity to coffee farms with two non-native tree species. The same study found a similar species richness of butterflies on all farms.

3921: Increase crop diversity across a farm or farmed landscape
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Agricultural landscapes are often homogenous, with the same crops being grown across a large area. Increasing the diversity of crops within a single farm, or across a farmed landscape, may improve the habitat suitability for butterflies and moths by increasing the availability of resources, or making that availability more consistent over time. For example, differences in flowering time or harvest time may increase the permability of the landscape for butterflies and moths, or mean that nectar resources are available for longer across the summer than if only a single crop type was present.
For studies on increasing diversity within a field, see “Plant more than one crop per field (intercropping)”.

Key Messages:
     

Two studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of increasing crop diversity across a farm or farmed landscape. Both studies were in Switzerland.

3923: Leave uncropped, cultivated margins or plots 
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
On intensively farmed land, crop monocultures typically flower in unison, and provide little variation in the vegetation structure. Uncropped, cultivated margins or plots are typically designed to benefit birds, however they may provide resources for butterflies and moths by increasing the structural diversity of the landscape, and allowing nectar-rich agricultural plants, which are typically considered as weeds, to grow around and among the crop.

Key Messages:

Four studies evaluated the effects of leaving uncropped, cultivated margins or plots on butterflies and moths. Three were in the UK and one was in Switzerland.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Richness/diversity (3 studies): Two of three replicated studies (including one randomized, paired, controlled study, one replicated, randomized, site comparison study, and one site comparison study) in the UK and Switzerland found that farms managed under agri-environment schemes, or with a greater area of in-field agri-environment scheme options, both including uncropped cultivated margins, had a similar species richness of butterflies and moths to conventional farms or farms with a smaller area of in-field options. The other study found that fields with wider margins between crops had higher butterfly species richness in one of two years.

POPULATION RESPONSE (4 STUDIES)

Abundance (4 studies): One replicated, randomized, site comparison study in the UK found that fields with wider margins between crops had a higher abundance of butterflies in one of two years. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the UK found that farms managed under agri-environment schemes (AES), including uncropped cultivated margins, had a higher abundance of butterflies and micro-moths, but a similar abundance of other moths, compared to conventionally managed farms. One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK found that farms managed with enhanced AES options, including uncropped, cultivated margins, had a higher abundance of some butterflies, but a lower abundance of other butterflies, than farms with simpler AES management. One replicated, site comparison study in Switzerland found that farms with a larger area of in-field AES options, including uncropped, cultivated plots, had a similar abundance of butterflies to farms with a smaller area of in-field AES options.

3924: Leave unharvested crop headlands within arable fields 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Harvesting crops creates a dramatic change in the farmed landscape, by suddenly and simultaneously removing plants, which may be providing nectar resources to butterflies and moths, from a large area. Even if butterflies and moths are not using the crop itself, harvesting disturbs the structure of the field, and may cause mortality of caterpillars living on other plant species within or around the crop. Leaving unharvested strips, known as headlands, at the edge of fields may provide both shelter and a continued resource availability to butterflies and moths.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of leaving unharvested crop headlands within arable fields. This study was in France.

3925: Plant crops in spring rather than autumn 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Sowing crops in autumn is commonly used to advance the harvest, as the crop begins to grow when sown and then overwinters as small plants in the ground. However, this head-start means that the crop flowers earlier, and may be too early to be beneficial for butterflies and moths. In addition, the disturbance to the previous year’s stubble in autumn may kill butterflies and moths of any life-stage which are overwintering within the harvested crop. Planting crops in spring may, therefore, mitigate these impacts.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of planting crops in spring rather than autumn.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.

Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Undersowing cereals with plants such as clover, which are able to fix nitrogen in the soil, is commonly used in agri-environment schemes to reduce the need to apply artificial fertilizer. However, these plants may also provide an important source of nectar for butterflies and moths, which could improve the value of arable land for butterfly and moth populations.

Background information and definitions:
Rice paddy fields are unusual among agricultural habitats as they normally have banks as field boundaries (rather than hedgerows, walls or ditches). The banks are often managed to reduce vegetation cover, either by spraying with herbicide or by mechanical cutting (Giuliano et al. 2018). However, reduced management may enable vegetation cover to develop and flower abundance to increase, which may benefit butterflies and moths.

Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Large areas of grassland have been converted to arable land, leading to a loss of grassland-dependent species. Meadows can support a higher abundance and species richness of butterflies than arable land (Luppi et al. 2018). Restoring arable land to permanent grassland may recreate communities of invertebrates similar to those historically found in an area (Denning & Foster 2018).

Ten studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of restoring arable land to permanent grassland. Six studies were in the UK, two were in Finland, and one was in each of Switzerland and Taiwan.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (9 STUDIES)

Community composition (2 studies): One of two replicated, site comparison studies in the UK and Finland found that grasslands restored from bare soil by seeding developed butterfly communities that were increasingly similar to existing high-quality grasslands over the first 10 years after establishment. The other study found that older grasslands established by sowing with competitive seed mixes had a greater proportion of specialist butterflies than newer grasslands sown with less competitive species which required re-seeding every 4–5 years.
Richness/diversity (8 studies): Three replicated, site comparison studies (including two paired studies) in Switzerland, the UK and Taiwan found that 4–5-year-old created grasslands and abandoned cropland had a greater species richness of butterflies, burnet moths and all moths than conventionally managed grassland or cultivated farms. Two of three replicated studies (including one randomized, paired, controlled study and two site comparison studies) in the UK and Finland found that grasslands established by sowing grasses, legumes and other non-woody, broadleaved plants (forbs), or perennial grass mixes, had a higher species richness of butterflies (in one case including other pollinators) than grasslands established with grass-only mixes or less competitive species. The third study found that grasslands established by sowing complex or simple seed mixes, or by natural regeneration, all had a similar species richness of butterflies and day-flying moths, but species richness was higher on grasslands created &lt;10 years ago than on grasslands created &gt;20 years ago. One before-and-after study in the UK found that after the adoption of an Environmentally Sensitive Areas scheme, including reverting arable land to permanent grassland, the species richness of large moths on a farm increased. One replicated, site comparison study in the UK found that over 10 years after restoration, the number of species of butterfly on seeded grassland remained similar each year.

POPULATION RESPONSE (7 STUDIES)

Abundance (7 studies): Two of three replicated, paired, site comparison studies in the UK and Taiwan found that restored grassland had a higher abundance of moths than conventional grassland or unrestored crop fields, and a similar abundance to semi-natural grasslands, but abundance did not increase with time since restoration.

Wild bird seed mixtures are commonly sown as part of agri-environment schemes aimed at restoring bird populations. Seed mixtures can contain a wide variety of plants, predominantly annual species, and are therefore re-sown every one or two years. Some commonly used plants may provide beneficial resources, in particular nectar, to butterflies and moths.

3931: Produce coffee in shaded plantations 
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Coffee is often grown commercially in large monocultures, with no taller trees providing shade, often referred to as “sun-grown” coffee. However, as a perennial species which grows naturally in the forest understorey, coffee can also be grown among other, taller trees, which may or may not also provide a commercial product (“shade-grown coffee”). By retaining a more diverse forest structure, shade-grown coffee may allow a more diverse forest ecosystem to develop or persist, including communities of butterflies and moths. However, some species of moth, such as the coffee leaf miner, are a coffee pest, and growers may want to reduce their abundance (Borkhataria et al. 2012).

3932: Plant nectar flower mixture/wildflower strips 
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Butterflies and moths often show a preference for areas with more floral resources (Vogel et al. 2007), but such resources are absent from intensive arable landscapes. Sown nectar flower mixtures, or wildflower strips, are common components of agri-environment schemes or conservation incentive programs which aim to increase the availability of flowers for insects. However, there can be many differences in the implementation methods used. For example, the exact seed mixture of species sown often differs between geographic regions and individual studies. Excluding grasses from nectar flower mixtures may reduce competition and aid re-establishment of the flowering species, while the rotation of the location of wildflower strips every 2–3 years may also be beneficial, as not all sown species will persist for longer than this (Heard et al. 2011).
Nectar flower mixes are normally composed of perennial plants, as opposed to annual species sown in wild bird seed mixes (Pywell et al. 2008). For studies on sowing these mixes, see “Plant wild bird seed or cover mixture”.

The other study found that, five years after sowing wildflower strips, butterfly species richness, but not diversity had increased at one of two study sites. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the UK found that the species richness of butterflies and moths was similar on farms managed under agri-environment schemes, including with sown wildflower strips, and on conventionally managed farms. Two replicated studies (including one randomized, controlled study and one site comparison study) in the UK and Sweden found that field margins sown with wildflowers had a greater species richness of butterflies than grass-only field margins. One of two replicated, paired, controlled studies (including one randomized study) in the USA and the UK found that plots sown with a mix of wildflowers had a greater species richness of caterpillars than plots sown with a single flower species. The other study found that plots sown with either complex or simpler flower mixes had a similar species richness of butterflies. Two replicated studies (including one randomized, controlled study) in the UK found that wildflower plots sown with phacelia, borage or lucerne had a higher species richness or diversity of butterflies and moths than plots sown with other flower species.

POPULATION RESPONSE (16 STUDIES)

Abundance (17 studies): Ten studies (including nine replicated studies, three randomized studies, three controlled studies and seven site comparison studies) in the UK, Switzerland and Finland found that sown wildflower strips had a higher abundance of all butterflies, generalist butterflies, specialist butterflies and meadow brown butterflies than conventional field margins, unsown margins, cropped fields, cropped margins, conventional grassland or extensively managed meadows. However, one of these studies only found this effect in one of two study years. Two of these studies also found that the abundance of specialist butterflies and meadow brown caterpillars was similar in sown wildflower strips and unsown margins, cropped fields and conventional grassland, and one found that the abundance of caterpillars was lower in sown wildflower strips than in conventional grassland. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the UK found that the abundance of butterflies and micro-moths was higher on farms managed under agri-environment schemes, including with sown wildflower strips, than on conventionally managed farms, but the abundance of other moths was similar. Two replicated studies (including one randomized, controlled study and one site comparison study) in the UK and Sweden found that field margins sown with wildflowers had a higher abundance of butterflies than grass-only field margins. One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK found that farms with wildflower strips (along with other enhanced agri-environment scheme options) had a higher abundance of some butterflies, but a lower abundance of other butterflies, than farms with simpler agri-environment scheme management such as grass-only margins. One of two replicated, paired, controlled studies (including one randomized study) in the USA and the UK found that plots sown with one of three wildflower mixes had a higher abundance of moths than plots sown with two other mixes or a single flower species. The other study found that plots sown with either complex or simple flower mixes had a similar abundance of butterflies. One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK found that wildflower plots sown with lucerne had a higher abundance of butterflies than plots sown with borage, chicory or sainfoin.

BEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)

Use (2 studies): Two studies (including one replicated study) in the UK and the USA reported that sown nectar flower plots and tropical milkweed plots were used by six species of butterflies and moths and monarch butterflies and caterpillars.

3933: Replant native vegetation 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
The conversion of natural habitat to other land uses leads to the loss of native vegetation. Butterflies and moths often have specific host plant requirements, meaning that if their host species is lost from a site, the population will not be able to survive. This action includes studies testing the effect of specifically planting butterfly and moth host species, as well as planting other native vegetation which may benefit butterflies and moths (Fuentes-Montemayor et al. 2015). Caterpillar growth and survival can differ between naturally occurring host plants species (Pocius et al. 2017), so the choice of host species for planting may be important. This action includes tests of different methods of replanting (e.g. sowing vs plug planting, or the effect of patch size) as well as the effectiveness of replanting overall, and may be conducted at a small scale, or as large-scale habitat restoration where planting is the only action.
For studies on specifically replacing non-native plant species with native species, see “Replace non-native species of tree/shrub with native species”. For studies on the restoration of specific habitats by either multiple actions (which may include planting) or where the specific action is not clear, see “Restore or create forest or woodland”, “Restore or create grassland/savannas”, “Restore or create heathland/shrubland”, “Restore or create peatland” and “Restore or create wetlands and floodplains”.

Key Messages:

Eleven studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of replanting native vegetation. Five studies were in the USA, two were in New Zealand, and one was in each of Switzerland, Mexico, Ecuador and Brazil.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (5 STUDIES)

Community composition (3 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in Ecuador found that native trees planted within recently abandoned pasture and secondary shrubland had a similar community composition of butterflies and moths after 7–8 years, but a subset of communities found on native trees planted within pine plantations, or on saplings regenerating naturally within pristine forest. One replicated, site comparison study in Brazil found that 12–14-year-old replanted and naturally regenerating forests had a different butterfly community to both grazed pasture and remnant forest. One site comparison study in Mexico found that a replanted forest had a different community composition of caterpillars to a naturally regenerating forest.
Richness/diversity (5 studies): Four of five site comparison studies (including four replicated studies) in New Zealand, Mexico, Ecuador, Brazil and the USA found that replanted native shrubs, grasses, non-woody broadleaved plants (forbs) and trees had a similar species richness or diversity of butterflies, caterpillars and flower-visiting insects (including butterflies and moths) to vineyards, pasture, naturally regenerating and remnant forests, and remnant prairies. However, one of these studies also found that the species richness of butterflies in replanted native shrubs and grasslands was lower than in remnant native habitat. The fifth study found that, after 7–8 years, native trees planted in pine plantations had a greater species richness of butterflies and moths than trees planted in recently abandoned pasture, but both had a lower species richness than naturally regenerating saplings within pristine forest.

POPULATION RESPONSE (6 STUDIES)

Abundance (5 studies): Four of five site comparison studies (including four replicated studies) in New Zealand, Mexico and the USA found that replanted native shrubs, grasses, non-woody broadleaved plants (forbs), trees and translocated bamboo rush had a similar abundance of butterflies, caterpillars and flower-visiting insects (including butterflies and moths), and density of Fred the thread moth caterpillars to vineyards, pasture, naturally regenerating forest, remnant prairies and undisturbed bogs. However, one of these studies also found that replanted native shrubs and grasses had a lower abundance of butterflies than remnant native habitat. The fifth study found that common milkweed planted in meadows had fewer monarch butterfly eggs than milkweed planted in private gardens.
Survival (2 studies): Two replicated studies (including one randomized, controlled study and one site comparison study) in the USA found that the survival of common sooty winged skipper and monarch butterfly eggs and caterpillars was similar on planted patches of lamb’s-quarters of different sizes, and on common milkweed planted in meadows or private gardens.
Condition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in New Zealand found that Fred the thread moth caterpillars in translocated bamboo rush plants were a similar size to caterpillars in undisturbed bogs.

BEHAVIOUR (3 STUDIES)

Use (3 studies): Three studies in the USA and Switzerland reported that planted patches of silver lupine, prairie violet and bladder senna were used by wild mission blue and Iolas blue butterflies, and translocated regal fritillaries, for at least three or 4–10 years after planting.

3934: Restore or create habitat connectivity 
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
An important threat to butterflies and moths is the increasing fragmentation of habitat patches by human activity (Cavanzón-Medrano et al. 2018). This limits dispersal, especially in species which are poor fliers, and leaves isolated populations vulnerable to local extinction (van Langevelde & Wynhoff 2009). Species richness tends to be higher in better connected habitat patches (Öckinger et al. 2010), so restoring habitat connectivity across a landscape may be important for reconnecting isolated populations (Schultz et al. 2008). For example, woodland creation projects can be used to increase connectivity between existing woodland fragments, but are most beneficial when they are spatially-targeted (Fuentes-Montemayor et al. 2015).
For studies on retaining habitat corridors, see “Habitat protection – Retain connectivity between habitat patches”.

Six studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of restoring or creating habitat connectivity. Three studies were in the USA, two were in the UK and one was in Sweden.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (4 STUDIES)

Abundance (4 studies): Four studies (including one controlled, before-and-after study and one before-and-after study) in the USA and the UK found that restoring connectivity between lupine, bracken, pastures or prairie patches increased the abundance of Karner blue, high brown fritillary, small pearl-bordered fritillary, marsh fritillary and regal fritillary.

BEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)

Use (2 studies): One site comparison study in Sweden reported that grassland strips providing nectar or shelter were each more likely to be used by one of four butterfly species than strips with no resources. One replicated, controlled study in the USA found that common buckeye and variegated fritillary butterflies were more likely to move between connected than unconnected habitat patches.

3935: Maintain or create bare ground 
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Some butterflies and moths show preferences for exposed areas of ground (e.g. Marschalek et al. 2017, Vogel et al. 2007), which warm up quicker than the surrounding vegetation and can be used for basking/sunning, although other species avoid it (Vogel et al. 2007). Exposed ground can also allow less competitive plants to re-establish, which butterflies and moths may rely on as caterpillar food or adult nectar sources (Howe et al. 2004). Bare ground can be created in a number of ways, including disking (Dollar et al. 2013), turf stripping (Howe et al. 2004) or sod cutting (Sedláková & Chytrý 1999), or by the impact of livestock (Elligsen et al. 1997) or wild mammals (de Schaetzen et al. 2018).

Key Messages:

Four studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of maintaining or creating bare ground. Two studies were in the UK, and one was in each of the Netherlands and the USA.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that after 1–2 years, grass field margins disked to create bare ground had a similar species richness of both grassland butterflies and disturbance-tolerant butterflies to undisturbed margins.

POPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Abundance (3 studies): One replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that after 1–2 years, grass field margins disked to create bare ground had a higher abundance of disturbance-tolerant, but not grassland, butterflies to undisturbed margins. One replicated, site comparison study in the Netherlands found that Alcon large blue occupied a similar proportion of heathlands managed with sod cutting and unmanaged heathlands. However, the same study found that Alcon large blues were less likely to occur on heathlands where sod cutting and grazing were used together. One site comparison study in the UK found that a sand dune plot which had been stripped of turf and soil supported a translocated population of belted beauty moths, but a plot which had been strimmed and raked did not.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)

Use (1 study): One replicated study in the UK reported that 2-3 years after bare ground plots were created, some were used by caterpillars or adult moths of one or more of the grey carpet, lunar yellow underwing, forester and marbled clover, but none by the basil thyme case-bearer.

3936: Restore or create forest or woodland
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Woodland creation or restoration can be used to reverse the global loss of forest habitat, and forest-dependent species. However, restored forests can remain structurally different from older forests even 20 years after regeneration (Fuentes-Montemayor et al. 2015), which may in turn affect the butterfly and moth community which they can support. Additional management, such as thinning, may be necessary to improve the structural diversity of new forests, as part of the restoration process (Fuentes-Montemayor et al. 2015).
This action includes studies where either multiple actions have been used to restore or create forests, or where the specific action used is not clear, including natural regeneration on abandoned land. For studies of specific actions for creating or managing forests, see “Replant native vegetation”, “Replace non-native species of tree/shrub with native species”, “Clear or open patches in forests”, “Coppice woodland”, “Thin trees within forests”, “Create young plantations within mature woodland” and “Natural system modifications – Use prescribed fire to maintain or restore disturbance in forests”. For studies testing the natural regeneration of native forests after forestry/logging operations, see “Biological resource use – Encourage natural regeneration in former plantations or logged forest”.

Key Messages:

Ten studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of restoring or creating forest or woodland. Three studies were in the UK, two studies were in Brazil and one was in each of the USA, Cameroon, Mexico, Malaysia and Costa Rica.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (6 STUDIES)

Community composition (4 studies): Three site comparison studies (including two replicated studies) in Mexico, Costa Rica and Brazil found that naturally generating or secondary forest had a different community composition of caterpillars6, geometrid and arctiine moths and butterflies to replanted forest, oil palm plantations, pasture or remnant primary forest. One site comparison study in Brazil found that a 54-year-old restored forest had a higher proportion of fruit-feeding forest butterfly species than 11–22-year-old restored forests, and a similar community composition to a remnant forest.
Richness/diversity (6 studies): Three replicated, site comparison studies in Cameroon, Costa Rica and Brazil found that secondary forest had a similar species richness of butterflies and geometrid and arctiine moths to agroforestry plantations, pasture and remnant forest. Two of these studies also found that secondary forest had a greater species richness of butterflies and geometrid and arctiine moths than cropland or oil palm plantations. One of two site comparison studies (including one replicated study) in Brazil and Malaysia found that a 54-year-old restored forest had a lower species richness of fruit-feeding butterflies than 11–22-year-old restored forests. The other study found that 5–60-year-old restored forests had a greater species richness of butterflies than newly restored forests (&lt;3-years-old), but restored forests had a lower species richness than primary forests. One site comparison study in Mexico found that a forest restored by natural regeneration had a similar diversity of caterpillars to a forest restored by planting.

POPULATION RESPONSE (6 STUDIES)

Abundance (6 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies in Cameroon and Costa Rica found that secondary forest had a higher abundance of butterflies and geometrid and arctiine moths than cropland or oil palm plantations. One of these studies also found that secondary forest had a similar abundance of butterflies to coffee and cocoa agroforestry, and the other study also found that secondary forest had a lower abundance of geometrid and arctiine moths than primary forest. One site comparison study in Mexico found that a forest restored by natural regeneration had a similar abundance of caterpillars to a forest restored by planting. Two of three studies in the UK reported that where forest had been restored with coppicing, felling and ride management, the number of populations of high brown fritillary, pearl-bordered fritillary, wood white and grizzled skipper stayed the same or increased. The other study found that the number of heath fritillary colonies decreased after management.

BEHAVIOUR (3 STUDIES)

Use (3 studies): Two studies (including one paired study) in the USA and the UK found that in forest restored with selective logging or coppicing, felling and ride widening orange sulphur and heath fritillary butterflies, but not pine white butterflies, flew into restored areas more than unrestored areas and occupied a greater area than before the sites were restored. One replicated, before-and-after study in the UK reported that in forest restored with coppicing, felling and ride management, high brown fritillary presence was the same or higher than before restoration, and after restoration the butterflies were more likely to be present at sites with high brash and bracken litter coverage.

Background information and definitions:
The conversion of natural habitat to other land uses often leads to the replacement of native vegetation with non-native species. Native trees and shrubs often support a greater abundance and species richness of caterpillars than non-native trees (Clem & Held 2018). Therefore, replacing non-native species with native ones may improve native butterfly and moth populations.

3938: Clear or open patches in forests
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Although many species of butterflies and moths live within woodland, many are reliant upon open glades, where sunlight can reach the understorey and create warm habitat patches and encourage the growth of flowers. Traditional woodland management, such as small scale wood harvesting, which created these habitats has declined, leading to the closure of woodland canopies (Bubová et al. 2015). Opening up patches within the forest may create new habitat for these species. However, some species, especially in tropical and sub-tropical regions, are dependent on the shade provided by continuous forest cover, and may be adversely affected by canopy clearance, so caution should be taken when applying this action.

Key Messages:

Fourteen studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of clearing or opening patches in forests. Five studies were in the UK, two were in each of Finland and Japan one was in each of Sweden, the USA and Canada and the Czech Republic, and one was a review across Europe.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (6 STUDIES)

Community composition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the UK found that wider woodland rides (and coppiced woodland) contained more unique species of macro-moth than standard width rides or mature forest.
Richness/diversity (6 studies): Three replicated studies (including one controlled study, one site comparison study and one paired sites, controlled study) in the UK, Japan and the Czech Republic found that cleared patches in forests had a greater species richness of butterflies but a lower species richness of moths than unmanaged patches, coppiced woodland or closed canopy forest. One of these studies also found that the species richness of butterflies declined over the first three years after clearing. One of two replicated, site comparison studies in the UK and Canada found that larger, but not smaller, cleared patches supported a higher species richness of butterflies than undisturbed forest. The other study found that both wider and standard width rides had a similar species richness of macro-moths to mature forest. One replicated, site comparison study in Japan found that cleared forest patches had a similar species richness of butterflies to semi-natural grassland, although six species were only observed in cleared patches, compared to 15 species only observed in grassland.

POPULATION RESPONSE (10 STUDIES)

Abundance (10 studies): Five studies (including one replicated, controlled, before-and-after study, one replicated, controlled study and one replicated, site comparison study and two before-and-after studies) in the UK, Finland, Sweden and Japan found that cleared patches in forests, which were also managed with coppicing and grazing, had a higher abundance of butterflies generally, and chequered blue, woodland brown, high brown fritillary and small pearl-bordered fritillary specifically, than before management, or than unmanaged or coppiced areas. One of these studies also found that the abundance of butterflies declined over the first three years after clearing. One of two replicated, site comparison studies in the UK and Canada found that larger, but not smaller, cleared patches had a higher abundance of butterflies than undisturbed forest. The other study found that wider rides had a lower abundance of macro-moths than standard width rides or mature forest. One replicated, site comparison study in the UK found that patches cleared 2–4 years ago had a greater abundance of heath fritillary than patches cleared 7–11 years ago or patches in their first year after clearance. One study in Finland reported that, in an area with selected clearance of pines, a translocated population of baton blue butterflies increased in number over two years. One review across Europe reported that clearing small patches in forests benefitted 19 out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern.
Survival (1 study): One study in Finland reported that, in an area with selected clearance of pines, a translocated population of baton blue survived for at least two years.

BEHAVIOUR (2 STUDY)

Use (2 studies): One paired sites study in the USA found that orange sulphur butterflies, but not pine whites, flew into areas with selective clearance of pines more often than other areas.

3939: Coppice woodland
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Coppicing is a traditional woodland management technique, used to harvest the young, fast-growing stems of particular tree species, such as hazel. It involves repeatedly felling trees at the base and allowing them to regrow for a number of years. Coppicing removes some of the canopy, allowing light in to the woodland floor, replicating the natural creation of woodland clearings. This may benefit butterflies and moths by encouraging the growth of food plants on the woodland floor, or by creating sheltered, sunny sites for basking and territory defence.

Key Messages:

Ten studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of coppicing woodland. Eight studies were in the UK and one was in each of France and Germany.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (4 STUDIES)

Community composition (3 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies in the UK and France found that coppiced woodland of different ages supported different communities of moths and butterflies. One replicated, site comparison study in the UK found that coppiced woodland contained more unique species of macro-moth than mature forest.
Richness/diversity (4 studies): One of two replicated, site comparison studies in the UK found that coppiced woodland had a greater species richness of butterflies than unmanaged woodland. The other study found that coppiced woodland had a lower species richness of macro-moths than mature forest, and there was no change in species richness with the age of coppice. One of two replicated, site comparison studies in the UK and France found that woodland coppiced two years ago had a greater species richness of butterflies than woodland coppiced &gt;15 years ago. The other study found that the species richness of moths was similar in woodland coppiced 1–4, 5–8 and 12–20 years ago.

POPULATION RESPONSE (10 STUDIES)

Abundance (9 studies): Two of four site comparison studies (including three replicated studies and one before-and-after study) in the UK found that coppiced woodland (in one case also legally protected) had a higher abundance of butterflies generally, and of heath fritillary specifically, than unmanaged woodland. One study found that pearl-bordered fritillary and small pearl-bordered fritillary populations were more likely to persist for up to 20 years in coppiced woodland (or woodland with young plantations) than in mature conifer woodland. The fourth study found that the abundance of macro-moths was lower in coppiced woodland than in mature forest, and there was no change in abundance with the age of coppice. Three of four replicated, site comparison studies (including one before-and-after study) in the UK, France and Germany found that the abundance of butterflies generally, heath fritillary specifically, and eastern eggar moth and scarce fritillary caterpillar webs, was higher in woodland coppiced two, two–four, five–seven or 12–15 years ago than in woodland coppiced 5–11 or &gt;15 years ago. The fourth study reported that the abundance of moths was similar in woodland coppiced 1–4, 5–8 and 12–20 years ago. One before-and-after study in the UK reported that after coppicing, along with scrub control, tree felling and grazing, high brown fritillary and small pearl-bordered fritillary abundance increased.
Reproductive success (1 study): One before-and-after study in the UK reported that pearl-bordered fritillaries released into coppiced woodland bred at least once.

3940: Thin trees within forests
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Thinning is a forestry practice that involves the selective removal of trees to reduce tree density and improve the growth rate and health of the remaining trees. Thinning has been done historically to maximize timber production but may have ecological benefits. Thinning removes some of the canopy, allowing light in to the woodland floor, replicating the natural creation of woodland clearings. This may benefit butterflies and moths by encouraging the growth of food plants on the woodland floor, or by creating sheltered, sunny sites for basking and territory defence. However, some species spend almost their entire lives in the canopy, and may be adversely affected by the loss of even a few canopy trees, so caution should be taken when applying this action.
For studies that used thinning as part of selective logging methods, see the intervention “Biological resource use – Harvest groups of trees or use thinning instead of clearcutting”.

Key Messages:

Six studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of thinning trees within forests and woodland. Three studies were in the USA and one was in each of Côte d’Ivoire, Finland and the Czech Republic.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (5 STUDIES)

Community composition (1 study): One site comparison study in Côte d’Ivoire found that rarer species of fruit-feeding butterfly were less frequently caught in a forest managed by thinning than in an unmanaged, naturally regenerating forest.


Richness/diversity (6 studies): Four studies (including two replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after studies) in the USA and Finland found that one, two or four years after management, coniferous woodland which had been thinned, along with either prescribed burning, mulching or nearby felling, had a greater species richness of butterflies, or butterflies, diurnal moths and bumblebees combined, than either unmanaged woodland or before management. One site comparison study in Côte d’Ivoire found that a forest managed by thinning had a similar species richness and diversity of fruit-feeding butterflies to an unmanaged, naturally regenerating forest. One replicated, paired sites, controlled study in the Czech Republic found that partially-cleared forest plots had higher butterfly but lower moth species richness than plots of closed-canopy forest.

POPULATION RESPONSE (5 STUDIES)

Abundance (5 studies): Four studies (including two replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after studies) in the USA and Finland found that one, two or four years after management, coniferous woodland which had been thinned, along with either prescribed burning, mulching or nearby felling, had a higher abundance of all butterflies, or specialist butterflies, than either unmanaged woodland or before management. One site comparison study in Côte d’Ivoire found that a forest managed by thinning had a similar abundance of fruit-feeding butterflies to an unmanaged, naturally regenerating forest.

Although many species of butterflies and moths live within woodland, many are reliant upon open areas with a diverse habitat structure, which are sheltered by the surrounding trees. Traditional woodland management, such as small scale wood harvesting, which created these habitats has declined, leading to the closure of woodland canopies (Bubová et al. 2015). Creating young plantations within mature woodland may help to temporarily open up patches within the forest, and create new habitat for butterflies and moths by encouraging the growth of food plants on the woodland floor, or by creating sheltered, sunny sites for basking and territory defence.

3942: Manage woodland edges for maximum habitat heterogeneity 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Adult butterflies and moths, and their caterpillars, often have different habitat requirements but poor dispersal ability, and therefore creating a varied habitat structure is important for producing habitat suitable for each life stage within a small area (Schultz et al. 2008). Where woodland meets adjacent, open habitat, hard, straight edges provide little habitat diversity for butterflies and moths. Creating a more varied structure to the woodland edge, by felling some trees, encouraging scrub growth, or “scalloping” to increase the length of the edge, may be beneficial to a range of butterfly and moth species.

3943: Restore or create grassland/savannas 
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
In many parts of the world, vast areas of native grassland have been lost or degraded. Recreating or restoring these grasslands, by re-planting native species, removing invasive, non-native species, or reintroducing disturbance regimes such as grazing, mowing or burning, aims to create the habitat necessary to restore or boost native butterflies and moths, and return communities to those found in remnant, undisturbed grasslands (Denning & Foster 2018, O’Dwyer & Attiwell 2000).
For studies on restoring wet grasslands, fenland and floodplains, see “Restore or create wetlands and floodplains”. For studies on restoring dry heathland and shrubland, see “Restore or create heathland/shrubland”.
This action includes studies where either multiple actions have been used to restore or create grasslands, or where the specific action used is not clear. For studies of specific actions for creating or restoring grasslands, see “Replant native vegetation”, “Change mowing regime on grassland” and “Natural system modifications – Use prescribed fire to maintain or restore disturbance in grasslands or other open habitats”.

Key Messages:

Six studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of restoring or creating grassland or savanna. Three studies were in the USA, two were in the UK, and one was in Italy.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, paired, site comparison study in Italy found that created semi-natural grasslands had a greater diversity of butterflies than adjacent conifer forests, but a lower diversity than species-rich pastures.

POPULATION RESPONSE (4 STUDIES)

Abundance (4 studies): Two site comparison studies (including one replicated, paired study) in Italy and the USA found that created semi-natural grasslands and restored grasslands and oak barrens had a higher abundance of butterflies and regal fritillaries than adjacent conifer forests, species-rich pastures or unmanaged or remnant prairies. One site comparison study in the USA found that prairies restored 5–10 years ago by seeding with native species, mowing, and weeding or applying herbicide, had a greater abundance of Fender’s blue eggs than a prairie restored 1–2 years ago, and a similar abundance to remnant prairies. One study in the USA reported that restored prairie supported a translocated population of regal fritillaries for at least three years after restoration.

3944: Employ areas of semi-natural habitat for rough grazing (includes salt marsh, lowland heath, bog, fen) 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Low intensity, rough grazing can be used to maintain open habitats in an early successional state. It can be enclosed (with limited stocking levels) or unenclosed. This action involves grazing semi-natural habitats that are not an integral part of modern farming practice, such as areas of peat bog, or other undrained wetland, lowland heath, saltmarsh and sand dunes. It does not include management of species-rich grasslands, wet meadows or wood pasture. For studies on the use of grazing to maintain these habitats, see “Agriculture and aquaculture – Maintain species-rich, semi-natural grassland”, “Agriculture and aquaculture – Maintain or restore traditional water meadows and bogs”, “Agriculture and aquaculture – Maintain or restore native wood pasture and parkland”.
For other management options for open, semi-natural habitats, see “Change mowing regime on grassland”, “Manage heathland by cutting” and “Natural system modifications – Use prescribed fire to maintain or restore disturbance in grasslands or other open habitats”.

Key Messages:

Nine studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of employing areas of semi-natural habitat for rough grazing. Three studies were in Germany, two were in each of the UK and the Netherlands, and one was in each of China and Canada.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (5 STUDIES)

Community composition (1 study): One controlled study in Germany found that after 16–18 years of sheep grazing, lightly grazed and ungrazed saltmarshes had a different community of micro-moths to heavily grazed saltmarsh.
Richness/diversity (4 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies (including one paired study) in the Netherlands and Canada found that calcareous coastal dunes and shrubsteppe managed by cattle or pony grazing for 4–13 or 6–40 years had a similar species richness of butterflies (in one case combined with all pollinators) to unmanaged land or dunes managed by cutting. One controlled study in Germany found that saltmarsh managed by light sheep grazing for 15–18 years had a greater species richness of micro-moths than moderately or heavily grazed marsh, but a similar species richness to ungrazed marsh. One replicated, site comparison study in the UK found that upland rough grassland managed by livestock grazing had a greater species richness of butterflies than permanently or partially grazed improved grassland.

POPULATION RESPONSE (7 STUDIES)

Abundance (7 studies): Two of four studies (including two controlled studies, one before-and-after study and two site comparison studies) in the UK, the Netherlands, China and Canada found that fenland and calcareous coastal dunes managed by cattle or pony grazing for two or 4–13 years had a higher abundance of large copper eggs and four of 13 species of butterfly than unmanaged land or dunes managed by cutting. One study found that meadow steppe grazed by cattle, goats or sheep for 1–5 years had a lower abundance of butterflies and moths than ungrazed steppe. The fourth study found that shrubsteppe grazed by cattle for 6–40 years had a similar abundance of pollinators (including butterflies) to ungrazed shrubsteppe. Two controlled studies (including one replicated, paired study) in Germany found that saltmarsh managed by light sheep grazing for 15–18 or 19–22 years had a higher total abundance of micro-moths, and of two out of seven caterpillars, than moderately or heavily grazed, or ungrazed marsh. However, one of these studies also reported that the abundance of four other caterpillars was lower in lightly or heavily grazed marsh than in ungrazed marsh. One replicated, site comparison study in the UK found that upland rough grassland managed by livestock grazing had a higher abundance of butterflies than permanently or partially grazed improved grassland.

BEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)

Use (2 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies in the Netherlands found that calcareous coastal dunes and heathland managed by cattle or pony, or year-round horse and sheep, grazing for five or 4–13 years were more likely to be occupied by brown argus and Alcon large blue than unmanaged land or habitat managed by cutting, grazing and sod cutting, or summer-only cattle and sheep grazing.

3945: Change mowing regime on grassland
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
In the absence of wild or domestic grazing animals, mowing or haying can be used to maintain open grasslands or savannas, and prevent scrub encroachment. However, mowing causes a sudden change in the habitat structure, removing nectar plants and potentially injuring or killing eggs, caterpillars or pupae living within the sward (Humbert et al. 2010, Morris 2000). The timing and frequency of mowing may be important for avoiding these short-term negative impacts on butterflies and moths (Morris 2000). This action includes studies comparing different mowing regimes, as well as studies comparing mowing to other options for grassland management, such as burning.
For studies on the creation or restoration of grasslands by either multiple actions (which may include mowing) or where the specific action is not clear, see “Restore or create grassland/savannas”.

Background information and definitions:
The loss of heathland or shrubland may occur due to a range of factors, including too many grazing animals inhibiting regeneration of shrubs, too few grazing animals or fire suppression leading to reversion to woodland, or invasion by non-native species. Shrubland restoration or creation may benefit butterflies and moths associated with the habitat.

3947: Manage heathland by cutting
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Heathland, like other open habitats, requires some disturbance to maintain habitat favourable to specialist species of butterflies and moths. Management by cutting is one option for creating this disturbance, but cutting causes a sudden change in the habitat structure, potentially removing nectar resources or injuring or killing eggs, caterpillars or pupae living within the heath (Humbert et al. 2010, Morris 2000). Therefore, the timing and frequency of cutting may be important for avoiding these short-term negative impacts on butterflies and moths (Morris 2000). This action includes studies comparing different cutting regimes, as well as studies comparing cutting to other options for heathland management, such as burning.

3948: Restore or create peatland
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Large areas of peatland have been deliberately or unintentionally drained (for example extracting drinking water from below ground lowers the water table over a large area) for human activities. Drained peat can be too dry and chemically unsuitable for peatland plants (Lamers et al. 2002), reducing the suitability of habitat for specialist butterflies and moths. Peatland restoration typically involves raising the water table to rewet the surface peat. This creates more suitable conditions for recolonization by peatland plants (Money & Wheeler 1999; Ritzema et al. 2014), such as bog myrtle Myrica gale, which could benefit butterflies and moths which depend upon them as a caterpillar food source (Fowles et al. 2004). However, the rate at which water levels are raised may need to be controlled, so as not to submerge overwintering caterpillars (Joy & Pullin 1997, 1999). It may also be necessary to rewet the area around a peatland (creating a ‘hydrological buffer zone’) to prevent water simply draining away from the peatland.
A range of techniques may be used to raise the water table to restore peatlands, for example blocking drainage ditches, planting flood-resistant vegetation to slow water flow, blocking underground channels, building raised embankments to retain water, inserting dams below the peat surface to slow subsurface drainage, switching off drainage pumps, felling trees, or restoring inflows. These interventions are all considered in this action. For studies of specific actions for creating, restoring, or managing peatlands, see “Replant native vegetation” and “Employ areas of semi-natural habitat for rough grazing (includes salt marsh, lowland heath, bog, fen)”.
Habitats within this action include peatland, bogs, mires, and wet heathland, where the water table is close to the ground surface.

For studies on restoring dry heathland and shrubland, see “Restore or create heathland/shrubland”.

Background information and definitions:
Wetland habitats are often drained or degraded during the development of agriculture or expansion of urban areas or other land uses. Restoration of these habitats can help to recover specialist butterfly and moth populations. Restoration of wetlands may involve a combination of interventions, such as removing invasive and emergent plants, maintaining bankside vegetation and trees, planting native species, and raising water levels or reinstating seasonal flooding.

3950: Manage wetlands or ponds by grazing or cutting to prevent succession
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Wetlands support a number of specialist butterfly and moth species, but this habitat requires some form of disturbance to prevent succession into scrub or woodland. In natural systems, this may have been provided by seasonal flooding and wild grazing animals, but flooding may not be possible in wetlands constrained by surrounding human land use. Cutting or mowing wetlands, or grazing with domestic livestock, may be able to replace natural disturbance regimes, but the frequency and timing of management may be important for benefitting, or avoiding harm to, particular species.

Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Large mammals can act as ecosystem engineers, altering the habitat around them. This often takes the form of disturbance: by grazing, browsing, uprooting or felling dominant plant species (Hess et al. 2014). This creates new habitats (such as bare ground, deadwood, or open water), which may benefit butterfly and moth species directly, or allow the establishment of less competitive plant species on which butterflies and moths depend (de Schaetzen et al. 2018). Common examples of mammals considered to be ecosystem engineers include elephants, wild boar (de Schaetzen et al. 2018), bison (Hess et al. 2014) and beavers.

Background information and definitions:
In natural wetland habitats in northern temperate regions, streams and rivers are dammed by beavers, reducing the flow of water and creating wetlands and pools which are used by many other species. This rise in water levels may be important for the reproductive cycle of other species, including wetland specialist butterflies and moths. However, in many regions, beavers have been extirpated or reduced to very small populations by hunting, leading to a loss of this important wetland habitat. Where the reintroduction of beavers is unfeasible, installing artificial dams may replicate the rise in water levels associated with wild beavers.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of installing artificial dams in streams to raise water levels. This study was in the USA.

3955: Restore or create species-rich, semi-natural grassland
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
In marginal lands where agriculture ceases to be viable, traditionally managed pastures and hay meadows are frequently abandoned. This leads to an increase in scrub cover, changing the habitat from open grassland to early successional woodland. While this may encourage butterflies and moths which prefer more closed habitats (see “Abandon/fallow grassland to allow early succession”), it is detrimental to species which prefer open habitats.  This intervention covers the restoration of species-rich, semi-natural grassland from abandoned pasture or hay meadows, by clearing scrub and/or reintroducing low intensity grazing or mowing management.
For studies on the restoration of grassland from former arable land, “Restore arable land to permanent grassland”. For studies on the restoration of species-rich grassland from intensively managed grassland, see “Reduce grazing intensity on grassland by reducing stocking density”, “Reduce grazing intensity on grassland by seasonal removal of livestock”, “Reduce cutting frequency on grassland” and “Reduce management intensity on permanent grasslands (several interventions at once)”. For studies on the maintenance of species-rich grassland, see “Maintain species-rich, semi-natural grassland”. For studies on grassland restoration outside of a farmland context, see “Habitat restoration and creation – Restore or create grassland/savannas”.

Key Messages:

Six studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of restoring or creating species-rich, semi-natural grassland. Two studies were in Finland, and one was in each of Switzerland, Sweden, the UK and Germany.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Community composition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the UK found that semi-natural grasslands restored by scrub clearance and the reintroduction of grazing or mowing had different butterfly communities to existing species-rich grasslands, and they did not become more similar over time.
Richness/diversity (3 studies): One of two replicated, site comparison studies in Finland and Sweden found that semi-natural grasslands restored by scrub clearance and grazing had a similar species richness of butterflies and burnet moths to both unrestored and continuously managed grassland. The other study found that semi-natural grasslands restored by cattle grazing had a lower species richness of butterflies and day-flying moths than unrestored and continuously managed grasslands. One replicated, site comparison study in the UK found that the species richness of butterflies on semi-natural grasslands restored by scrub clearance and the reintroduction of grazing or mowing remained similar over time since restoration.

POPULATION RESPONSE (5 STUDIES)

Abundance (5 studies): Two of five replicated, site comparison studies (including one paired study) in Switzerland, Finland, Sweden and Germany found that semi-natural grasslands restored by cattle grazing had a lower total abundance of butterflies and day-flying moths, and of 13 out of 32 individual species, than unmanaged, abandoned grasslands, but that three species had higher abundance, and three had lower abundance, on restored grasslands than on continuously grazed grasslands. Two studies found that grasslands restored by scrub clearing and grazing or mowing had a similar abundance of butterflies and burnet moths and heath fritillaries to unmanaged grasslands and continuously managed grasslands, although the abundance of heath fritillary adults and caterpillars was lower on restored grasslands than on continuously managed grasslands. The fifth study found that the density of blue-spot hairstreak eggs, and egg batches, was higher in grasslands restored by scrub cutting than in unrestored or continuously managed grasslands.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)

Use (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Germany found that in grasslands restored by scrub cutting, a greater proportion of small buckthorn bushes contained blue-spot hairstreak eggs than in unrestored or continuously managed grasslands.

3956: Cease grazing on grassland to allow early succession
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Some grassland butterfly and moth species, which require generally open habitats, are also dependent on host plant species which are sensitive to disturbance (Eichel & Fartmann 2008), or may themselves suffer decreased juvenile survival from grazing (Dover et al. 2011). The cessation of grazing on grassland, also known as abandoning or fallowing, may enable host plant species to establish (Eichel & Fartmann 2008) or lead to an increase in the survival of eggs, caterpillars or pupae of butterflies and moths (Dover et al. 2011). It may also allow larger, woody plants to establish through succession, which increases habitat complexity, and may enable a more diverse, or different, community of butterflies and moths to establish, at least in the short-term (Bubová et al. 2015).
This action contains studies which compare abandoned grassland to grazed pasture. Note that the effect of grazing cessation may vary depending on the intensity of grazing before abandonment. See also “Cease mowing on grassland to allow early succession”.
For other studies on reducing grassland management, see “Reduce grazing intensity on grassland by reducing stocking density”, “Reduce grazing intensity on grassland by seasonal removal of livestock” and “Reduce management intensity on permanent grasslands (several interventions at once)”. For studies on reversing the process of abandonment, see “Restore or create species-rich, semi-natural grassland”.

Key Messages:

Twenty-six studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of ceasing grazing on grassland to allow early succession. Five studies were in the UK, four were in each of Germany and the USA, three were in each of Sweden and Finland, two were in each of Spain and the Czech Republic, and one was in each of Switzerland, Europe and Israel.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (14 STUDIES)

Community composition (3 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies in the Czech Republic and Germany found that the community composition of butterflies and moths in grasslands which had been abandoned for &gt;5 years or an unspecified length of time was similar to grasslands managed by grazing or mowing (results not distinguished). One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in Spain found that after grazing and mowing management was abandoned, over 6 years the butterfly community became dominated by generalist species, and species with fewer generations/year.
Richness/diversity (12 studies): Six of nine replicated studies (including one randomized, controlled study, one paired, site comparison, and seven site comparisons) in Germany, the USA, Finland, Sweden and the Czech Republic found that grasslands which had been not been grazed for &gt;5 years, or an unspecified length of time, in one case with burning, had a similar species richness of butterflies and day-flying, burnet or all moths to grasslands grazed by cattle, horses and cattle or a mix of livestock (in two studies grazing and mowing were not distinguished) or grazed with cattle and burned. One of these studies also found that grasslands abandoned for 5–15 years had a greater species richness than grasslands grazed by sheep. A further two studies found that grasslands which had been abandoned for &gt;5–20 years or many years had a lower species richness of butterflies than grazed grasslands (in one study grazing and mowing were not distinguished). The other study found that butterfly species richness was higher in grasslands where grazing ceased 2–9 years ago than those abandoned &gt;10 years ago or those currently grazed. Three replicated studies (including one randomized, controlled study and two site comparison studies) in Switzerland, Germany and the UK found that grasslands which had been abandoned for 4, 5–10 or &gt;10 years had a higher species richness of butterflies and day-flying moths and nocturnal moths than extensively grazed, recently abandoned or commercially grazed grasslands. Two of these studies also found that grassland abandoned for 4 or 5–10 years had a similar species richness of butterflies and day-flying moths and all moths to grassland lightly grazed by cattle or sheep/sheep and cattle.

POPULATION RESPONSE (24 STUDIES)

Abundance (24 studies): Six of 20 replicated studies (including one paired, controlled, before-and-after study, three randomized controlled studies, and 15 site comparison studies) in Germany, the USA, the UK, Switzerland, Finland, Sweden, Spain, the Czech Republic and Israel found that grasslands which had been abandoned for 1-25 years had a higher abundance of Scotch argus, butterflies and day-flying moths, nocturnal moths, caterpillars, and of small insects including caterpillars, than grasslands grazed by goats, sheep and/or cattle. Two of these studies only found a difference compared to grazing at commercial/intensive, not low, densities. Four of the studies found that grasslands which had been abandoned for two weeks, 5–20 years or an undetermined time had a lower abundance of butterflies and spring webworm caterpillars than grasslands grazed by cattle or a mix of livestock (in two studies grazing and mowing were not distinguished). A further four of the studies found that grasslands which had been abandoned for 5-15 years had a similar abundance of butterflies, burnet moths, day-flying moths and meadow neb moth caterpillars to grasslands grazed by sheep, horses and cattle or a mix of livestock. A further four of the studies found that in grasslands which had been abandoned for &gt;10 years, many years or an unspecified number of years, and in one case with burning, abundance or density was mixed depending on butterfly and moth species compared to grasslands grazed by cattle or unspecified grazers or grazed with cattle and burned. The other study found that butterfly density was higher in grasslands where grazing ceased 2–9 years ago than those abandoned &gt;10 years ago or those currently grazed. Two replicated studies (including one controlled, before-and-after study and one site comparison study) in Spain and Germany found that grasslands which had been abandoned for 1–6 years or an unspecified time period had a higher abundance of woodland and hedgerow butterflies and burnet moths, but a lower abundance of grassland or farmland species, than grasslands managed by grazing and/or mowing (results not distinguished). Two studies also found that the large blue and silver-studded blue went extinct in some abandoned meadows. One replicated, site comparison study in Sweden found that grasslands which were ungrazed for the year had a lower abundance of clouded Apollo butterflies than lightly grazed grasslands, but a higher abundance than heavily grazed grasslands. One review in Europe reported that ceasing grazing on grassland benefitted six out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern.

BEHAVIOUR (3 STUDIES)

Use (3 studies): One replicated, paired, site comparison study in Germany found that grassland which had been abandoned for &gt;5 years had a similar occurrence of hoary bell moth caterpillars to grassland grazed by sheep. One replicated, site comparison study in the UK found that a similar proportion of grasslands which had been abandoned for one year, and grazed grasslands, contained &gt;20 marsh fritillary caterpillar webs. One replicated, site comparison study in Spain found that grizzled skipper and painted lady occurred less frequently, but small pearl-bordered fritillary occurred more frequently, in meadows which had been abandoned for at least 1–2 years than in meadows managed by grazing or mowing (results not distinguished).

Some grassland butterfly and moth species, which require generally open habitats, are also dependent on host plant species which are sensitive to disturbance (Eichel & Fartmann 2008), or may themselves suffer decreased juvenile survival from mowing or haying (Dover et al. 2011). The cessation of mowing on grassland, also known as abandoning or fallowing, may enable host plant species to establish (Eichel & Fartmann 2008) or lead to an increase in the survival of juvenile life stages of butterflies and moths (Dover et al. 2011). It may also allow larger, woody plants to establish through succession, which increases habitat complexity, and may enable a more diverse, or different, community of butterflies and moths to establish, at least in the short-term (Bubová et al. 2015).

Community composition (3 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies in the Czech Republic and Germany found that the community composition of butterflies and moths in grasslands which had been abandoned for &gt;5 years or an unspecified length of time was similar to grasslands managed by mowing or grazing (results not distinguished). One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in Spain found that after mowing and grazing was abandoned, over 6 years the butterfly community became dominated by generalist species, and species with fewer generations/year.


Richness/diversity (7 studies): Five of seven replicated, site comparison studies in Germany, Poland, Japan, the Czech Republic, Russia and Italy found that grasslands which had been abandoned for 3–13 years, 10–20 years or an unspecified length of time, had a similar species richness of butterflies and burnet moths or all moths to grasslands managed by annual or unspecified frequency mowing, or mown within the last three years (in two studies mowing and grazing were not distinguished). One of these studies also found that grasslands abandoned for more than 50 years had lower species richness than grasslands mowed annually to up to 20 years ago, and another found that grasslands abandoned for 6–13 years had a lower species richness of butterflies than grasslands managed by traditional rotational mowing and burning. One of the studies found that meadows not cut all summer had a higher species richness of butterflies than meadows cut 1–3 times/summer. The other study found that grasslands abandoned for at least 5–20 years had a lower species richness of butterflies than grasslands managed by mowing or grazing (results not distinguished).

POPULATION RESPONSE (14 STUDIES)

Abundance (14 studies): Four replicated studies (including one randomized, paired, controlled study and three site comparison studies) in Germany, Spain, Slovakia and Hungary found that grasslands which had been abandoned for &gt;1–20 years had a lower abundance of all butterflies or some species of butterfly and caterpillars, than grasslands managed by mowing once or twice per year (in two studies mowing and grazing were not distinguished). Four replicated, site comparison studies (including one paired study) in Germany, the Czech Republic, Russia and Italy found that grasslands which had been abandoned for &gt;3 years, were temporarily abandoned, or were uncut all summer, had a higher abundance of all butterflies, 11 species of butterfly, Scotch argus adults and meadow neb moth caterpillars, than grasslands managed by mowing annually, 1–3 times/summer, or within the last three years. Two replicated studies (including one controlled, before-and-after study and one site comparison study) in Spain and Germany found that grasslands which had been abandoned for 1–6 years or an unspecified time period had a higher abundance of woodland and hedgerow butterflies and burnet moths, but a lower abundance of grassland or farmland species, than grasslands managed by mowing and/or grazing (results not distinguished). One of these studies also found that silver-studded blue went extinct in some abandoned meadows. Three replicated, site comparison studies in the USA and Poland found that in grasslands which had been abandoned for many years or 10 to over 50 years before abundance was mixed depending on butterfly species compared to grasslands managed by grazing or mowing. One replicated, site comparison study in Switzerland found that grasslands which had been abandoned for around six years had a similar abundance of heath fritillary adults and caterpillars to grasslands managed by annual mowing, but that grasslands abandoned for &gt;25 years had a lower abundance of adults and no caterpillars.

3958: Reduce management intensity on permanent grasslands (several interventions at once)
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Intensive, conventional grassland management, with high fertilizer input and regular cutting or grazing, creates species-poor plant communities which in turn result in a lower diversity of butterflies and moths (Marini et al. 2009). Reducing management intensity may, therefore, enable species-rich plant and butterfly and moth communities to recover.
This intervention is for studies which look at the effect of a combination of measures to reduce management intensity, including reducing or delaying grazing or mowing, sometimes in combination, and often alongside a reduction or removal of the application of fertilizers, herbicides or pesticides. For individual effects of these actions, see “Reduce grazing intensity on grassland by reducing stocking density”, “Reduce grazing intensity on grassland by seasonal removal of livestock”, “Reduce cutting frequency on grassland”, “Delay cutting or first grazing date on grasslands to create variation in sward height”, “Pollution – Reduce fertilizer, pesticide or herbicide use generally” and “Pollution – Convert to organic farming”.

Key Messages:

Twelve studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of reducing management intensity on permanent grasslands. Seven studies were in Switzerland, three were in the UK, and one was in each of Greece and Germany.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (12 STUDIES)

Community composition (2 studies): Two replicated studies (including one controlled study and one site comparison study) in Switzerland found that the composition of butterfly communities differed between low-input and intensively managed grasslands. One of these studies found that low-input grasslands tended to have more butterfly species whose caterpillars feed on a single host plant, have one generation/year and poor dispersal ability.
Richness/diversity (11 studies): Six of 10 studies (including five controlled studies and five site comparison studies) in Switzerland, the UK, Greece and Germany found that less intensively managed grasslands had a higher species richness of butterflies and moths than conventionally managed grasslands, although two of these studies only found a difference in one of two years or regions. The other four studies found that less intensively managed grasslands had a similar species richness of butterflies and moths to conventionally managed grasslands. However, one of these studies also found that less intensively managed grassland had more specialist species of moths, and species of conservation concern, than conventionally managed grassland. One before-and-after study in the UK found that after grazing was reduced and chemical application stopped, the species richness of large moths increased.

POPULATION RESPONSE (5 STUDIES)

Abundance (5 studies): Three of four replicated studies (including two controlled studies and two site comparison studies) in Switzerland, the UK and Germany found that low-input or unfertilized, ungrazed grassland managed with a single cut had a higher abundance of butterflies, micro-moths and declining macro-moths than intensively managed grassland. Two of these studies also found that the abundance of caterpillars and of all macro-moths was similar between less intensively and more intensively managed grasslands. The other study found that less intensively managed grassland had a similar abundance of moths to more intensively managed grassland. One before-and-after study in the UK found that after grazing was reduced and chemical application stopped, the total abundance of large moths and the abundance of five out of 23 butterfly species increased, but the abundance of two butterfly species decreased.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)

Use (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Germany reported that 24 out of 58 moth species preferred less intensively managed grasslands, but 12 species preferred more intensively managed grasslands.

3959: Reduce grazing intensity on grassland by reducing stocking density
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Productive grasslands used for livestock production are intensively managed, with high stocking densities resulting in a closely cropped sward (Bubová et al. 2015). While grazing is important for maintaining open grassland, reducing grazing intensity by decreasing stocking density allows some vegetation to grow taller, increasing structural complexity and floral diversity (Morris 2000), and this may provide more suitable habitat for some grassland butterflies and moths (e.g. Elligsen et al. 1997).
For studies on reducing grazing intensity by removing livestock for part of the year, see “Reduce grazing intensity on grassland by seasonal removal of livestock”. For studies on reducing grazing intensity alongside other reductions in management intensity, such as reduced chemical input, see “Reduce management intensity on permanent grasslands (several interventions at once)”. For studies on removing grazing entirely, see “Cease grazing on grassland to allow early succession”. For studies on increasing grassland management, see “Increase grazing intensity or cutting frequency on grassland”.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (8 STUDIES)

Richness/diversity (8 studies): Five of eight replicated studies (including two randomized, controlled studies and six site comparison studies) in the UK, Sweden, Germany, the USA and Switzerland found that grasslands grazed with lower stocking densities of sheep, cattle or a mix of sheep, cattle and horses had a greater species richness of adult butterflies, all moths and burnet moths than grassland grazed at higher stocking densities. However, one of these studies also found that butterfly and burnet moth caterpillar species richness was similar at sites with low and high stocking densities. Two of the other studies found that grasslands grazed with lower stocking densities of cattle and horses or unspecified grazing animals had a similar species richness of butterflies and burnet moths to grassland grazed at higher stocking densities. The other study found that, in one of two study years, grasslands grazed with cattle at a low density had lower species richness than grasslands grazed at moderate density.

POPULATION RESPONSE (12 STUDIES)

Abundance (11 studies): Eight replicated studies (including four controlled studies and four site comparison studies) in the UK, Germany, the USA and Sweden found that grasslands grazed with lower stocking densities of sheep, cattle or both (in one case combined with a later start to grazing) had a greater abundance of all butterflies, butterflies with grass host plants, all moths, burnet moths, their caterpillars or specific species (in two cases as part of combined invertebrate counts) than grasslands grazed at higher stocking densities. The three studies on caterpillars only found a higher abundance at two out of three sites or in earlier or later sampling periods, and one of the studies found that sites with low and high intensity grazing had a similar abundance of butterfly and burnet moth caterpillars. Two replicated, site comparison studies in Sweden and Switzerland found that grasslands grazed with lower stocking densities of cattle and horses or unspecified grazing animals had a similar abundance of butterflies and burnet moths to grassland grazed at higher stocking densities. One review of studies in Europe reported that reducing grazing intensity benefitted 41 out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern, but did not distinguish between reducing stocking density and seasonal removal of livestock.
Survival (1 study): One site comparison study in Belgium and the Netherlands reported that the survival of Glanville fritillary caterpillar nests was similar between grasslands with low and high stocking density of sheep.
Condition (1 study): One site comparison study in Belgium and the Netherlands found that after 6–10 days of sheep grazing, fewer Glanville fritillary caterpillar nests were damaged in a grassland with lower stocking density than in a grassland with higher stocking density, but there was no difference after two months.

The other two studies found that meadows cut occasionally or once/year had a higher abundance of Scotch argus and pollinators (including butterflies) than intensively mown grasslands and meadows cut twice/year.

3962: Increase grazing intensity or cutting frequency on grassland
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Although intensive grazing or regular mowing of grasslands is often seen as a threat to butterflies and moths, increasing management intensity can be an important option for controlling dominant plant species and encouraging beneficial plants, such as caterpillar host plants. For example, Goodenough & Sharp (2016) found that increasing autumn and winter grazing intensity led to an increase in the abundance of Primula species, the sole food plant of the Duke of Burgundy Hamearis lucina. Therefore, increasing grazing intensity could, in some cases, be beneficial for butterflies and moths. Alternatively, increased cutting or grazing frequency may be applied to a landscape by the introduction of agri-environment scheme (AES) prescriptions to land previously managed at very low intensity (e.g. Konvicka et al. 2008).
For studies on the effects of reducing management intensity, see “Reduce grazing intensity on grassland by reducing stocking density”, “Reduce grazing intensity on grassland by seasonal removal of livestock”, “Reduce cutting frequency on grassland” and “Reduce management intensity on permanent grasslands (several interventions at once)”.

Key Messages:

Five studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of increasing grazing intensity or cutting frequency on grassland. Two studies were in Germany, and one study was in each of the Czech Republic, the USA and Israel.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Germany found that at intensively grazed sites species richness of adult butterflies and burnet moths was lower than at sites with low or no grazing, but caterpillar richness was lower in intensively grazed and low grazing sites than in sites with no grazing.

POPULATION RESPONSE (5 STUDIES)

Abundance (5 studies): Four studies (including one replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study, one replicated, site comparison study, and two site comparison studies) in Germany, the USA and Israel found that grasslands managed with more intensive grazing or with grazing in addition to rotational burning had a lower abundance of all adult butterflies, adult burnet moths, adult regal fritillaries and spring webworm caterpillar nests than ungrazed grasslands, lightly or moderately grazed grasslands or rotationally burned grasslands with occasional light grazing. However, one of these studies found that, while intensively grazed sites had lower butterfly and burnet moth caterpillar abundance than ungrazed sites, there was no difference in caterpillar abundance between ungrazed and lightly grazed sites. One before-and-after study in the Czech Republic reported that after increasing the cutting frequency on traditional meadows (under agri-environment scheme prescriptions) the abundance of Danube clouded yellow decreased.

3963: Change type of livestock grazing
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Livestock prefer to eat different plants, and graze at different heights or in different patterns. For example, sheep graze to a uniform height, while cattle leave heavily trampled areas and eat grass in clumps, leaving patches of taller vegetation (Schultz et al. 2008). These grazing patterns encourage different vegetation communities to develop, with different plants dominating. Therefore, changing the type of livestock used to graze grassland may create differences in the butterfly and moth community, with individual species preferring the landscape created by particular grazers.
This action includes studies comparing the use of different types of livestock alone. For studies comparing the use of single and multiple livestock types, see “Use mixed stocking”.

3965: Use rotational grazing
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Many butterfly species rely on transitional grassland habitats, where continuous management (often by grazing) results in a grass sward which is too short, or prevents the growth of their host plant, but complete abandonment leads to the sward becoming too long or the host plant being outcompeted (e.g. Eichel & Fartmann 2008). Rotational grazing, where livestock are moved between different areas of a site throughout the year, is one option for creating this kind of intermediate habitat, as well as generating a mosaic of more or less recently grazed areas on a larger scale. For other rotational management options, see “Use rotational mowing”, “Reduce grazing intensity on grassland by seasonal removal of livestock” and “Natural system modifications – Use rotational burning”.

Key Messages:

Six studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of using rotational grazing. Three studies were in France, two were in the USA and one was in the UK.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (5 STUDIES)

Community composition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that rotational, cattle-grazed grasslands had a similar butterfly community to continuously grazed or patch-burned grasslands.
Richness/diversity (5 studies): Two of four replicated studies (including one randomized, controlled study, two controlled studies and one site comparison study) in France and the USA found that rotational cattle- and sheep-grazed grasslands had a greater species richness of butterflies and burnet moths than continuously grazed or patch-burned grassland. Another of these studies found that rotationally sheep-grazed grassland had a similar species richness of butterflies and burnet moths to continuously grazed grassland. The other study found that rotational cattle-grazed pastures had a greater species richness of butterflies than constantly grazed pastures but only at a high, not low, stocking density. One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that rotationally managed grasslands, including some rotationally grazed grasslands, which were last managed longer ago had a higher species richness of butterflies than more recently managed grasslands.

POPULATION RESPONSE (6 STUDIES)

Abundance (6 studies): Two of four replicated, controlled studies (including two randomized studies and one paired study) in France and the UK found that rotational cattle- and sheep-grazed grassland had a higher abundance of butterflies and burnet moths and caterpillars (along with other invertebrates) than continuously grazed grasslands. However, one of these studies only found this in the first of three years of management. Another of these studies found that rotationally sheep-grazed grassland had a similar abundance of butterflies and burnet moths to continuously grazed grassland. The other study found that rotational cattle-grazed pastures had a higher abundance of butterflies than constantly grazed pastures but only at a high, not low stocking density. One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that the abundance of two species was higher, two species were lower and the other five species did not differ in rotationally cattle-grazed grasslands compared to continuously grazed or patch-burned grasslands. One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that rotationally managed grasslands, including some rotationally grazed grasslands, which were last managed longer ago had a higher abundance of butterflies than more recently managed grasslands.

3966: Use rotational mowing
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Mowing large areas of grassland at once creates a uniform habitat structure, and removes all floral resources simultaneously (Morris 2000). It can also kill or injure butterfly and moth eggs or caterpillars living among the grass. Rotational mowing resembles many traditional meadow management practices, and involves cutting different areas at different times, such that some patches remain uncut (Bubova et al. 2015). This creates a more heterogeneous sward height, and may provide a refuge habitat for butterflies and moths (Morris 2000). Studies are included here if they look at rotational mowing both within and between growing seasons.

Key Messages:

Ten studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of using rotational mowing. Two studies were in each of the USA, the Czech Republic and Switzerland, and one was in each of the UK, Germany, Europe and Japan.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (6 STUDIES)

Community composition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the Czech Republic found that grasslands managed with “mixed management”, which included mowing parts of a site at different times and leaving some areas uncut, had a similar community composition of butterflies, but a different community composition of moths, to grasslands managed by complete annual mowing.
Richness/diversity (6 studies): Three of four replicated studies (including two paired, controlled studies and two site comparison studies) in Germany, Switzerland, Japan and the Czech Republic found that grasslands managed by mowing strips in alternate years, by mowing and burning one half of the meadow each year, or by mowing parts of a site at different times and leaving some areas uncut, had a greater species richness and diversity of butterflies than grasslands cut in full once/year. However, one of these studies also found that grasslands managed by mowing parts of a site at different times and leaving some areas uncut had a lower species richness of moths than grasslands cut in full once/year. The fourth study found that grasslands managed by leaving a rotational area uncut on each mow had a similar species richness of butterflies and burnet moths to grasslands cut in full twice/year. One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that rotationally managed grasslands, including some rotationally mown grasslands, which were last managed longer ago had a higher species richness of butterflies than more recently managed grasslands. One replicated, site comparison study in Switzerland found that farms managed with more in-field agri-environment scheme (AES) options, including staggered mowing dates, had a similar species richness of butterflies to farms with fewer AES options.

POPULATION RESPONSE (7 STUDIES)

Abundance (7 studies): Two replicated, paired, controlled studies (including one randomized study) in Germany and Switzerland found that grasslands managed by mowing strips in alternate years, or by leaving a rotational area uncut on each mow, had a higher abundance of butterflies and burnet moths than grasslands cut in full once or twice per year. One of two replicated, site comparison studies in the USA found that rotationally managed grasslands, including some rotationally mown grasslands, which were last managed longer ago had a higher abundance of butterflies than more recently managed grasslands. The other study found that rotationally mown grasslands had a lower abundance of butterflies in the second year after they were last cut than in the first year after mowing. One replicated, site comparison study in the UK reported that two heath fritillary populations survived on rotationally mown grasslands while six populations went extinct on unmanaged grasslands. One review in Europe reported that rotationally mowing grassland benefitted 27 out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern. One replicated, site comparison study in Switzerland found that farms managed with more in-field agri-environment scheme (AES) options, including staggered mowing dates, had a similar abundance of butterflies to farms with fewer AES options.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)

Use (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in the Czech Republic found that 29 out of 32 butterfly species preferred meadows which were half mown in June and August to meadows cut in full twice/year. The other three species were woodland species which only visited meadows temporarily.

Background information and definitions:
Cutting or grazing are important management techniques for maintaining grassland habitats, but both represent a threat to butterflies and moths through either direct mortality or damage to food plants. However, alterations to the timing of management to when species are less vulnerable or need fewer resources (e.g. during the pupal phase) may be important for creating the optimal habitat conditions, in terms of structural variation, host plant abundance or quality (Goodenough & Sharp 2016), or the abundance of host species such as ants (Grill et al. 2008).

One study found that, in one of three years, grassland strips mulched once/year in September had a lower species richness of butterflies than strips mown once/year after 10 June. The third study found that meadows mown 1–2 times/year after 15 July had a similar species richness of butterflies and burnet moths to meadows mown twice/year after 15 June.

POPULATION RESPONSE (6 STUDIES)

Background information and definitions:
In productive grasslands, cutting or mowing is used to harvest vegetation, such as for hay or silage, but the harvest causes a sudden loss of habitat structure and resources used by butterflies and moths. It may also kill or injure eggs or caterpillars living within the sward (Humbert et al. 2010). Raising the cutting height by a few centimetres may allow more individuals to survive underneath the mower, or leave more resources available.

In productive grasslands, cutting or mowing is used to harvest vegetation, such as for hay or silage, but the process kills or injures the eggs and caterpillars of butterflies and moths living within the grassland (Humbert et al. 2010). However, the mortality of individuals may depend on the equipment used for mowing. For example, mechanized tractor-pulled rotary mowers may have a larger impact than hand-pushed bar mowers (Humbert et al. 2010). Using a different type of mower may increase butterfly and moth survival.

3971: Maintain or restore traditional water meadows and bogs
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Traditionally managed, extensive wet grasslands and water meadows provide an important habitat for many specialist butterfly and moth species. These habitats have suffered from historical drainage, to reduce flooding and allow cultivation, and from scrub encroachment caused by the removal of grazing or other management. Therefore, the restoration or maintenance of wet meadows could include raising water levels, scrub cutting, or the reintroduction of grazing. Studies are also included here if they compare different management techniques on wet grassland, such as grazing and mowing.

One replicated, site comparison study in Germany found that the abundance of butterflies was similar in wet meadows managed by mowing once/year in autumn, or by light grazing with cattle or horses. One site comparison study in the UK found that wet grassland grazed at an intermediate intensity by cattle had a higher abundance of marsh fritillary caterpillar webs, but a similar abundance of adults, to grassland grazed at high or low intensity.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Wood pasture, where livestock are grazed at a low intensity under widely spaced mature trees, can support a diverse community of invertebrates, including butterflies and moths (Runquist 2011). For example, 12% of all British butterfly and moth species were recorded in a single summer in three small, traditionally managed orchards grazed by cattle (Smart & Winnall 2006). However, traditional wood pastures have been lost due to conversion into more intensive forms of agriculture or pasture, or abandonment. Restoring management may therefore benefit a wide range of butterflies and moths.

Background information and definitions:
Increased management of upland heath, or moorland, in particular by overgrazing, has led to a reduction in characteristic vegetation cover in favour of more dominant grass species, which are less favoured by sheep (Martin et al. 2013). A reduction in grazing pressure, or a switch to low intensity cutting or burning regimes, may allow moorland vegetation to recover, and in turn potentially support larger populations of heathland butterflies and moths.

Background information and definitions:
Continuous large areas of arable crops or intensively-managed grassland can be inhospitable for butterflies and moths. However, field edges such as hedgerows, ditches and grass or flower margins may provide important resources which are lacking in the managed field centres. Reducing field sizes, and therefore increasing the density of field edge habitat, may improve the habitat quality for butterflies and moths within the farmed landscape.
See also “Plant new hedges”, “Create uncultivated margins around intensive arable or pasture fields” and “Plant grass buffer strips/margins around arable or pasture fields”.

3975: Manage hedgerows to benefit wildlife (e.g. no spray, gap-filling and laying) 
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Despite being originally man-made, hedgerows provide an important source of semi-natural habitat within the farmed landscape. In Europe, conventional hedgerow management consists of annual cutting to a standard shape and size, which is unlikely to encourage the diversity of growth and resources needed by butterflies and moths. The timing of hedgerow cutting may be important for some species, depending on whether they are in a life-stage which is actively using the hedgerow and how easily it can disperse (Waring 2004). On the other hand, unmanaged hedgerows can become too overgrown, and gaps can appear over time. Hedgerows with more gaps attract fewer meadow brown Maniola jurtina butterflies than continuous hedgerows (Pywell et al. 2004). Agri-environment schemes recommend a diversity of hedgerow management techniques, including gap-filling, reduced mowing at the base, less frequent cutting (once every two or three years), and advise cutting at specific times of years (often in winter, Facey et al. 2014).

Key Messages:

Seventeen studies evaluated the effects of managing hedgerows to benefit wildlife on butterflies and moths. Fourteen studies were in the UK, and one was in each of Belgium, Costa Rica and Italy.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (9 STUDIES)

Richness/diversity (9 studies): Three replicated, site comparison studies in the UK and Costa Rica found that hedgerows with trees or a more complex structure had a higher species richness or diversity of butterflies and macro-moths than simpler hedgerows without trees. Three of six replicated studies (including three randomized, paired, controlled studies, one randomized, site comparison, and two site comparison studies) in the UK and Italy found that hedgerows cut to allow incremental growth had a higher diversity of caterpillars and pupae than hedgerows cut to the same size, that hedgerows kept between 1–2 m tall had a higher species richness of butterflies than hedgerows kept below 1 m tall and that fields with hedgerows of a larger volume had higher species richness of butterflies than those with hedgerows of a smaller volume, but only in one of two study years. The other three studies found that hedgerows managed according to agri-environment scheme prescriptions (including less frequent or winter cutting, gap-filling and restricted mowing, in one case in combination with other agri-environment scheme habitat) had a similar species richness of butterflies and moths to conventionally managed hedgerows.

POPULATION RESPONSE (17 STUDIES)

Abundance (17 studies): Four of six replicated studies (including four randomized, paired, controlled studies, one controlled study, and one paired, site comparison study) in the UK found that hedgerows cut once every 2–3 years, cut in autumn, or cut to allow incremental growth, had a higher abundance of adult butterflies and moths, moth caterpillars and pupae and brown hairstreak eggs than hedgerows cut to the same size every winter. However, one of these studies also found that hedgerows cut to allow incremental growth had a similar abundance of moth caterpillars and pupae to hedgerows cut to the same size. The other two studies found that hedgerows managed by gap-filling and cutting every three years had a similar abundance of moths to conventionally managed hedgerows, and that hedgerows cut in winter, or less frequently in autumn, had more concealed moth caterpillars, but a similar abundance of free-living caterpillars, to hedgerows cut annually in autumn. Three of five replicated, site comparison studies (including one paired study) in the UK and Costa Rica found that hedgerows with trees had a similar total abundance of macro-moths to hedgerows without trees. The other two studies found that hedgerows with trees, or with a more complex structure, had a higher abundance of butterflies and pale shining brown moths than simple hedgerows. Two replicated, site comparison studies in Belgium and Italy found that hedgerows managed with scalloped edges, or maintained at below 1 m tall, had more brown hairstreak eggs and a higher abundance of adult butterflies, than hedgerows with straight edges or allowed to grow over 2 m tall. One of two studies (including one controlled and one replicated, site comparison study) in the UK found that laid or coppiced hedgerows had a higher abundance of butterflies than unmanaged hedgerows. The other study found that managed hedgerows had a lower abundance of caterpillars than remnant hedgerows. One replicated, randomized, site comparison study in the UK found that butterfly abundance was higher in fields with hedgerows of a larger volume, but only in one of two study years. One replicated, site comparison study in the UK found that field margins next to hedgerow trees had a higher abundance of most shrub- and tree-feeding, but not grass- and herb-feeding, moth species than margins away from hedgerow trees.

3976: Plant new hedges 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Hedgerows provide important semi-natural habitat within farmland, offering food and shelter in their own right, as well as connectivity between other patches of semi-natural habitat, such as woodland. Hedgerows also reduce the temperature fluctuations experienced in open farmland, which may facilitate greater species survival or movement through the landscape. The presence of hedgerows in an agricultural landscape has been found to increase both the abundance and species richness of butterflies recorded (Luppi et al. 2018), therefore planting new hedgerows may help butterfly and moth populations on farmland to recover.
For studies on managing existing hedgerows, see “Manage hedgerows to benefit wildlife (e.g. no spray, gap-filling and laying)”.

Key Messages:

Seven studies evaluated the effects of planting new hedges on butterflies and moths. Five studies were in the UK and one was in each of Ireland and Canada.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (5 STUDIES)

Richness/diversity (5 studies): Three of four site comparison studies (including three replicated and three paired studies) in the UK, Ireland and Canada found that established hedgerows had a higher species richness of butterflies and macro-moths than in-field beetle banks, crops or pasture. The other study found that hedgerows had a similar species richness of butterflies to grass banks between fields. One replicated study in the UK found that gorse, oak and blackthorn planted within hedgerows had more species of arthropods, including caterpillars, than more commonly planted hawthorn.

POPULATION RESPONSE (6 STUDIES)

Abundance (6 studies): Five of six studies (including one replicated, controlled study, three paired, site comparison studies and two site comparison studies) in the UK, Ireland and Canada found that the abundance of butterflies, moths, macro-moths and gatekeepers was higher along hedgerows than on beetle banks, grass margins without hedgerows, in field interiors, or 5–10 metres away from hedgerows.The other study found that the abundance of butterflies along hedgerows was similar to grass banks between fields without hedgerows.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)

Behaviour change (1 study): One site comparison study in the UK found that moths recorded close to hedgerows were more likely to be flying parallel to it than moths recorded further away.

3977: Manage ditches to benefit butterflies and moths 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Well-managed ditches running between agricultural fields could provide important resources to butterflies and moths, including food, shelter, and water or mud, as well as connectivity between other semi-natural habitat patches across the landscape.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of managing ditches to benefit butterflies and moths.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.

3978: Protect in-field trees 
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Within open farmland, protecting remnant habitat features which provide vertical structure, such as in-field trees or forest fragments, may provide pockets of resources to butterflies and moths. In some cases, this may be enough to support small, transient populations, but it may also provide important stepping stones which allow individuals to move through an otherwise hostile landscape.
For studies on planting new trees, see “Plant in-field trees (e.g. copses)”.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of protecting in-field trees on butterflies and moths. The study was in Sweden.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Sweden found that where more trees and trees of more species had been retained in pastures, butterfly species richness was higher, but richness was lower when a high proportion of those trees were large.

3979: Plant in-field trees (e.g. copses) 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Intensively farmed areas have often lost much of their natural habitat structure, such as woodland, which would provide shelter, resources and structural variation for butterflies and moths. One option for encouraging species back on to farmland is the creation of small areas of woodland – or copses – within or at the edge of farmed land.
For studies on protecting existing trees, see “Protect in-field trees”.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of planting in-field trees on butterflies and moths.

3980: Provide or retain set‐aside areas in farmland 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Within the farmed landscape, fields are sometimes temporarily left uncultivated (or “set-aside”) for one or more years to allow the soil to recover, when the land is not required for production. Set-aside land may be left with the standing stubble of the previous crop, ploughed in and left fallow to allow natural regeneration, or sown with non-crop species such as lacy phacelia Phacelia tanacetifolia to encourage insect pollinators, including butterflies and moths (Steffan-Dewenter & Tscharntke 1997).
For studies of long-term or permanent set-aside, see “Restore arable land to permanent grassland”.
Steffan-Dewenter I. & Tscharntke T. (1997) Early succession of butterfly and plant communities on set-aside fields. Oecologia, 109, 294–302.

Key Messages:

Nine studies evaluated the effects of providing or retaining set-aside areas in farmland on butterflies and moths. Three studies were in the UK, and one was in each of Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, Hungary, Finland and the USA.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (5 STUDIES)

Community composition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Germany found that butterfly communities in older set-aside fields included species which were less migratory, spent longer as caterpillars, and had fewer generations/year than species found in newer set-aside fields.
Richness/diversity (5 studies): Three of four replicated studies (including one randomized, controlled study and three site comparison studies) in Germany, Ireland, Hungary and Finland found that sown or naturally regenerating set-aside had a greater species richness of butterflies and day-flying moths than cereal fields or pasture, especially when the set-aside was sown with less competitive grasses. One of these studies found a higher species richness of butterflies and day-flying moths in second-year set-aside than in first-year set-aside, but another found no difference in butterfly species richness between 1–3-year-old set-aside. The other study found that set-aside fields had a similar species richness of butterflies and moths to arable and pasture fields. One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that set-aside fields had a similar species richness of butterflies to native prairies.

POPULATION RESPONSE (8 STUDIES)

Abundance (8 studies): Two of five replicated studies (including one randomized, controlled study and four site comparison studies) in the UK, Ireland, Hungary and Finland found that the abundance of butterflies and day-flying moths in sown set-aside was higher than in cereal fields, especially when the set-aside was sown with less competitive grasses. One of these studies found a higher abundance of butterflies and day-flying moths in second-year set-aside than in first-year set-aside, but another found no difference in butterfly abundance between 1–3-year-old set-aside. The other three studies found that fallow and stubble set-aside had a similar abundance of adult butterflies and butterfly and moth caterpillars to arable fields and pasture. Two site comparison studies (including one replicated study) in the UK and Switzerland found that set-aside fields had a similar abundance of butterfly and moth adults and caterpillars to uncultivated field boundaries and extensively farmed land. One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that set-aside fields had a similar abundance of butterflies to native prairies in their first year, but a lower abundance of butterflies thereafter.

3981: Create uncultivated margins around intensive arable or pasture fields 
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Uncultivated margins around intensive arable or pasture fields may provide refuges for butterflies and moths, where a more diverse plant community can develop to provide shelter and food resources. They may also provide habitat which allows butterflies and moths to move through the farm landscape.

Key Messages:

Ten studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of creating uncultivated margins around intensive arable or pasture fields. Six studies were in the UK, two were in Sweden, and one was in each of Finland and Germany.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (9 STUDIES)

Richness/diversity (9 studies): Two of five studies (including four replicated, one randomized, one paired, two controlled and two site comparison studies) in Sweden, the UK and Finland, found that uncultivated margins had a lower species richness or diversity of butterflies than margins sown with grasses and non-woody broadleaved plants (forbs) or wildflowers. One other study found that the species richness of butterflies and day-flying moths was higher in permanent uncultivated margins than in sown fallow plots, and the other two found that the species richness of butterflies and moths was similar in uncultivated and sown margins. Three replicated studies (including one randomized, controlled study and two site comparison studies) in the UK and Germany found that uncultivated margins which were not grazed or cut, or were only cut in spring or autumn, had a higher species richness of butterflies than margins which were cut in summer. Two site comparison studies (including one replicated study) in the UK and Germany found that the species richness of butterflies was higher in longer or wider uncultivated margins than in shorter, narrower or conventional width margins. One of two replicated studies (including one controlled study and one site comparison study) in the UK and Finland found that uncultivated margins had a higher species richness of butterflies and day-flying moths than cereal fields, but the other found that the species richness of butterflies was similar between regenerating margins and cropped field edges. One replicated, paired, site comparison study in Sweden found that uncultivated margins had a higher species richness of butterflies and burnet moths if they were located closer to existing grassland.

POPULATION RESPONSE (9 STUDIES)

Abundance (9 studies): Six of seven studies (including six replicated, two randomized, four controlled and three site comparison studies) in Sweden, the UK and Finland found that the abundance of butterflies and moths, and of adult but not caterpillar meadow brown, was lower in uncultivated margins than in margins sown with grasses, or grasses and non-woody broadleaved plants (forbs) or wildflowers, or a mixture of grasses and wildflowers. However, one of these studies found that uncultivated margins had similar abundance of butterflies to margins sown with grasses or cereal crop. The other study found that the abundance of butterflies and day-flying moths was higher in permanent uncultivated margins than in sown fallow plots. Two of three replicated, site comparison studies (including two randomized studies) in the UK found that uncultivated margins which were not cut, or were only cut in spring and autumn, had a higher abundance of butterflies, and adult but not caterpillar meadow brown, than margins cut in summer. The other study found that margins which were not cut and grazed had a similar abundance of butterflies to margins which were cut and grazed. Two replicated studies (including one controlled study and one site comparison study) in the UK and Finland found that uncultivated margins had a higher abundance of butterflies and day-flying moths than cereal fields or cropped field edges. One site comparison study in the UK found that the abundance of butterflies in wide uncultivated margins was higher than in conventional margins. One replicated, paired, site comparison study in Sweden found that uncultivated margins had a higher abundance of butterflies and burnet moths if they were located closer to existing grassland.

3982: Plant grass buffer strips/margins around arable or pasture fields 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Grass margins, or buffer strips, can be created around the edges of fields to reduce nutrient and chemical run-off into adjacent habitat, and provide corridors of habitat for farmland wildlife. In Europe, this is often implemented as an option within agri-environment schemes. While basic agri-environment schemes often allow simple grass margins, enhanced schemes often provide an option for sowing wildflowers alongside the grass to provide “floristic enhancement”. This action includes tests of both simple and enhanced grass margins, as well as comparisons between them, and comparisons between other implementation options, such as changing the width of created margins.

Key Messages:

Twenty-six studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of planting grass margins around arable or pasture fields. Seventeen were in the UK, two were in each of Sweden, the Netherlands and the USA, and one was in each of China, France and Italy.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (15 STUDIES)

Richness/diversity (15 studies): One of two replicated, controlled studies in the UK found that 2-m grass margins had a greater species richness of butterflies than cropped field edges, but 6-m grass margins did not. The other study found that the species richness of butterflies was similar in grass margins and cropped field edges. Five replicated, site comparison studies (including one paired study) in the USA, the UK and Italy found that wider grass margins (up to 6 m wide) had a greater species richness or diversity of butterflies, macro-moths and micro-moths than narrower or conventional width margins, although one of these studies found that the species richness of macro-moths was similar in wide and conventional grass margins. Three of five replicated studies (including three randomized, controlled studies, one controlled study, and one site comparison study) in the UK and Sweden found that floristically enhanced grass buffers or wildflower strips had a greater species richness of butterflies than standard grass margins. The other two studies found that farms with floristically enhanced margins (along with other enhanced agri-environment scheme (AES) options) had a similar species richness of butterflies and moths to farms with standard grass margins (along with basic AES options) and farms with no grass margins or other AES options. One site comparison study in Sweden found that grass margins sown with legumes or a clover and grass ley had a higher species richness of butterflies and moths than uncultivated margins, but less than a species-rich pasture. One replicated study in the Netherlands found that the species richness of butterflies increased over time after the establishment of grass margins. One replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that disking or burning grass margins did not affect the species richness of butterflies.

POPULATION RESPONSE (22 STUDIES)

Abundance (21 studies): Three of four replicated, controlled studies in the UK found that grass margins had a higher abundance of butterflies than cropped field edges. The other study found that the abundance of gatekeepers on grass margins increased over four years after they were sown, but was only higher than cropped field edges at one of three farms after 2–4 years. Three of seven replicated, site comparison studies (including two paired studies) in the USA and the UK found that wider grass margins (up to 6 m wide) had a higher abundance of habitat-sensitive butterflies, macro-moths and micro-moths than narrower or conventional width margins. Two of these studies, and the other four studies, found that the abundance of disturbance-tolerant butterflies, macro-moths generally, and pale shining brown moths specifically, was similar in wide and conventional grass margins. Four replicated studies (including two randomized, controlled studies, one controlled study, and one site comparison study) in the UK and Sweden found that floristically enhanced grass buffers or wildflower strips had a higher abundance of butterflies than standard grass margins, uncultivated margins or margins sown with cereal crop. Two replicated, randomized, controlled studies in the UK found that farms with floristically enhanced margins (along with other enhanced agri-environment scheme (AES) options) had a higher abundance of some butterflies and micro-moths, a similar abundance of macro-moths, but a lower abundance of other butterflies, than farms with standard grass margins (along with basic AES options) and farms with no grass margins or other AES options. One site comparison study in Sweden found that grass margins sown with legumes or a clover and grass ley had a higher abundance of butterflies and moths than uncultivated margins or a species-rich pasture. Two replicated, before-and-after studies (including one randomized, controlled study) in the Netherlands and the USA found that mowing, disking or burning grass margins did not affect the abundance of butterflies and moths generally, or diamondback moths specifically, but that disking increased the abundance of disturbance-tolerant butterflies. One replicated, paired, site comparison study in the UK found that field margins had a similar abundance of butterfly and moth caterpillars to beetle banks established in the middle of fields.
Survival (1 study): One site comparison study in China found that the survival of marsh fritillary caterpillars in grass margins around lightly cultivated fields was lower, but survival of egg clusters similar, to in uncultivated, grazed meadows.

BEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)

Use (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in China found that grass margins around lightly cultivated fields were more likely to be occupied by marsh fritillary eggs and caterpillars than uncultivated, grazed meadows. One replicated, paired, site comparison study in France found that meadow brown butterflies used grass margins in a similar way to meadows.

3983: Plant more than one crop per field (intercropping) 
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Modern agricultural fields normally only contain a single crop, making sowing and harvest easier for the farmer. However, for sedentary butterfly and moth species, this may reduce the availability of resources. Planting more than one crop per field may increase the diversity of resources available for butterflies and moths, enabling less mobile species in particular to make better use of the landscape.
For studies on increasing diversity across a farm or farmed landscape, see “Increase crop diversity across a farm or farmed landscape”.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of planting more than one crop per field. The study was in Malaysia.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Community composition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Malaysia found that smallholdings planted with oil palm and other crops did not differ in butterfly community composition from those planted with oil palm alone.
Richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Malaysia found that smallholdings planted with oil palm and other crops did not have greater butterfly species richness than those planted with oil palm alone.

POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Malaysia found that smallholdings planted with oil palm and other crops did not have higher overall butterfly abundance than those planted with oil palm alone.
