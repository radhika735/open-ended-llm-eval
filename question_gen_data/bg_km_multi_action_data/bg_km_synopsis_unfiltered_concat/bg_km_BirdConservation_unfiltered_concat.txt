157: Distribute poison bait for predator control using dispensers 
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
If bait is easily visible, birds may be more likely to feed on it opportunistically. Therefore providing it in dispensers, which partially hide bait or make it difficult for non-target species to access it, may reduce incidental mortality of non-target species.

Key Messages:
A controlled study in New Zealand found that survival of South Island robins Petroica australis australis was higher when brodifacoum was dispensed from bait feeders compared to where bait was scattered.

Key Messages:

Four studies (two replicated) from Europe found population increases following habitat protection, more positive population trends in protected habitats, compared with outside, or with increases amounts of protected habitats.
A literature review reported that a large number of cranes (Gruidae) of seven species used nature reserves in China, whilst a replicated, randomised and controlled study from Argentina found that some guilds of birds were found at higher species richnesses in protected forests, some at higher densities, and that some showed no differences.

159: Use repellents on baits for predator control
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
If repellents that discourage birds from taking bait but do not affect bait consumption by target species can be identified then the risk of incidental mortality during eradication programmes may be greatly reduced.
Most birds (unlike most mammals) are visual hunters and foragers, meaning that strangely coloured baits may not be taken as readily, and so using them during eradication programmes may reduce incidental mortality.

Key Messages:

A replicated, randomised and controlled experiment in the USA found that methyl anthanilate and aminoacetophenone did not reduce consumption of baits by American kestrels Falco sparverius.
A replicated, randomised and controlled experiment in New Zealand found that treating baits with pulegone or Avex™ reduced pecking rates in North Island robins Petroica australis longipes.

160: Ensure connectivity between habitat patches
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Habitat fragmentation, as well as destruction, may be an important driver of population declines. Small areas hold fewer species than large ones and if individuals are unable to cross areas of converted habitat then populations in separate habitat patches will become isolated. This potentially makes them more vulnerable to extinction, from natural variations in birth and death rates or sex ratios; from inbreeding depression and from outside pressures, both natural (such as storms or wildfires) and man-made (such as hunting or continued habitat loss), although the precise effects of habitat fragmentation, as opposed to loss, are debated (e.g. Fahrig 1997).
Theoretically, the number of species surviving in a habitat fragment is determined by its size and its effective distance to other habitat patches (MacArthur & Wilson 1967). Connecting remaining areas of habitat is therefore often seen as a way to increase the viability of populations, but there is considerable debate as to the effectiveness of such ‘wildlife corridors’ (e.g. Beier & Noss 1998).
Studies describing the effects of creating habitat corridors, rather than retaining them are described in ‘Habitat restoration and creation’. Beier, P. & Noss, R.F. (1998) Do habitat corridors provide connectivity? Conservation Biology, 12, 1241–1252.

Key Messages:

A replicated, controlled study in Canada found significantly higher abundances of some birds, but not forest specialists, in forest patches connected to a continuous area of forest, than in isolated patches.
Another study of the same system found evidence that corridors were used by some bird species more than clearcuts between patches, although corridors near cut forest were not used more than those near uncut stands.

161: Provide or retain un-harvested buffer strips
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Provision or retention of forest strips in areas subject to timber extraction may be undertaken with the purported objectives of helping to mitigate the effects of loss of forest cover for woodland flora and fauna, as well as reducing potential problems such as soil erosion. Nature conservation aims include retaining valuable old forest features such as older trees with cavities and dead wood affording nest site and foraging opportunities for woodland birds. A similar intervention is ‘Ensure connectivity between habitat patches’, discussed in ‘Habitat protection’.

Key Messages:

Four replicated studies from Canada and the USA  found that wider buffer strips retained a bird community more similar to that of uncut forest than narrower strips. Two replicated and controlled studies from the USA found that several forest-specialist species were absent from buffers up to 70 m wide. 
Two replicated and controlled studies from the USA found that richness was higher in buffers &lt;100 m wide, compared to wider strips or forest. A replicated, controlled study in the USA (6) found that thinned buffer strips had lower abundances of forest species than unthinned strips, but higher abundances of early successional species. A replicated study from the USA (4) found that species richness was similar between 20–50 m buffers and original forest.
A replicated study from the USA found that bird abundances were higher in 20–50 m wide buffer strips than in original forest.
A replicated study in the USA found no differences in productivity of birds nests between buffer strips wider than 350 m, compared to those thinner than 250 m. Whilst a replicated, controlled study from the USA found that predation of artificial nests was significantly higher in buffer strips compared with continuous forest, but that there was no diffrerence between narrow and wide buffers.

Feeding birds in gardens is a popular past time in many parts of the world, and there is the possibility that encouraging young children to feed birds may increase their knowledge of local species and their desire to conserve them. Studies describing the effects of feeding on bird populations and reproduction are described in ‘General responses to small/declining populations - Provide supplementary food’.

Key Messages:
A single replicated before-and-after study from the USA found that most children involved in a programme providing families with bird food increased their knowledge of birds, but there was no significant change in environmental attitudes.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Low-intensity agricultural systems have consistently been shown to have higher biodiversity than more intensive systems, both in temperate regions and the tropics. Supporting such systems may therefore help declining farmland bird populations. However, whilst we captured many studies describing the distribution of birds across high- and low-intensity agricultural systems, we found no intervention-based evidence for the effects of legislation aimed at supporting and maintaining low-intensity agricultural systems on bird populations.

Key Messages:

We captured no evidence for the effects of supporting low-intensity agricultural systems on bird populations.

Background information and definitions:
Integrated Farm Management is a whole farm system that aims to provide profitable production whilst being environmentally responsible. It focuses on integrating beneficial natural processes, by using efficient soil management and crop rotations for example, into modern farming techniques. Practitioners of Integrated Farm Management need to be able to clearly demonstrate improvement to the quality of soil, water, air, wildlife habitat and the landscape.
We have not included studies describing the effects of Integrated Farm Management because farms are able to use a variety of different management interventions and which were used in any particular case is not always recorded. Where individual interventions are recorded, studies are described in the appropriate section.

Key Messages:

We found no intervention-based evidence on the effects of practicing integrated farm management on bird populations.

Background information and definitions:
This intervention is concerned with general increases in the proportion of natural or semi-natural habitat in a landscape. Studies describing the effects of the creation of specific habitat types and the use of individual restored sites are discussed in ‘Habitat restoration and creation’.

Key Messages:

Of four studies captured, one, a replicated and controlled paired sites study from Australia, found that farms with plantings of native vegetation held more species than those without. The effect was smaller than that explained by variation in the amount of natural habitat remaining on farms. A replicated study from Switzerland found more species in areas under the Ecological Compensation Area scheme than areas not under it.
A before-and-after study from Switzerland found that the populations of three bird species increased after an increase in the amount of land under the Ecological Compensation Scheme. This study found that three species were more found more than expected on Ecological Compensation Scheme land. Another replicated study from Switzerland found that some habitats held more birds if they were close to ECA habitat but that the amount of Ecological Compensation Scheme in an area had no impact on population densities.
A small study from the UK found no effect of habitat creation on grey partridge populations.

172: Pay farmers to cover the costs of bird conservation measures
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Agri-environment schemes are government or inter-governmental schemes designed to compensate farmers financially for changing agricultural practice to be more favourable to biodiversity and landscape. In Europe, agri-environment schemes are an integral part of the European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and Member States devise their own agri-environment prescriptions to suit their agricultural economies and environmental contexts.
Agri-environment schemes represent many different specific interventions, and where a study’s results can be clearly assigned to a specific intervention, they appear in the appropriate section. This section, meanwhile, includes evidence about the success of agri-environment policies overall.
Evidence relating to the Swiss Ecological Compensation Areas is placed under ‘Increase the proportion of natural habitat in the landscape’, if it involves monitoring biodiversity effects on a landscape scale, rather than focussing on specific aspects of habitat management.
In the USA and Canada, schemes such as the Conservation Reserve Program (USA) and the Permanent Cover Program (Canada) are aimed primarily at creating semi-natural and natural vegetation and are mainly discussed in ‘Habitat creation and restoration’.

Key Messages:

Three reviews from the UK of three studies captured reported population increases of three species after the introduction of specially-designed agri-environment schemes. These species were cirl buntings, corncrakes and Eurasian thick-knees. One of these found that many other species continued to decline.
Twenty-two of 25 studies all from Europe, including a systematic review,  examining local population levels or densities found that at least some birds studied were at higher densities, had higher population levels or more positive population trends on sites with agri-environment schemes, compared to non-agri-environment scheme sites. Some studies found that differences were present in all seasons, others in either summer or winter. Fifteen studies from Europe, including a systematic review, found that some or all species were not found at higher densities, had similar or lower population levels, showed similar population trends on sites with agri-environment schemes, compared with non-agri-environment scheme sites, or showed negative population trends. A study from the Netherlands found that many agri-environment scheme farms were sited in areas where they were unlikely to be effective.
One small study from the UK found no differences between winter densities of seed-eating birds on UK Higher Levels Stewardship sites, compared with those under Entry Level Stewardship. 
A replicated study from the UK found that grey partridge survival was higher on agri-environment scheme sites than non-scheme sites. This difference was not significant every year.
Two of three studies investigating reproductive productivity, including one replicated study, found that productivity was higher on farms under agri-environment schemes. One replicated study from the UK found no effect of agri-environment schemes on productivity.
A review (Vickery et al. 2010) found that the amount of land entering an agri-environment scheme was on target, but that some options were not being used at high enough rates to help many species.

173: Cross compliance standards for all subsidy payments
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Cross compliance is when farmers have to meet certain statutory standards to qualify for direct support payments such as those under the first pillar of the current Common Agricultural Policy. The standards could include, for example, keeping the land in ‘good agricultural condition’ or managing soil to avoid erosion. The Swiss Ecological Compensation Areas scheme, under which farmers have to manage 7% of their land to qualify for area-based payments, was made obligatory in Switzerland under cross compliance in 1998. Studies examining the effects of this scheme are included in a different section:  ‘Increase the proportion of natural/semi-natural habitat in the farmed landscape’.

Key Messages:
Apart from the Swiss Ecological Compensation Areas scheme (considered in another section), we found no studies comparing the effects of cross compliance standards with other means of implementing agri-environmental measures, or that considered the effects of cross compliance by monitoring farmland bird populations before and after it was implemented.

Background information and definitions:
Reducing field size means having a greater number of smaller fields, with boundaries between them. One reason this approach is expected to enhance biodiversity is that field boundaries of any type provide heterogeneity, with heterogeneity thought to be a strong factor determining biodiversity on farmland.

175: Provide or retain set-aside areas in farmland
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Allocation of some farmland to ‘set-aside’ (fields taken out of production) was compulsory under European agricultural policy from 1992 until 2008. Originally intended as a method of reducing production, set-aside has also been promoted as a way of protecting on-field biodiversity. Set-aside fields can be sown with fallow crops or left to naturally regenerate. Set-aside can be rotational (in a different place every year) or long term (retained for 5–20 years).
A 2008 literature review of the Environmental Stewardship programme, particularly Entry Level Stewardship (ELS) in the UK (Vickery et al. 2008) found that the population trends of all Farmland Bird Index species were positively correlated with the availability of set-aside in that year and that Entry Level Stewardship may not be able to effectively replace set-aside.

Key Messages:

Three replicated studies and a review of five studies from Europe and North America examining species richness or diversity found that more species were found on set-aside than on crops. One found fewer species on set-aside than other agricultural habitats.
All 21 studies, including a systematic review, 12 replicated experiments and two reviews, from Europe and North America that investigated population trends or habitat associations found that some species were found at higher densities or used set-aside more than other habitats, or were found on set-aside. Four studies (three replicated) from the UK found that some species were found at lower densities on set-aside compared to other habitats.
Three of four replicated studies from the UK found that waders and Eurasian skylarks had higher productivities on set-aside, compared to other habitats. One study found that skylarks nesting on set-aside had lower productivity compared to those on cereal crops, and similar productivities to those on other crops.
One replicated paired study from the UK found that rotational set-aside was used more than non-rotational set-aside, a replicated paired study found no differences between rotational and non-rotational set-aside. A review from Europe and North America found that naturally regenerated set-aside held more birds and more species than sown set-aside.

Background information and definitions:
Hedges can be key habitats for farmland biodiversity, but they may need managing to maximise their value. Managing hedges to benefit wildlife involves one or more of the following management changes: reduce cutting frequency; reduce or avoid spraying; mowing vegetation beneath hedgerows or filling gaps in hedges.

Key Messages:

The one study of six that investigated species richness found no difference in species richness between a UK site with wildlife-friendly hedge management and three control sites.
Seven studies from the UK and Switzerland, five replicated, found that some species studied increased in relation to managed hedges or were more likely to be found in managed hedges, compared to other habitats. Two investigated several interventions at once. 
One replicated study found that species that showed positive responses to hedge management in some regions showed weak or negative responses in other parts of the UK. Four studies from the UK found that some species declined or showed no response to wildlife-friendly management of hedges.

Hedges are used to separate fields but are also extremely important habitats on many farms, providing heterogeneity in the landscape and resources not found elsewhere. In much of Europe, hedges are being removed as field sizes are increased, potentially reducing the biodiversity value of farmland. Planting new hedges may mitigate this change, but may be both costly and unattractive to farmers, as they can reduce the efficiency of farming.

187: Plant wild bird seed or cover mixture
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
The loss of food supplies, especially seeds, is thought to be a key driver of farmland bird declines. Plants that provide seed food for wild birds include maize, sunflower and cereals. They can be planted in blocks or 6 m wide strips and are left unharvested. These plants can also provide cover for nesting birds or juveniles and are sometimes called wild bird cover, ‘game crops’ or ‘game cover crops’.
 

Key Messages:

All seven studies (based on five replicated experiments and a review) that investigated species richness or diversity were from the UK and found that fields or farms with wild bird cover had higher bird diversity than those without, or that more species were found in wild bird cover than in surrounding habitats.
Thirty-two studies out of 33 from the UK and North America that examined abundance and population data, found that bird densities, abundances, nesting densities or use of wild bird cover was higher than in other habitats or management regimes, or that sites with wild bird cover had higher populations than those without. These studies included a systematic review and seven randomised, replicated and controlled studies. Some studies found that this was the case across all species or all species studied, while others found that only a subset showed a preference. Four studies investigated other interventions at the same time. Thirteen of the 33 studies (all replicated and from Europe and the USA), found that bird populations or densities were similar on wild bird cover and other habitats, that some species were not associated with wild bird cover or that birds rarely used wild bird cover. 
Three studies from the UK and Canada, two replicated, found higher productivities for some or all species monitored on wild bird cover, compared to other habitats. Two replicated and controlled studies from Canada and France found no differences in reproductive success between wild bird cover and other habitats for some or all species studied.
Three studies from Europe and the USA investigated survival, with two finding higher survival of grey partridge Perdix perdix released on wild bird cover or of artificial nests in some cover crops. The third found that survival of grey partridge was lower on farms with wild bird cover, possibly due to high predation.
Five studies from the UK, three replicated, found that some wild bird cover crops were preferred to others. A randomised, replicated and controlled study and a review from the UK found that the landscape surrounding wild bird cover and their configuration within it affected use by birds.

188: Protect bird nests using electric fencing
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
For fencing to be effective it has to physically prevent predators from entering an area, which is likely to be very difficult for species such as racoons Procyon lotor. Electric fences may offer a solution as animals will be unlikely to attempt to climb through them after receiving electric shocks.

Key Messages:

One before-and-after study from the UK found an increase in tern numbers after the erection of an electric fence, whilst a study from the USA found an increase in the number of nests.
Five studies from the USA found higher survival or productivity at wader or seabird colonies with electric fencing, compared to areas without fencing, although one study found that hatching rates were no different, whilst nesting success was only higher in one of two years.
One study from the USA found lower predation by mammalian predators inside electric fence exclosures, whilst predation by birds was higher.

Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Flowering plants are sown in strips or blocks, for bees and other flower-visiting insects. Nectar flower mixture can include agricultural varieties of flowering plants such as clovers. Increased numbers of insects may then provide food for more birds.
 

Key Messages:

Two replicated and controlled studies from the UK (one randomised) and a European review out of seven studies captured found that more birds used nectar/wildflower strips than crops or land under other management. Two studies of a replicated and controlled experiment in the UK found that no more birds used nectar/wildflower strips in winter than used land under other management.
A replicated, controlled study from Switzerland found that Eurasian skylarks Alauda arvensis were more likely to nest in patches of fields sown with annual weeds than in crops, and were less likely to abandon nests in these patches.

Background information and definitions:
This intervention allows vegetation in field margins to regenerate naturally, without planting, although it can involve subsequent mowing. The margins are not fertilised and only spot-treated with herbicides if necessary.
 

Key Messages:

A replicated, controlled study from the USA found that three sparrow species found on uncultivated margins were not found on mown field edges. A replicated study from Canada found fewer species in uncultivated margins than in hedges or in trees planted as windbreaks.
Three replicated studies from the USA and UK, one controlled, found that some birds were associated with uncultivated margins, or that birds were more abundant on margins than on other habitats. One study found that these effects were very weak. Four replicated studies (two of the same experiment) from the UK, two controlled, found that uncultivated margins contained similar numbers of birds in winter, or that several species studied did not show associations with margins.
A replicated, controlled study from the UK found that yellowhammers Emberiza citrinella used uncultivated margins more than crops in early summer, but use fell in uncut margins in late summer. Cut margins however, were used more than other habitat types late in summer.
A replicated study from the UK found high rates of survival for grey partridge Perdix perdix released in margins.

Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves planting field margins with a grass-rich seed mixture. It includes ‘floristically-enhanced' grass margins available under the English Higher Level Stewardship scheme. The margins are not fertilised and only spot-treated with herbicides if necessary.
 

Key Messages:

One replicated controlled study from the USA found that there were more species in fields bordered by margins than unbordered fields. Two replicated studies from the UK, one with paired sites, found no effect of field margins on species richness. A replicated, controlled study from the UK found that more birds and more species used sown strips in fields than the fields themselves, but even more used field margins.
Nine studies from the UK and USA, seven replicated, two controlled, found more positive population trends, higher populations or strong habitat associations for some or all species for sites with grass margins to fields. One study investigated multiple interventions. Three replicated studies from the UK found that grass field margins did not have a positive effect on populations of some or all bird species investigated.
Both studies that examined habitat use (one replicated, both from the UK) found that species used margins more than other habitats. A randomised, replicated and controlled study from the UK found that birds used cut margins more than uncut margins during winter but less than other management regimes during summer. The authors argue that management type is more important than the seed mix used to sow the margins.
A replicated study from the UK found that grey partridge Perdix perdix had smaller broods in grass margins than other habitat types.

192: Use mowing techniques to reduce chick mortality
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
During mowing and harvesting operations, ground-nesting birds frequently remain in long grass or crops for as long as possible. If mowing/harvest occurs from the outside of the field inwards, this behaviour can leave the birds trapped in the centre of the field and killed as the last patch is harvested. Adjusting mowing techniques, for example starting from the inside of the field, can therefore allow chicks to escape into field margins.
 

Key Messages:

A review from the UK found a large increase in corncrake Crex crex populations in the UK following a scheme to delay mowing and promote corncrake-friendly mowing techniques.
One replicated controlled study from the UK and a review from the UK found lower levels of mortality of corncrakes and Eurasian skylark Alauda arvensis when wildlife-friendly mowing techniques were used, compared to other techniques.

193: Leave refuges in fields during harvest 
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
During mowing and harvesting operations, ground-nesting birds frequently remain in long grass or crops for as long as possible. If mowing/harvest occurs from the outside of the field inwards, this behaviour can leave the birds trapped in the centre of the field and killed as the last patch is harvested. However, if unharvested refuges are left in fields then it is possible that chicks and adults will remain in them and survive.
 

Key Messages:

A replicated study in France found that fewer gamebirds came into contact with mowing machinery when refuges were left in fields than when they were not left.
A review from the UK found that Eurasian skylarks Alauda arvensis did not nest at higher densities in uncut refuges than in the rest of the fields.

195: Relocate nests at harvest time to reduce nestling mortality
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
If nests are likely to be destroyed by machinery during harvest or mowing, it may be possible to move them and then return them after the danger has passed. If nests are extremely likely to be destroyed during harvest or mowing then it may be best to remove the chicks and hand-rear them. Studies on the effects of this intervention are found in the chapter on captive breeding and hand-rearing.
 

Key Messages:
A replicated controlled study from Spain found that clutches that were temporarily removed from fields during harvest and then replaced had higher hatching and fledging rates than control clutches. Effects were greater on clutches that were older when moved.

Background information and definitions:
Most agri-environment schemes aim to compensate farmers for the cost of conservation management on their land, irrespective of the outcomes. The Netherlands, however, also has a scheme where farmers are paid directly, based on the number of breeding bird pairs on their land.
 

Key Messages:

One of two replicated and controlled studies from the Netherlands found that farms with per clutch payments held slightly higher breeding densities of waders, but not higher overall numbers than control farms. One study found no population effects over three years. 
A replicated and controlled study found higher hatching success on farms with payment schemes than control farms.

Background information and definitions:
Field corners can be taken out of management on both arable and livestock farms. This can either involve simply not managing or planting corners with grass (see also ‘Plant grass buffer strips’).
 

Key Messages:
A replicated study in the UK found that overwinter survival of grey partridge Perdix perdix was higher where field corners were taken out of management than on other sites for one of three winters. There was no relationship with the intervention and brood size, the ratio of young to old birds or density changes.

202: Use ‘mosaic management’
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Mosaic management is a Dutch agri-environment scheme that, rather than concentrating on individual farms, attempts to coordinate management across groups of farms. Interventions include delayed and staggered mowing, refuge strips and nest protection and aim to provide suitable foraging habitat for wader chicks throughout the year.
 

Key Messages:

A replicated, controlled before-and-after study from the Netherlands found that northern lapwing Vanellus vanellus population trends changed from decreases to increases following the introduction of mosaic management. Three other waders did not show such a response.
A replicated, paired sites study in the Netherlands found that black-tailed godwits Limosa limosa had higher productivity under mosaic management than other management types, and nests were less likely to be trampled by livestock.

203: Leave overwinter stubbles
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
A 2008 literature review and analysis of the Environmental Stewardship programme, particularly Entry Level Stewardship in the UK (Vickery et al. 2008), suggested that, for Eurasian skylarks Alauda arvensis, approximately 0.1 km² of stubble/km2 would be needed to prevent population declines. The authors also suggest that having these patches over 1 km apart would maximise winter use.

Key Messages:

The three studies from the UK (one replicated) that report population-level changes found positive effects of over-winter stubble provision, but all investigated multiple interventions at once.
Eight studies from the UK, including a systematic review, found that at least some species or groups of farmland birds were positively associated with over-winter stubbles, or were found on stubbles. Three studies investigated multiple interventions without separating the effects of each. Two studies reported that seed-eating birds in particular were more abundant on stubbles.
One of the eight studies found that no more positive responses to stubbles were found than would be expected by chance. A replicated, randomised and controlled study from the UK found that 22 of 23 species did not preferentially use stubbles compared to cover crops. A replicated study from the UK found that the area of stubble in a site was negatively related to grey partridge Perdix perdix brood size.
Five studies from the UK, four replicated, found that stubble management affected use by birds. Some species or groups were more common on cut stubbles, some on uncut and some showed preferences for barley over wheat. One study found that only Eurasian skylarks Alauda arvensis were more common on stubbles under agri-environment schemes, and only on highly prescriptive schemes. One study found that all seed-eating species were more abundant on stubbles under agri-environment schemes in one of two regions studied.

Three studies from Sweden and the UK, two replicated and controlled, found population increases after the start of spring sowing, or higher populations on sites with spring-sown cereals, compared to sites with winter cereals. A before-and-after study from the UK found that ten species did not increase after spring sowing began. No species decreased. A replicated, controlled paired sites study from Sweden found that the benefits of spring-sowing decreased with the proportion of autumn-sown crops in the surrounding area.

Background information and definitions:
Planting more than one crop in each field increases habitat heterogeneity at a smaller scale than increasing crop diversity at a landscape scale (see ‘Increase crop diversity’). Heterogeneity is thought to be key for increasing farmland biodiversity and so planting multiple crops may help birds of different functional groups to use a single field.

210: Revert arable land to permanent grassland
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be ineffective or harmful
Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves changing from an arable crop to sown agricultural grassland, to be used for grazing or silage. It is not the same as the creation of species-rich or other semi-natural grasslands, which is discussed in the chapter on habitat restoration and creation.
See also ‘Provide or retain set-aside areas’ for some studies where non-rotational set-aside land was sown with grass, but managed as set-aside rather than as permanent agricultural grassland.
 

Key Messages:

All five studies looking at the effects of reverting arable land to grassland found no clear benefit to birds. The studies monitored birds or grey partridges in the UK and wading birds in Denmark (4). They included three replicated controlled trials.
One of the studies, a controlled before-and-after study from the UK, showed that grey partridge numbers fell significantly following the reversion of arable fields to grassland.

211: Reduce tillage
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Conventional ploughing uses a mould-board plough, cultivating to a depth of around 20 cm. This can damage soil structure and potentially reduce the abundance of soil invertebrates, a food source for many farmland birds. This intervention includes various methods to reduce the depth or intensity of ploughing, such as layered cultivation, non-inversion tillage and conservation tillage. It also includes stopping tillage altogether, sometimes called 'no till'.
 

Key Messages:

Four replicated and controlled studies from North America and Canada and the UK and two literature reviews found that some or all bird groups had higher species richness or diversity on reduced-tillage fields, compared to conventional field in some areas. Two replicated and controlled studies from Canada and the UK and a review found that some measures of diversity were lower, or no different, on reduced-tillage fields, compared to conventional fields.
Five replicated and controlled studies from the USA and Europe, a small study and two reviews all found that some bird species are found at higher densities on fields with reduced tillage than conventional fields. Five replicated and controlled studies from the USA, Canada and Europe, and a review found that some or all species were found at similar or lower densities on reduced-tillage fields compared to conventional fields, with one finding that preferences decreased over time (possibly due to extreme weather) and another finding that preferences were only found in spring. 
Two controlled studies (one replicated) and a review found evidence for higher productivity, nesting success or earlier laying on reduced tillage fields, compared to conventional fields. One controlled study found no evidence for greater success or larger chicks on reduced-tillage fields.

213: Leave uncropped, cultivated margins or plots, including lapwing and stone curlew plots
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Lapwing and stone curlew plots are cultivated plots or strips that are left undrilled to encourage northern lapwings Vanellus vanellus and stone curlews (Eurasian thick-knees) Burhinus oedicnemus to nest successfully. They are normally &gt;2 ha in size and different from 'skylark plots' (see separate section), which are much smaller and usually created in groups. Similar interventions include set-aside, which involves fields that are not cultivated at all. 
 

Key Messages:

Two studies and two reviews examined population-level effects of uncropped margins or plots. A before-and-after study from the UK and two reviews found an increase in Eurasian thick-knee Burhinus oedicnemus numbers following a scheme that promoted plots (amongst other interventions); a replicated study from the UK found no effect of plots on grey partridge density changes.
Four studies (three replicated) and a review from the UK found that at least one species was associated with lapwing plots or used them for foraging or nesting. One replicated study from the UK found that 11 species were not associated with plots; another found that fewer birds used the plots than cropland in two out of three UK regions.
Two of the three studies that examined productivity (one replicated) found that nesting success of birds was higher in fallow fields or lapwing plots than in crops. A replicated study from the UK found that grey partridge Perdix perdix productivity was not related to the amount of lapwing plots on a site and that the proportion of young partridges in the population was lower on sites with lots of cultivated fallow plots.

214: Create skylark plots for bird conservation
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Eurasian skylarks Alauda arvensis require short vegetation to nest in and skylark plots are small (usually 4–16 m2) undrilled patches within cereal fields that provide this, with little impact on overall yield. They are similar to lapwing plots (see above) but much smaller.
 

Key Messages:

A before-and-after study found an increase in Eurasian skylark Alauda arvensis population on a farm after the creation of skylark plots; a replicated, controlled study from the UK found higher densities of skylarks on fields with plots, compared to those without. No other studies investigated population-level effects.
Two UK studies, one replicated and controlled, found that skylark productivity was higher in plots or in fields with plots than in controls. One replicated and controlled study from Switzerland found no differences in productivity between territories that included plots and those that did not.
Two replicated studies (one controlled) from Denmark and Switzerland found that skylark plots were used by skylarks more than expected. A replicated and controlled study from the UK found that seed-eating songbirds did not use skylark plots more than surrounding crops.

Effectiveness rating: Likely to be ineffective or harmful
Background information and definitions:
Planting cereals in widely spaced rows can increase the proportion of habitat in the farmland that can be used by birds, as spaces between rows can be left fallow or planted with grass or legumes.
 

Key Messages:

A replicated and controlled study from the UK found that planting cereals in wide-spaced rows “offered benefits over conventional wheat for Eurasian skylarks, but details were not given. Another replicated and controlled study from the UK found that fields with wide-spaced rows had fewer skylark nests than control or skylark plot fields.

217: Create beetle banks
Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Beetle banks are grassy mounds, about 2 m wide, that run across the middle of large arable fields. They are intended to provide habitat, especially during winter, for predatory insects such as beetles and spiders and therefore could also provide foraging habitats for birds.
 

Key Messages:

A small UK study found that a site with beetle banks had increasing populations of rare or declining species, although several other interventions were used on this site. A literature review from the UK found that grey partridge Perdix perdix populations were far larger on sites with beetle banks and other interventions than on other farms. Two replicated studies from the UK also investigated population-level effects: one found that no bird species were strongly associated with beetle banks; the second found no relationship between beetle banks and grey partridge population density trends.
A UK literature review found that two bird species nested in beetle banks and that some species were more likely to forage in them than others. A study in the UK found that one of two species used beetle banks more than expected. The other used them less than other agri-environment options.

Reducing the intensity of grassland management involves one or more of: reducing or stopping the use of fertilisers, herbicides and pesticides; delaying the mowing date; reducing the number of cuttings taken.
 

Key Messages:

Four replicated trials and a review, of seven studies in total, found that some or all birds monitored were more abundant or foraged more on grasslands with lower management intensity than on conventionally managed agricultural grasslands.

220: Reduce grazing intensity 
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Overgrazing is responsible for the degradation of habitats across the world, being especially damaging in arid environments, where the removal of vegetation can quickly lead to soil erosion. Reducing grazing intensity may reduce the damage to vegetation and can also help reduce disturbance to birds and accidental loss of nests.
 

Key Messages:

Nine studies from the USA and the UK, one replicated and controlled, found increases in populations of some species on fields with reduced grazing, or increased use of such fields by birds. Three of the studies used multiple interventions at once. Five studies from Europe, four replicated and controlled, found that some or all species were no more numerous on fields with reduced grazing, compared to intensively-grazed fields. One paired sites study from the UK found that black grouse Tetrao tetrix populations increased at reduced grazing sites (and declined elsewhere), but that large areas of reduced grazing had lower densities of female grouse.
A before-and-after study from the USA found that the number of species on plots with reduced grazing increased over time. A replicated, controlled study from four countries in Europe found no differences in the number of species on sites with low-intensity or high-intensity grazing. 
One replicated trial in the UK found that some bird groups preferred grassland short in winter (grazing effect simulated by mowing), and others preferred it long (unmown to simulate removal of livestock). Frequency and timing of the simulated grazing did not alter this preference.

Background information and definitions:
Vegetation height is important in determining the value of a grassland to wildlife, with short vegetation allowing birds access to the ground for foraging and potentially reducing predation risk. However, high vegetation can provide more complex environments and more habitats (see Raise mowing height on permanent grassland).

Vegetation height is important in determining the value of a grassland to wildlife. High vegetation can provide more complex environments and more habitats, but short vegetation can allow birds access to the ground which can help foraging, and can reduce the risk of predation (see Provide short grass for waders).
 

Key Messages:

A review from the UK  found that raising mowing height may have increased productivity of Eurasian skylarks, but not sufficiently to maintain the local population.
A randomised, replicated and controlled study from the UK found that no more foraging birds were attracted to plots with raised mowing heights, compared to plots with shorter grass.

223: Delay haying/mowing
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Early-season, mechanised mowing is thought to be responsible for declines in the UK and elsewhere of species such as the corncrake Crex crex, with chicks killed and nests destroyed by mowing machinery. Delaying mowing until after chicks can escape is therefore a part of many agri-environment schemes.
 

Key Messages:

Two reviews from the UK found that the population of corncrakes Crex crex increased following the implementation of two initiatives to encourage farmers to delay mowing (and provide cover and use corncrake-friendly techniques).
A replicated and controlled paired sites study from the Netherlands found no evidence that waders and other birds were more abundant in fields with delayed mowing, compared to paired controls. A replicated and controlled before-and-after study from the Netherlands found that fields with delayed mowing held more birds than controls, but did so before the start of the scheme. Population trends did not differ between treatments.
A replicated, controlled study from the USA found that destruction of nests by machinery was lower and late-season nesting higher in late-cut fields, compared with early-cut fields.

224: Leave uncut rye grass in silage fields for birds	
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
In the UK, seed-eating songbirds have declined across farmland, probably in part because of a lack of winter food. Rye grass Lolium perenne seeds are a potential food source, but cutting rye grass fields multiple times a year for silage removes seed heads before they can ripen and so reduces the food available to birds the following winter. Leaving fields or plots uncut may therefore provide valuable overwinter food.
 

Key Messages:

Two reviews from the UK found that leaving rye grass uncut, or with only a single cut, benefited seed-eating birds and two replicated, controlled studies from the UK found that seed-eating birds were more abundant on uncut plots.
Two replicated and controlled studies and a review, all from the UK, found that seed-eating birds were more abundant on uncut and ungrazed plots than on uncut and grazed plots.

229: Maintain traditional water meadows
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Water meadows are areas of grazing land or hay meadow that have carefully controlled water levels to keep the soil damp. In Europe they provide valuable breeding habitats for waders and other biodiversity. The studies below describe instances where multiple interventions have been used to maintain meadows. When the effects of multiple interventions, such as raising water levels and adding foot drains, can be separated, they are discussed under the relevant interventions in ‘Threat: Natural system modifications’. The creation of new water meadows and the restoration of degraded ones are discussed in ‘Habitat restoration and creation’.
 

Key Messages:

A replicated study from the UK found that northern lapwing and common redshank populations increased on nature reserves managed to maintain water meadows. Two replicated studies from the Netherlands found that there were more waders or birds overall on specially managed meadows or 12.5 ha plots including several management interventions than on conventional fields, but one study found that these differences were present before the management scheme was introduced and the other found no differences between individual fields under different management. 
A replicated study from the UK found that common snipe decreased on nature reserves managed to maintain water meadows and a replicated before-and-after study from the Netherlands found that wader population trends on specially managed meadows were no different to those on conventionally-managed meadows.
A replicated study from the UK found that lapwing populations on three of four water meadow sites managed for conservation did not have high enough productivity to maintain population levels. All three sites were judged deficient in at least one management category.

236: Exclude grazers from semi-natural habitats 
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Whilst grazing can be used to maintain early-successional habitats (see ‘Natural System Modifications’), this may not always be desirable. In addition, over-grazing can be a severe problem and whilst a reduction in stocking densities (see ‘Reduce grazing intensity’) can reduce damage, sometimes livestock need to be excluded to allow vegetation to recover.
Excluding wild grazers and browsers is discussed in ‘Threat: Invasive alien and other problematic species’.
 

Key Messages:

Two replicated (one controlled) studies from the USA found higher species richnesses on sites with grazers excluded; a replicated and controlled study from Argentina found lower species richness in ungrazed sites and a study from the USA found no difference.
Seven studies from the USA (three controlled, two replicated) found that overall bird abundance, or the abundances of some species were higher in sites with grazers excluded; seven studies from the USA and Argentina found that overall abundance or the abundances of some species were lower on sites without grazers, or did not differ between treatments.
Three studies from the USA investigated productivity and found it higher in sites with grazers excluded. In one study this difference was only found on improved, not unimproved pastures.

244: Scare birds from fish farms
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be ineffective or harmful
Background information and definitions:
Predation by birds at aquaculture facilities (e.g. fish ponds, raceways and shellfish farms) can cause significant commercial loss (Draulans 1987). With increasing protective wildlife legislation, demand for non-lethal, environmentally safe methods of bird exclusion and scaring have increased. Most fish farmers now rely primarily on non-lethal techniques to accomplish control (i.e. to reduce abundance or exclude fish-eating birds in and around the vicinity of fish farms). Control efforts may be optimized by compiling evidence relating to deterrent or exclusion device efficacy, taking into account costs, practicality of use and the possibility of developing integrated strategies (i.e. combining more than one deterrent method). Avian deterrents can be categorised as auditory, visual, chemical, exclusion, habitat modification and lethal (Bishop et al. 2003). Lethal deterrents are not considered here (except where, very rarely, used as part of an integrated approach).

Key Messages:

One before-and-after study from Israel found that the population of pygmy cormorants in the area increased after birds were scared away from fish farms, possibly due to lower persecution.
One of two studies that examined fish stocks found that fewer fish were taken from a farm when heron distress calls were played. The other study, a literature review, found no evidence for the effects of scaring birds on fish stocks.
Two replicated studies from Belgium and Australia found that using foot patrols to disturb birds from fish farms did not reduce the number of birds present or fish consumption.
Ten of eleven studies from across the world, three controlled, found evidence that playing distress calls or using other acoustic deterrents (some with flashes of light) reduced the number of birds at fish farms, or changed bird behaviours. One of these involved underwater broadcasting. One study found effects were only temporary and five found that birds became habituated to noises. Four studies, one replicated and controlled, two before-and-after, found that acoustic deterrents were not effective in scaring birds.
Five of seven studies, one controlled, found evidence that visual deterrents (including inflatable ‘Scarey Man’ scarecrows) reduced the number of birds at fish farms. Three found evidence for habituation to deterrents and three studies found no evidence that visual deterrents were effective. 
Two studies examined other deterrents, finding that trained raptors were effective but that the effects of helicopters and ultra-light aircraft were either inconclusive or very temporary.

Key Messages:

One controlled study from the USA investigated the effects of harassment on fish predation, and found there were fewer double-crested cormorants Phalacrocorax auritus on, and fewer fish were taken from, fish ponds near roosts which were harassed, compared with undisturbed roosts.
A review found that there was a reduction in the number of cormorants foraging near roosts after night-time disturbance. Four studies, two replicated, from the USA and Israel, found that cormorants moved away from roosts where they were disturbed at night. One study found that this effect was only temporary.

250: Use ‘mussel socks’ to prevent birds from attacking shellfish
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
‘Mussel socks’ are protective netting materials designed to reduce predation by birds on shellfish. The socks are made from polypropylene material with a biodegradable layer sown around it. The second layer (which has smaller mesh openings) prevents mussels from migrating towards the outside of the sock in order to filter feed and so reduces the threat from predation. The mussels are buffered between these layers over winter until the following spring when the protective layer decomposes and allows mussel growth to continue unhindered.
 

Key Messages:

262: Bury or isolate power lines to reduce incidental bird mortality
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
In 2008, there were an estimated 65 million km of medium- and high-voltage power lines in use across the world, with the network growing at perhaps 5% a year (Jenkins, Smallie, & Diamond 2010). These power lines are a significant threat to many species of birds, with both direct collision mortality and electrocution (from touching multiple wires at once) killing birds. As well as causing potentially unsustainable mortality, these collisions can be economically costly, especially when large-bodied species are involved.
Species are most at risk if they are large and heavy, with poor eyesight and limited manoeuvrability (Jenkins, Smallie, & Diamond 2010), but some relatively small species, such as gamebirds, are also very vulnerable (Bevanger & Brųseth 2001). Appropriate planning of power lines to avoid high-risk areas (such as those between feeding and roosting grounds) and to follow features such as roads may well reduce bird mortalities (Bevanger 1994), but in many cases wires are already in potentially dangerous locations and techniques are needed to mitigate the damage they cause.

263: Remove earth wires to reduce incidental bird mortality
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Earth wires act to protect transmission wires against lightning, by dispersing excessive electricity. They are normally positioned either above or below the transmission wires, increasing the vertical height of wires and therefore the chances of collisions. In addition, earth wires tend to be thinner than transmission wires and so less visible, which, when they are positioned above transmission wires, increases the chances of collisions as birds climb to avoid the transmission wires.

265: Mark power lines to reduce incidental bird mortality
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Birds may fly into power lines accidentally, either because they do not see them at all, or because they see them too late to react; this is a particular issue for large species that cannot change direction quickly. Increasing power line visibility by marking them is therefore frequently proposed as a way of reducing collision-induced mortalities without the need to remove earth wires or bury transmission wires.
 

Key Messages:

A total of eight studies and two literature reviews from across the world found that marking power lines led to significant reductions in collision rates or dangerous flight behaviour (i.e. approaching close to power lines) in cranes Grus spp., mute swans Cygnus olor and other bird species. 
All markers except thin, black plastic strips or neoprene crosses were effective, with no differences in effectiveness between Bird Flight Diverters (BFDs: brightly coloured plastic spirals) and static fibreglass plates and only a small possible difference between BFDs and ‘flappers’ (moving markers).

Perhaps the most commonly used intervention in response to declining species is to provide legal protection for the species. This alone may be enough to protect a species or population, but if not, de facto or ‘on-the-ground’ protection may also be required to ensure people abide by the law.
 

Key Messages:

Six out of seven before-and-after studies and two literature reviews/meta-analyses found evidence that legislation protects bird populations. 
Five studies in Europe, Indonesia and across the world found increased population levels of vultures, raptors, cranes and cockatoos following protective legislation (amongst other interventions). However, one found populations of raptors declined soon after. The literature review also found two cases of limited or no impact of legislation.
Two before-and-after studies from Denmark and the USA and Canada and the meta-analysis found increased estimated survival of falcons, ducks and parrots with stricter protection, but not necessarily population-level responses.
A meta-analysis found decreased harvest of parrots in areas with stricter protection regimes, but a before-and-after study found no evidence for reduced shearwater harvest with legislation.

272: Increase ‘on-the-ground’ protection to reduce unsustainable levels of exploitation
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Whilst providing legal protection for species may be effective on its own, it is possible that those exploiting a species or population will not stop unless there is ‘on- the-ground’ or de facto protection – wardens or guards at a site preventing exploitation. However, increasing such protection is expensive and may be unpopular with local people if it is done in an insensitive way.
 

Key Messages:

Two before-and-after studies from Central America and Europe found increases in recruitment and population levels following either stricter anti-poaching measures or stricter protection and the stationing a warden on an island.
However, the Central American study found that recruitment increases were only maintained for as long as the intensive effort was continued.

274: Use education programmes and local engagement to help reduce persecution or exploitation of species
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
If a community relies on exploiting bird populations then they may well want to exploit the population sustainably, to ensure it persists and can be exploited in the future. However, exactly how to exploit a population sustainably may not be clear, and so education programmes may be useful in reducing over-exploitation.
Other, more general education programmes are discussed in ‘Education and community development’.
 

Key Messages:

Five out of six studies from across the world found increases in bird populations or decreases in mortality following education programmes. In all but one case, education was one of several interventions employed. 
A replicated before-and-after study from Canada also found that there was a significant shift in local peoples’ attitudes to conservation and exploited species following educational programmes.
One study from Venezuela found no evidence for decreases in yellow-shouldered parrot Amazona barbadensis poaching following an educational programme in local schools. The authors argue that the benefits would probably be seen later in the project.

276: Mark eggs to reduce their appeal to egg collectors
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Egg collecting involves removing eggs from nests, blowing them to remove the contents and presenting the eggs in a collection. This practice can be extremely damaging for some slow-reproducing species (Ewins 1997) and is made more so by the greater value of, and demand for, rarer species’ eggs. This has led to the prohibition of egg collecting in many countries, but the practice still continues.
Marking eggs in a non-damaging way may reduce the desirability of eggs because collectors are interested in eggs for their aesthetic appeal.

277: Relocate nestlings to reduce poaching
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Nestlings are particularly vulnerable to exploitation, as they cannot fly and are confined to nests. This is especially problematic with species such as parrots that are exploited for the pet trade, as nestlings can be easily raised in captivity and sold on. Moving nestlings into safer areas may reduce the threat of exploitation, but is likely to be expensive or time-consuming. In the study below, chicks were taken from nests overnight and then returned in the morning, something that is only likely to be possible for species under very intense management.

A replicated before-and-after study in Venezuela found significant decreases in poaching rate and increased fledging rates of parrots after wild chicks were moved into police premises each night.

278: Use wildlife refuges to reduce hunting disturbance
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Wildlife refuges are a type of protected area where hunting is prohibited. Often situated near hunting areas, they can be effective both by reducing the number of birds shot, but also in reducing the disturbance to non-target species. Other interventions designed to reduce disturbance are discussed in ‘Threat: Disturbance’.
 

Key Messages:

Three studies from the USA and Europe found that bird densities were higher in refuges where hunting was prohibited, compared to areas with hunting. In addition, two studies found that more birds used hunting-free areas during the open season and on hunting days.
No studies investigated the population-level impacts of these refuges.

279: Introduce voluntary ‘maximum shoot distances’
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
The probability of successfully killing a bird when shooting decreases with distance from the bird. If hunting is regulated by ‘bag limits’ (i.e. the number of birds individuals can harvest), then shooting at birds from a long distance may be detrimental, as many birds are hit but do not die instantly. These escape and die later but are not collected and so are not included in a bag limit. This means that actual mortality from hunting is considerably higher than the set bag limits.
 

Key Messages:
A replicated, randomised before-and-after study from Denmark found that significantly fewer pink-footed geese Anser brachyrhynchus were wounded but not killed, following the implementation of a voluntary maximum shooting distance.

280: Provide ‘sacrificial’ grasslands to reduce the impact of wild geese on crops
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
There have been dramatic increases in many species of goose in recent decades (Madsen et al. 1999) and this has led to increasing conflict with farmers, as many species graze on arable land, potentially ruining crops. One potential solution, to reduce conflict whilst maintaining the populations of geese is to provide ‘sacrificial grasslands’ – areas set-aside for geese to feed on, which keeps them away from agricultural fields.
To be useful, such areas need to be more attractive than neighbouring fields. Interventions detailing specific management practices are mainly described in ‘Threat: Natural system modifications’, whilst the studies below describe whether the provision of sacrificial grasslands actually affects the distribution of geese in an area.

Key Messages:
Two studies in the UK found that managing grasslands for geese increased the number grazing there. However, both found that the birds were moving within a relatively small area (i.e. within the study sites) and therefore the grasslands may not reduce conflict with farmers.

Background information and definitions:
Reduce fisheries bycatch
Commercial fisheries have expanded dramatically across the world since the 1960s, and are having increasing direct impacts on seabirds worldwide. Commercial longline, trawl and gillnet fisheries are responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of seabirds each year, threatening the survival of a number of species, especially albatrosses.
Longline fleets set more than one billion hooks each year and up to 300,000 seabirds, including 100,000 albatrosses, are killed on longlines as they scavenge for bait and offal and are accidentally caught on the fishhooks and drowned. This form of bycatch is now the single greatest threat to albatrosses. All 22 albatross species are classed as globally threatened or Near Threatened.
Trawl fisheries are also a threat, with birds killed when they are hit by the powerful cables that attach the trawl net to the vessel, and by being entangled by the net as they scavenge for fish.
Gillnets – static curtains of netting designed to entangle fish by their gills – can be responsible for the accidental entanglement of large numbers of pelagic birds. Despite a ban on their use in the high seas, commercial gillnet fisheries continue to operate in territorial and coastal waters around the world, where they pose a significant threat to numerous seabird populations, especially ‘pursuit-diving’ species, such as divers (loons), grebes, sea ducks, auks and cormorants.
This bycatch is extremely detrimental to bird populations, but is also expensive for fishermen, as each bait taken by a bird is one lost for catching fish. Methods to prevent bycatch are therefore also likely to increase profits. Both conservation-based and commercial fisheries organisations are now working together to try and uncover which methods are the most effective and then to ensure that every boat employs them.
A literature review in 2000 (Melvin & Robertson 2000) argued that much of the research into bycatch is confused and non-standardised, with different methodologies being used and experiments often uncontrolled. Bycatch can often vary hugely from one voyage to the next and from year to year, due to movements of birds and changes in fish stocks, but also because of factors, such as the phase of the moon, which alter the effectiveness of, for example, setting lines at night. Evidence from single-year comparisons or uncontrolled tests therefore need to be treated with caution.

283: Set longlines at night to reduce seabird bycatch
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Most seabirds feed during the day and so longlines set at night may catch fewer birds. Some species, however, do hunt at night and so night-setting is unlikely to be an effective mitigation measure. An adequate knowledge of bycatch species’ ecology is therefore important in determining whether to promote night-setting.
Many of the studies in this section do not explicitly say whether night-setting was done for conservation purposes or not. However, given the valuable information they contain, we have included them below.
 

Key Messages:

Six out of eight studies from fisheries around the world found lower rates of seabird bycatch on longlines set at night, compared with during the day, or with previously collected data. However, effects seemed to depend on the species caught.
Two studies found higher rates of bycatch on night-set longlines, due to high numbers of white-chinned petrels Procellaria aequinoctialis or northern fulmars Fulmarus glacialis being caught at night.

284: Turn deck lights off during night-time setting of longlines to reduce bycatch
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Birds might be attracted to deck lights on fishing boats either to use them to forage, or because birds are generally attracted to lights at night (see ‘Threat: Pollution’ for interventions designed to reduce the threat of light pollution). In either case, birds may be vulnerable, so turning off the lights may reduce mortality.
 

Key Messages:
A single replicated and controlled study in the South Atlantic found significantly lower bycatch rates when deck lights were turned off during line setting at night.

285: Use streamer lines to reduce seabird bycatch on longlines
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Streamer lines are long lines attached to a high point on the stern of a fishing boat so that they fall slowly to the surface of the water. On the 25 m or so of the lines, multiple ‘streamers’ are attached: strands of often brightly coloured line attached on a swivel to the main line. These move in the wind and interfere with birds attempting to reach the baited longline below. Streamer lines can vary in effectiveness with design, and the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) and some other fisheries organisations have specific recommendations on their design. For example, boats in CCAMLR fishing areas must use a line at least 150 m long, attached 4.5 m above the water, with five sets of streamers attached at 5 m interval (Miller et al. 2003).
Multiple streamer lines may also be more effective than a single streamer, and how the streamer is deployed is thought to be important: if the wind moves the streamer so it is not directly over the longline then it is unlikely to have an effect.

Key Messages:

A total of eight studies and two literature reviews from coastal and pelagic fisheries across the world found strong evidence for reduced seabird bycatch on longlines when streamer lines were used.  
A replicated, controlled trial from the sub-Antarctic Indian Ocean found no reduction in bycatch rates when using streamer lines, whilst five studies were inconclusive, uncontrolled or had weak evidence for reductions. 
The effect of streamer lines appears to vary between seabird species: northern fulmars Fulmarus glacialis were consistently caught at lower rates when streamers were used but shearwaters Puffinus spp. and white-chinned petrels Procellaria aequinoctialis were caught at similar rates with and without streamers in one study each.
The three studies that investigated the use of multiple streamer lines all found that fewer birds were caught when two streamer lines were used, compared to one, with even fewer caught when three were used.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Large hooks may be more difficult for birds to swallow and so may reduce bycatch rates. A correlative study found a negative relationship between hook size and bycatch rate (Moreno et al. 1996).  However, large hooks may be more likely to hook birds through the body or wings (‘foul hooking’).

288: Set lines underwater to reduce seabird bycatch
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Most birds caught on longlines are caught when the lines are being set, after the bait has been attached to hooks but before they have sunk out of the reach of surface-feeding birds. If lines are set underwater then it may reduce the time they are available to birds and therefore reduce bycatch.
 

Key Messages:

Four replicated and controlled studies and a literature review in Norway, South Africa and the North Pacific found reductions in northern fulmar Fulmarus glacialis, albatross and petrel bycatch rates when using an underwater setting funnel. Although one found a disproportionate number of albatross were caught during day line setting.

290: Use a line shooter to reduce seabird bycatch
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be ineffective or harmful
Background information and definitions:
As a longline is deployed it will be put under tension as the movement of the boat stretches the line. This can delay the sinking of the line and baits, increasing the time available for birds to get hooked. A line shooter works by deploying the line faster than the boat is moving, removing tension from it and allowing the line to sink faster.
 

Key Messages:

A randomised, replicated and controlled trial from a pelagic fishery in the North Pacific found significantly higher seabird bycatch when a line shooter was used to set longlines.
A second randomised, replicated and controlled trial (from Norway), found no effect of a line shooter on bycatch rates.

Background information and definitions:
The turbulence created by a boat’s wake can stop bait from sinking quickly, allowing birds more time to become hooked. Bait throwers work by throwing bait clear of the wake, so that it sinks faster. Throwers also allow fishermen to direct lines, for example aiming them to lie under streamer lines (see ‘Use streamer lines to reduce seabird bycatch on longlines’

Key Messages:

Three replicated and controlled studies found evidence for reduced bycatch in some species when using weighted lines. One study found low bycatch rates, but was uncontrolled.
In Hawaii and New Zealand, rates of bait loss and bycatch of albatrosses Phoebastria spp., white-chinned petrels Procellaria aequinoctialis and sooty shearwaters Puffinus griseus were much lower with weighted baits or integrated weight lines than with control lines.
In the North Pacific, two trials found that bycatch rates of some species was reduced when using weights, but that shearwaters Puffinus spp. attacked weighted lines more often.

Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Many fishing boats prepare fish onboard, after catching them, in order to maximise the catch that can be stored. The offal (waste) is then normally discarded overboard. Moreno et al. 1996 describe the highest bycatch rates of a series of voyages coming from a vessel that piped offal overboard on the same side that the line was being set. However, other studies suggest that piping offal overboard from a different point to where the lines are being set will reduce bycatch, as birds spend their time eating the offal, rather than attempting to take bait.

Six studies (two replicated and controlled, two before-and-after and two small studies) from across the world found increased numbers of breeders, higher reproductive success or lower levels of disturbance in waders and terns following the start of access restrictions or the erection of signs near nesting areas. One Canadian study involved the use of multiple interventions.
A before-and-after study from the USA found that a colony of black-crowned night herons Nycticorax nycticorax was successfully relocated to an area with no public access.
One small study from Europe and one replicated and controlled study from Antarctica found no effect of access restrictions on the reproductive success of eagles or penguins, respectively.

310: Set minimum distances for approaching birds (buffer zones)
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Disturbance by people on foot or in vehicles can reduce birds’ use of habitats, or drive them into less favourable habitats. Preventing people from approaching birds too closely may help reduce disturbance. We found two studies that investigated the distances at which birds were disturbed by people: one found that people on foot disturbed birds at greater distances than people in boats (Rodgers & Smoth 1995); the second found that different species reacted differently to disturbance (Rodgers & Schwikert 2002). Both recommended buffer zones of between 100 and 180 m around breeding or feeding birds.

Key Messages:

We captured no evidence for the effects on bird populations of setting minimum distances for approaching birds.

312: Reduce visitor group size
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Larger groups of visitors to sites will probably cause more disturbances, so limiting the number of people visiting at once may reduce detrimental impacts on birds.
 
 

Key Messages:

We found no intervention-based studies examining the effects of reducing visitor numbers on bird populations. However, a single, replicated study in forests in Spain in 2004 (Remacha et al. 2011) found that fewer birds, but not fewer species, were observed as visitor number increased. This effect was largely due to decreases in collared dove Streptopelia decaocto presence and serin Serinus serinus abundance.

317: Use prescribed burning on deciduous forests
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be ineffective or harmful
Background information and definitions:
Controlled burning of accumulated litter (fuel reduction) may reduce the risk of hotter, more extensive and potentially more damaging, wildfires in temperate woodland habitats (e.g. Wooller & Brooker 1980). Periodic prescribed burns may also be used to reinstate/restore ecosystem processes in forests historically subject to occasional wildfires but where active fire suppression has occurred, often over many decades. Changes likely to occur with burning include a reduction in hardwood understorey vegetation and an increase in grasses and herbaceous vegetation. Other habitat modifications or interventions may be undertaken in combination with fire, such as thinning trees or the removal of mid- and understorey vegetation. Sometimes conflicts arise as to conservation priorities and possible detrimental effects on non-target species or communities.

318: Use prescribed burning on pine forests
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Fire is a fundamental part of many pine forest ecosystems, and is particularly well studied in the USA, where open pine forests and savannas are intensively managed for red-cockaded woodpeckers Picoides borealis and other species such as Bachman’s sparrows Peucaea aestivalis (formerly Aimophila aestivalis).
 

Key Messages:

Two studies of the 28 captured (all from the USA) found higher bird species richness in sites with prescribed burning, tree thinning and mid- or understorey control or just burning and tree thinning, compared to control sites. Five studies found no differences in species richness or community composition between sites with prescribed burning; prescribed burning, tree thinning and mid- or understorey control; or prescribed burning and tree thinning only, compared to control sites, or those with other management.
Eight studies found that some species or guilds (such as open habitat species) were more abundant or more likely to be found in burned areas of pine forest than control areas. One study found that the responses of Henslow’s sparrows to burning varied considerably with geography and habitat. 
Three studies found that some species were more abundant in thinned and burned stands, compared to controls or other management. Three studies found that overall bird densities or abundances of red-cockaded woodpeckers were higher in open pine forests with prescribed burning, tree thinning and mid- or understorey control, compared with control areas or those thinned but not burned. One found differences were more marked in spring. A study found that a red-cockaded woodpecker population increased following the start of intensive management consisting of prescribed burning and other interventions. 
Ten studies found that total bird densities or those of some species was the same or lower in sites with prescribed burning compared to control sites, or those with other management. Five studies investigated several interventions at once. Generally, closed-forest species and ground nesters appeared to be adversely affected by burning.
Three studies found higher productivities or survival of species in burned or burned and thinned areas, compared to control areas or those burned less recently. Seven studies found no differences in productivity, behaviour or survival (including of artificial nests) in burned areas or burned and thinned areas, compared to controls. One study found that northern bobwhite chicks had lower foraging success in burned areas, compared to other management regimes, whilst another found that different predators were dominant under different management.
The three studies that investigated it found that burning season did not appear to affect the effects of burning.

320: Use prescribed burning on savannas
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Periodic wildfires and grazing/browsing by wild animals maintained open savanna ecosystems in parts of the world, retarding woody plant encroachment and succession to woodland. In some regions where these natural processes have been lost, and where active fire suppression may have also occurred, rotational burning may be used to reinstate and maintain more open habitat conditions amenable. Other methods commonly used include thinning of trees and shrubs, timber harvesting, and livestock grazing.
There is a continuum between habitats classified as ‘savannas’ and those classified as ‘forests’ and ‘grasslands’. Relevant information for management of habitats with both trees and grasses may, therefore, be found in all three sections.
 

Key Messages:

A replicated and controlled study from Kenya, of five studies captured, found that burned areas of savanna tended to have more birds and more species than control or grazed areas. However, the authors note that differences were not present during drought years and burned sites showed significant annual variation, unlike grazed sites. A replicated and controlled study from Australia found that the effects of burning on bird abundances depended on burn season, and habitat type.
Two replicated studies in the USA found that some open country species were more common in burned areas than unburned, whilst other species were less so.
A small study from the USA found that two eastern bluebird Sialia sialis successfully raised chicks after the habitat around their nest boxes was subject to a prescribed burn.

Background information and definitions:
Fire can play an important part in shrublands by maintaining the balance between woody and herbaceous vegetation types. If the natural systems have been modified so that fire does not occur as regularly as it used to, for example to reduce risks to homes and property, then prescribed burning may be necessary to maintain the natural dynamics of the habitat.
 

Key Messages:

One controlled study from the USA, of eight captured, found that overall bird densities were similar between burned and unburned areas, whilst a replicated and controlled study found that species numbers and bird densities did not vary between areas burned in summer and those burned in winter.
Three studies found that some species were more abundant on areas that were burned, compared to those managed differently, or not at all. Four studies found that the densities of individual species were similar or lower on burned areas compared to control areas or those under different management.
A before-and-after study found that sage sparrows chose different nest sites before burning compared to after. A controlled study found no differences in greater sage grouse movement between burned and unburned areas.

322: Use prescribed burning on grasslands
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Suppression of fires may shift grassland communities from grasses and herbs towards woody-stemmed species. Alternatively, it may allow the fuel load to build up to such an extent that when fires do occur, they are hotter and burn for longer. This can mean that even fire-adapted plants (such as some pines and palms) are killed.
A possible way to reduce these effects is to ensure there are frequent, smaller fires, which prevent trees from establishing and constantly reduce the fuel load of a system.
 

Key Messages:

Four studies from the USA, of 21 studies captured, found that overall species richness did not vary between burned areas, or areas burned recently, and unburned sites. One study found that community composition was also similar whilst others found that species showed individual responses.
Nine studies from across the world found that at least some study species were found at higher densities or were more abundant in burned areas than in unburned areas or areas under different management. One study investigated multiple interventions at once. Fourteen studies found that at least one study species was less abundant or found at similar abundances on burned areas of grassland, compared to unburned areas or those under different management. However, four studies found that apparent responses varied depending on how soon after fires measurements were taken. Care should therefore be taken when interpreting the results of studies on prescribed burning.
One study from the USA found that Florida grasshopper sparrow had significantly higher reproductive success soon after plots were burned, whilst another American study founds that dickcissel reproductive success was higher in patch-burned areas than burned and grazed areas.

326: Clear or open patches in forests
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Forests naturally undergo disturbances, from storms, lightning and even large animals. These disturbances can create a mix of different habitats, with open clearings allowing a greater range of species to survive in a forest. Deliberately creating open patches may, therefore, encourage woodland edge and ‘early-successional’ species.
 

Key Messages:

Of nine studies, seven from the UK and the USA found that early-successional species increased in clearcut areas or opened forests, compared to control areas, areas before management, or other management techniques. One study found that population increases only occurred in clearcuts up to 20 ha in size. Two studies report that mature-forest species declined in cut/opened areas of forest.
A replicated, randomised, controlled study from the USA found no differences in species richness between clearcuts of different sizes, whilst another American study found that a mosaic of cut and uncut areas supported a variety of species. A long-term study from the USA of a landscape with opened patches found that there were no consistent differences between clearcut and controlled areas, although some species were only seen in clearcuts.

328: Thin trees within forests
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Thinning of trees (i.e. removal of, trees to reduce density) may be undertaken as a timber management practice e.g. within forestry plantations where saplings may be planted at unnaturally high densities, or as a deliberate conservation management practice to reinstate more natural open woodland conditions that have been lost due to active fire suppression and/or loss of populations large mammal grazers and browsers. Whilst mechanical thinning may be aimed at benefitting certain target species (flora or fauna), impacts on non-target species inevitably occur.
Many studies (especially in pine forests and savannas) simultaneously thin forests whilst introducing a prescribed fire regime. These studies are described in detail in ‘Use prescribed burning’.
 

Key Messages:

Of 13 studies, one from the USA which used several interventions found higher species richness in managed sites. Three studies from the USA and the UK found no differences between thinned and control sites.
Seven studies from the USA and Sweden found that total bird abundance, or that of some species, were higher in thinned plots than control plots or those under different management. Four of these used other interventions as well. Five studies found that abundances were similar, or that some species were less abundant in areas with thinning.
Two studies from the USA found no effect of thinning on wood thrushes, a species thought to be sensitive to it. A controlled before-and-after study found that more nests were in nest boxes in a thinned site, compared to a control site.

Background information and definitions:
Coppicing is a management practice typical of Eurasian northern temperate zone deciduous woodlands and wood pastures, in which stems of tree species, such as hazel Corylus avellana and sweet chestnut Castanea sativa, are cut near ground level once every few years, often in defined coppice compartments. These then regrow from the cut ‘stool’ giving a sustainable yield of woody material harvested on a rotational basis.
 

Key Messages:

Of three studies, one, a before-and-after study in the UK found that a population of European nightjars increased following a series of management interventions, including the coppicing of some birch trees.
Two before-and-after studies from the UK and the USA found that the use of coppices by some bird species declined over time. The UK study also found that overall species richness decreased with age, but that some species were more abundant in older stands.

330: Use patch retention harvesting instead of clearcutting 
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
In forests in which trees are commercially exploited for timber, a system known as patch retention harvesting may be used as an alternative to a total clear-cut. Typically, around 10% of mature and/or immature trees are retained in patches within an otherwise, clear-cut harvest compartment, with ‘prompt reforestation’ subsequent to timber extraction in the other 90%. These retained patches could help maintain characteristic forest species and act as reservoirs for re-colonisation by forest dependant species.
 

Key Messages:

One before-and-after study of two from the USA found that areas under patch retention harvesting contained more birds of more species than clearcut areas, retaining similar numbers to unharvested areas.
Two studies from the USA found that forest specialist species were found with greater frequency in patch retention plots than other management types. One found that habitat generalists increased on other management types, relative to patch retention areas.

331: Use selective harvesting/logging instead of clearcutting 
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
It has been suggested that conservation aimed at maintaining bird populations and economic need for timber extraction can be compatible if extraction methods minimize creation of large clearcut areas. One such method is selective logging (removing one or two trees and leaving the rest intact) that maintains an uneven-age forest structure and creates openings typically smaller than 0.4 ha, and often considered a sustainable alternative to clear-cutting. However, predators and avian nest parasites are often most common in edge habitat, thus potentially reducing reproductive success of birds breeding near forest edges.
 

Key Messages:

Six studies of seven from the USA and Canada found that some species were more abundant in selective-logged forests, whilst others were less abundant, compared to both control stands and other managements. One study found that there were no consistent differences between selectively harvested and clearcut stands.
A replicated study from the USA found a lower species richness of cavity-nesting birds in snags in selectively-logged stands, compared to clearcuts.

335: Manually control or remove midstorey and ground-level vegetation (including mowing, chaining, cutting etc) in forests
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
In wooded habitats, control or removal of understorey and/or midstorey vegetation may be undertaken as a deliberate conservation management practice, for example to restore previously naturally occurring open woodland conditions that have been lost due to active fire suppression and/or declining populations of large mammal grazers and browsers. In terms of bird conservation, such practice may aim to improve habitat conditions to maintain and enhance populations of individual endangered species. However, such changes may make habitat unsuitable for other species.
Many studies (especially in pine forests and savannas) simultaneously control vegetation and introduce a prescribed burning regime. These studies are described in detail in ‘Use prescribed burning’. Studies that describe the impact of mid- and understorey vegetation removal in open pine woodlands, which form a continuum with pine savannas are discussed below.
 

Key Messages:

Of fifteen studies captured, one, a replicated controlled study from the USA, found higher bird species richness in areas with midstorey thinning, compared to control areas. One study from the USA found similar bird species richness in areas with mid- and understorey control, compared to other management types. A study from Canada found fewer species in treated sites than controls.
Seven studies from Europe and the USA found that total bird densities or those of some species or guilds were higher in areas with mid- or understorey management, compared to before management or to areas without management. Four of these studies used understorey removal as part of a wider management regime.

Cutting and mowing of grasslands can help maintain grass cover, as grasses can survive cutting, whilst herbs and woody plants may not. Cutting can also encourage grass re-growth and increase productivity. Alternatively, in improved soils, cutting and removing the cut vegetation can reduce the nutrient content of the grassland and allow species that rely on nutrient poor soils to return.

Cutting reeds like this changes the composition of the reedbeds, resulting in higher spring water levels and higher reed biomass (due to increased regrowth) than in uncut reedbeds (Poulin & Lefebvre 2002). A comparison of cut and uncut reedbeds in southern France found that there was also a higher abundance of food arthropods in cut reeds, although lower abundances of birds in summer (Poulin & Lefebvre 2002).
 

Key Messages:

Of three studies captured, one controlled study from the Netherlands found that warblers nested at lower densities in cut areas of reeds. Productivity and success did not vary between treatments.
An unreplicated study from Denmark found that geese grazed at the highest densities on reedbeds cut 5–12 years previously.
One replicated study investigated changing water levels in addition to cutting reeds in the UK and found that management did not affect great bittern breeding productivity but did appear to delay territory establishment.

Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
A combination of fuel reduction (e.g. by burning or understorey removal) and planting of native species could help replace an exotic mid- or understorey with a native one.
 

Key Messages:
A replicated, controlled study from the USA found that the number of black-chinned hummingbird nests increased at sites with fuel reduction and planting of native species, but that the increase was smaller than at sites without planting.

343: Use ring-barking (girdling), cutting or silvicides to produce snags
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Woody debris can be created in forests by ‘ring-barking’ or ‘girdling’, a process which removes the living tissue from a tree in a ring around the trunk. This prevents water and nutrients from reaching the leaves and upper portions of the tree, normally killing the plant, which then decays to produce a snag.
 

Key Messages:

Of five studies found, one replicated and controlled study from the USA found that forest plots provided with snags had higher bird diversity and abundance than plots without snags added.
Three studies from the USA and UK found that woodpeckers and other species used artificially-created snags for nesting and foraging. One study from the USA found that use increased with how long a snag had been dead.
A UK study found that no crested tits used snags created for them, possibly because they were not rotted enough, or because they were too close to the ground.

Background information and definitions:
If large amounts of wood are available, then it may be possible to deliver the benefits of having woody debris in forests without having to damage the trees themselves.
 

Key Messages:
A randomised, replicated, controlled study from Australia found that brown treecreeper numbers were higher in plots with large amounts of dead wood added, compared to control plots or those with less debris added.

345: Remove coarse woody debris from forests
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Removal of coarse woody debris (i.e. dead woody plant material &gt;5mm diameter, including bark &gt; 5mm thickness) from forests is a practice most commonly undertaken in North American and Australian forests to reduce risk of intense wildfires by reducing the fuel-load. It may be undertaken as a deliberate conservation intervention to benefit certain bird species, but with the potential to adversely affect understorey species that utilise accumulated dead wood for foraging or nesting.
 

Key Messages:

One of two replicated and controlled studies from the USA found that overall breeding bird abundance and diversity were lower in plots where woody debris was removed, compared to control plots. Several individually-analysed species showed lower abundances. A replicated, controlled before-and-after study from the USA found lower nest survival for black-chinned hummingbirds following debris removal. 
Some species in both studies increased after debris removal.

346: Apply herbicide to mid- and understorey vegetation
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be ineffective or harmful
Background information and definitions:
If it is not possible to manually remove mid- or understorey vegetation from forests and shrublands then applying herbicide may be a useful alternative. There may, however, be other issues with widespread herbicide application.
 

Key Messages:

Of seven studies, one replicated, controlled study in forests in Canada found that bird species richness declined after the treatment of deciduous trees with herbicide.
Two of the four studies monitoring bird populations (two replicated, controlled before-and-after studies) these found that numbers of red-cockaded woodpeckers or male greater sage grouse increased in all or some herbicide-treated areas. Increases of sage grouse were larger at two areas without vegetation control. One study considered two species: one decreased while the other showed no response. Another found that bird densities increased equally in both control and treatment areas.
Three replicated, controlled before-and-after studies in forests found that nest survival was lower where herbicide was applied to exotic shrubs or deciduous vegetation. One study also found lower nesting densities. One controlled study found northern bobwhite chicks higher had foraging success in herbicide-treated forest areas.

347: Treat wetlands with herbicide
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be ineffective or harmful
Background information and definitions:
Wetlands can become overgrown with vegetation, particularly if they have unusually high nutrient levels, or if invasive plants (with no natural predators) are present. Very dense vegetation can exclude open-water species from a wetland, meaning that treating the wetland with a herbicide may be beneficial. However, conservationists should be aware that some herbicides, such as glyphosate, can be extremely toxic to amphibians and fish (Relyea 2005).

Key Messages:
Three of four studies, one replicated and controlled, found that numbers of terns, American coot and waders were found at higher densities on wetland areas sprayed with herbicide, compared to unsprayed areas. However, one study found that wader numbers were not as high as on ploughed areas. One replicated and controlled study found that songbird densities were lower on sprayed than unsprayed areas.

Key Messages:

Five of 12 studies from the USA and Canada, four replicated, found that some species studied were found at higher densities on grazed than ungrazed sites. Eight studies from the USA, Canada and France, six replicated, found that some or all species studied were found at lower densities on grazed sites compared to ungrazed sites or those under other management, or that there were no differences.
Two controlled studies from the USA and Canada, one replicated, found that duck nesting success was higher on grazed than ungrazed sites. Two studies from the USA found that songbird nesting success was lower on grazed than ungrazed sites.

Key Messages:

Of ten studies captured, one replicated, controlled study from the USA found lower species richness in grazed areas than ungrazed. Another replicated, controlled study from the USA found no consistent differences in community composition between grazed and ungrazed areas.
A small study from Canada found an increase in duck populations following the start of grazing amongst other interventions.
Five studies from the UK and USA, four replicated, found higher use of, or higher nesting densities in, grazed areas compared to ungrazed. Seven studies from the UK, Canada and the USA, five replicated, found no differences in use or nesting densities, or lower abundances of birds on grazed, compared with ungrazed areas. One found that several species appeared to be excluded by grazing. 
Three studies from the UK, USA and Canada, two replicated, found that nesting success or productivity was similar, or lower, on grazed sites compared with ungrazed.

350: Employ grazing in non-grassland habitats
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
In many parts of the world, the native grazers that would have helped maintain a balance between woody and herbaceous plants in a habitat have been lost or greatly reduced in numbers. Introducing domestic grazers is a potential way to re-establish the ecosystem dynamics.
 

Key Messages:

One of eight studies, a replicated, controlled study on savannas in Kenya found more bird species on grazed site, compared with unmanaged sites. These differences were not present during drought years. A before-and-after study from the Netherlands found the number of species in a mixed habitat wetland site declined after the number of grazing animals increased.
Three studies (two replicated) from a variety of habitats in Sweden, the Netherlands and Kenya found that the overall number of birds, or the densities of some species were higher in grazed than ungrazed sites, or increased after the introduction of grazing. The Kenyan study found differences were not present in drought years. Four studies from several habitats in Europe and Kenya found that some species were found at lower densities, or not found at all, on grazed sites compared to ungrazed sites or those under different management. Five studies from several habitats from across the world found no differences in the abundances or densities of some or all species between grazed sites and those that were ungrazed or under different management.
Two replicated studies from the UK found that productivity of northern lapwing and grey partridge was lower in grazed sites compared to ungrazed. One study examined several interventions at the same time.
A replicated study from the UK found that songbirds and invertebrate-eating species were more common on rough-grazed habitats than intensive pasture, but that crows were less so.

352: Re-seed grasslands
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Re-seeding grasslands may improve productivity and the growth of young grass, which in turn may increase the number of birds it can support. This intervention is sometimes used to attract geese to specific areas to reduce conflict with farmers, when geese graze their crops. See ‘Provide sacrificial grasslands to reduce the impact of wild geese on crops’ for details.
Re-seeding can be with grass species, or with legumes such as clover Trifolium spp. which may improve the nitrogen content of the forage.
 

Key Messages:

One of two studies, both from the UK and investigating grazing by geese Branta spp., found that geese grazed at higher densities on grasslands that were re-seeded, compared to control or fertilised areas.
One study found that areas sown with clover were grazed at higher densities than those sown with grass seed.

353: Fertilize artificial grasslands 
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Fertilised grasslands are likely to have higher productivity and therefore support larger numbers of birds, particularly grazing species, such as geese. This intervention is commonly used to attract geese to specific areas to reduce conflict with farmers, when geese graze their crops. See ‘Provide sacrificial grasslands to reduce the impact of wild geese on crops’.
 

Key Messages:

We captured four studies examining the impacts of fertilizing grasslands, all from the UK and investigating grazing by geese Anser and Branta spp. Two studies found that more geese grazed on areas that were fertilised compared with control areas. Two studies found that cut and fertilised areas were used more than control areas. One study found that fertilised areas were used less than re-seeded grasslands.
One study found that fertilisation affected grazing at applications of 50 kg N/ha, but not 18 kg N/ha. One study found that grazing rates only increased with applications of up to 80 kg.N/ha.

Key Messages:

Of seven studies captured, one, a before-and-after study from the UK found that two wader species recolonised a site after water levels were raised. A third was found at very high levels. A review from the UK found that high-level agri-environment schemes designed to provide wet habitats were effective at providing habitats for waders and two replicated studies from the UK and Denmark found that northern lapwings were more likely to nest or nested at higher numbers on grasslands with high water levels.
A replicated and controlled study from Denmark found that Eurasian oystercatchers did not nest at higher densities on fields with raised water levels and that raising water levels had no effect on nesting on restored grassland fields.
A replicated study from the USA found that predation rate on Cape Sable seaside sparrow nests increased as water levels increased.
A replicated, controlled and paired sites study from the UK found that birds visited grassland sites with raised water levels at higher rates than other fields. A replicated study from the UK found no differences in feeding rates on sites with raised water levels, compared with control sites.

Of six studies, one replicated, controlled study from the USA found that bird diversity was affected by maintaining water levels at different levels.
A study from the USA found that ducks were more abundant when high water levels were maintained on a wetland site. Geese were more abundant when lower levels were maintained. Three studies from the USA and Canada, two replicated, found that different species showed preferences for different water levels in wetlands. 
A replicated study from the UK found that great bitterns established territories earlier when deep water levels were maintained, but this had no effect on productivity.
A review from Spain found that management successfully maintained water near a greater flamingo nesting area, but the effects of this were not measured.

356: Use environmentally sensitive flood management 
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Many rivers across the world have been channelized and managed, meaning that then natural dynamics (changes in water levels, flooding etc) are lost. This has destroyed habitat and can also lead to less frequent, but far more damaging floods. Using environmentally sensitive flood management may both provide habitats and reduce the damage caused by flooding.
 

Key Messages:

One of two studies, a before-and-after study from the UK, found that there were significantly more bird territories in a stretch of river with ‘flood beams’ installed, compared to a channelized river.
A replicated site comparison study in the USA found that 13 of 20 bird species increased at sites with the restoration of river dynamics and vegetation.

Ploughing can be used to reduce the dominance of some species, such as Spartina spp. on wetlands, or heathers, on heathland.
 

Key Messages:

One of four studies (of two experiments), from the USA, found that bird densities were higher on ploughed wetland areas, compared to unploughed areas.
Three studies of a site comparison study from the UK found that few whimbrels nested on ploughed and re-seeded areas of heathland, but these areas were used for foraging in early spring.

Creating scrapes and pools in wetlands and wet grasslands can help create a heterogenous habitat, with varying vegetation types and water levels.
 

Key Messages:

Of six studies captured, four before-and after studies from the UK and North America found that the use of sites, or the breeding population of birds on sites, increased following the creation of ponds and scrapes or was higher in areas with ditch-fed ponds.
A study from the USA found that dabbling ducks used newly-created ponds in large numbers, although other species preferred older ponds. Songbirds did not appear to be affected by pond-creation.

360: Restore or create forests
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Some forests are the most complex terrestrial habitats, with countless species interacting. Restoring such complexity is difficult, but there is an ever-increasing amount of research and investment into the area. For example, insurance firms and shipping companies are financing a 25-year project to restore forest ecosystems along the Panama Canal (TEEB 2008); whilst mining companies in Australia are increasingly able to reconstruct the forests they destroyed after they have finished mining at a site (Nichols & Grant 2007).
Trees grow slowly and therefore the effects of forest restoration may not be evident for decades or even longer after restoration begins. Care must therefore be taken when interpreting the results of these studies.
Some studies below describe the effects of riparian forest and buffer strip creation as a habitat type. The effects of riparian buffer strips as a pollution-reducing intervention are discussed in ‘Threat: Pollution – Provide buffer strips along rivers and streams’.

Key Messages:

Thirteen of 15 studies from across the world found that bird communities in restored forests were similar to original forests or that species returned to restored sites, that species recovered significantly better than ats unrestored site, that species richness, diversity or abundances increased over time or that restoration techniques themselves improved over time. 
Nine of the studies found that some species did not return to restored sites, or were less common than in original forests.  One study also found that overall territory density decreased over time and another found that territory densities were similar between sites planted with oak Quercus spp. saplings and unplanted sites.
One study from the USA found that productivity of birds was similar in restored and natural forests. Another found that productivity was lower. 
A study from the USA found that fast-growing cottonwood forests less than ten years old held more territories and had higher diversity than similarly-aged oak forests.

361: Restore or create grasslands
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Several agri-environment schemes including the Environmentally Sensitive Area (ESA) arable reversion scheme (England and Wales), The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) in USA, and Permanent Cover Program (PCP) in Canada, provided financial incentives to landowners for planting grass/legume cover as an alternative to annual crops. Primary or secondary objectives of the schemes were to provide habitat for nature conservation purposes.
This section describes the results from studies examining the restoration or creation of semi-natural or natural grasslands, but not of permanent artificial pastureland. For example, North American prairies and species-rich chalk grasslands in Europe are both discussed below, but the creation of wet grazing pasture in northern Europe is instead discussed in ‘Restore or create traditional water meadows’.
 

Key Messages:

Of 23 studies found, three from the USA, Canada and Iceland found that species richness on restored grassland sites was similar to remnant habitats or higher than unrestored sites. One replicated, randomised study from the USA found that bird diversity was lower on restored grassland sites compared to hayfields or pastures, whilst a small American study found that species richness declined at one of two fields restored to grassland from croplands. Three studies from the USA found that target species used restored grasslands.
Two studies from the USA found that CRP fields held disproportionate proportions of total bird populations, or that local population trends were correlated with the amount of CRP land in the area. Six studies from the USA and UK found that the abundances or densities of some, or all, species were higher on restored sites compared to unrestored sites, or were comparable to natural habitats. Two studies found lower abundances of species on restored sites compared to unrestored sites, although the authors of one suggest that drought conditions may have confounded the results.
Five studies from the USA found that at least some bird species in restored areas of grassland had higher productivities than birds in unrestored areas; similar or higher productivies than natural habitats; or had high enough productivities to sustain populations. Three studies found that productivities were lower in restored areas than unrestored, or that productivities on restored sites were too low to sustain populations.
A replicated study from the USA found that older CRP fields held more nests, but fewer species than young fields. Two replicated American studies found no differences in species richness or abundances between CRP fields and riparian filter strips whether they were sown with warm- or cool-season grasses, whilst another found that more grassland specialist species were found on sites sown with non-native species. A replicated study from the USA found no difference in bird densities between sites seeded with redtop grass and those not seeded. A study from Iceland found that very few birds were found on restored sites, unless they were sown with Nootka lupin.

363: Restore or create traditional water meadows
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Water meadows are areas of grazing land or hay meadow that have carefully controlled water levels to keep the soil damp. In Europe they provide valuable breeding habitats for waders and other biodiversity. The studies below describe instances when multiple interventions have been used to create water meadows. When the effects of multiple interventions, such as raising water levels and adding foot drains, can be separated, they are discussed under the relevant interventions in ‘Threat: Natural system modifications’.
 

Key Messages:

Four out of five before-and-after studies, all from the UK, found that the number of waders and wildfowl on sites increased following the restoration of water meadows. One before-and-after study from Sweden found no increase in northern lapwing population following an increase in the area of managed meadows in the study area. This study also found that restored meadows were used less than expected by breeding lapwings.
A before-and-after study from Sweden found that hatching success of northern lapwings were higher on meadows than on spring-sown crops. There were no differences between meadows and autumn-sown crops or grasslands.

Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Shrublands are extremely diverse habitats, being found from subantarctic regions, through temperate climates to tropical dry and moist shrublands such as karoo (in South Africa) and restingas (in Brazil). They are also found from sea level up to beyond the tree line in mountains. However, we found relatively few studies describing the effects of shrubland restoration on bird populations, so we have not subdivided the studies further.
 

Key Messages:

Only one of the four studies captured investigated the effects of shrubland restoration in isolation. This small before-and-after study from the UK found that one or two pairs of northern lapwing bred on an area of restored moorland, whereas none had previously bred in the area.
A study from the USA and one from the Azores found that populations of target species (gamebirds and seabirds) increased following shrubland restoration, amongst other interventions.
A replicated study from the UK which did not distinguish between several interventions performed found a negative relationship between the combined intervention and the ratio of young-to-old grey partridges.

Key Messages:

Of eleven studies captured, 11, from the mainland USA, Guam, Canada and Hawaii, found that birds used artificially restored or created wetlands. Two found that rates of use and species richness were similar or higher than on natural wetlands. One found that use rates were higher than on unrestored wetlands.
Three studies from the USA and Puerto Rico found that restored wetlands held lower densities and fewer species of birds than natural wetlands.
A replicated study from the USA found that least bittern productivity was similar in restored and natural wetlands.

Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Coastal and intertidal wetlands are those that can be inundated with salt water. This can have profound consequences for the vegetation and animal life, as salt-intolerant species are excluded.
This form of habitat creation may form part of coastal protection measures, with habitats such as saltmarshes and mangroves being important in reducing the power of waves and so reducing coastal erosion.
 

Key Messages:

All six studies found, from the USA and UK, found that target bird species used restored or created wetlands. Two found that numbers and/or diversity were at least as high as in natural wetlands, one that numbers were higher than in unrestored sites. Three found that bird numbers on wetlands increased over time.
Two studies from the UK found that songbirds and waders decreased following wetland restoration, whilst a study from the USA found that songbirds were more common on unrestored sites than restored wetlands.

Kelp forests are unique habitats found in mostly cold, nutrient-rich waters. Large kelps such as Macrocystis spp. (the ‘giant kelps’) can grow to 45 m or more, creating ‘underwater forests’ that provide complex habitats and allow extremely productive ecosystems to flourish. However, they are vulnerable to pollution and ecosystem perturbations caused by, for example, the loss of keystone species such as sea otters Enhydra lutris (Jackson et al. 2001).

Whilst mining can be a very damaging activity, it can also create habitats. After quarries and gravel pits become disused, they may offer valuable aquatic, terrestrial and marshland habitats, particularly if they are close to urban areas (Catchpole and Tydeman 1975). These habitats can often be bare immediately after abandonment, so restoring vegetation to them may greatly improve their value as habitats.

Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Invasive and introduced avian predators can be problematic: islands with more introduced birds have lost more native bird species (Case 1996), but we have captured no evidence of the effects of their control or eradication. However, eight studies describe the effects of controlling or removing native predators on target bird populations.
The control of invasive and introduced competitor species is discussed in ‘Reduce competition with other species for nests sites’ and ‘Reduce competition with other species for food’.

Key Messages:

Out of 10 studies, six before-and-after studies from North America, Australia and Europe found that controlling avian predators led to increased population sizes, reduced mortality or increased reproductive success in seabirds on islands. The North American studies had several interventions, so increases could not be linked directly to predator control, and one found that increases were only at one of two sites studied.
Two controlled studies in Europe found little evidence that crow control led to increased reproductive success in gamebirds or raptors on islands. A North American study found that, despite higher reproductive success, very few birds returned to the study site after predator removal. A study from North America found that an Atlantic puffin Fratercula arctica translocation programme, combined with the culling of predatory gulls, appeared to be successful.
A study from the UK found that the number of common terns Sterna hirundo and black-headed gulls Larus ridibundus declined on gravel islands despite the attempted control of large gulls.

373: Control mammalian predators on islands
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Humans have introduced mammalian predators to hundreds of islands across the world, most frequently rats Rattus spp., mice Mus spp. and cats Felis cattus, but many others as well. These have had a devastating impact on bird populations on islands, with the historic probability of extinction on islands being well correlated with the number of introduced mammal species (Blackburn et al. 2004).
Most control efforts for rodents are through poisoning (with a 2007 review suggesting that bait stations are more effective than broadcast baiting, Howald et al. 2007), whilst trapping and hunting appear to be more effective for cats (Nogales et al. 2004) and larger mammals. However, this synopsis only discusses the impacts of eradication or control on native bird populations, not the details of eradication programmes themselves. The effects of different control methods will be discussed in detail in a forthcoming Conservation Evidence synopsis on invasive species.
Below are two studies describing the impacts of island predator removal on bird communities. Studies describing the effects on gamebirds, parrots, pigeons, rails, raptors, seabirds, songbirds, waders and wildfowl are also available.

375: Control mammalian predators on islands for seabirds
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Seabirds frequently nest on the ground, where they are vulnerable to predation by cats Felis catus or pigs Sus scrofa, or in burrows where rats Rattus spp. or even house mice Mus musculus can predate chicks, eggs and adults. In addition, seabirds are often poor walkers (as they are specialised for flying and swimming) and cannot evade predators. Because of this, breeding sites are often confined to offshore islands and their populations can be devastated if predators are introduced.
The effectiveness assessment of the control of mammalian predators on islands was carried out across all bird species groups.

Key Messages:

We found 16 before-and-after studies, one paired sites study and one literature review from around the world, all describing positive seabird responses to the removal or control of mammalian predators (mainly rats Rattus spp. and feral cats Felis catus) from islands.
Of these 18 studies, seven found either large population increases or recolonisations following predator eradication or control. Two of these found only partial population increases or recolonisations: a study from Alaska.
Twelve studies found increases in reproductive success and survival or decreases in predation and mortality following predator control. In one case there was also a small population increase.
Rats and mice Mus musculus were controlled in twelve studies, mostly examining burrow-nesting seabirds; cats in eight, mostly on ground or cliff-nesting seabirds; and other species in two.

Rails have been especially badly affected by introduced predators and other human impacts, with an estimated 800 species becoming extinct in the Pacific alone (Steadman 1995). They have diversified on islands across the world, with many species losing the ability to fly, thus rendering them extremely vulnerable to invasive predators.

Background information and definitions:
When predators are controlled on continental sites, rather than islands, the chances of eradicating predators are far smaller and may not be desirable – many of the studies we have captured describe the control of native predators.
We have classed landmasses above approximately 5,000 km2 as ‘non-islands’ because the largest island where eradication has so far been attempted (as of July 2011) is South Georgia, South Atlantic, at 3,718 km2.
One study discussing the impacts of predator control on bird communities is described below; studies describing the effects on individual taxa are in subsequent sections.

396: Reduce nest predation by excluding predators from nests or nesting areas
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
As well as direct predation on adults (see previous section), predators can have a devastating impact on bird populations through predating eggs and chicks too young to defend themselves or run away. Species ranging from hedgehogs to pigs to other birds can all affect bird populations in this way and in many cases it is not desirable or practical to remove these species. Therefore the use of barriers and cages to prevent predators from attacking nests is widespread.
These can take the form of barriers or cages around individual nests, fences around groups of nests or suitable nesting areas, or repellents to either disguise the presence of eggs or discourage predators from approaching. We found one systematic review (Smith et al. 2010) which compares these approaches and also investigates potential adverse effects of nest protection.
As in the section on predator removal, several studies perform experiments using artificial nests: either man-made or genuine nests that have been filled with false or real eggs (normally from quail Corturnix spp.) and placed in experimental areas to estimate predation rates.
 

Key Messages:
A 2011 systematic review found that excluding predators from nests significantly increased hatching success, although individual barriers around nests sometimes had adverse impacts.

397: Physically protect nests with individual exclosures/barriers or provide shelters for chicks of ground nesting seabirds
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
If fencing does not work to exclude predators (for example, predatory birds), or is not a viable option, it may be possible to protect individual nests using a variety of cages and exclosures. These must be able to allow chicks and adults to get in and out, but not predators and should be quick to install to minimise the chances of parents abandoning nests (see ‘Can nest protection increase nest abandonment?’).
Unfortunately, because each cage is over a nest, it is possible that predators will learn the association and that providing the exclosures will actually increase predation on either adults or chicks (see ‘Can nest protection increase predation of adult and chick waders?’)
The effectiveness score for this intervention included a combined assessment of the evidence for chicks of ground nesting seabirds, chicks of waders, chicks of storks and ibises, and chicks of songbirds.

Key Messages:

A before-and-after study from Japan found an increase in fledging rates of little terns Sterna albifrons following the provision of chick shelters and other interventions.

Background information and definitions:
Placing individual barriers over nests is likely to disturb incubating parents, and in extreme cases, this may lead to them abandoning the nest. Unless nests are abandoned, studies are unlikely to mention it and so will be discussed in ‘Physically protect nests with individual exclosures/barriers’.
 

Key Messages:

A replicated before-and-after study from the USA found that nest abandonment increased after nest exclosures were installed. Two replicated studies in Sweden and the USA found small levels of abandonment, or non-significant increases in abandonment following nest exclosure installation.

402: Use artificial nests that discourage predation
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Nest boxes are distinctive and often easier to see than natural nests. Therefore there is the possibility that predators will learn to associate boxes with nests and target them specifically. This could even lead to nest boxes acting as ‘ecological traps’ – with birds using them preferentially but having very low reproductive success in them. Therefore, ‘anti-predator’ devices and boxes may be desirable.
 

Key Messages:

Three trials in North America found lower predation or higher nesting success of wildfowl in nest boxes or nesting ‘tubs’ than natural nests in tree cavities or on the ground.
A trial in captivity found that raccoons could be prevented from entering nest boxes if they were topped with a metal cone with a 7.6 cm overhang and the distance between entrance hole and the roof was increased from 30 to 60 cm.
A replicated study in the USA found that fewer woods duck Aix sponsa used nest boxes with predator guards on when given the choice of unaltered boxes, but that both designs were used with equal frequency when only one design was available.

Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Several ant species including the red imported fire ant Solenopsis invicta, the big-headed ant Pheidole megacephala and yellow crazy ants Anoplolepis gracilipes have been introduced across the world and have often become invasive. Whilst too small to damage most adult birds, they can have severe impacts on chicks. Due to their huge numbers and adaptability eradication is rarely an option (although see ‘Control invasive ants on islands’). Therefore preventing them from accessing nests may be the best intervention.

Background information and definitions:
If populations are reduced to extremely low levels and continue to be threatened by nest predation, then extremely intensive monitoring can be used to ‘guard nests’ and protect nests from predators through direct interference. Due to the intensive nature of this work it is only likely to be viable if there are volunteers to do it, and the population being monitored is very small.  Nest guarding can be used as a response to range of threats and is therefore discussed in ‘General responses to small/declining populations’.

Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Cat collars can be modified to carry either simple bells or more complex sonic alerts which scare birds before cats can catch them. Another option is a ‘bib’ which hangs in front of the cat’s legs, preventing them from hunting effectively.
 

Key Messages:

Two replicated randomised and controlled studies in the UK and Australia found that significantly fewer birds were returned by cats wearing collars with various anti-hunting devices, compared to controls.
A replicated, randomised and controlled study from the UK found no significant differences between different devices.
Both UK studies found that collars were easily lost.

417: Use supplementary feeding to reduce predation 
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
If predators are dependent on threatened birds then providing supplementary food for the predators may remove some predation pressure whilst also supporting the predator population. However, it is also possible that providing supplementary food will allow an increase in the predator population and therefore increase predation pressure.
Studies describing the effects of supplementary food on fed populations are described in a separate chapter.
 

Key Messages:

A controlled cross-over experiment from the UK found that there was no difference in grouse adult survival or productivity when supplementary food was provided to hen harrier Circus cyaneus compared to in control areas.
This study and another from the USA that used artificial nests found that nest predation rates were reduced in areas when supplementary food was provided to predators. A second study from the USA found no such effect.

418: Use aversive conditioning to reduce nest predation by avian predators
Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
If predators can be taught to associate unpleasant tastes with eggs and/or chicks, then they may stop predating them. This can be achieved either through treating eggs in nests (spraying eggs or the nest) or placing artificial nests in the environment with eggs injected with unpleasant chemicals (not possible with natural nests as it will kill eggs).
The effectiveness score shown here is based on an assessment of this evidence combined with the evidence from Use aversive conditioning to reduce nest predation by mammalian predators; therefore the assessment describes the evidence available for Using aversive conditioning to reduce nest predation.
 

Key Messages:

Five studies from the USA and Europe found reductions in consumption of eggs treated with various chemicals. A further ex situ study from the USA found that American kestrels Falco sparverius consumed fewer chicks when they were treated, but not to the point of losing body condition.
Three studies from the USA found some evidence that treating eggs with some chemicals may have reduced predation of eggs after treatment stopped, or  of untreated eggs, although two of these were only short term experiments and the third found that the effect was lost after a year. 
Four studies from the Europe and the USA found no evidence for conditioning, or a reduction in predation of wild (untreated) eggs.

Key Messages:

One study from the USA and three  ex situ experiments found evidence for lower consumption of eggs treated with repellent chemicals.
However, when untreated eggs were provided simultaneously with or after treated eggs, no studies found evidence for continued lower predation. I.e. aversive conditioning did not occur. In addition, a study from the USA found no effect of repellent chemicals on predation rates of genuine nests.

420: Reduce predation by translocating nest boxes
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Many predators optimise their hunting by searching areas where they have previously been successful. This potentially makes birds nesting in nest boxes vulnerable – they cannot move nesting sites and can lose their clutches year after year if a predator learns their location. Moving nest boxes between years may, therefore, reduce predation and increase reproductive success. This is not the same as translocating birds from an area of high predation to a safer location. Studies describing this intervention are discussed in a separate section within ‘General responses to small/declining populations’.
 

Key Messages:
Two studies from Europe found that predation rates were lower for relocated nest boxes, compared to controls.

422: Reduce inter-specific competition for nest sites of ground nesting seabirds by removing competitor species
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
As humans modify ever-increasing amounts of habitat across the world, the number of nesting sites for many species is becoming limited, potentially increasing competition and reducing reproductive output. Two potential solutions are to increase the number of nesting sites (see separate section in ‘General responses to small/declining populations’) or to reduce competition by removing or controlling competitor species (see below).
 

Key Messages:

Four studies from Canada and the UK found increased tern Sterna spp. populations following the control or exclusion of gulls Larus spp. In two studies many interventions were used, making it impossible to tell which was responsible. One study from the UK and one from Canada found that controlling large gulls had no impact on smaller species.
Two studies from the USA and UK found that exclusion devices successfully reduced the numbers of gulls at sites, although one found that they were only effective at small colonies and the other found that methods varied in their effectiveness and practicality.

On continents and large islands, the chances of eradicating problematic species is very low, but we have captured five studies that describe the effects of successfully eradicating habitat-altering invasive species, most commonly European rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus from small islands across the world. Such control efforts are often accompanied by attempts to restore native vegetation and habitats, described in ‘Habitat restoration and creation’.
 
 

Key Messages:

Four studies from the Azores and Australia found that seabird populations increased following the eradication of European rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus or other species, although in three studies there were several other interventions used as well.

435: Exclude or control ‘reservoir species’ to reduce parasite burdens
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
If a bird population is threatened by a parasite or disease that can infect multiple species, it may not be enough to treat the population, because of the risk of constant re-infection from the other host, which can act as a ‘reservoir species’. Instead it may be necessary to treat the other hosts or to exclude them from particular habitats or control their numbers.
While we found studies describing the impact of controlling reservoir species through culling, we found no intervention-based studies describing the impact of excluding reservoir species from an area.  However, a correlative study in Scotland in 2007 found that areas of forest that were fenced to exclude deer had fewer ticks (carriers of louping ill virus which attacks red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus) than unfenced areas, but that areas of adjacent moorland (where the grouse were actually found) were not affected (Ruiz-Fons & Gilbert, 2010).

A literature review found no compelling evidence that culling mountain hares Lepus timidus (a carrier of the ticks that carry louping ill virus) increased red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus populations.
A controlled before-and-after study from the UK did find that there was a significant increase in chick production on grouse moors with hare culling, compared to control sites but no change in population density. A comment on this paper argued that the controls used in it were not adequate.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
If populations are reduced to extremely low levels and are threatened by parasitism, then extremely intensive monitoring can be used to ‘guard nests’ and remove parasites if they increase to damaging levels. Due to the intensive nature of this work it is only likely to be viable if there are volunteers to do it, and the population being monitored is very small. Nest guarding is also used as a response to several other threats, such as predation and poaching and is therefore discussed in ‘General responses to small/declining populations’.

441: Remove/control adult brood parasites 
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Brood parasites are species that lay their eggs in other species’ nests, with the chicks cared for by the hosts. They can have extremely detrimental impacts on bird species, with parasite chicks frequently evicting all host eggs or chicks. However, some brood parasite species, such as common cuckoos Cuculus canorus are themselves declining or threatened, making control or the reduction of parasitism undesirable.
However, in North America, brown-headed cowbirds Molothrus ater are increasingly abundant and expanding in their range. Brown-headed cowbirds have also been implicated in the near extinction of at least one species, the pale-headed brush finch Atlapetes pallidiceps in South America (Oppel et al. 2004), meaning that their control is seen as a conservation priority. All the studies we captured concern cowbird species.

Key Messages:

All 11 studies from across the world that investigated parasitism rates found that they were lower following cowbird Molothrus spp. control.
One study from Ecuador found an increase in host species population after cowbird control, but two American studies found no such effect.

445: Provide supplementary food to increase parental presence and so reduce brood parasitism
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Brood parasites only tend to lay in host nests when the parents are absent, to reduce the risk of eggs being rejected. Therefore, maximising the time parent birds spend at their nest may reduce the incidence of parasitism. One possible way of doing this would be to provide supplementary food, meaning that birds have to spend less time foraging. Studies discussing this and other uses of supplementary feeding are discussed in ‘General responses to small/declining populations’.
 

Key Messages:

We found no evidence on providing supplementary food to increase parental presence and so reduce boord parasitims on bird populations.

Background information and definitions:
In Mauritius, the critically endangered echo parakeet Psittcaula eques has a very small breeding population and low reproductive output. In 2002–4, four chicks were found dead having been covered in slime and suffocating after African giant land snails Achatina spp. (introduced to Mauritius and many other islands for food) moved other them.
Snails are deterred from moving over copper due to a reaction between their slime and the metal, and trials in Mauritius showed that Achatina individuals did not move over copper strips. A snail exclusion barrier was therefore tested.
 

Key Messages:
A single small, before-and-after study in Mauritius found no snail-caused chick mortality in 2004–7 after the installation of copper strips at seven echo parakeet Psittacula eques nest holes, compared to four fatalities in 2003–4.

448: Clean birds following oil spills
Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Oil spills at sea can kill large numbers of seabirds and have the potential to wipe out entire populations where these are small or localised. Oil can stick to birds’ feathers, making them lose their water-proofing and potentially leading to hypothermia. When birds try to clean their feathers they ingest oil and are likely to become poisoned.
Birds can be taken in and cleaned, but this is an expensive operation, with the cleaning operations after the Treasure oil spill in South Africa in 2000 costing an estimated $100/bird (Whittington 2003). In addition, whereas cleaning may prevent adults from dying, there is evidence that the offspring of rehabilitated birds have lower survival than normal (Barham et al. 2008). This means that the hand-rearing of offspring may be an important intervention after oil spills (Barham et al. 2008, see ‘Artificially incubate and hand-rear birds in captivity’).
In addition to the direct effects described in the studies below, one study (Ryan 2003) estimated that the population of African penguins Spheniscus demersus was 19% larger than it would have been without rehabilitation efforts (approximately 163,000 adults, compared to 137,000).

449: Relocate birds following oil spills
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
If an oil spill is definitely going to affect a large number of birds and there is sufficient warning, then it may be possible to temporarily relocate birds away from the danger. This avoids having to clean birds, which can be expensive, stressful and may not work (see ‘Clean birds following oil spills’). However, it is still likely to be expensive and carries the risk that birds will not be able to return to the original site. Alternatively, there is the possibility, with fast-flying species, that they will return before the clean-up operations are complete, thus becoming oiled anyway.
 

Key Messages:
A replicated study in South Africa found that a higher percentage of African penguins Spheniscus demersus that were relocated following an oil spill bred at their old colonies, compared to birds which were rehabilitated after being oiled, despite fewer relocated birds being seen at their home colony.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Various techniques have been employed to deter birds from landing in hazardous water bodies, especially contaminated mine-tailings ponds. Tailing ponds store water-borne, often toxic, waste material derived from mining activities, power plant evaporation ponds can contain sodium decahydrate (which can crystallize on feathers) and oil spills can also have catastrophic effects on seabirds (see ‘Clean birds following oil spills’).
Numerous ‘conventional’ deterrent techniques are used e.g. scarecrows, and propane-powered gas guns (that produce periodic loud explosions). However, their effectiveness often declines over time as birds habituate to deterrent stimuli (Bomford & O’Brien 1990). Therefore, radar-activated on-demand systems (which activate deterrents located in/around ponds only upon the approach of flying birds) have been developed in an attempt to reduce the problem of habituation (Ronconi et al. 2004).
Repellents are also used to deter birds, although the literature on the effectiveness of these is smaller.
Similar interventions are discussed in the chapter on aquaculture, with the aim of reducing conflict with fish-eating birds.

452: Use visual and acoustic ‘scarers’ to deter birds from landing on pools polluted by mining or sewage
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:


Key Messages:

Two studies found lower bird mortality or fewer birds rescued from toxic ponds when deterrent systems were used. Four of five studies found that fewer birds landed on pools with deterrents than controls, although one of these found that the effect was weaker for grebes compared to wildfowl and absent for waders. One study that used regular broadcasts of different sounds found that it had no impact on bird behaviour.
Two studies investigated different systems and found that radar-operated systems were more effective than systems that worked at random intervals. One of these studies also found that loud noises were more effective than moving peregrine falcons Falco peregrinus models.

453: Use repellents to deter birds from landing on pools polluted by mining
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
If the threat from pollution is not from birds landing on ponds but from consuming the water, then repellents may be a more effective or inexpensive method of reducing harm.
 

Key Messages:
A randomised, replicated and controlled ex situ trial from the USA found that fewer common starlings Sturnus vulgaris consumed contaminated water when it was treated with repellents, compared to untreated water.

454: Reduce pesticide or herbicide use generally
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Pesticides and herbicides are likely to reduce the plant and insect diversity on farmland and this, in turn, can reduce food supplies for birds. Reducing these inputs may therefore help bird populations. Reductions can be accomplished by using smaller quantities or fewer applications. See also ‘Pay farmers to cover the costs of conservation measures’ and ‘Reduce management intensity on permanent grassland’.
 

Key Messages:

A single small study from the UK investigated population level effects of reduced chemical inputs, and found that the populations of some species increased when pesticide use was restricted alongside other interventions.
Three studies, two replicated, one controlled, from the UK found that some or all species were found at higher densities on sites with reduced pesticide inputs, in one case with other interventions as well. Five studies from the UK, four replicated, four controlled, found that some or all species were not found at higher densities on fields or sites with reduced chemical inputs, or were not associated with reduced inputs.
A controlled before-and-after study from the UK found that grey partridge Perdix perdix chicks had higher survival on sites with reduced pesticide applications. A replicated study from the UK found that reduced chemical inputs had a negative relationship with partridge brood size and no relationship with survival or the ratio of young to old birds.

455: Restrict certain pesticides or other agricultural chemicals for birds
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Certain agricultural chemicals such as DDT, diclofenac and strychnine are now know to be extremely harmful to birds, either by direct poisoning, or interfering with reproduction. Many of these chemicals are now restricted or prohibited, but many others still remain in use. For example, some organophosphates such as monocrotophos are used to control insect pests and have caused mass poisoning incidents in raptors and cranes Grus spp. (Goldstein et al. 1999; Pain et al. 2004).

456: Provide food for vultures to reduce mortality from diclofenac
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug has caused widespread and dramatic declines in vulture populations in South Asia by inducing renal failure and visceral gout in birds feeding on the carcasses of livestock previously treated with the drug (Oaks et al. 2004). Whereas, there are measures to reduce its use and replace it with non-toxic alternatives (Pain et al. 2008), it has so far remained on sale. Vulture ‘restaurants’ have therefore been proposed as a method of reducing mortality until the drug is phased out, by providing a safe, uncontaminated source of food for the remaining vulture populations.
Other studies on the provision of food (for reasons other than diclofenac avoidance) are discussed in ‘Supplementary feeding’.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Organic fertilisers include farmyard manure and soil treatments derived from sewage sludge, whilst mineral fertilisers are manufactured preparations of nitrate, phosphate or 'NPK'. Organic fertilisers have the potential benefit of contributing to better soil structure and therefore reducing soil erosion, whilst also, potentially reducing the risk of down-stream eutrophication.

461: Leave headlands in fields unsprayed (conservation headlands)
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Conservation headland management (under European agri-environment schemes) involves restricted fertiliser, herbicide and insecticide spraying in a 6 m margin of sown arable crop. The prescription allows selected herbicide applications to control certain weeds or invasive species.
 

Key Messages:

Three studies from Europe, two replicated, found that conservation headlands were frequently used by some of all of the bird species studied, or were strongly associated with species. A review from the UK found that grey partridge Perdix perdix populations were far larger on farms with conservation headlands and other interventions in place than other farms. Two replicated studies from Europe found that species were not associated with, or were no more abundant on, conservation headlands, compared with control fields.
All four studies, three replicated, that investigated survival found higher grey partridge Perdix perdix chick or adult survival on sites with conservation headlands than control sites. One found that this difference was not significant.
Five studies from Europe, four replicated, found larger grey partridge broods on farms with conservation headlands, one study found that differences were not significant. One replicated study from the UK found that fewer broods were found in fields with conservation headlands. Another replicated study from the UK found no relationship between conservation headlands and partridge brood size or young to adult ratio.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Buffer strips along rivers and streams are designed to reduce pollution from agricultural or other activities from reaching waterways. They should reduce soil erosion and ensure that water remains clearer and less polluted.
Buffer strips can consist of one or more of: a zone of native, river-side trees; a second zone of native shrubs and a third zone of native grasses and forbs.
 

Key Messages:

We did not find any evidence describing the impact of riparian strips on reducing water pollution and how this affected bird populations. However, riparian strips also provide valuable habitats in their own right. Studies describing the use of riparian strips by birds are described in ‘Habitat restoration and creation’.

466: Reduce incidental mortality from birds being attracted to artificial lights 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Many species of birds fly at night and can be attracted to artificial lights. This can be detrimental both through direct collision mortality, but also because seabirds especially can be vulnerable to predators or dehydration if they are downed by collisions, even if they are not hurt.
Dangerous lights can be designed specifically to be seen, for example on communications towers or lighthouses, or can simply be lights used at night, for example, domestic lighting.
 

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for reduced incidental mortality from birds being attracted to artificial lights.

The simplest way to prevent birds from being attracted to and colliding with lights is to turn them off. However this might not be practical for economic, safety or other considerations.
 

Key Messages:
A before-and-after study from the UK found that fewer seabirds (Manx shearwaters Puffinus puffinus, European storm petrels Hydrobates pelagicus and Leach’s storm petrels Oceanodroma leucorhoa) were attracted to artificial lighting and downed when lighting was reduced at night, compared to when normal lighting was in place.

Background information and definitions:
A lot of the mortality caused by birds crashing into lights is not direct collision mortality, but caused by stunned and injured birds being predated (e.g. by gulls after crashing onto oil rigs, van de Laar 2007) or dying of dehydration. If volunteers or conservationists can collect downed birds soon after they crash and rehabilitate them, they may be able to greatly reduce collision mortality.

473: Water nesting mounds to increase incubation success in malleefowl
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Malleefowl Leipoa ocellata and other megapodes build large nesting mounds, filled with vegetation. This vegetation rots and produces heat which then incubates the eggs. This process requires the vegetation to be damp, meaning that eggs may die in dry conditions. Artificially adding water to the mounds may help prevent this.
 

Key Messages:
A small controlled in Australia found that two malleefowl Leipoa ocellata nests were abandoned after they dried out, despite being watered, although unwatered nests were abandoned much earlier.

474: Replace nesting substrate following severe weather
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Many birds require specific substrates to nest on, and if flooding or heavy rains remove these then they may not nest. Replacing the substrate following removal may therefore help a colony to survive. Most studies describing the reconstruction of nesting habitats or the protection of nests from flooding are described in ‘Provide artificial nesting sites’.
 
 

Key Messages:
Two before-and-after studies from Canada found that common tern Sterna hirundo populations increased at one colony where nesting substrates were replaced, but decreased at a second. Several other interventions were used at both sites, making it difficult to evaluate the effects of substrate replacement.

475: Use artificial visual and auditory stimuli to induce breeding in wild populations 
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Some species that nest in colonies may require a ‘critical mass’ of individuals to be present before breeding behaviour is stimulated. If this is the case, it might be possible to help very small populations (beneath this threshold) to breed by using decoys and vocalisations to stimulate courtship behaviours.

476: Rehabilitation of injured and treated birds
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Relatively large and slow-reproducing species, such as raptors, can be badly affected by increases in adult mortality. Rehabilitating birds that have been injured may therefore be an important conservation action, particularly if it occurs on a large scale. In 1978, there were approximately 225 active wildlife or raptor rehabilitation programmes in the USA (Hamilton et al. 1988), showing that if they are effective, such programmes could make a real difference to bird populations.

Key Messages:

Two replicated studies from the USA and UK found that 40% and 25% of raptors were released following rehabilitation. The USA study also found that 32% of owls were released.
Three replicated studies from the USA all found relatively high survival of released raptors, with only 2.4% of birds being recovered (i.e. found dead, 1) and 66–68% survival over two weeks and six weeks. One study found that mortality rates were higher for owls than raptors.

477: Remove eggs from wild nests to increase reproductive output 
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
If a bird population is at a very low level then removing eggs from nests can be used to encourage females to continue laying, with some species replacing eggs as they are removed. The removed eggs can then be hand-reared (see ‘Artificially incubate and hand-rear birds in captivity’) or fostered (‘Foster eggs or chicks with wild conspecifics’ and ‘Foster eggs or chicks with non-conspecifics’), increasing the productivity of the species.
Alternatively, removing eggs from wild nests may actually increase the success of these nests, possibly due to competition between siblings. Studies discussing this aspect of the intervention are described below.
 

Key Messages:

A replicated study from Mauritius found that harvesting entire clutches appeared to increase Mauritius kestrels Falco punctatus productivity more effectively than removing individual eggs as they were laid.
A replicated study over 30 years in Canada (Kuyt 1996) found that wild whooping cranes Grus americana reproductive success was higher for nests with one or two eggs removed than for control nests.
A single study from the USA found that removing bald eagle Haliaeetus leucocephalus eggs from wild nests for hand-rearing did not appear to greatly affect the wild population.

478: Provide artificial nesting sites for divers/loons
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Divers or loons (Gaviidae) are specialised for swimming and diving and cannot move quickly on land. This means they are vulnerable to predators and frequently nest on small islands and patches of vegetation. Providing these habitats where they are absent may increase the number of birds using a site, increase their reproductive success, or allow the colonisation of new lakes.
 

Key Messages:

A replicated before-and-after study from the UK found that there was a very large increase in loon productivity on lakes provided with nesting rafts, with a corresponding increase in productivity across the whole country.
Two studies from the USA found higher nesting success on lakes with floating  nesting rafts, compared to sites without rafts, but no new territories were established on lakes without loons but with rafts.
A replicated study from the UK found that loons used nesting rafts and artificial islands in some areas of the UK, but not others.

481: Provide artificial nesting sites for burrow-nesting seabirds
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Many petrels and shearwaters and auks nest underground in burrows dug themselves or burrowing mammals such as rabbits. This means that they require very different artificial nests to the ground- and tree-nesting species discussed in the previous section.
 

Key Messages:

Four studies from across the world found evidence for population increases or new populations being established in petrel species following the provision of nest boxes. In two cases nest boxes were combined with the translocation of chicks or other interventions.
Six studies from across the world found high occupancy rates for artificial burrows by seabirds, with three finding that occupancy increased over time, taking years to build up. Three studies from across the world found very low occupancy rates for artificial burrows used by petrel species.
Eight studies from across the world found that the productivity of birds using artificial burrows was high, in many cases as high or higher than in natural burrows. One replicated study from the USA and a small study from the Galapagos found low productivity of petrels using artificial burrows.

482: Provide artificial nesting sites for wildfowl
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Wildfowl nest both in trees (e.g. wood ducks Aix sponsa and goldeneyes Bucephala spp.) and on the ground (e.g. dabbling ducks Anas spp.). These different strategies require very different interventions if conservationists are to provide nesting sites. We have therefore split studies describing the provision of artificial islands and floating rafts for wildfowl (described in the next section) from those describing the provision of nest boxes and other artificial nests.
One study, Divoky & Suydam (1995), describes the use of a nesting shelter for ground-nesting common eiders Somateria mollissima, and is included in this section as it is providing a shelter, rather than nesting substrate.
Divoky, G.J. & Suydam, R. (1995) An artificial nest site for arctic nesting common eiders. Journal of Field Ornithology, 66, 270–276.
 

Key Messages:

Six studies from North America and Europe found that wildfowl populations increased with the provision of artificial nests, although one study from Finland found that there was no increase in the number of broods or chicks in areas with nest boxes.
Twelve studies from North America investigated the success of nests in artificial nests with nine finding that success and productivity was high, sometimes higher than or similar to natural nests. Two studies found that success for some species in nest boxes was lower than for natural nests. Two studies investigated the impact of nest box location, finding that hidden nests had higher success and that nests over water were more successful than those in trees over land.
Nineteen studies from across the world investigated occupancy rates of artificial nests, finding that rates varied from no use of 25 nest boxes in a single site in Indonesia to 100% occupancy across 20 sites in the USA with one study finding that nest boxes were used more than natural cavities. Two studies found that occupancy rates increased over time, whilst four studies found that occupancy rates appeared to be affected by design or positioning.
Three studies from North America found that nest boxes could have other impacts on reproduction and behaviour, with common starlings Sturna vulgaris (a nest site competitor) avoiding some nest box designs; hidden nest boxes having lower intra-specific nest parasitism than easily visible boxes and female common eiders Somateria mollissima losing less weight over incubation if they were nesting in shelters, compared to birds nesting in the open, although they lost weight quicker after nesting.

488: Provide artificial nesting sites for raptors
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Many birds of prey return every year to the same nesting site, adding material so that the nest gets larger and larger. In extreme cases, this can damage the tree or structure that the nest is on, resulting in the nest falling. Providing platforms or other robust structures for birds to build on may, therefore, help to increase reproductive success.
 

Key Messages:

Nine studies from North America and Spain found that raptors used artificial nesting platforms, although one describes low levels of use and another describes use increasing over time.
Two studies from the USA describe increases in populations or population densities of raptors following the installation of artificial nesting platforms.
Three studies describe successful use of platforms, whilst three describe lower productivity or failed nesting attempts, although these studies only describe a single nesting attempt each.

489: Provide artificial nesting sites for falcons
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
There is a large literature on artificial nest use by falcons, falcons are known to use relatively small nest boxes, compared to other birds of prey and some species (e.g. the lesser kestrel Falco naumanni) nest communally. Therefore we have separated out studies investigating artificial nest use by falcons from those investigating other birds of prey.
 
 

Key Messages:

Four studies from the USA and Europe found that local populations of falcons increased following the installation of artificial nesting sites, with one reporting that there was no decline in natural nest use following the installation and use of nest boxes. A replicated study from Canada found that the local population of American kestrels Falco sparverius did not increase following the erection of nest boxes.
Eight studies from across the world found that the success and productivity of falcons in nest boxes was high and equal to, or higher than those in natural nests. Four studies from across the world found that productivities in nest boxes were lower than in natural nests or in previously published results, or that some falcons were evicted from their nests by barn owls Tyto alba.
Four studies from across the world found no differences in productivity between nest box designs or positions, whilst two, from Spain and Israel found that productivity in boxes varied between designs and habitats.
Twenty-one studies from across the world found nest boxes were used by falcons, with one in the UK finding that nest boxes were not used at all. One study from Canada found that falcons preferentially nested in nest boxes over natural nest sites; a study from Mauritius found that most breeding attempts were in nest boxes 
Four studies found that use increased over time. Seven studies found that position or design affected use, whilst three found no differences between design or positioning.

Key Messages:

Three studies from the UK appeared to show increases in local populations of owls following the installation of artificial nests, although the authors from one note that they could not rule out birds merely switching from natural nest sites. Another UK study found that providing nesting sites when renovating buildings maintained barn owl Tyto alba populations, whilst they declined at sites without nests.
Four studies from the USA and the UK found high levels of breeding success in artificial nests, three finding equal or higher productivity than natural nests. A replicated, controlled study from the USA found lower productivity from artificial nests, whilst a replicated, controlled study from Finland found that artificial nests were only successful in the absence of larger owls and a replicated, controlled study from Hungary found that fledglings from artificial nests were less likely to be found alive after one year.
Four studies from the USA and Europe found that artificial nests were used at least as frequently as natural nesting sites. Five studies from across the world found that owls used artificial nests, with one finding that use increased over time, although only for one of two species.
Three studies found that owls differentiated between nests in different positions, whilst five studies found that different designs of nests differed in occupancy or productivity. Three studies found occupancy did not differ between designs and two found no differences in productivity for different designs.

Background information and definitions:
Oilbirds Steatornis capripensis are a unique, nocturnal species in their own family Steatornithidae, related to nightjars, potoos and frogmouths. However, unlike their relatives oilbirds feed entirely on fruit and nest and roost in caves in northern and central South America. It is thought that the availability of nesting and roosting sites in these caves may limit populations, although increasing habitat destruction is also threatening the species (Thomas 1999).

496: Provide artificial nesting sites for woodpeckers
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Woodpeckers typically nest in hollows in trees. These are normally hollowed out from soft wood. Therefore, if this substrate is lacking in a site, providing it may be beneficial. Providing dead wood and ‘snags’ is described in ‘Natural system modifications’, whilst providing artificial snags, typically made of polystyrene cylinders is described below.
Alternatively, ‘cavity inserts’ can be provided. These consist of a nest box inserted into a tree. Full details of their installation can be found in Allen (1991), but basically consist of cutting a 10 x 25 x 6 cm block out of a live tree and gluing a nest box into place to give the impression of a tree with a hole and a nesting cavity. These inserts are used most frequently to provide nesting habitats for red-cockaded woodpeckers Picoides borealis.

Key Messages:

Four studies from the USA found local increases in red-cockaded woodpecker Picoides borealis populations or the successful colonisation of new areas following the installation of ‘cavity inserts’ (described above). One study also found that the productivity of birds using the inserts was significantly higher than the regional average.
Two studies from the USA found that red-cockaded woodpeckers Picoides borealis used cavity inserts, in one case more frequently than making their own holes or using natural cavities. One study from the USA found that woodpeckers roosted, but did not nest, frequently in nest boxes.
Five studies from the USA found that some woodpeckers excavated holes in artificial snags but only ever roosted in excavated holes or in nest boxes provided.
A small study in the USA found that modifying artificial nests to allow easy access did not alter the behaviour of birds using them.

A before-and-after study from Costa Rica found that the local population of scarlet macaws Ara macao increased following the installation of nest boxes along with several other interventions.
Five studies from South and Central America and Mauritius that nest boxes were used by several species of parrots, with one finding an increase in use over time until the majority of the population used them. One replicated study from Peru found that blue-and-yellow macaws Ara ararauna only used modified palms, not ‘boxes’, whilst another replicated study found that scarlet macaws Ara macao used both PVC and wooden boxes, but that PVC lasted much longer.
Four studies from Venezuela and Columbia found that several species very rarely, if ever, used nest boxes.
Six studies from Central and South America found that parrots nested successfully in nest boxes, with two species showing higher levels of recruitment into the population following nest box erection and another finding that success rates for artificial nests were similar to natural nests.
Three studies from South America found that artificial nests had low success rates, in two cases due to poaching.

498: Provide artificial nesting sites for songbirds
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:


Key Messages:

Only three studies out of 66 from across the world found low rates of nest box occupancy, although this may be partially the result of publishing biases. Thrushes, crows, swallows and New World warblers were the target species with low rates of use. Thrushes, crows, finches, swallows, wrens, tits, Old World and tyrant flycatchers, New World blackbirds, sparrows, waxbills, starlings and ovenbirds all used nest boxes. One study from the USA found that wrens used nest boxes more frequently than natural cavities.
Five studies from across the world found higher population densities or population growth rates in areas with nest boxes, whilst one study from the USA found higher species richness in areas with nest boxes. One study from Chile found that breeding populations (but not non-breeding populations) were higher for two species when next boxes were provided.
Twelve studies from across the world found that productivity of birds in nest boxes was higher or similar to those in natural nests. One study found there were more nesting attempts in areas with more nest boxes, although a study from Canada found no differences in behaviour or productivity between areas with high or low densities of nest boxes. Two studies from Europe found lower predation of some species using nest boxes. However, three studies from the USA found low production in nest boxes, either in absolute terms or relative to natural nests.
Thirteen studies from across the world founds that use, productivity or usurpation varied with nest box design, whilst seven found no difference in occupation rates or success with different designs.
Similarly, fourteen studies found different occupation or success rates depending on the position or orientation of artificial nest sites. Two studies found no difference in success with different positions.

499: Clean nest boxes to increase occupancy or reproductive success
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Old nest boxes may contain parasites and so reduce breeding success in them, or they may provide a suitable base for building new nests. Cleaning them out may, therefore, have a positive or a negative impact on nest site choice and reproductive success.
 

Key Messages:

Five studies from Spain and North America found that various songbirds preferentially nested in cleaned nest boxes, compared to used ones. One study from the USA found that eastern bluebirds showed this preference, but most did not switch from a soiled to a cleaned nest box. One study from the USA found that birds showed an avoidance of heavily-soiled boxes and one from Canada found that tree swallows Tachycineta bicolor preferentially selected nests which were sterilised by microwaving.
Two studies from the USA found that eastern bluebirds Sialia sialis and house wrens Troglodytes aedon preferentially nested in uncleaned nest boxes, and one study found that prothonotary warblers Protonotaria citrea showed no preference for cleaned or uncleaned boxes. 
None of the five studies that investigated it found any difference in success or parasitism levels between cleaned and uncleaned nest boxes.

505: Remove vegetation to create nesting areas
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Many birds nest on bare substrate or in areas of sparse vegetation and may abandon a site if it becomes overgrown. Removing vegetation may therefore help to maintain a breeding colony, or attract birds to a new area.
This intervention describes the general removal of vegetation, studies discussing the removal of specific species are described in ‘Threat: Invasive alien and other problematic species - Remove problematic vegetation’.
 

Key Messages:

Two out of six studies found that the number of waders and terns nesting in an area increased following the removal of vegetation, and another found that a tern colony moved to an area prepared by removing vegetation. Two of these studies used multiple interventions at once. One study found a decrease in colony size after several interventions, including vegetation control.
A study from the UK found that gulls and terns nested in an area cleared of vegetation and a controlled study from Puerto Rico found that although no terns nested in plots cleared completely of vegetation, more nested in partially-cleared plots than in uncleared plots.
A before-and-after study from Canada found that tern nesting success was higher after plots were cleared of vegetation and other interventions were used.

Background information and definitions:
If populations are reduced to extremely low levels and have low reproductive success then extremely intensive monitoring can be used to ‘guard nests’ and protect them from a range of threats through direct intervention. Due to the intensive nature of this work it is only likely to be viable if there are volunteers available to do it, and the population being monitored is very small.

507: Foster eggs or chicks of gannets and boobies with wild conspecifics
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Natural variations in reproductive output can be detrimental when populations are very small, for example if pairs fail to produce fertile eggs or some pairs repeatedly fail to raise offspring successfully. One way to minimise this problem is to foster eggs and chicks between nests. Eggs and chicks from nests with more offspring than they are likely to be able to raise can be moved to those with infertile eggs. Alternatively, if a pair produces fertile eggs or healthy chicks but consistently fails to raise chicks then it may be possible to transfer offspring to a more successful pair.
In other circumstances it may be possible to foster chicks with other species (‘cross-fostering’). Studies describing this intervention are discussed in the following section ‘Foster eggs or chicks with wild non-conspecifics (cross-fostering).’
 

Key Messages:

However, it may be possible to foster chicks and eggs to a similar, but more abundant species, if one is present. This can increase the reproductive output of the wild population of the endangered species, or even allow for the reintroduction of a population into parts of its former range.
 

Key Messages:

A replicated study from the USA found that the survival of cross-fostered yellow warbler Dendroica petechia chicks was lower than previously-published rates for the species, although incubation and nestling periods were very similar.
A replicated and controlled study from Norway found that the success of cross-fostering small songbirds varied depending on the species of chick and foster birds. However, only great tits P. major raised by blue tits P. caeruleus had lower pairing success than control birds, whilst blue tits raised by coal tits P. ater had higher recruitment than controls, or those raised by great tits.

521: Provide supplementary food
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Food supply is one of the key factors determining mortality and reproductive rates. Providing supplementary food is therefore often used as a technique to support small populations. However, feeding is only likely to have a positive effect on a population if the food supply is limiting either reproduction or survival. Because of differences in population responses to food during the breeding season and at other times, we have divided studies into those investigating the impact of feeding on reproduction and those investigating adult survival.
As with all interventions in this synopsis, studies that investigate population-level effects are most useful for conservationists. This is especially true for supplementary feeding, as many birds have large foraging ranges and the appearance of increased numbers at a feeding station, or even in the habitat surrounding feeders may not represent an increase in numbers but a redistribution of the same birds, and could even hide a population decline.
It is also important to note that the effect of providing food can be confounded by many factors. For example, variations in natural food supplies due to population cycles or irregular fruiting, whilst droughts or other extreme weather and pollution levels can also affect how populations respond to food.
 
 
Providing supplementary food can also be used to improve the success of release programs for captive-bred birds. Studies describing this intervention are discussed in ‘Captive breeding, rearing and releases (ex situ conservation) – Provide supplementary food after release’.
 

Key Messages:
A replicated, controlled study from Europe found that overall, gardens with supplementary food did not contain more species than those without. However, there was some evidence that gardens with supplementary food in five countries did contain more species than unfed ones, when countries were analysed separately.

Two studies from the USA found evidence for higher population densities of magpies and American blackbirds in areas provided with supplementary food, whilst two studies from the UK and Canada found that population densities did not appear to be affected by feeding.
Twelve studies from across the world found that breeding productivity was higher for fed birds than controls. The increases were through higher hatching or fledging rates, or higher chick survival or recruitment rates. One study from the USA found that these increases were only found in dry years.
Eleven studies from Europe and the USA found that fed birds had no higher, or even lower breeding productivity or chick survival than control birds.
Nine studies from Europe and North America found that the eggs of fed birds were larger or heavier, or that the chicks of fed birds were in better physical condition: being larger, heavier, faster growing, more symmetrical or having a better immune response. In one study this was only true in a heavily polluted site. However, eight studies from across the world found no evidence for better condition or increased size in the eggs or chicks of fed birds. 
Six studies from across the world found that food-supplemented pairs laid larger clutches than unfed birds, whilst 14 studies from Europe and North America found that fed birds did not lay larger clutches, or even laid smaller ones.
Fifteen studies from across the world found that birds supplied with supplementary food began nesting or laying earlier than controls, although in two studies this was only true for young females or in one of two habitats. In one study, a high fat, high protein diet had a greater effect on laying date than a high fat, low protein diet.­ One study found that fed birds had shorter incubations than controls whilst another found that fed birds re-nested quicker than controls and had shorter second incubations.
Four studies from the USA and Europe found that fed birds did not lay any earlier than controls.
Seven studies from across the world found that fed parent birds showed positive behavioural responses to feeding, such as being more likely to re-nest, less likely to be parasitized or  showing better anti-predator responses, spending more time incubating or building larger nests.
Three studies from across the world found neutral or negative responses to feeding, including being more likely to be invaded by conspecifics, making no more breeding attempts or showing no preference for fed nest boxes compared to controls.

541: Provide supplementary food to allow the rescue of a second chick
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Many vultures and birds of prey lay more eggs each year than they can raise, with the final chick hatching several days after the first. This chick will always be weaker and is almost always killed by its siblings or starves to death as it cannot compete for food. It is thought that this chick acts as ‘insurance’ in case the older chicks die.
In very rare species, it may be beneficial to ‘rescue’ the younger chick, but doing so can be difficult. It is possible that providing extra food will allow the yonger chick to survive for long enough for a rescue attempt to be mounted.

Well-fed animals are likely to be in better physical condition than those with too little food: having greater muscle mass and larger fat supplies to help them survive lean periods. However, it is worth noting that species that forage in groups can have dominance hierarchies, which alter the relationship between weight and fitness. For example Gentle and Gosler (2001) found that, amongst great tits Parus major in Oxfordshire, England, more dominant birds had a lower mass than subdominants, particularly when perceived predation risk was high. Birds with lower masses are better able to take off and therefore escape predators than heavier birds (Krams 2002). However, because of their dominance, they were able to usurp other birds from food resources when hungry. Care should therefore be taken when interpreting results which do not directly examine survival.

550: Provide supplementary food for hummingbirds to increase adult survival
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
We have separated the literature on feeding hummingbirds from other species because they feed on a food source, nectar, very different from most other birds (although see ‘Nectar-feeding songbirds’ later in this chapter).
Successfully providing food for nectar-feeding birds is difficult because they can show strong preferences for different sugar solutions, depending on their sugar concentrations, and which sugar is used. Brown et al. 2008 argue that care must be taken in interpreting the results of preference studies, because different studies measure solution concentration in different ways. For example, they test the preferences of malachite sunbirds Nectarinia famosa (a songbird, not a hummingbird) and found that birds appeared to show a preference for sucrose over hexose, no preference or a preference for hexose over sucrose depending on whether equimolar (i.e. with the same number of sugar moleculars/ml), equiweight (the same weight of sugar/ml) or equicalorific (the same energy content/ml) solutions were used.
 

Key Messages:

 Four studies from the USA found that three species of hummingbird showed preferences for higher concentrations of sucrose (measured in weight/volume), consuming more and visiting feeders more frequently. 
 A study from the USA found that black-chinned hummingbirds Archilochus alexanderi preferentially fed on sugar solutions over artificial sweeteners, and that increasing the viscosity of these solutions (so they appeared more like sugar solutions) did not affect their consumption. 
 Two studies from Mexico (ex situ) and Argentina found that four species showed preferences for sucrose over fructose or glucose when equiweight solutions were compared.  One found that birds also preferentially fed on sucrose over a sucrose-glucose mix, the other found no preference for sucrose over a glucose-fructose mix. 
A controlled study from the USA found that Anna’s hummingbirds Calypte anna showed a preference for red-dyed sugar solutions over five other colours, but only if different colours were presented at the same time.
A replicated study from the USA found that rufous hummingbirds Selasphorous rufus preferentially fed on feeders placed higher, over lower ones.

Key Messages:


Seven studies from Europe and the USA found higher densities or larger populations in various songbird species in areas close to supplementary food. Six studies from Europe, Canada and Japan found that population trends or densities in some species were no different between fed and unfed areas. The American study found that populations appeared to follow food, with populations increasing after feeders were erected and decreasing after they were removed.
Four studies from Canada, Europe, Japan and the USA found that birds had higher survival when supplied with supplementary food. However, in two studies this was only apparent in females or in one of two species studied. A controlled study in the USA found no evidence that birds were dependent on supplementary food: when food was removed, previously fed birds did not have lower survival than controls.
A replicated, controlled study from the USA found that song sparrows Melospiza melodia had lower survival with feeding stations in their territories. 
Six studies from Europe and the USA found that birds supplied with supplementary food were in better physical condition or had larger fat supplies than unfed birds. However, in one replicated, controlled study this was only the case for females; in another two, only one of three species showed better condition, with one species in one study showing lower condition when fed; a final replicated and controlled study found that differences between treatments were only apparent in the breeding season.
 Two studies investigated the effect of feeding on behaviours: a randomised, replicated and controlled study in the USA found that male Carolina wrens Thryothorus ludovicianus spent more time singing when supplied with food; a replicated, controlled study in Sweden found no behavioural differences between wood nuthatches Sitta europaea supplied with food, and unfed birds. 
Thirteen studies from the UK, Canada and the USA investigated use of feeders. Four studies from the USA and the UK found high use of supplementary food by several species, with up to 21% of birds’ daily energy needs coming from feeders. However, another UK study found very low use of food, possibly because the feeder was not positioned close to natural food sources.
One UK study found that use of feeders peaked in midwinter, although another found that the exact timing of peak use varied between species.
Two replicated trials from the UK finding that the use of feeders increased with distance to houses and decreased with distance to cover, whilst a replicated Candadian study found that American goldfinches Carduelis tristis preferred using bird feeders in high positions. A large-scale replicated study in the UK found that preferences for feeder locations varied between species.
Three studies from the UK argue that placing feeders over 1 km apart, and possibly 1.1–1.3 km apart will maximise their use whilst keeping the intervention practical.

553: Provide supplementary food for nectar-feeding songbirds to increase adult survival
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
As with experiments on hummingbirds, experiments on the preferences of nectar-feeding songbirds can be difficult to interpret and compare between studies. See ‘Provide supplementary food to increase adult survival – Hummingbirds’ for details.
 

Key Messages:

Two studies from Australia and New Zealand found that ten species of honeyeaters and stitchbirds Notiomystis cincta readily used feeders supplying sugar solutions, with seasonal variations varying between species and stitchbirds spending more time foraging for insects when food was supplied.
A series of ex situ trials using southern African birds found that most species tested showed a preference for sucrose solutions over glucose or fructose. One study found that sunbirds and sugarbirds only showed such a preference at low (equimolar) concentrations. Two more studies found that two species showed preferences for sucrose when comparing 20% (by weight) solutions, although a third species did not show this preference. All species rejected solutions with xylose (a natural sugar in nectar) added. A final study found that sucrose preferences only became apparent at equicalorific concentrations high enough for birds to subsist on.

554: Can supplementary feeding increase predation or parasitism?
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Supplementary feeding could potentially have deleterious effects on both the target population, for example through spreading disease or drawing birds to feeding areas where they can easily be predated, or non-target species, for example by bringing large numbers of predators into the area.
 

Key Messages:

A replicated, controlled study in the USA found that providing seeds in predictable areas did not increase predation on seven species of songbird. 
A replicated and controlled trial in Spain found higher levels of potentially dangerous gut microflora when fed on livestock carrion, compared to those fed on wild rabbits. A replicated study in Spain found higher levels of predation on artificial nests close to carcasses provided for vultures.

Background information and definitions:
Supplementary feeding can be an intensive and potentially expensive intervention. However, it may be possible to achieve the same results by planting crops or establishing prey populations.
 

Key Messages:

One pre-1950 study in the USA found that waterfowl fed on specially-planted rye grass.
Three studies from North America and Sweden found that attempts to support populations by establishing prey did not succeed. Whooping cranes Grus americana in the USA preferentially fed on scattered grains, over planted crops; attempts in Sweden to boost macroinvertebrate numbers were not successful and great horned owls Bubo virginianus in Canada did not respond to induced increases in prey populations.

Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
If prey are plentiful but birds have low hunting success then it may be possible to increase population sizes by making hunting more effective, for example by providing perches for birds to use.
 

Key Messages:

Two studies from the USA found that raptors and other birds used perches provided, whilst a replicated and controlled study in Sweden found that raptors used clearcuts with perches significantly more than those without.
However, a controlled study from the USA found that overall bird abundances were not higher in areas provided with perches and a small controlled cross-over trial on an island in the USA found that San Clemente loggerhead shrikes Lanius ludovicianus mearnsi did not alter their hunting patterns or increase their success rates following the installation of perches in their territories.

Background information and definitions:
In urban environments, many people feed garden birds in front of their windows, potentially increasing the risk of birds flying into windows. Determining how distance from windows affects collision rates is therefore very important. Other interventions designed to reduce collisions with windows are discussed in ‘Threat: Residential and commercial development’.

559: Provide calcium supplements to increase survival or reproductive success
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Calcium is vital for birds to produce eggshell and to produce strong bones, and parents of dependent young therefore feed chicks on calcium-rich foods and precocial chicks (i.e. those that can walk and forage for themselves) seek out calcium-rich foods.
In acidified environments (e.g. those subject to acid rain) the supply of calcium may be limited, leading to low reproductive success. Therefore providing birds with supplementary calcium in a useable form, frequently fragments of bone or shell may increase reproductive output and the subsequent survival of chicks.
 

Key Messages:

Eight studies from across the world, including a literature review from across the world found evidence for positive effects of calcium supplementation on several bird species. 
Positive effects included lower incidence of bone disease, higher fledging succes, larger broods, higher quality eggs or chicks and better physical condition of female parents. Not all species reacted similarly.
Six studies including a literature review did not find any evidence for increased reproductive success in at least one of the species supplied with supplementary calcium.
One replicated study from Europe found that birds took calcium supplied, and birds at polluted sites took more than those at cleaner sites. The effects on fitness were not monitored.

566: Translocate individuals
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Translocations, also known as relocations, reintroductions, restocking, or repatriations, involve the intentional release of captive-bred and/or wild-caught birds into the wild in order to re-establish a population that has been lost, or augment a critically small population. This can reduce the risk of inbreeding, or simply increase the range of a species and therefore the maximum possible population. Translocations are also frequently used to move birds to areas that have been cleared of invasive predators, particularly on islands. This intervention is not the same as that of periodically moving next boxes to prevent predators from learning their locations, discussed in ‘Invasive and other problematic species’.
Translocations are typically expensive and may risk spreading pathogens to previously unexposed areas.
 

Key Messages:
A review of 239 bird translocation programmes found 63–67% resulted in establishment of self-sustaining populations.

567: Translocate megapodes
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Megapodes are a family of birds found in East Asia, Australasia and Oceania that build large nest mounds filled with vegetation which rots to heat and incubate the eggs. The chicks are extremely independent and can run immediately after hatching, with some species even able to fly on the day they hatch. As eggs are not incubated by parents, they can be translocated and re-buried elsewhere.
 

Key Messages:
A replicated study from Indonesia found that up to 78% of maleo Macrocephalon maleo eggs hatched after translocation, with higher success if eggs were reburied as they were found. There was only anecdotal evidence that the translocations increased local populations.

568: Translocate petrels and shearwaters
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Many species of Procellariiformes (petrels, shearwaters and albatrosses) breed on offshore or oceanic islands and have suffered severe population declines and local extinctions due to introduced mammalian predators. Although many islands have now been cleared of predators, Procellariiformes show very strong homing instincts and return to the area they fledged from to breed. This means that birds are unlikely to recolonise islands, or even other areas of the same island, even if it is safe. Translocations may therefore be a suitable way to increase the range and population size of these species. Using decoys and vocalisations are also possible methods to encourage recolonisation, these are discussed later in this chapter (‘Use vocalisations to attract birds to safe areas’ and ‘Use decoys to attract birds to safe areas’).
 

Key Messages:
Two studies from Australia and one from New Zealand found that colonies of burrow-nesting Procellariiformes were successfully established on two islands, and in uninhabited areas of another following the translocation and hand-rearing of chicks.

Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Thirty-three species of rails and crakes (Rallidae) are globally threatened, of which 13 are flightless (Taylor 1996). These species are unlikely to rapidly colonise new areas or recolonise former ranges, especially as several live on islands. Therefore translocating birds to new suitable habitats is likely to be an important conservation tool.

Key Messages:

Three reviews of two translocation programmes in the Seychelles and New Zealand found high survival amongst translocated rails.
All studies found that translocated birds bred successfully, although one found that translocated takahe Porphyrio hochstetteri had lower reproductive success than birds in the source population. The other New Zealand study found no differences in breeding success between recently and formerly translocated takahe.

574: Translocate raptors
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Raptor populations across the world have been lost to persecution, pollution (e.g. DDT contamination) and other threats, and have therefore been subject to many reintroduction programmes, using both captive-bred (see ‘Release of captive-bred individuals’) and wild-bred individuals. These programmes can be controversial as large birds of prey can take livestock, but also have the potential to restore ‘flagship’ species and boost interest in conservation.
 
 

Key Messages:

Six studies of three translocation programmes in the UK and the USA found that all three successfully established populations of white-tailed eagles Haliaeetus albicilla, red kites Milvus milvus and ospreys Pandion halieatus. However, the latest review of the programme to reintroduce red kites to England and Scotland reported that one of six populations was very small, with only four pairs, despite 90 birds being released.

577: Translocate woodpeckers
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Red-cockaded woodpeckers Picoides borealis are a vulnerable species from the southeast USA. They are subject to intense management practices including forest manipulations (see ‘Natural system modifications’) and competitor control (‘Invasive and other problematic species’). Red-cockaded woodpeckers live in small family groups, normally with a single breeding pair. These groups occupy small ‘clusters’ of trees and can become increasingly isolated if populations decline.
Translocating birds between groups and into new areas therefore represents a potential method of maintaining a viable population structure. Pine stands can be specifically managed for woodpeckers to create unoccupied clusters, into which translocated birds can be released.
 

Key Messages:

All five translocation programmes studied were for red-cockaded woodpeckers Picoides borealis in the southern USA.
Six studies of four programmes found that &gt;50% of translocated birds remained in their new sites, with two studies of the same programme reporting a large population increase.
Birds from four programmes were reported as forming pairs or breeding, although some translocated pairs split up and some translocated nestlings were abandoned.
One study found that translocated nestlings fledged at similar rates to native chicks.

Kakapos Strigops habroptila are large, flightless parrots that used to be found across New Zealand, but declined catastrophically after the introduction of mammalian predators. The entire population has now been transferred to predator-free islands off the mainland in an attempt to save the species.
 

Key Messages:

Three studies of two translocation programmes from the Pacific and New Zealand found that populations of parrots were successfully established on islands following translocations, including the colonisation of other islands in the New Zealand study.
Survival of translocated birds was monitored in five studies of four programmes from across the world and ranged from 41% over 60 days for red-fronted parakeets Cyanoramphus novaezelandiae in New Zealand to 98% for kakapos Strigops habroptila in New Zealand.
Survival for translocated thick-billed parrots Rhynchopsitta pachyrhyncha in the USA was higher than for captive-bred birds.
Despite very high survival, kakapos that were translocated had very low reproductive output in New Zealand.

580: Translocate songbirds
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Several species of songbird on islands across the world (e.g. New Zealand, Hawaii and the Seychelles) have been lost from parts of their historic range due to predation by introduced mammalian predators. These predators have now been cleared from some islands, allowing the reintroduction of birds from elsewhere.
 
 

Key Messages:

Nine studies from across the world, including a review of 31 translocation attempts in New Zealand found that translocations led to the establishment of songbird populations. The review found that 79% and 100% of translocation programmes for saddlebacks Philesturnus carunculatus and New Zealand robins Petroica australis, respectively, were successful in establishing populations. Eight of the studies were from islands, mostly following predator removal.
Three studies from Zimbabwe, New Zealand and the USA report on three translocation programmes that failed to establish populations.
A methodological paper found that the nesting success of saddlebacks decreased as the latitudinal difference between source area and release site increased.

581: Use techniques to increase the survival of species after capture
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Translocations can be a stressful and potentially dangerous procedure, with birds being confined for potentially long periods of time after being captured from the wild. Techniques to maximise survival may therefore be an important part of ensuring the overall success of translocations. In addition, ensuring higher survival can help to reduce the impact of translocations on source populations by requiring fewer individuals to be taken.
 

Key Messages:

A small controlled study from the USA found that providing dark, quiet environments with readily-available food and water increased the survival of small birds after capture and increased the probability that they would accept captivity.
A study from Hawaii found that keeping birds warm in a ‘mock’ translocation in Hawaii increased survival, although all birds suffered some loss of condition.

583: Ensure genetic variation to increase translocation success
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
If translocated birds are used to recolonise a part of the species’ former range then they will constitute a founder population. If the founders do not have sufficient genetic variation, their breeding may lead to inbreeding depression, potentially jeopardising the long-term viability of the population.
 

Key Messages:

We did not find any studies on the effects of ensuring genetic variation in translocated birds.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.

584: Translocate nests to avoid disturbance
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Some birds return year after year to the same nest, making moving them difficult: birds are likely to return to the old site the next year. If nesting sites are threatened by development or are unsuitable for some reason then moving birds could be beneficial. However, it is possible that if the nest can be moved whilst it is in use, the birds will return to its eventual site rather than its original position.
 

Key Messages:

Four small trials from the USA and a replicated study from Chatham Island, New Zealand found some success in relocating nests whilst they were in use.
However, one study from the USA found that only 40% of burrowing owls Athene cunicularia were moved successfully, another found that American kestrels Falco sparverius tolerated movement of their nest, but not repeated disturbance and another found that barn swallow Hirundo rustica may follow their nest as it is slowly moved on a car, but may not stay at the new site.

585: Use vocalisations to attract birds to safe areas
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
As well as physically moving birds to areas (translocations, see separate intervention), it is possible to try and get birds to move of their own accord. Many birds nest colonially for protection and are attracted nesting to areas with conspecifics. Especially for birds that land mainly at night, hearing the calls and other vocalisations of conspecifics may be an important part of guiding them to colonies. Playing recordings of these calls may therefore encourage birds to colonise new areas. A similar intervention is ‘Use decoys to attract birds to safe areas’.
 

Key Messages:

Six studies from North America, the Galapagos and the Azores found that seabirds were more likely to nest in areas where vocalisations were played, or were successfully attracted to nest in new areas, following the playing of vocalisations. Four of these studies used several interventions at once. One study found that some calls were more effective than others.
Two studies from the USA and the Galapagos found that birds did not colonise all new areas where vocalisations were played. It is possible that the result from the Galapagos was due to only having a single year’s data.
One controlled study from Hawaii found that albatross were more likely to land in areas where vocalisations were played than in areas without vocalisation playback. A small controlled study from New Zealand found that terns were not more likely to land in areas where vocalisations were played.

Key Messages:

Seven studies found that birds bred in areas where decoys (of birds or nests) were used to attract birds. Six of the studies used several interventions at once. Two studies from the USA found that least terns Sterna antillarum and herons were not attracted to new areas to breed when decoys were used.
Five studies from North America and France and Spain found that more birds landed near decoys than in control areas.

Background information and definitions:
Many ground-nesting seabirds require little or no vegetation to be able to nest. Therefore, if conservationists are trying to move a colony, for a number of reasons, they can make the habitat at the old site unsuitable by encouraging vegetation to grow there.
Many species of seabird disperse from colonies outside the breeding season, allowing work to be carried out without disturbing birds.

588: Use captive breeding to increase or maintain populations of tinamous
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Captive breeding or ex situ conservation involves establishing and maintaining populations of wild species in captivity whilst attempting to keep the fundamental nature of the species the same (i.e. avoiding domestication). It is frequently used as a technique when wild populations become very small indeed, very fragmented or are declining very rapidly. Captive breeding potentially offers a way to maintain a population of the species whilst the threats to it in the wild are reduced or removed; or of increasing reproductive output and outbreeding beyond what would be possible in the wild.
Large-scale captive breeding programmes typically use specially-designed breeding centres, but zoos and wildlife parks can also be used. Whilst the differences between these may impact on the success of captive breeding, we have included both in the following section, as the techniques used should be applicable to both.

599: Can captive breeding have deleterious effects on individual fitness?
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
One potential problem with captive breeding is that it limits the effective population of a species to the number of captive individuals that are available to interbreed. This could lead to inbreeding depression and a loss of fitness. Similarly, the different selection pressures on individuals in captivity may alter the physiology of captive populations, as has occurred in domesticated species.
It is important to note that low genetic diversity, inbreeding and changes due to captivity do not necessarily lead to reduced fitness. Care should therefore be taken in interpreting the results from the studies below.
 

Key Messages:

Three studies of wild populations, wild and captive populations and museum specimens, one replicated, found evidence for  potentially deleterious physiological or genetic changes due to captive breeding. These studies did not investigate fitness.
A study of a wild Mauritius kestrel, Falco punctatus, population derived totally from captive individuals found high inbreeding and a loss of genetic diversity, but this was caused more by the very low population size (four wild birds) than by captivity per se.
The museum-based study found reduced relative brain volume in captive wildfowl, compared with wild birds, whilst a comparison of wild and captive populations of white-headed ducks Oxyura leucocephala found lower genetic diversity in captive populations.

601: Use artificial insemination in captive breeding
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Artificial insemination involves artificially introducing sperm into a female’s reproductive tract to fertilise her eggs. It may have advantages over natural insemination through mating if, for example, captive birds will not form pair bonds, or if males in some pairs are infertile. The ability to transport frozen sperm between geographically isolated populations can also substantially increase the genetic diversity of species. However, the methods used may be very species-specific and research may be needed before it can be adopted for any one species.
 

Key Messages:

A review of artificial insemination argued that it could be a useful tool to conservationists, but that there were challenges to its use. Deep and repeated inseminations increased fertility.
Two trials from the USA found that artificial insemination of raptors achieved approximately 50% fertility or 0%.
A review of a houbara bustard Chlamydotis undulata macqueenii captive breeding programme in Saudi Arabia found that artificial insemination increased fertility, whilst another review found that the highest fertility levels were achieved with inseminations of at least 10 million spermatozoa every 4–5 days.

602: Freeze semen for use in artificial insemination
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Spermatozoa only survive for a short time and so if artificial insemination is not going to happen immediately, the semen must be frozen. This in itself can damage cells, so a cryoprotectant such as dimethyl sulphoxide or glycerol must be added to protect the cells. Some cyroprotectants (e.g. glycerol) must then be removed by dialysis before insemination.
 

Key Messages:

A small controlled trial in the USA found that using frozen semen for artificial insemination resulted in lower fertility in falcons, and a second small trial from the USA found that an American kestrel Falco sparverius had only 33% fertility when inseminated with frozen semen.
A small trial from the USA found that fertility rates were highest when semen contained 10% dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO, a cryoprotectant), compared to semen containing 6% or 8% DMSO.

603: Wash contaminated semen and use it for artificial insemination
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Collecting semen can be difficult and expensive, and if it is contaminated it is likely to be cheaper to wash it, than to collect more.
 

Key Messages:
A single replicated controlled study in Spain found that semen contaminated with urine could be successfully washed to increase its pH and produced three raptor nestlings.

604: Artificially incubate and hand-rear seabirds in captivity
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Artificial incubation involves removing eggs from incubating parents and using an incubator to hatch them. Techniques can be extremely complex, with precision humidity and temperature control and turning of the eggs to ensure correct development Hand-rearing can be used with chicks from artificially-incubated eggs or with chicks removed from parents after hatching and involves manually feeding chicks until independence. Both techniques can be used to encourage parents to produce more offspring, or when naturally-raised chicks and eggs have low survival.
 

Key Messages:

Five studies from across the world found evidence for the success of hand-rearing seabirds.
One small study in Spain found that one of five hand-reared Audouin’s gulls Larus audouinii successfully bred in the wild.
Four studies found that various petrel species (Procellariiformes) successfully fledged after hand-rearing. One controlled study found that fledging rates of hand-reared birds was similar to parent-reared birds, although a study on a single bird found that the chick fledged at a lower weight and later than parent-reared chicks.

617: Use puppets to increase the survival or growth of hand-reared chicks
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
A potential problem with hand-rearing chicks is that they will ‘imprint’ on the humans raising them and be unable to adjust to life in the wild or breed with conspecifics. It has therefore been suggested that chicks should be fed with as little human contact as possible and that puppets, designed to look like parent birds, be used to feed them.
 

Key Messages:
Three replicated studies from the USA and Saudi Arabia found that corvids and bustards raised using puppets did not have higher survival, dispersal or growth than conventionally hand-reared chicks.

Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Captive breeding is normally used to provide individuals which can then be released into the wild to either restore a population in part of the species’ former range, or to augment an existing population.
Release techniques vary considerably, from ‘hard releases’ involving the simple release of individuals into the wild to ‘soft releases’ which involve a variety of adaptation and acclimatisation techniques before release or post-release feeding and care. The following section includes studies describing the overall effects of release projects. Studies that compare specific release techniques are described elsewhere (‘Use holding pens at release sites’, ‘Use ‘anti-predator training’ to improve survival after release’ etc).
 

Key Messages:

Two studies of reintroduction programmes of ducks in New Zealand found high survival of released birds and population establishment, with one describing successful breeding. One study describes higher success in the second year of the release programme, potentially because there was then a population present in the wild and more intensive predator control.
A before-and-after study from Alaska found low survival of released cackling geese Branta hutchinsii, but that the population recovered from 1,000 to 6,000 birds after releases and the control of mammalian predators.
A review of a reintroduction programme from Hawaii found that the release of 2,150 Hawaiian geese (nene) Branta sandvicensis had not resulted in the establishment of a self-sustaining population, although some birds bred.
Two studies from Canada found very low return rates for released ducks with one finding no evidence for survival of released birds over two years, although there was some evidence that breeding success was higher for released birds than wild ones.

Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Raptors can be released through a process called ‘hacking’ which was developed as a falconry method to train young birds to hunt. It involves placing broods (once they can feed themselves and regulate their body temperature) in an artificial nest site where they can be fed without imprinting on humans. The birds can learn about their environment and gradually learn to fly and hunt, with food provided until it is no longer taken (Jones 2004).

631: Use appropriate populations to source released populations
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Some bird species follow instinctive migration patterns, which vary between populations (Berthold et al. 1984), and populations are likely to be adapted for local environmental conditions. If individuals from one population are released into another area, this could result in maladaptive behaviours, with birds migrating in the wrong direction, or breeding at the wrong time. Sourcing individuals for release from the area that they will be released into may, therefore, improve success rates.

632: Use holding pens at release sites
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Captive-bred individuals may well take time to adjust to life in the wild, without regular food and potentially in an unfamiliar habitat. It may therefore increase the chances of birds surviving if they are kept at the release site for some time before being released, either enclosed in pens or with access to the habitat outside.
This section includes only those studies that make a comparison between releases using holding pens and those without. Many of the studies in ‘Release captive-bred individuals’ describe releases that use holding pens, but do not test the effects of using them.
 

Key Messages:

Three replicated and one small study from three release programmes in Saudi Arabia, the USA and Canada found that released birds had higher survival or were more likely to pair up if kept at release sites in holding pens before release.
A replicated study in the USA found lower survival for thick-billed parrots Rhynchopsitta pachyrhyncha released in holding pens, compared to birds released without preparation.
A review of northern bald ibis  Geronticus eremita conservation found that holding pens successfully prevented most birds from migrating (which resulted in 100% mortality), although some 200 birds ‘escaped’ over 25 years.

633: Clip birds’ wings on release
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Holding pens are designed to allow birds to adjust to their environment before being released, but if they leave before they are ready, the pens may have no effect. Therefore preventing birds from leaving by clipping their wings may increase the time they spend in the pens and their survival.
A similar intervention is the use of ‘wing brails’ to prevent birds from flying. Brails are bands attached to wings to prevent birds extending them and so preventing birds from flying. We captured no evidence of the effects of wing brails, but several studies describe their use in the release of cranes Grus spp. These are described in ‘Release captive-bred individuals’.
 

Key Messages:

Two studies from Saudi Arabia and Hawaii found that bustards and geese had lower survival when released in temporary exclosures with clipped wings, compared to birds released with unclipped wings.
A review of cackling goose  Branta hutchinsii conservation found that wing-clipped or moulting wild adult geese proved a better strategy than releasing young geese.
A review of northern bald ibis (waldrapp)  Geronticus eremita conservation found no differences in survival between birds released with clipped and unclipped wings in Israel.

Key Messages:
A replicated study from New Zealand found that released black stilts Himantopus novaezelandiae were more likely to move long distances after release if they were released in larger groups.

635: Release birds in ‘coveys’
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Coveys are ‘family groups’ of birds (normally gamebirds): broods of chicks with an accompanying adult. Groups of birds may be safer from predators than individual chicks and the presence of parents or foster parents may also help survival.
 

Key Messages:

A replicated study in Saudi Arabia found that houbara bustard Chlamydotis undulata macqueenii survival was low when chicks were released in coveys with flightless females.
A review of cackling goose  Branta hutchinsii conservation and a replicated study in England found that geese and grey partridge Perdix perdix releases were more  successful for birds released in coveys than for young birds released on their own or adults released in pairs.

636: Release birds as adults or sub-adults, not juveniles
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Most captive-bred birds are released as juveniles as adults may have become too conditioned to life in captivity. Under some circumstances, however, adults or sub-adults may survive better.
 

Key Messages:

Three replicated studies found that malleefowl Leipoa ocellata, houbara bustards Chlamydotis undulata macqueenii and cackling geese Branta hutchinsii released as sub-adults, not juveniles had higher survival rates.
A replicated study from New Zealand found lower survival for black stilts Himantopus novaezelandiae released as sub-adults, compared with juveniles.
Two replicated studies from Hawaii and Saudi Arabia found lower survival for Hawaiian geese Branta sandvicensis and bustards released as wing-clipped sub-adults, compared with birds released as juveniles. 
Three replicated studies found no differences in survival between ducks, vultures and ibises released at different ages, but a second study of the vulture release programme found that birds released when more than three years old had lower reproductive success than birds released at an earlier stage.

637: Use ‘anti-predator training’ to improve survival after release
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
If individuals have been raised in captivity, it is unlikely that they will have encountered predators and, in consequence, may have lost some of their innate fear leaving them vulnerable after release. Using predators under controlled conditions can therefore teach them to avoid dangerous species and potentially increase post-release survival.
 

Key Messages:

A review from Pakistan and a small trial from Saudi Arabia found that pheasants and bustards had higher survival after release, when given pre-release predator training, compared to birds without training, many of which were predated.
The Saudi Arabian study found that introducing a model fox (as opposed to a live predator) to cages did not increase post-release survival. Introducing a live fox to the cage increased post-release survival more than other techniques used.

638: Use ‘flying training’ before release
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Birds in captivity will rarely fly as far or as often as those in the wild, potentially leading to weaker flight muscles.
 

Key Messages:
A replicated study from the Dominican Republic found that captive-reared Hispaniolan parrots Amazona ventralis had higher initial survival if they were given pre-release predator training, although this difference was not present a year after release.

639: Provide supplementary food after release
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Supplementary feeding is a technique frequently used to support bird populations or increase reproductive success (see separate section). Newly released birds may be unable to find enough food when they are first released and therefore supplementary food may offer a way of ensuring they survive until they have learned to forage successfully.
 

Key Messages:

Three studies from found that malleefowl Leipoa ocellata, Andean condors Vultur gryphus and pink pigeons Nesoenas mayeri used supplementary food when it was provided after release.
A replicated, controlled study from Australia found that malleefowl had higher survival when supplied with supplementary food.
A study in Peru found that supplementary food could be used to increase the foraging range of condors after release, or to guide them back to suitable feeding areas.
