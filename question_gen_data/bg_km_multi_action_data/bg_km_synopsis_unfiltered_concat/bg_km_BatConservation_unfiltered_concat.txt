1000: Educate the public to improve perception of bats to improve behaviour towards bats
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Bats have long been the victims of negative public opinion due to mythology involving vampires and witchcraft, and associations with disease, such as rabies, the Ebola virus, and more recently the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Education programmes, campaigns and events to dispel myths and to educate the public about the importance of bats and bat conservation have been put in place in some countries and may benefit bat populations by improving human behaviour towards bats. Three studies in the USA (Rule & Zhbanova 2012, Hoffmaster et al. 2016, Lu et al. 2017) and two in the UK (Kaninsky et al. 2018) found that providing education to the public resulted in more positive perceptions and beliefs about bats.

1014: Change effluent treatments of domestic and urban waste water
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Organic pollution occurs when treated sewage effluents containing organic compounds are discharged into rivers affecting plant growth and the number and diversity of insects. Riparian habitats are important for foraging bats and changes in water quality may have positive effects on foraging activity for some species, and negative effects for others (Vaughan et al. 1996, Kalcounis-Rüppell et al. 2007, Abbott et al. 2009).
We found evidence that filter sewage bed treatment works can provide foraging habitat for bats. However, the results should be treated with caution as a subsequent study found that insects above these filter beds were contaminated with endocrine disrupting chemicals that may have adverse effects on bats feeding on them (Park et al. 2009).

1024: Provide bat boxes for roosting bats
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Bats roost in caves, built structures, natural crevices (e.g. in rocks) and in trees. The provision of bat boxes is a widely used intervention, as a conservation measure and for research, and there is a lot of literature on the use of these structures by bats. However, the many different designs of bat box available makes it difficult to draw consistent conclusions as evidence in support of each individual design is lacking. Studies are also needed that evaluate the long-term effects of providing artificial roosts on bat populations, by observing changes in bat numbers over time, ideally in areas with and without bat boxes.
For evidence relating to other types of artificial roosts used during building developments, see ‘Create alternative bat roosts within developments’.

Key Messages:

Forty-four studies evaluated the effects of providing bat boxes for roosting bats on bat populations. Twenty-seven studies were in Europe, nine studies were in North America, four studies were in Australia, two studies were in South America, and one study was a worldwide review.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
BEHAVIOUR (44 STUDIES)

Uptake (9 studies): Nine replicated studies in Europe and the USA found that the number of bats using bat boxes increased by 2–10 times up to 10 years after installation.
Use (43 studies): Forty-one of 43 studies (including 34 replicated studies and two reviews) in Europe, the USA, South America, and Australia found that bats used bat boxes installed in forest or woodland, forestry plantations, farmland, pasture, wetlands, urban areas and buildings, bridges, underpasses or unknown habitats. The other two studies in the USA and UK found that bats displaced from buildings did not use any of 43 bat houses of four different designs or 12 heated bat boxes of one design. One review of 109 studies across Europe, North America and Asia found that 72 bat species used bat boxes, although only 18 species commonly used them, and 31 species used them as maternity roosts. Twenty-two studies (including 17 replicated studies, one before-and-after study and two reviews) found bats occupying less than half of bat boxes provided (0–49%). Nine replicated studies found bats occupying more than half of bat boxes provided (54–100%).

OTHER (23 STUDIES)

Bat box design (16 studies): Three studies in Germany, Portugal and Australia found that bats used black bat boxes more than grey, white or wooden boxes. One of two studies in Spain and the USA found higher occupancy rates in larger bat boxes. One study in the USA found that bats used both resin and wood cylindrical bat boxes, but another study in the USA found that resin bat boxes became occupied more quickly than wood boxes. One study in the UK found higher occupancy rates in concrete than wooden bat boxes. One study in the USA found that Indiana bats used rocket boxes more than wooden bat boxes or bark-mimic roosts. One study in Spain found that more bats occupied bat boxes that had two compartments than one compartment in the breeding season. One study in Lithuania found that bat breeding colonies occupied standard and four/five chamber bat boxes and individuals occupied flat bat boxes. Four studies in the USA, UK, Spain and Australia found bats selecting four of nine, three of five, three of four and one of five bat box designs. One study in the UK found that different bat box designs were used by different species. One study in Costa Rica found that bat boxes simulating tree trunks were used by 100% of bats and in group sizes similar to natural roosts.
Bat box position (11 studies): Three studies in Germany, Spain and the USA found that bat box orientation and/or the amount of exposure to sunlight affected bat occupancy, and one study in Spain found that orientation did not have a significant effect on occupancy. Two studies in the UK and Italy found that bat box height affected occupancy, and two studies in Spain and the USA found no effect of height. Two studies in the USA and Spain found higher occupancy of bat boxes on buildings than on trees. One study in Australia found that bat boxes were occupied more often in farm forestry sites than in native forest, one study in Poland found higher occupancy in pine relative to mixed deciduous stands, and one study in Costa Rica found higher occupancy in forest fragments than in pasture. One study in the USA found higher occupancy rates in areas where bats were known to roost prior to installing bat boxes. One review in the UK found that bat boxes were more likely to be occupied when a greater number of bat boxes were installed across a site.

1935: Legally protect bats during development
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Bats are protected by national and/or international law in many countries. This typically includes protection against killing, injuring, capturing, disturbing or trading bats, or damaging, destroying, or obstructing access to their roosts. Activities such as development that are likely to affect bats in these ways may be against the law and require licences from a government licensing authority.
The studies discussed here relate specifically to protecting bats during development. Other studies that discuss legal protection are included in ‘Legally protect bat habitats’, and ‘Legally protect bat species’.

Background information and definitions:
Only 14.7% of the world’s land surface is currently protected (UNEP-WCMC & IUCN 2016). Therefore, it is vital to engage effectively with landowners, such as farmers, so that they manage their land in ways that help to maintain bat populations. This may be done by providing advice and support to farmers on how to manage their land specifically for bats.

Background information and definitions:
Allocation of some farmland to ‘set-aside’ (fields taken out of production) was compulsory under European agricultural policy from 1992 until 2008. Originally intended as a method of reducing production, set-aside has also been promoted as a way of protecting on-field biodiversity. Set-aside fields that are left to naturally regenerate may provide important foraging habitat for bats within the farmed landscape.

1942: Plant new hedges
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Hedgerows provide important commuting and foraging habitats for bats within open agricultural landscapes. Frey-Ehrenbold et al. (2013) found bat activity to be 1.4–2.8 times higher along linear features such as hedgerows than in open farmland areas, and one study in the UK found bats to be highly sensitive to the loss of hedgerows (Pocock & Jennings 2008). Planting new hedges within farmland may benefit bats. However, it will take a considerable amount of time for hedgerows to become established and sufficiently mature. Existing hedges should therefore be retained where possible. See ‘Manage hedges to benefit bats’. For studies that may carry out this intervention alongside other interventions to benefit bats on farmland, see ‘Pay farmers to cover the costs of conservation measures (e.g. agri-environment schemes)’.

1943: Manage hedges to benefit bats
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Hedgerows on farms may be subject to various management practices, including cutting. However, there is evidence that bats prefer taller, wider, structurally diverse hedgerows and those with emergent trees (e.g. Boughey et al. 2011, Lacoeuilhe et al. 2016). Reducing the cutting frequency of hedges, planting trees within hedges, retaining and maintaining existing emergent trees, minimising pesticide use and filling gaps within hedges are all likely to benefit bats.

1945: Retain existing in-field trees
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Single or scattered trees, particularly mature or veteran trees, may provide important roosting and foraging habitat for bats in open agricultural landscapes. Two studies in Australia found greater total bat activity and more bat species over pastures with scattered trees than open pastures without trees (Lumsden & Bennett 2005, Fischer et al. 2010). A study in Sweden found that tree density (up to 120–130 trees/ha) had a positive effect on total bat activity and foraging activity, activity of cluttered and edge habitat adapted bat species, and species richness in wood-pastures (Wood et al. 2017). A study in the USA found greater activity of edge habitat adapted bat species around remnant mature oak trees (Quercus spp.) than in treeless, open areas within vineyards (Polyakov et al. 2019).
To be included as evidence for this intervention, studies must have monitored a comparison, i.e. compared areas where existing in-field trees have been retained with areas where they have been removed. There must have been an active decision (i.e. intervention) to retain the in-field trees and the study must state when the intervention was carried out.

1947: Retain remnant forest or woodland on agricultural land
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Remnant forest or woodland fragments may provide important habitat for bats in agricultural landscapes. Remnants of forest or woodland have been found to support greater bat activity and/or more bat species than surrounding pasture, arable land or plantations (e.g. Hobbs et al. 2003, Law et al. 2011, Lentini et al. 2012, Fuentes-Montemayor et al. 2013, Pina et al. 2013). A study in Southeast Asia found that larger forest fragments in areas of plantation agriculture supported similar or higher bat abundance and diversity to undisturbed continuous forest (Struebig et al. 2008).
To be included as evidence for this intervention, studies must have monitored a comparison, i.e. compared remnant forest or woodland that has been kept intact with similar/nearby areas where remnants have been cut down or otherwise degraded. There must have been an active decision (i.e. intervention) to retain the remnant forest or woodlands and the study must state when the intervention was carried out.

1951: Manage livestock water troughs as a drinking resource for bats
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Livestock water troughs can provide water sources for bats, particularly in arid areas. Modifications to water troughs that prevent livestock from damaging or entering them, such as wires and braces across the water surface, may injure bats or prevent them from drinking. Removing livestock modifications, keeping water troughs full and managing surrounding vegetation may increase the use of troughs by bats. Carefully designed escape structures may also prevent downed bats from drowning (e.g. see Taylor & Tuttle 2012).
For studies that avoid illuminating livestock water troughs, see ‘Avoid illumination of bat foraging, drinking, and swarming sites’. For studies that create water sources on farmland and in other habitats, see ‘Create artificial water sources’.

Survival (12 studies): Ten of 12 studies (including 10 replicated, randomized, controlled studies and one before-and-after study) in the USA and Canada found that increasing the wind speed at which turbines become operational (‘cut-in speed’), or increasing the cut-in speed along with preventing turbine blades from turning at low wind speeds (‘feathering’) resulted in fewer bat fatalities than at conventionally operated turbines. The other two studies found that increasing cut-in speeds did not reduce bat fatalities, but sample sizes were small or treatments were applied for short periods only.

A study in Australia found that riparian buffers in logged areas had similar overall bat activity and species richness to unlogged mature forest (Lloyd et al. 2006). See also ‘Retain forested corridors in logged areas’.
To be included as evidence for this intervention, studies must have monitored a comparison, i.e. compared logged areas where riparian buffers have been kept intact with similar/nearby logged areas where riparian buffers have not been kept. There must have been an active decision (i.e. intervention) to retain the riparian buffer and the study must state when the intervention was carried out.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Bats can carry diseases and viruses that may spillover to human populations with serious risks to public health (e.g. see Schneeberger & Voigt 2016). Carrying out surveillance of bats for diseases and viruses, particularly in areas where bats and humans are in close contact, could provide an early warning system for potential spillover events and may allow preventative measures to be taken. This may reduce the persecution and culling of bats. Surveillance programmes and sampling protocols should aim to minimize disturbance to bats.

2007: Treat bat hibernacula environments to reduce the white-nose syndrome pathogen reservoir
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
The white-nose syndrome fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans can grow on a variety of substrates and can persist in hibernacula environments (such as caves and mines) for long periods without bats being present (e.g. Lorch et al. 2013). Bat hibernacula could be treated with environmental cleaning agents or bacterium treatments that inhibit fungal growth, to reduce the pathogen reservoir. However, these approaches have the potential to damage cave environments and other cave-dwelling species at some sites.

Description: Update 2020
2020: Use 'warm white' rather than 'cool' LED lights
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
LEDs (light-emitting diodes) are increasingly being used in the lighting industry. It has been suggested that ‘warm white’ LED lights emitting little or no ultraviolet component may have less of an impact on bats than ‘cool’ lights emitting blue and ultraviolet wavelengths (e.g. Stone et al. 2015). Bat vision is more sensitive to light with shorter wavelengths (e.g. Müller et al. 2009), and ultraviolet lights can attract insects and foraging bats. For similar interventions, see ‘Use ultraviolet filters on lights’ and ‘Use red lighting rather than other lighting colours’.

Description: Update 2020
2021: Use red lighting rather than other lighting colours
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Red lighting may have a reduced effect on bats compared to lighting of other colours, as bat vision is more sensitive to shorter wavelengths (blue and ultraviolet light) than longer wavelengths (red light) (Müller et al. 2009). However, a study in Latvia found that migratory bats may be attracted to red lighting, which could have negative consequences (Voigt et al. 2019).

Key Messages:

Three studies evaluated the effects of red lighting on bat populations. Two studies were in the Netherlands and one was in the UK.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Abundance (2 studies): One replicated, controlled, site comparison study in the Netherlands found that red lighting resulted in higher activity (relative abundance) for one of three bat species groups than white or green lighting. One site comparison study in the Netherlands found that culverts illuminated with red light had similar activity of commuting Daubenton’s bats as culverts illuminated with white or green light.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)         

Behaviour (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in the UK found that more soprano pipistrelles emerged from a roost when lit with red light than when lit with white light, but no difference was found between red and blue lights.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
The availability of water in arid areas is predicted to decrease under future climate change scenarios (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2014). Desert bats depend on these water resources for both drinking and foraging (Razgour et al. 2010) and reduced water availability can affect their survival and reproductive success (Adams & Hayes 2008). Studies that experimentally reduced desert pond sizes to simulate predicted water loss due to climate change found reduced bat activity and species richness, particularly for larger, less manoeuverable bat species (Razgour et al. 2010, Hall et al. 2016, Razgour et al. 2018).

2028: Retain buffer zones around core habitat
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Retaining areas of natural or semi-natural vegetation around core habitat can help to protect the habitat and wildlife that it supports from the detrimental effects of habitat loss or disturbance. Core bat habitats include foraging, drinking and swarming sites, as well as roosts and hibernacula. Buffers may also be retained along important bat commuting routes.
To be included as evidence for this intervention, studies must have monitored a comparison, i.e. compared core bat habitats where a buffer has been kept intact with similar/nearby areas where buffers have not been kept. There must have been an active decision (i.e. intervention) to retain the buffer and the study must state when the intervention was carried out.
For interventions relating to retaining buffers around bat habitats in logged forests, see ‘Retain buffers around roost trees in logged areas’ and ‘Retain riparian buffers in logged areas’. For planting of buffer zones to reduce pollution see ‘Plant riparian buffer strips’.

Linear features such as hedgerows and treelines provide important commuting routes for bats (Limpens & Kapteyn 1991, Verboom & Huitema 1997, Downs & Racey 2006). Where original commuting routes cannot be retained, new unlit commuting routes could be planted. However, it will take a considerable amount of time for hedgerows or trees to become established and sufficiently mature. Existing commuting routes should be retained where possible.

2037: Legally protect bat species
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Perhaps the most common intervention in response to declining species is to provide legal protection. Bats are protected by national and/or international law in many countries. This typically includes protection against killing, injuring, capturing, disturbing or trading bats, or damaging, destroying, or obstructing access to their roosts. Activities that are likely to affect bats in these ways may be against the law and require licences from a government licensing authority.
Assessing the effectiveness of legal protection can be difficult. Effectiveness is best monitored over long timescales, but this increases the chance that other factors may influence population recovery. The legal protection of threatened species can also lead to a range of other conservation actions being implemented at the same time, along with increased research and monitoring efforts.
 Increasing population trends for some bat species in the UK may have occurred as a result of legal protection introduced in the 1980s, among other factors such as an increased awareness of bat conservation and changes in agricultural practices (Barlow et al. 2015). Similarly, the recovery and de-listing of the lesser long-nosed bat Leptonycteris yerbabuenae in the USA and Mexcio may have occurred as a result of legal protection, along with bat-friendly farming iniatives and education programmes (US Fish & Wildlife Service 2016).
Evidence that relates specifically to the legal protection of bats during development is discussed in ‘Legally protect bats during development’, and for the legal protection of habitats, see ‘Legally protect bat habitats’.

Title: Bat Conservation
Description: Update 2020
2045: Legally protect bat habitats
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
National legislation for bats varies around the world. In some countries, bat roosts and important bat habitats are legally protected, but in others there is no protection at all.
Assessing the effectiveness of protected areas is particularly difficult. For example, protected and unprotected areas might start off with different quality habitats (protection being granted to the best quality habitat). Protected areas are also more likely to be in remote areas, so less accessible to threats such as harvesting (Joppa & Pfaff 2009). Finally, effectiveness is best monitored over long timescales, but this increases the chance that other factors influence the ecosystem. The most reliable studies would compare protected and unprotected areas over time, and possibly correct for some of the biases.
For other interventions relating to the legal protection of bats, see ‘Legally protect bats during development’ and ‘Legally protect bat species’.

Key Messages:

Five studies evaluated the effects of legally protecting bat habitats on bat populations. Four studies were in Europe and one was in India.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Community composition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in India found that the composition of bat species was similar in protected forest and unprotected forest fragments.
Richness/diversity (2 studies): Two replicated, site comparison or paired sites studies in Europe and India found that the number of bat species did not differ between protected and unprotected forests or forest fragments. One replicated, site comparison study in France found that protected sites had a greater number of bat species than unprotected sites.

POPULATION RESPONSE (4 STUDIES)

Abundance (4 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in the UK found that the activity (relative abundance) of Daubenton’s bats was higher over rivers on farms in protected areas than in unprotected areas. One replicated, paired sites study in Europe found that the activity of common noctule bats was higher in protected forests than unprotected forests, but bat activity overall did not differ. Two replicated, site comparison studies in France and India found higher overall bat activity, higher activity of three of six bat species/species groups and a greater number of bats in protected sites and forests than unprotected sites and forests.

2053: Breed bats in captivity
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Captive breeding involves taking wild animals into captivity and establishing and maintaining breeding populations. It tends to be undertaken when wild populations become small or fragmented or when they are declining rapidly. The aim is usually to release captive-bred animals back to natural habitats. See ‘Release captive-bred bats’. Some captive populations may also be used for research to benefit wild populations. Although there are many captive-breeding programmes for bats in zoos around the world, we found only five studies that evaluated the reproductive success and survival of bats in captivity.
For a similar intervention relating to the management of white-nose syndrome in bats, see ‘Breed bats in captivity to supplement wild populations affected by white-nose syndrome’.

Key Messages:

Eight studies evaluated the effects of breeding bats in captivity on bat populations. Three studies were in the USA, two in the UK, and one in each of Italy, Brazil and New Zealand.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (8 STUDIES)

Reproductive success (6 studies): Six studies in the USA, UK, Italy and Brazil found that 6–100% of female bats captured in the wild successfully conceived, gave birth and reared young in captivity. Two studies in the UK and Brazil found that two of five and two of three bats born in captivity successfully gave birth to live young.
Survival (8 studies): Seven studies in the USA, UK, Italy and Brazil found that 20–100% of bat pups born in captivity survived from between 10 days to adulthood. One study in New Zealand found that two of five New Zealand lesser short-tailed bat pups born in captivity survived, both of which were hand-reared.

Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Injured or orphaned bats may be rehabilitated with the aim of releasing them back into the wild to maintain wild bat populations. This often involves the use of volunteers, which may help to raise awareness for bat conservation. Although bat rehabilitation activities are carried out in many countries, we only found two studies that provide evidence for the effects of this intervention on the survival of rehabilitated bats. We found no studies evaluating the effects of this intervention on maintaining wild bat populations.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (4 STUDIES)

Survival (4 studies): One study in Brazil found that two hand-reared orphaned greater spear-nosed bats survived for over three months in captivity. Two studies in the UK and Italy found that 70–90% of hand-reared pipistrelle bats survived for at least 4–14 days after release into the wild, and six of 21 bats joined wild bat colonies. One study in the UK found that pipistrelle bats that flew in a large flight cage for long periods before release survived for longer and were more active than bats that flew for short periods or in a small enclosure. One study in the UK found that 13% of ringed hand-reared pipstrelle bats were found alive in bat boxes 38 days to almost four years after release into the wild.
Condition (1 study): One study in Brazil found that two orphaned greater spear-nosed bats increased in body weight and size after being hand-reared, and reached a normal size for the species after 60 days.

2284: Retain riparian buffers on agricultural land
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves retaining buffers of woodland, forest or other vegetation along streams and rivers (riparian buffers or corridors) in agricultural areas. This may provide foraging and roosting opportunities for bats and maintain connectivity in disturbed landscapes.
To be included as evidence for this intervention, studies must have monitored a comparison, i.e. compared agricultural areas where riparian buffers have been kept intact with similar/nearby areas where riparian vegetation has been cut down or otherwise degraded. There must have been an active decision (i.e. intervention) to retain the riparian buffer and the study must state when the intervention was carried out.
For a similar intervention relevant to logging, see ‘Retain riparian buffers in logged areas’. For an intervention that involves planting riparian buffers to reduce pollution, see ‘Plant riparian buffer strips’.

2939: Slow rotation of turbine blades at low wind speeds
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Most wind turbines operate by a ‘cut-in’ wind speed at which the turbine begins to generate electricity and the blades can move at a maximum rotation speed. However, the blades can still rotate below cut-in speeds when electricity is not being generated. Slowing the rotation of turbine blades below the cut-in speed may reduce bat fatalities, which have been found to be higher at low wind speeds (e.g. Horn et al. 2008, Rydell et al. 2010, Wellig et al. 2018).
For studies that prevent turbine blades from turning below the cut-in speed, see ‘Prevent turbine blades from turning at low wind speeds (‘feathering’)’. Cut-in speeds may also be increased in combination with this intervention. See ‘Increase the wind speed at which turbines become operational (‘cut-in speed’)’.

‘Brownfield sites’ are previous industrial or commercial sites that have been abandoned and are available for reuse. These sites may be targeted for redevelopment in urban areas. Some sites can support a high diversity of wildlife making them important sites for biodiversity and conservation. High insect numbers can provide important foraging habitat for bats, and derelict buildings may provide roosting opportunities.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of protecting brownfield or ex-industrial sites on bat populations. The study as in the USA.

954: Create or restore bat foraging habitat in urban areas
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Providing foraging habitat for bats in urban areas may reduce the impact of residential and commercial development. Existing foraging sites may be protected, or be replaced with suitable alternatives such as parks, woodland and wetlands. Bat activity was found to be higher in large parks in Mexico City than in natural forest or other urban habitats, although the number of species was higher in natural forest (Avila-Flores & Fenton 2005). Habitats should also be appropriately managed for bats, for example a study in Australia found more bat species in urban green spaces with a higher density of large trees and native plants (Threlfall et al. 2016). See also ‘Protect greenfield sites or undeveloped land in urban areas’.

961: Use organic farming instead of conventional farming
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Organic farming is an agricultural system that excludes the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides and relies on techniques such as crop rotation, compost, and biological pest control. Organic standards are strictly regulated in many countries prohibiting the use of chemicals and providing recommendations for management to conserve biodiversity. Organic farming may include combinations of several separate interventions (as discussed separately in this chapter). The studies below examine the effects of organic farming overall.
For an intervention that relates specifically to organic pest control, see ‘Use organic pest control instead of synthetic pesticides’. For an intervention that involves reducing the use of synthetic pesticides and fertilisers, see ‘Reduce pesticide, herbicide or fertiliser use’.

Key Messages:

Twelve studies evaluated the effects of using organic farming instead of conventional farming on bat populations. Eight studies were in Europe, two in the USA, one in Canada and one in Chile.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (7 STUDIES)

Community composition (1 study): One replicated, paired sites study in the USA found that the composition of bat species did not differ between organic and non-organic farms.
Richness/diversity (7 studies): Five of seven replicated, paired sites or site comparison studies in Europe, the USA, Canada and Chile found that the number of bat species did not differ between organic and non-organic farms. The other two studies found more bat species on organic farms than non-organic farms.

POPULATION RESPONSE (12 STUDIES)

Abundance (12 studies): Five of nine replicated, paired sites or site comparison studies in Europe, the USA, Canada and Chile found that overall bat activity (relative abundance) and common pipistrelle activity did not differ between organic and non-organic farms. The other four studies found higher overall bat activity, bat feeding activity, Brazilian free-tailed bat activity, and activity of four of seven bat species on organic farms than non-organic farms. Two replicated, paired sites and site comparison studies in the UK found higher activity of Myotis species over water and rivers on organic farms than non-organic farms, but no differences were found for other species or habitats. One replicated, site comparison study in France found higher activity for two of three bat species over organic fields than two of three types of conventionally managed fields.

962: Pay farmers to cover the costs of conservation measures (e.g. agri-environment schemes)
Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This action involves compensating farmers financially for changing agricultural practices to be more favourable to biodiversity and the landscape, usually through government or inter-governmental schemes. Such schemes exist around the world, although the terminology used may differ. For example, agri-environment schemes are used in the UK and Europe. In the USA, there are incentive programs such as The Environmental Quality Incentives Program and the Conservation Stewardship Program.
In the UK, agri-environment schemes use many different specific interventions which may be beneficial to bats such as the protection and maintenance of archaeological features, traditional farm buildings and stone walls; the restoration and enhancement of key habitats such as woodland, wetlands and hedgerows; and improvements to air and water quality. Three studies that evaluated the overall effects of agri-environment schemes are discussed here. See also ‘Reduce pesticide, herbicide and fertiliser use’.

Key Messages:

Three studies evaluated the effects of agri-environment schemes on bat populations. The three studies were in the UK.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Abundance (3 studies): Two of three replicated, paired sites studies in the UK found that overall bat activity (relative abundance) or the occurrence of six bat species did not differ significantly between farms managed under agri-environment schemes and those managed conventionally. One of the studies found that agri-environment scheme farms had similar activity of five bat species, and lower activity of one bat species, compared to conventional farms. The other study found lower overall bat activity and activity of pipistrelle species on agri-environment scheme farms than conventional farms.

Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves growing crops under shade trees that are either native tree species that are remnants from cleared vegetation, or other crop trees (often referred to as ‘agroforestry’). This approach provides a more complex habitat than conventional monoculture farming and can support higher levels of biodiversity.

Key Messages:

Eight studies evaluated the effects of retaining or planting native trees and shrubs amongst crops on bat populations. Four studies were in Mexico, three were in South America and one was in Tanzania.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (7 STUDIES)

Community composition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Tanzania found different compositions of bat species in coffee plantations with different amounts and types of shade cover.
Richness/diversity (7 studies): Four of six replicated, site comparison studies in Columbia, Mexico and Costa Rica found a similar number of bat species in shaded and unshaded coffee plantations, and in coffee plantations with different amounts and types of shade cover. The two other studies found more bat species and higher bat diversity in coffee, cacao and banana plantations with varied shade cover, than in plantations with a single shade species or no shade. One replicated, site comparison study in Tanzania found more bat species in shaded coffee plantations than in traditional mixed agroforestry systems with natural forest vegetation.

POPULATION RESPONSE (6 STUDIES)

Abundance (5 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies in Mexico captured more bats in coffee plantations with varied shade cover than in plantations with a single shade species. One replicated, site comparison study in Mexico found higher activity (relative abundance) of forest bat species in plantations with a varied shade cover than in plantations with a single shade species, but the opposite was true for open habitat bat species. One replicated, site comparison study in Costa Rica found no difference in the number of bats captured between cacao and banana shade plantations and unshaded monocultures. One replicated, site comparison study in Tanzania found greater bat occurrence in shaded coffee plantations than in traditional mixed agroforestry systems with natural forest vegetation.
Condition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Columbia found that great fruit-eating bats captured in ‘silvopastoral’ areas that used agroforestry, along with no chemicals, had higher body weights and body condition scores than those in conventional farming areas.

965: Modify turbine placement to reduce bat fatalities
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Positioning wind turbines away from bat roosts, foraging areas and commuting or migration routes may reduce bat mortality. At wind farms in the USA, bat fatalities are often dominated by migratory species and are higher during autumn migration periods (e.g. Arnett et al. 2008, Baerwald & Barclay 2009, Piorkowski & O’Connell 2010). A review of reports in northwest Europe found higher fatality rates at wind farms located on forested hills than in flat, open farmland (Rydell et al. 2010). Spatial patterns of bat fatalities within wind farms in Europe and the USA have been found in some studies (Arnett et al. 2008, Baerwald & Barclay 2011, Georgiakakis et al. 2012) but not others (Arnett et al. 2008, Piorkowski & O’Connell 2010).

966: Retain a buffer between turbines and habitat features used by bats
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves leaving a minimum distance between wind turbines and bat roosts or habitat features to create a buffer zone. The EUROBAT guidance on bats and wind turbines recommends a minimum distance of 200 m between wind turbines and important bat habitats (Rodrigues et al. 2014). Natural England, UK recommends a minimum distance of 50 m from the turbine blade tip to the nearest bat habitat feature (Mitchell-Jones & Carlin 2012), and for micro turbines a minimum distance of 20 m has been recommended (Minderman et al. 2012). However, reduced bat activity has been recorded up to 1,000 m from wind turbines (Barré et al. 2018). This action may not protect migratory bat species. Bennet & Hale (2018) found high fatalities of migratory bats at wind turbines without bat habitat features nearby (e.g. in open grazed fields).

Background information and definitions:
It has been suggested that bats may avoid the radio frequency radiation associated with radar installations. During experimental trials in the UK, bats were less active at wetland and woodland foraging sites when pulses of radar signals were emitted from antennas (Nicholls & Racey 2009). However, the authors state that the thermal effects of exposure to electromagnetic radiation may be harmful to bats and other organisms.

Survival (3 studies): Three replicated, randomized, controlled studies (one with a before-and-after trial in the second year) in the USA found mixed results. In the first year of one study, 21-51% fewer bats were killed at turbines with an ultrasonic deterrent fitted than at control turbines, but in the second year, from 2% more to 64% fewer bats were killed at turbines with ultrasonic deterrents fitted. One study found that using an ultrasonic deterrent emitting a constant or pulsed signal had mixed effects on the fatality rates of three bat species. One study found that using ultrasonic deterrents resulted in fewer fatalities for two of three bat species.

970: Prevent turbine blades from turning at low wind speeds ('feathering')
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Most wind turbines operate by a ‘cut-in’ wind speed at which the turbine begins to generate electricity and the blades can move at a maximum rotation speed. However, the blades can still rotate below cut-in speeds when electricity is not being generated. Preventing wind turbine blades from turning when they are not operational (known as ‘feathering’) may reduce bat fatalities, which have been found to be higher at low wind speeds (e.g. Horn et al. 2008, Rydell et al. 2010, Wellig et al. 2018). Turbine blades may be locked or the angle of the blades may be changed to be parallel to the wind. In some cases, the blades may still move a minimal amount (e.g. 1–2 rotations/minute). The cut-in speed of wind turbines is often increased in combination with this intervention. See ‘Increase the wind speed at which turbines become operational (‘cut-in speed’)’.

Underpasses may guide bats safely under roads or railways. They have the potential to reduce the number of bats killed by traffic and increase the permeability of roads/railways for bats to maintain connectivity across the landscape. There is evidence that an unknown proportion of bats of various species use underpasses below roads (e.g. Bach et al. 2004, Boonman 2011, Barros 2014). However, these studies have not been summarised here as they do not provide data that can be used to assess effectiveness, such as a control or the proportion of bats that are or are not using the underpasses. The studies described below report the proportion of bats that are either using underpasses to cross roads safely, or are crossing the road above them at risk of collisions with traffic. We did not find any studies that assessed underpasses below railways as crossing structures for bats.

For evidence relating to bat gantries/bridges (wire or mesh structures), see ‘Install bat gantries or bat bridges as road/railway crossing structures for bats’.

Key Messages:

Four studies evaluated the effects of installing overpasses as road crossing structures for bats. Three studies were in Europe and one in Australia.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Richness/diversity (1 study): One site comparison study in Australia found that the same number of bat species were recorded at an overpass and in nearby forest and bushland.

POPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
BEHAVIOUR (3 STUDIES)      

Use (3 studies): Two replicated studies (including one site comparison) in Ireland and France found that two or three bat species/species groups used overpasses but up to three-quarters of bats crossed the road below at traffic height or crossed at other nearby locations. One study in the UK found that an overpass with planters was used by two-thirds of crossing bats, and an unvegetated overpass with a paved road over it was not used by crossing bats.

978: Install bat gantries or bat bridges as road/railway crossing structures for bats
Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Bat gantries, or bat bridges, are purpose-built structures designed to act as linear features that will guide echolocating bats over roads at a safe height above traffic. They typically consist of wood or metal pylons erected on either side of the road with wires or mesh over the road between them. The aim is to both reduce the number of bats killed on roads and increase the permeability of roads to maintain connectivity for bats across the landscape. Studies have been summarised below if they provide data that can be used to assess effectiveness, such as a control or the proportion of bats that are or are not using bat gantries.
Bat gantries, or bat bridges, may also be built over railways, although we found no studies that assessed this. For evidence relating to overpasses (solid structures such as bridges built for pedestrians or vehicles), see ‘Install overpasses as road/railway crossing structures for bats’.

BEHAVIOUR (3 STUDIES)      

Use (3 studies): Two replicated studies (including one site comparison) in the UK found that fewer bats used bat gantries than crossed the road below at traffic height, and one bat gantry was not used at all. One replicated study in France found that a temporary bat gantry was used by three bat species/species groups, but almost half of crossing bats flew over the road at other locations.

979: Install green bridges as road/railway crossing structures for bats
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Green bridges are bridges over roads/railways that are covered in vegetation and usually planted with hedgerows and trees. They have been built as mitigation measures usually to guide larger mammals, such as deer, safely across wide roads or railways. A study in Germany found 10 bat species using eight green bridges to fly over a road and also to forage (Bach & Müller-Stiess 2005). However, the study has not been summarised here as it did not provide data that can be used to assess effectiveness, such as a control, or the proportion of bats not using the green bridges. The study described below reports the proportion of bats that are either using a green bridge to cross the road safely or are crossing the road below at risk of collisions with traffic.

980: Install hop-overs as road/railway crossing structures for bats
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
A ‘hop-over’ typically consists of tall vegetation planted on either side of a road/railway with overhanging branches that create a continuous canopy over the gap. The aim is to guide bats across roads/railways at a safe height above traffic. There is evidence that bats will cross roads at greater heights in the presence of high canopy cover or roadside embankments (Russell et al. 2009, Berthinussen & Altringham 2012). However, experiments using two parallel screens at natural gaps in bat flight paths in Denmark had mixed results, with some bats continuing to fly at hazardous heights or abandoning their commuting routes (Christensen et al. 2016).

981: Divert bats to safe crossing points over or under roads/railways with plantings or fencing
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Linear features such as hedgerows and treelines provide important commuting routes for bats (e.g. Limpens & Kapteyn 1991, Verboom & Huitema 1997, Downs & Racey 2006). Roads or railways can fragment these commuting routes cutting off important habitat. Attempts may be made to divert bats from their original commuting routes to crossing structures or safe crossing places along roads/railways, by planting tree lines or hedgerows, or installing fences. Berthinussen & Altringham (2012) found that although diverted bats were not recorded directly, very few bats used two underpasses below roads where attempts had been made to divert bats to them with plantings. Conversely, high numbers of bats were found using an underpass constructed on an original flight path.
For general interventions that involve creating or retaining bat commuting routes, see ‘Create new unlit bat commuting routes using planting’ and ‘Retain existing bat commuting routes’.

989: Use selective or reduced impact logging instead of conventional logging
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Selective logging is the removal of selected trees within a forest based on criteria such as diameter, height, or species. Remaining trees are left in the stand, as opposed to clearcutting where all trees are felled.
Reduced impact logging is a sustainable harvesting and management method that aims to minimize ecological disturbance. It involves selective logging as well as other practices such as directional tree felling, stream buffer zones, constructing roads, trails and landings to minimum widths, and methods to extract timber with minimal damage. One study on reduced impact logging has been included but the effects of selective logging cannot be separated from the other interventions used.

Key Messages:

Four studies evaluated the effects of using selective or reduced impact logging instead of conventional logging on bat populations. Two studies were in the Neotropics, one study was in Italy and one in Germany.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Community composition (1 study): One replicated, controlled, site comparison study in Trinidad found that the composition of bat species differed between selectively logged and conventionally logged forest.
Richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Germany found similar bat diversity in selectively logged and conventionally logged forest.

POPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Abundance (3 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in Germany found similar overall bat activity (relative abundance) in selectively logged and conventionally logged forest. One review of 41 studies in the Neotropics found that reduced impact logging had a smaller effect on bat abundance than conventional logging. One replicated, site comparison study in Italy found greater bat activity at two of three sites that used selective logging techniques to open up the forest canopy rather than leaving the canopy intact.

990: Use shelterwood cutting instead of clearcutting
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
There are several different shelterwood systems. The basic process is the selective removal of overstorey trees to allow enough light through to the forest floor to create new, even-aged stands below. The remaining mature overstorey trees provide seeds for regeneration and create shelter for the younger trees. Harvesting is done in a series of cuts and may also involve thinning of the lower forest canopies.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of using shelterwood cutting instead of ‘gap release’ cutting on bat populations. The study was in Australia. We found no studies that evaluated the effects of shelterwood cutting instead of clearcutting.

991: Thin trees within forest and woodland
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Thinning is a forestry practice that involves the selective removal of trees to reduce tree density and improve the growth rate and health of remaining trees. Thinning has been done historically to maximize timber production but may have ecological benefits. The retention of large old trees may provide roosting sites for bats and opening the canopy may provide favourable foraging habitats.
For studies that used thinning as part of selective logging methods, see the intervention ‘Use selective or reduced impact logging instead of conventional logging'.

Key Messages:

Eleven studies evaluated the effects of thinning trees within forest and woodland on bat populations. Six studies were in the USA, four were in Australia and one was in Canada.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Richness/diversity (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in Australia recorded the same bat species in thinned and unthinned forest, except for the chocolate wattled bat, which was not recorded in forests with unthinned regrowth. One replicated, site comparison study in Australia found that forest thinned up to 20 years previously had higher bat diversity than unthinned forest, but sites thinned more than 20 years previously did not differ.

POPULATION RESPONSE (11 STUDIES)

Abundance (11 studies): Five of six replicated, site comparison studies (including two paired sites studies and one controlled study) in the USA and Australia found higher overall bat activity (relative abundance) in thinned or thinned and burned forest than unthinned forest. The other study found similar overall bat activity in thinned and unthinned stands. One replicated, randomized, site comparison study in the USA found higher overall bat activity for three of four types of thinning and burning treatments. One replicated, site comparison study in Australia found that forest thinned up to eight years previously or more than 20 years previously had higher bat activity than unthinned forest, but sites thinned 8–20 years previously did not differ. Three replicated, controlled studies (including one site comparison and one before-and-after study) in Canada and Australia found that thinning increased the activity of some bat species but not others.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Veteran or damaged trees (of any age and size) and standing dead trees (‘snags’) can provide important roosting sites for bats within crevices, cavities and behind loose bark.
To be included as evidence for this intervention, studies must have monitored a comparison, i.e. compared areas where veteran and standing dead trees have been kept as roosting sites for bats with similar/nearby areas where they have been removed. There must have been an active decision (i.e. intervention) to retain the trees and the study must state when the intervention was carried out.

Logging by clearcutting results in large open, cleared areas in forests (clearcut blocks). Residual tree patches may be left uncut within these areas.
To be included as evidence for this intervention, studies must have monitored a comparison, i.e. compared residual tree patches that have been kept intact with similar/nearby areas where tree patches have been cut down or otherwise degraded. There must have been an active decision (i.e. intervention) to retain the residual tree patches and the study must state when the intervention was carried out.

999: Install and maintain cave gates to restrict public access
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Recreational users of caves can disturb both nursing and hibernating colonies of bats causing abandonment of young or arousal from hibernation. Gates have been installed at cave entrances to restrict public access and reduce human disturbance. However, cave gating can also impede access by bats and early installation attempts from the 1950s to the 1970s often resulted in roost abandonment (Tuttle 1977). For evidence relating to gates at mines, see ‘Install and maintain gates at mine entrances to restrict public access’.

Eleven studies evaluated the effects of installing cave gates on bat populations. Six studies were in the USA and five studies were in Europe.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (7 STUDIES)

Abundance (7 studies): Three of four before-and-after studies (including one replicated study and one controlled study) in the Netherlands, the USA, Spain and Turkey found more or similar numbers of bats in caves and a bunker after gates were installed to restrict public access. The other study found fewer bats in caves after gates were installed. Two before-and-after studies in the USA and Spain found more bats within two caves after the size of the gated entrances were increased. One replicated, before-and-after study in the USA found that installing cave gates resulted in population increases or decreased rates of decline for 13 of 20 colonies of Indiana bat. One replicated, site comparison study in Spain found no difference in the population growth rates of bats roosting in caves with and without cave gates.
Condition (1 study): One site comparison study in the USA found that bats hibernating in a cave with a wall and gate over the entrance lost more body mass than bats in a nearby unmodified cave.

Use (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Spain found no difference in the occupancy rates of bats roosting in caves with and without cave gates.
Behaviour change (4 studies): One replicated, controlled, before-and-after and site comparison study in the USA found that bats at cave entrances circled more and entered caves less after gates were installed. One replicated study in the USA found that bats flew through gates with a funnel design more frequently than gates with a round bar or angle iron design. One randomized, controlled, before-and-after study in the UK found that fewer bats flew through cave gates when the spacing between horizontal bars was reduced. One before-and-after study in the USA found that significantly fewer bats emerged from a cave with a gate installed compared with a cave with a fence.
