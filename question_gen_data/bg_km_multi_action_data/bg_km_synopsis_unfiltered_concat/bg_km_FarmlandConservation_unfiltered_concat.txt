107: Control mink
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:

The UK water vole Arvicola amphibius population has declined by 96% since 1950, which is largely thought to be due to predation by invasive non-native American mink Mustela vison. Mink also prey on fish, birds and other mammals, and can have a significant effect on local wildlife (Defra 2005). This intervention may involve controlling mink populations through trapping.

Key Messages:

A systematic review found seven studies demonstrating that trapping appears to be an effective method of reducing American mink populations, but firm conclusions could not be made due to limitations in experimental design.
A large-scale trapping programme in the UK demonstrated that American mink have been successfully eradicated over a large area and this may have been associated with some localized water vole expansions.

108: Protect individual nests of ground-nesting birds
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:

If fencing does not work to exclude predators (for example, predatory birds) or is not a viable option, it may be possible to protect individual nests using a variety of cages and exclosures. These must be able to allow chicks and adults to get in and out, but not predators and should be quick to install to minimize the chances of parents abandoning nests.

 

Key Messages:

Two replicated,      randomized, controlled studies from Sweden found providing nest exclosures      offered some benefits to ground-nesting birds. One study found that      protected nests had higher average daily survival rates than unprotected      nests for both common redshank and northern lapwing, however, this study      also reported higher predation of adult redshank on protected nests. One study found that the average hatching rate for      southern dunlin was higher for protected rather than unprotected nests. This      study also found no difference in the      number of fledglings, breeding adults or new recruits      during two periods with and without nest protection.

109: Erect predator-proof fencing around important breeding sites for waders
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:

As well as direct predation on adults, predators can have a devastating impact on bird populations through predating eggs and chicks too young to defend themselves or run away. Species such as hedgehogs Erinaceus europaeus or other birds can all affect bird populations in this way and in many cases it is not desirable or practical to remove these species.
This intervention involves erecting predator-proof fencing around important breeding sites for waders to exclude predators.

116: Manage hedgerows to benefit wildlife (includes no spray, gap-filling and laying)
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:

Hedges can be key habitats for farmland biodiversity, but they may need managing to maximize their value. Managing hedges to benefit wildlife involves one or more of the following management changes: reduce cutting frequency; reduce or avoid spraying; mow vegetation beneath hedgerows; fill gaps in hedges; coppice or lay to restore traditional hedge structure.
See also Reduce fertilizer, pesticide or herbicide use generally, which includes studies monitoring hedgerow biodiversity in response to management outside the hedgerows.


Key Messages:

Ten studies from Switzerland and the UK (three replicated and controlled studies of which one was randomized) found that managing hedges for wildlife resulted in increased berry yields, species diversity or richness of plants and invertebrates and diversity or abundance of farmland birds.
Five studies from the UK (including one replicated, controlled and randomized study) found that hedge management did not affect plant species richness, numbers of bumblebee queens or farmland birds. Two replicated studies have shown mixed or adverse effects, with hedge management having mixed effects on invertebrates or leading to reduced hawthorn berry yield.
A replicated site comparison in the UK found hedges cut every two years had more suitable nesting habitat for grey partridge than other management regimes. A replicated study from the UK found that hawthorn berry yield was reduced when management involved removing fruit-bearing wood.

Background information and definitions:

In agricultural landscapes, field margins can provide valuable habitats for maintaining and enhancing biodiversity. The common nettle Urtica dioica is a perennial species that provides food for a range of insects (Greig-Smith 1948), including ‘beneficial’ species that help to suppress pests. This intervention involves planting nettle strips which may enhance invertebrate diversity on arable fields.

Key Messages:

A small study from Belgium found that planting nettle strips in the margins of three arable fields      resulted in a higher number of aphid predator species. The number of aphid predators on a natural patch of      nettles was higher than on crops, however there were fewer predators on      nettle strips than on crops. Three insect families, including green      lacewings, were only found on nettles.

119: Restore or create traditional water meadows
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves restoring or creating traditional water meadows, also known as wet meadows. Water meadows are areas of grazing land or hay meadow that have carefully controlled water levels to keep the soil damp. In Europe they provide valuable breeding habitats for wading birds and other biodiversity.
Techniques used to restore or create plant communities associated with wet meadows may include topsoil removal, which rapidly reduces nutrient levels in nutrient-enriched soils and increases flooding frequency by lowering the ground surface (Hölzel & Otte 2003). In areas where target plant species are not present in the seed bank or plant species have limited dispersal, it may also be important to introduce plant species through sowing, planting or spreading hay from existing wet meadows (Hölzel & Otte 2003).
See also ‘Raise water levels in ditches or grassland’ for studies looking at the effects of raising water levels on grassland.
Hölzel N. & Otte A. (2003) Restoration of a species-rich flood meadow by topsoil removal and diaspore transfer with plant material. Applied Vegetation Science, 6, 131-140.

Key Messages:

Of three studies from Sweden and the UK (two before-and-after trials) looking at bird numbers or densities following water meadow restoration, one study found increases, one study found increases and decreases and one found northern lapwing populations did not increase despite an increase in the area of managed water meadows. 
Seventeen studies from France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Switzerland and the UK (seven replicated controlled studies of which two were also randomized and two reviews) found one or more management techniques that were successful in restoring wet meadow plant communities. The techniques were topsoil removal, introduction of target plant species, raising water levels, grazing, mowing or a combination of removing topsoil and introducing target plant species, plus livestock exclusion. Three studies (one replicated controlled study and two reviews) from the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany and the UK found restoration of wet meadow plant communities had reduced or limited success.
Thirteen studies (five replicated and controlled of which two randomized) from France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the UK monitored the effects of methods to restore or create wet meadow plant communities over a relatively short time period after restoration, and found some positive effects within five years. Three replicated studies (one controlled, one a site comparison) from the Netherlands and Germany found restoration was not complete five, nine or 20 years later. A replicated controlled site comparison from Sweden found plant species richness increased with time since restoration.

120: Provide buffer strips alongside water courses (rivers and streams)
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Riparian buffer strips (uncultivated strips at the edge of waterways) are increasingly being used to help to reduce diffuse pollution from agricultural systems.  Agricultural field margins can provide important habitat for declining farmland species (see sections: Create uncultivated margins around intensive arable or pasture fields, Plant grass buffer strips/margins around arable or pasture fields).  It is therefore important to understand the influence of riparian buffer strip management, placement and structure on biodiversity.

Key Messages:

Three studies      (including one replicated site comparison) from the Netherlands and the UK reported that the provision of riparian buffer strips had a positive      influence on plant, invertebrate and bird diversity or abundance, and supported vegetation associated with habitats preferred      by water voles.


Two replicated site      comparison studies from France and Ireland found that the provision of      riparian buffer strips on farms did not result in an increase in the number of      plant species when compared to farms without buffer strips.


One replicated site      comparison study found ground beetle diversity was higher in grazed      riparian zones and narrow fenced strips than in wide riparian buffer      strips. However the ground beetle assemblages in      wide riparian buffer strips were more distinct from the adjacent pasture      field assemblages than either the grazed riparian zones or narrow fenced      strips.

121: Raise water levels in ditches or grassland
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Wet habitats have been lost from agricultural systems as a result of filling ditches, loss of ponds and removal of water from fields by surface run-off and extensive under-field drainage. These habitats provided important resources for a variety of species and re-wetting may offer an important mechanism for facilitating a reverse in the decline of birds and other farmland biodiversity.
Studies which raise water levels along with a combination of other measures, such as vegetation management, to restore wet grassland are included in the intervention ‘Restore or create traditional water meadows’.

Key Messages:

Seven studies from Denmark, the Netherlands and the UK (two replicated controlled studies and two before-and-after studies) found that raising water levels in ditches or grassland was associated with increased bird numbers, breeding bird numbers, plant species that favour wet conditions, and invertebrate numbers or biomass in agricultural landscapes.
Two replicated studies from the Netherlands and the UK found that raising water levels resulted in a net loss of plant species and did not affect lapwing foraging rate. A review found three studies reporting that re-wetting soils on old arable fields is not an effective method of reducing nutrient levels and restoring species-rich grassland. A replicated study from the UK found that unflooded pastures contained a high biomass of soil macroinvertebrates of importance to breeding wading birds.
A controlled, randomized study from the Netherlands found that raising the water level resulted in a more rapid establishment of species typical of wet grassland, than vegetation management. A review of agri-environment schemes from the UK found studies that suggested more expensive agri-environment scheme options for wetland habitats, such as controlling water levels, were more effective at providing good habitat for wading birds than easier-to-implement options.

Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:


Recent major flooding events have resulted in a change in European water management policies, from flood exclusion strategies to the use of former floodplains through reconnection with main rivers. This change will lead to an increase in flood frequency and may provide opportunities for the restoration of floodplain ecosystems.



Key Messages:

One controlled before-and-after study from the UK found more bird territories and species on a stretch of river modified to allow inundation of river edges compared to a channelized section of river.

123: Control weeds without damaging other plants in conservation areas
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:

This intervention involves controlling perennial weeds in nature conservation areas including field margins or fallow land. Invasive weed species can have an impact on the conservation and restoration of biodiversity, but control with herbicides can also be detrimental to non-target species (English Nature 2003). The use of mechanical methods and biological control, including the use of pathogens, are important alternatives to chemical control strategies, particularly where adverse effects of agrochemicals on the environment must be minimized or avoided (English Nature 2003).
The majority of evidence on the effectiveness of these interventions is currently available for creeping thistle Cirsium arvense, which is a persistent perennial weed that causes problems in arable fields, grasslands, pastures and within nature conservation areas. Limited evidence is available for purple moor grass Molinia caerulea, which can threaten the conservation of heather Calluna vulgaris dominated moorland or heathland.
See also ‘Control invasive non-native plants on farmland’ for studies which looked at methods of controlling non-native plants.

Key Messages:

Two studies looked at the effects of controlling weeds on the surrounding vegetation. One study from the UK found that new populations of rare arable plants established following the control of perennial weeds in a nature conservation area. A replicated, controlled and randomized study in the UK found that using grass-specific herbicide reduced grass diversity and resulted in increases in broadleaved plants. 
Eleven studies investigated different methods of controlling plants. A review found that specific management regimes can reduce the abundance of pernicious weeds in nature conservation areas. Four replicated controlled studies (one also randomized) from Denmark and Germany found cutting and infection with fungal pathogens were effective methods for controlling creeping thistle and one replicated, randomized, controlled trial from the UK found long-term control was achieved by lenient grazing. A replicated, controlled and randomized study in Germany found weevils could be used to infect creeping thistle with systemic rust. One study found a non-native beetle was unsuitable for controlling creeping thistle because it had poor survival in the UK climate. A replicated controlled study found that spraying a high concentration of herbicide killed less than half of broad-leaved dock plants. A replicated, controlled, randomized study found black grass was eliminated with a December treatment of grass-specific herbicide. A small replicated study found that Hebridean sheep grazed more purple moor grass than Swaledale sheep.
Two replicated controlled laboratory and grassland studies found negative impacts of the herbicide asulam on green dock beetles.

Planting more than one crop in each field increases habitat heterogeneity at a smaller scale than increasing crop diversity at a landscape scale (see ‘Increase crop diversity’). Farmland heterogeneity is thought to be key for increasing farmland biodiversity (Benton et al. 2003) and so planting multiple crops in a single field may help increase its biological value.

126: Reduce tillage
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Conventional ploughing uses a mould-board plough, cultivating to a depth of around 20 cm. This intervention includes various methods to reduce the depth or intensity of ploughing, such as layered cultivation, non-inversion tillage and conservation tillage. It also includes stopping tillage altogether in some areas.
Reduced tillage is often used in the context of ‘Integrated Farm Management’ (IFM), a whole farm system designed to enhance natural processes within a productive system (for example Hasken & Poehling 1995). These studies have not been included here unless the effects can clearly be related to the tillage practice as opposed to other elements of the system such as crop rotation, field margins, or reduced chemical use.
Conservation tillage, often accompanied by the use of cover crops or retention of crop residues, is widely practiced in the USA. A 2004 review (Holland 2004) of the broad environmental effects of conservation tillage found the bulk of the evidence came from North American studies, with studies from Europe being sparse. For example, seven American studies found more ground-nesting birds on conservation tillage fields than conventionally tilled fields, and two studies found that rodents were more abundant in conservation tillage fields. However, both bird and rodent faunas in North America are functionally different from those in Europe (more ground-nesting birds in arable fields in the US, for example).
A set of studies on the effects of avoiding tillage when re-seeding heathland with grass to improve it for grazing (Grant 1992a-c) is included under ‘Employ areas of semi-natural habitat for rough grazing’.

Key Messages:

A total of 42 individual studies (including seven replicated, controlled and randomized studies and six reviews) from Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Switzerland and the UK investigated the effects of reducing tillage on farmland wildlife. Thirty-four studies (of which 21 were replicated and controlled and seven also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found some positive effects on earthworms, some invertebrates (other than earthworms), weeds or farmland birds, of reducing tillage compared to conventional management. Positive effects included increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms, greater abundance of some invertebrates other than earthworms, increased numbers of some weeds and/or weed species, higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying date and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields, and greater abundance of some birds - including Eurasian skylark, seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in late winter on non-inversion or conservation tillage. A review found tillage had negative effects on invertebrate numbers and no-till systems had more invertebrate bird food resources.
Twenty-six studies (of which 13 replicated and controlled and three also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found reducing tillage had either negative, no effect or no consistent effects on abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates (other than earthworms), earthworm abundance, biomass, or species richness, number of different plant species found as seeds, number of some weed species, mammal abundance, some bird species, and one study found bird preferences for conservation tillage fields decreased over time. Two studies found that crop type affected the number of weeds under different tillage regimes.
One small replicated trial in the UK compared bird numbers under two different forms of reduced tillage, and found more birds from species that make up the ‘Farmland Bird Index’ on broadcast than non-inversion tillage fields.
Two studies looked at the long-term effects of reduced tillage on earthworms (after ten years). One study found higher earthworm biomass under reduced tillage, the other study found earthworm abundance was the same between conventional and reduced tillage plots.
Three of the studies mentioned above did not distinguish between the effects of reducing tillage and reduced pesticide and/or fertilizer inputs.

129: Add yellow rattle seed <i>Rhinanthus minor</i> to hay meadows
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:

This intervention involves adding yellow rattle Rhinanthus minor seed to grassland to help establish meadow plant communities. Yellow rattle is an annual wildflower native to the UK which parasitizes other wildflowers and grasses (Natural England 2009). By parasitizing other plants, particularly grasses, yellow rattle can reduce the dominant plant biomass in grasslands allowing other wildflower species to establish (Natural England 2009). See also ‘Restore species-rich, semi-natural grassland’ for studies that used yellow rattle in the restoration or creation of semi-natural grassland.
Natural England (2009) The use of yellow rattle to facilitate grassland diversification. Natural England Technical Information Note TIN060.


Key Messages:

A review of studies from the UK found that adding hay rattle seed helped other sown target meadow species to colonize and that more plant species were found when yellow rattle was present. A randomized, replicated controlled trial in the UK found that yellow rattle could be established on a pasture field by ‘slot seeding’.

130: Implement 'mosaic management', a Dutch agri-environment option
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:

Mosaic management is a Dutch agri-environment scheme that, rather than concentrating on individual farms, attempts to coordinate management across groups of farms. Interventions include delayed and staggered mowing, refuge strips and nest protection and aim to provide suitable foraging habitat for wader chicks throughout the year.

 

Key Messages:

A replicated, controlled, before-and-after study from the Netherlands found that northern lapwing population trends changed from decreases to increases following the introduction of mosaic management. Three other species of wading bird did not show such a response and Eurasian oystercatcher populations did less well under mosaic management than other management types.
A replicated, paired sites study in the Netherlands that black-tailed godwit had higher productivity under mosaic management than other management types due to higher nest survival, and nests were less likely to be trampled by livestock or destroyed by mowing under mosaic management.

131: Delay mowing or first grazing date on pasture or grassland
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves delaying the first mowing or grazing date on grasslands. Early-season, mechanized mowing is thought to be responsible for declines in the UK and elsewhere of species such as the corncrake Crex crex, with chicks killed and nests destroyed by mowing machinery (Green & Gibbons 2000). Delaying mowing until after chicks can escape is therefore a part of many agri-environment schemes. Delaying mowing or grazing may also provide benefits to other farmland wildlife such as plants and invertebrates.
Green R.E. & Gibbons D.W. (2000) The status of the Corncrake Crex crex in Britain in 1998. Bird Study, 47, 129-137.

Key Messages:

Eight studies from the Netherlands, Sweden and the UK (three replicated and controlled of which one also randomized and one European systematic review) found that delaying mowing or grazing dates resulted in benefits to some or all plants, invertebrates or birds studied. These benefits included: higher plant species richness, higher densities of two rare arable weeds, more insect species and individuals visiting flowers, greater abundance of some spiders and ground beetles, increased breeding wading bird densities, and increased Eurasian skylark productivity.
Three reviews found the UK corncrake population increased after measures including delaying mowing dates were introduced.
Six studies from Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK (including three replicated controlled trials of which one was also randomized and a European systematic review) found that delaying mowing or grazing dates on grassland had no clear effect on plant species richness, ground beetle communities, abundance of some insects and spiders, or population trends of wading bird species.

132: Leave uncut strips of rye grass on silage fields
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:

This intervention involves leaving areas of uncut rye grass in silage fields. In the UK, seed-eating songbirds have declined across farmland, probably in part because of a lack of winter food. Rye grass Lolium perenne seeds are a potential food source, but cutting rye grass fields multiple times a year for silage removes seed heads before they can ripen and so reduces the food available to birds the following winter. Leaving fields or plots uncut may provide valuable overwinter food for birds and may also provide suitable habitat away from damaging harvesting machinery for other farmland wildlife such as invertebrates.
 

 

Key Messages:

Two reviews and two replicated controlled trials from the UK found that leaving uncut strips of rye grass on silage fields resulted in benefits to birds including increased numbers. One of these studies found that whilst seed-eating birds preferred rye grass cut once only, birds that fed on different food resources such as insect-eaters showed more variable results with some preferring plots cut two or more times.
One replicated controlled randomized study from the UK found no difference in ground beetle abundance and diversity between cut and uncut silage field headlands in the first two years of the experiment, but higher species diversity in uncut plots in the third year.

133: Restore/create species-rich, semi-natural grassland
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:

The area of species-rich grassland in northwest Europe declined dramatically during the twentieth century in response to agricultural intensification (Walker et al. 2004). Restoring this habitat is a high priority for many conservation groups, and in the UK a number of agri-environment schemes support the restoration or creation of species-rich semi-natural grasslands (Walker et al. 2004). Measures used to restore or create grasslands of high plant diversity such as chalk grasslands and hay meadows include grazing, mowing, sowing and hay spreading.
See also ‘Reduce management intensity on permanent grasslands’ for studies where the endpoint is still an economically viable agricultural grassland, rather than a species-rich grassland with nature conservation as its main objective.
See also ‘Restore or create traditional water meadows’ for studies where the species-rich grassland in question is (or was) either fen meadow, or frequently flooded water meadow.
See also ‘Add yellow rattle seed Rhinanthus minor to hay meadows’ for studies looking at the effects of adding yellow rattle seed to grasslands.
See also ‘Reduce chemical inputs in grassland management’, for studies where the sole intervention has been to reduce or cease chemical inputs, in an attempt to restore plant communities.

Key Messages:

Twenty-eight studies monitored the effects on wildlife of restoring species-rich grassland. Of these, 20 from Finland, Germany, Lithuania, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK (15 replicated of which eight controlled and three also randomized) found restoring species-rich grassland resulted in higher ground beetle abundance, increased plant species richness, farmland bird abundance, pollinating insect density and diversity and earthworm abundance than other types of grassland, or that restored grasslands had similar abundance and species richness of insects to old traditionally managed sites.
Seven studies from Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK (five replicated and controlled, two also randomized) found that efforts to restore species-rich grassland had no clear effect on the species richness or abundance of plants, beetles, or the abundance of butterflies and moths. Three replicated studies from Sweden and the UK (one also controlled and two site comparisons) found that restored grassland had a lower diversity and frequency of certain plant species, and attracted fewer foraging queen bumblebees than continuously grazed or unmanaged grasslands.
We captured 40 studies (including 19 replicated and controlled studies of which six were also randomized, and six reviews) from nine European countries that found ten different techniques used alone or in combinations were effective for restoring species-rich grassland. Effective techniques included: grazing, introducing plant species, hay spreading and mowing.
We found 22 studies from seven European countries that included information on the length of time taken to restore grassland communities (including 16 replicated trials of which nine also controlled and three reviews). Six studies saw positive signs of restoration in less than five years, 11 studies within 10 years and two studies found restoration took more than 10 years. Six studies found limited or slow changes in plant communities following restoration. Two studies from Germany and the UK (one replicated controlled trial) found differences in vegetation between restored and existing species-rich grasslands nine or 60 years after restoration.

134: Use organic rather than mineral fertilizers
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:

The use of chemicals in agricultural management, such as synthetic fertilizers, may have a detrimental effect on farmland biodiversity. Organic fertilizers such as farmyard manure (including green manure or crop residues), slurry and other composts provide an alternative to synthetic or mineral fertilizers. Mineral fertilizers are manufactured preparations including nitrogen N, phosphorous P or potassium K, or 'NPK'.

 

Key Messages:

Seventeen studies (including three reviews) from Austria, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland and the UK looked at the effects of using organic rather than mineral fertilizers. Fourteen studies (including two reviews and seven replicated and controlled studies, of which four also randomized) from Austria, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland and the UK found that areas treated with organic rather than mineral fertilizers supported higher plant diversity and cover or species richness, increased earthworm abundance or diversity, biomass and density and increased abundance and/or species richness of some or all invertebrates investigated. 
A literature review found organic fertilizers without pesticides produced highest earthworm biomass. A small trial in Belgium found more predatory beetles on an arable field two years after organic fertilizer application than on a control plot.
One randomized, replicated, controlled trial in the UK found that using organic rather than mineral fertilizers did not affect the abundance of three weed species. A replicated study from Ireland found that the application of farmyard manure had no long-term effect on invertebrates, whilst two studies from the UK found the increase in arthropod predators and springtails was only seen at a local not a field scale. A review found one study from the UK reporting that heavy applications of slurry can be toxic to common earthworms.

135: Manage ditches to benefit wildlife
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Ditch bank biodiversity is declining in agricultural landscapes and so management is required to maintain and increase species diversity. Ditch wildlife has been shown to be affected by agricultural management practices such as mowing and grazing regimes (e.g. van Strien et al. 1989) and by ditch management practices including cleaning/dredging technique, season and frequency (e.g. van Strien et al. 1991, Twisk et al. 2000, 2003).
In the Netherlands, botanical agri-environment schemes to enhance biodiversity are most commonly applied to ditch banks. Farmers are encouraged to follow the recommended management, i.e. low stocking rate, first mowing at the end of June or beginning July, no fertilization and deposition of dredging material at the high end of the ditch bank.

Key Messages:
 

Five out of a total eight studies from the Netherlands and the UK (including one replicated, controlled paired study and three replicated site comparisons) looking at the effects of managing ditches on biodiversity, found that this intervention resulted in increased invertebrate biomass or abundance, plant species richness, emergent plant cover, amphibian diversity and abundance, bird visit rates and higher numbers of some bird species or positive impacts on some birds in plots with ditches managed under agri-environment schemes. 
One replicated controlled and paired study from the Netherlands found higher plant diversity on ditch banks along unsprayed edges of winter wheat compared to those sprayed with pesticides. 
Three studies from the Netherlands and the UK (including two replicated site comparisons) found that ditch management had negative or no clear effects on some farmland bird species or plants.

136: Undersow spring cereals, with clover for example
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:

This intervention involves sowing grass or clover beneath a cereal crop. The undersown crop is later ploughed in.

 

Key Messages:

A total of fifteen studies from the UK, Austria, Denmark, Finland and Switzerland (including four replicated, controlled and randomised studies and two reviews) looked at the effects of undersowing spring cereals on biodiversity. Eleven studies (including seven replicated trials, of which one controlled and three randomized and controlled, and one review) found that undersowing spring cereals benefited some birds, plants, insects, spiders and earthworms. These benefits to farmland wildlife included increases in barnacle goose abundance, densities of singing Eurasian skylark and nesting dunnock, arthropod abundance and species richness, and bumblebee, butterfly, earthworm, ground beetle, spider or springtail abundances.
Five studies from Austria, Finland and the UK (including three replicated studies of which one was also controlled and randomized, and a review) found that undersowing spring cereals did not benefit invertebrates, plants, grey partridge population indicators, or nesting densities of two out of three farmland bird species. One replicated study from the UK found only one out of five bird species was found more frequently on undersown wheat stubbles than conventionally managed barley.

137: Plant crops in spring rather than autumn
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:

This intervention involves planting crops in spring rather than autumn. Changes in farming practice in northern Europe have included a shift from sowing crops in spring to sowing them the preceding autumn/winter. This change is considered to have adversely affected farmland biodiversity including invertebrates and farmland birds (see, for example, Donald & Vickery, 2000).

Vickery (eds) Ecology and Conservation of Lowland Farmland Birds, British Ornithologists Union, Tring.


Key Messages:

A total of nine studies from Denmark, Sweden and the UK looked at the effects of sowing crops in spring or autumn on farmland wildlife. Five studies (including one replicated controlled trial, and a review) found that planting crops in spring rather than autumn resulted in higher numbers of farmland birds, weed diversity or weed density and one arable weed species produced more fruit on spring-sown crops.
A review found one study from the UK showing that four out of five species of arable weed produced more fruits on autumn-sown crops. A second review found one study showing that there were more invertebrates in winter wheat than spring wheat.
A replicated study from the UK found that winter and spring sown crops were used for different broods by Eurasian skylarks. A replicated site comparison found arthropod abundance was higher in autumn barley in early summer and spring barley in late summer. A replicated, controlled study in Sweden, found that northern lapwings nested on spring-sown crops more than expected based on their availability, but hatching success on spring crops was lower than on autumn crops.

138: Raise mowing height on grasslands to benefit farmland wildlife
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:

Vegetation height is important in determining the value of a grassland to wildlife. High vegetation can provide more complex environments and more habitats, but short vegetation can allow birds access to the ground which can help foraging, and can reduce the risk of predation.

 

Key Messages:

A replicated controlled study and a review from the UK found that raised mowing heights provided benefits to Eurasian skylark including increased productivity. A review found raised cutting heights were less damaging to amphibians and invertebrates.
A randomized, replicated, controlled trial from the UK found that raising mowing height on grasslands had no effect on numbers of foraging birds or invertebrates. One replicated controlled study found no difference in invertebrate abundance.
One replicated study from the UK found that northern lapwing and common starling chicks had greater foraging success in shorter grass.

139: Reduce fertilizer, pesticide or herbicide use generally
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Pesticide, herbicide and fertilizer applications may have a negative impact on farmland wildlife. This intervention may involve reducing or ceasing applications of pesticides (such as insecticides, fungicides), herbicides and fertilizers.
Several European countries (Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden) introduced initiatives in the 1990s to reduce pesticide applications (Pretty 2005). In Denmark, a Pesticide Action Plan was introduced in 1986 with the aim of reducing total pesticide applications by 50% in 10 years in order to reduce impacts on biodiversity and groundwater resources (Jørgensen & Kudsk 2006). Reductions continued and by 2004, Danish farmers had reduced inputs of pesticides by 56% (kg of active ingredient) and 20% (treatment frequency index) (Jørgensen & Kudsk 2006).
See also ‘Leave headlands in fields unsprayed (conservation headlands)’, which also has monitoring of biodiversity in response to reduced fertilizer, pesticide and herbicide applications.

Key Messages:

Of 38 individual studies from Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden and the UK investigating the effects of reducing fertilizers, pesticides or herbicides, 34 studies (23 replicated, of which six also controlled and randomized, one review and one systematic review) found benefits to some invertebrates, plants, or farmland birds. Twenty-five studies (16 replicated, of which seven also randomized and controlled and one review) found negative, mixed, minimal or no effects on some invertebrates, farmland birds or plants.
Ten studies (six replicated, controlled studies of which two randomized) from three countries found positive effects of reducing or stopping pesticide applications on invertebrates, plants, or birds. Eight studies (two replicated controlled and randomized, one paired before-and-after trial) from four countries found inconsistent or no effects on some invertebrates or birds.
Ten studies (nine replicated, five also controlled and a European systematic review) from four countries found positive effects of reducing or stopping herbicide use on plants, invertebrates, and birds. Five replicated studies (two also controlled and randomized) from three countries found no or mixed effects on birds, invertebrates and plants.
Five studies (three replicated controlled of which two randomized) from four countries found positive effects of reducing or stopping fertilizer applications on invertebrates, Eurasian skylark, or plants. Four studies (three replicated, controlled and randomized) from two countries found reducing or stopping fertilizer inputs had no, or no consistent effects on some invertebrates and farmland birds. Two studies from the UK (one replicated) found plots where fertilizer inputs were not reduced tended to have higher earthworm biomass or abundance.
Fifteen studies (three replicated controlled of which one also randomized, five site comparisons and one review) from seven countries looked at the effects of reducing or stopping applications of two or more inputs: pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers. Thirteen studies found positive effects of reducing two or more inputs on some or all invertebrates, plants, soil organisms, and birds studied. Seven studies found negative or no effects of reducing combinations of inputs on some invertebrates, plants or birds.

145: Increase the proportion of semi-natural habitat in the farmed landscape
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:

Agricultural intensification has resulted in a loss of semi-natural habitats.  These habitats include field margins, ditch banks, hedgerows, woods and ponds. Those that persist support a high proportion of the remaining farmland biodiversity.
This intervention is backed up by a body of correlative evidence, which tends to find higher biodiversity or species abundances in areas with higher proportions of semi-natural landscape. For example, in a review looking at the relationship between agricultural biodiversity and semi-natural habitats (Grashof-Bokdam and van Langevelde, 2005),  seven of nine studies found significantly higher spider, bird, plant or butterfly diversity in agricultural landscapes with greater proportions of semi-natural habitat.  The one study on mammal species found no such effect.
Here we summarize studies in which the proportion of semi-natural habitat in the farmed landscape has been manipulated and responses of wildlife have been monitored. Studies assessing the effects of the Swiss Ecological Compensation Areas scheme at a landscape scale are included here. This scheme obliged farmers in Switzerland to manage at least 7 % of their agricultural land area as Ecological Compensation Areas, from 1998 onwards.

Key Messages:
Five studies monitored the effects of the Swiss Ecological Compensation Areas scheme at a landscape scale, including three replicated site comparisons. Of these, one found an increase in numbers of birds of some species.

146: Make direct payments per clutch for farmland birds
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:

Most agri-environment schemes aim to compensate farmers for the cost of conservation management on their land, irrespective of the outcomes. The Netherlands, however, also has a scheme where farmers are paid directly, based on the number of breeding bird pairs on their land.

 

Key Messages:

Two replicated and controlled studies from the Netherlands found limited evidence for increased wading bird populations on farms with per-clutch payments. One study found no population effects over three years. The second found slightly higher breeding densities of wading birds, but not higher overall numbers.
A replicated and controlled study found higher hatching success of northern lapwing and black-tailed godwit on farms with payment schemes than control farms.


A replicated site comparison from the Netherlands that looked at the effects of per-clutch payments in combination with postponed agricultural activities found more birds bred on 12.5 ha plots under the per-clutch payment and postponed agricultural activities scheme but found no differences at the field-scale.

147: Provide refuges during harvest or mowing
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:


During mowing and harvesting operations, ground‐nesting birds frequently remain in long grass or crops for as long as possible. If mowing/harvest occurs from the outside of the field inwards, this behaviour can leave the birds trapped in the centre of the field and killed as the last patch is harvested. However, if unharvested refuges are left in fields then it is possible that chicks and adults will remain in them and survive.


 

Key Messages:

Three studies examined the effect of providing refuges for birds during harvest or mowing in France and the UK. One replicated study in France found evidence that providing refuges during mowing reduced contact between mowing machinery and unfledged quail and corncrakes. However one replicated controlled study and a review from the UK found that Eurasian skylark did not use nesting refuges more than other areas.

149: Plant cereals for whole crop silage	
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:

Cereal-based wholecrop silage is an intervention that involves growing crops, not grass, to turn into silage. This may provide seed resources for grain-eating farmland birds throughout the year and provide habitat for invertebrates.

 

Key Messages:

Two studies (one review, one replicated trial) from the UK investigated the effects of cereal-based whole crop silage. One replicated study found that cereal-based whole crop silage fields were used more by farmland birds and supported a higher abundance of seed-eating songbirds, swallows and martins than other crop types. The same study also found that important bird food plants were more abundant in cereals than other crop types and more invertebrates were found in wheat, barley and grass silage fields compared to maize.
A review found one study in which cereal-based whole crop silage fields were avoided by seed-eating birds during winter, but used as much as a control during summer.

153: Create scrapes and pools
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:

Creating scrapes and pools in wetlands and wet grasslands can help create a heterogenous habitat, with varying vegetation types and water levels. Scrapes consist of pools or strips of shallow water which dry during the summer. The muddy margins may provide suitable feeding conditions for invertebrates and wading birds (Natural England 2010).
Natural England (2010) Illustrated guide to ponds and scrapes. Natural England Technical Information Note TIN079.


Key Messages:

Three studies from Sweden and the UK (including two site comparisons one of which was replicated) found that the creation of scrapes and pools provided habitat for a range of plant, invertebrate or bird species and resulted in increased aquatic macroinvertebrate diversity. One of these studies found constructed pools supported locally or nationally scarce species of plant and water beetle.


A study in Sweden found that a combination of      large surface area, high shoreline complexity and shallow depth resulted      in increased bird, bottom-dwelling invertebrate and aquatic plant      diversity. However there were fewer fish species than in natural wetlands. Two replicated      studies from Ireland and the UK (one controlled paired study and a site      comparison) found that bird visit rates were higher but invertebrate      numbers varied in ditch-fed paired ponds compared with dry controls and total macroinvertebrate and beetle richness did not      differ between artificial and natural ponds, although communities did      differ.

Key Messages:

Two studies from the UK (a before-and-after study and a controlled study) found that the provision of owl nest boxes in farm buildings maintained barn owl nesting and roosting activity and resulted in an increase in population density. A study from the Netherlands found that the barn owl population increased with increased availability of nest boxes.
A replicated, controlled study in Hungary found that juvenile barn owls fledged from nest boxes were significantly less likely to be recovered alive than those reared in church towers.

155: Provide nest boxes for birds
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves providing nest boxes for birds on farmland. Nest boxes can provide suitable habitats for hole-nesting birds where more natural nesting habitats such as tree cavities are scarce (Newton 1994). Nest boxes may consist of a wooden box with a circular (or other shaped) entrance hole and can be installed on poles or attached to trees.
See also ‘Provide owl nest boxes (Tawny owl, Barn owl)’ for studies looking at the effects of providing nest boxes for owls that commonly nest in farm buildings, such as barn owls or tawny owls.

Key Messages:

Two studies (including one before and after study) from the Netherlands and the UK found that following the provision of nest boxes there was an increase in the number of Eurasian kestrel clutches and breeding tree sparrows. One replicated study from Switzerland found the number of Eurasian wryneck broods in nest boxes declined over five years whilst the number of Eurasian hoopoe broods increased.
Eight studies from Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK (six were replicated) found that nest boxes in agricultural habitats were occupied by Eurasian kestrel, long-eared owl, common starling, tits Parus spp., tree sparrow, stock dove and jackdaw, and Eurasian wryneck and Eurasian hoopoe. Whilst two studies from the UK (a replicated, paired site study and a controlled study) found that carrion crows did not nest in artificial trees and tree sparrows showed a preference for nest boxes in wetland habitat, compared to those in farmland sites.
Two replicated studies from Sweden found that nest success within boxes was related to the amount of pasture available and nest boxes positioned higher above the ground had higher occupancy, numbers of eggs and numbers of hatched young.

156: Provide or retain set-aside areas in farmland
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:

Allocation of some farmland to set-aside (fields taken out of production) was compulsory under European agricultural policy from 1992 until 2008.  The idea was to reduce production. However, set-aside has also been promoted as a method of enhancing biodiversity within farmland.  Set-aside can be rotational (in a different place every year or two) or non-rotational (same place for 5-20 years) and fields can either be sown with fallow crops or left to naturally regenerate.  Unlike fallow land left for the benefit of ground-nesting birds or arable plants, set-aside is not ploughed or harrowed except for the purpose of sowing.
Set-aside is often managed by cutting and/or spraying.  In some cases, set-aside land has had strips of wildflowers or grasses sown on it. Evidence for the effects of this management has been included under the following interventions: ‘Plant nectar flower mixture wildflower strips’ and ‘Plant grass buffer strips margins around arable or pasture fields’.


Key Messages:

We found 34 studies comparing use of set-aside areas with control farmed fields. Two were reviews, none were randomized, replicated, controlled trials. Of these, 20 (from Austria, Finland, Germany and the UK) showed benefits to or higher use by all wildlife groups considered. Twelve (from Finland, Germany, Ireland, Sweden and the UK) found some species or groups used set-aside more than crops, others did not. Two studies (all from the UK) found no effect, one found an adverse effect of set-aside.
Three of the studies, all looking at skylarks, went beyond counting animal or plant numbers and measured reproductive success. Two from the UK found higher nest survival or productivity on set-aside than control fields. One from the UK found lower nest survival on set-aside.
Fifteen studies (from Belgium, Germany, Sweden and the UK) monitored wildlife on set-aside fields, or in landscapes with set-aside, without directly comparing with control fields or landscapes. Three looked at set-aside age and found more plants or insects on set-aside more than a year old. Two compared use of different non-crop habitats and found neither insects nor small mammals preferred set-aside. Two showed increased bird numbers on a landscape scale after set-aside was introduced, amongst other interventions. Eight looked at effects of set-aside management such as use of fertilizer and sowing or cutting regimes.
A systematic review from the UK found significantly higher densities of farmland birds on fields removed from production and under set-aside designation than on conventionally farmed fields in both winter and summer.

246: Plant grass buffer strips/margins around arable or pasture fields
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:

This intervention involves planting field margins with a grass-rich seed mixture. It includes ‘floristically-enhanced’ grass margins available under the English Higher Level Stewardship scheme. The margins are not fertilized and only spot-treated with herbicides if necessary.


Key Messages:

Nineteen studies from Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden and the UK (including seven replicated controlled studies of which two were randomized, and three reviews), found that planting grass buffer strips (some margins floristically-enhanced) increased arthropod abundance, species richness and diversity. A review found grass margins benefited bumblebees and some other invertebrates but did not distinguish between the effects of several different margin types.
Nine studies from the UK (including seven replicated studies of which two were controlled, and two reviews) found that planting grass buffer strips (some margins floristically-enhanced) benefits birds, resulting in increased numbers, densities, species richness and foraging time.
Seven studies from the Netherlands and the UK (all replicated of which four were controlled and two randomized), found that planting grass buffer strips (some margins floristically-enhanced) increased the cover and species richness of plants. A review found grass margins benefited plants but did not distinguish between the effects of several different margin types.
Five studies from Finland and the UK (including two replicated, controlled trials and a review), found that planting grass buffer strips benefits small mammals: including increased activity and numbers.
Six studies from the Netherlands and the UK (including three replicated, controlled trials) found that planting grass buffer strips had no clear effect on insect numbers, bird numbers or invertebrate pest populations. A replicated site comparison found sown grassy margins were not the best option for conservation of rare arable plants.

362: Manage the agricultural landscape to enhance floral resources
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:

Managing landscapes to enhance nectar and pollen resources for flower-visiting insects is increasingly recognized as an important strategy to enhance the agricultural pollination service and to conserve pollinator populations. It could involve increasing the diversity or area of flowering crops or conserving aspects of the landscape, such as flower-rich meadows, woodlands or river banks, which provide important floral resources.
In Europe, recent research has shown that higher coverage of the mass-flowering crop, oilseed rape Brassica napus, in the landscape is associated with higher numbers of foraging worker bumblebees Bombus spp. at focal sampling points, but not with enhanced bumblebee reproductive success or colony densities (Westphal et al. 2003, Herrmann et al. 2007, Westphal et al. 2009). This work is not summarized by Conservation Evidence because the evidence is correlative, the area of flowering crops was not increased as a conservation measure.

Key Messages:

One large replicated controlled trial showed that the average abundance of long-tongued bumblebees on field margins was positively correlated with the number of ‘pollen and nectar’ agri-environment agreements in a 10 km grid square.

442: Plant nectar flower mixture/wildflower strips

Background information and definitions:

Flowering plants are sown in strips or blocks, providing forage resources for bees and other flower-visiting insects. Increased insect numbers may then provide food for more birds. Nectar flower mixture may include agricultural varieties of flowering plants such as clovers.

Key Messages:

A total of 80 individual studies have in some way investigated the effects of flowering strips on biodiversity. Sixty-four individual studies show some benefits to one or more wildlife groups.


Sixty-five individual studies reported the effects of flower strips on invertebrates. Of these, fifty reported positive effects. Forty-one studies from eight European countries (including five reviews and twenty-three replicated controlled studies, of which one randomized and two site comparisons) found evidence that flower strips had a positive influence on invertebrate numbers with increased abundance, species richness/diversity, or both. Ten studies (nine replicated of which two controlled) found invertebrates visited or foraged on flower strips but did not specify increases/decreases in numbers. Two studies found effects on ground beetles other than changes in numbers. One replicated controlled study showed that ground beetles were more active or had enhanced feeding/reproductive conditions in flower strips. A review found flower strips supported ground beetle species that were rarely found in crops. Fifteen studies reported mixed or negative effects of flower strips on invertebrates. Six studies found no significant effects.


Twenty-one studies looked at the effects of flower strips on plants. Sixteen studies from seven European countries (including ten replicated controlled studies of which one randomized) found evidence that flower strips had higher plant cover, number of flowers, diversity, and species richness. One review found flower strips benefited plants but did not specify how. Four studies found negative or no effects of flower strips on the number or diversity of plant species. Five studies described the effects of different margin establishment or management techniques on plants.


Seven studies investigated birds and wildflower strips. Four replicated, controlled studies from Switzerland and the UK (two of which were randomized) and one review of European studies found evidence that plots sown with a wildflower or legume seed mix had a positive influence on birds. Flower strips attracted more birds or bird species and the number of birds using flower strips increased over time. Eurasian skylarks preferentially foraged in, and nested in or near, sown weed patches and were less likely to abandon their territories when they included sown weed patches. However one replicated trial in Switzerland found barn owls avoided sown wildflower areas. Two winter recording periods of the same replicated, controlled study in the UK found there were not more bird species or individuals on wildflower plots compared to control margins.


All five studies investigating the effects of wildflower strips on small mammals (four replicated studies from Switzerland and one review of studies from north-western Europe) found evidence that small mammals benefit from strips sown with wildflowers or flowers rich in pollen and nectar, with increases in abundance, density and species richness. One replicated study from Switzerland reported that most common vole home ranges and core regions of their territories were found within a wildflower strip.


Nineteen studies (of which eight replicated, controlled) reported positive effects on biodiversity of sowing specific plant species including phacelia, and/or other plant species such as borage and red clover. Three replicated studies (two also controlled) found negative impacts or no effects on biodiversity of sowing phacelia.

538: Plant new hedges
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:

Agricultural intensification, which has included increasing field size and pesticide use, has resulted in a loss of field margin habitats, such as hedgerows. These features can provide a relatively undisturbed habitat for wildlife in intensively managed agricultural landscapes. Hedge planting has therefore been investigated to determine whether it can enhance biodiversity; evidence to date focuses mainly on invertebrates.


Key Messages:

Two studies from France and the UK compared newly planted hedges with control areas. Both (including one replicated trial) found newly planted hedges had higher abundance, species richness or diversity of beetles or spiders than crop fields or field margins. The replicated study also found vascular plant species diversity and grass species richness were higher in newly planted hedges than recently established grass field margins. A review found newly established hedges supported more ground beetles than older hedges.
A small-scale study from the UK found that local hawthorn plants exhibited better growth and were more stock proof than those of eight other provenances. A literature review found lower pest outbreaks in areas with new hedges. A replicated study in the UK found that the diversity of arthropods supported by newly planted hedges varied between seven different plant species
An unreplicated site comparison study in Germany found that two out of 85 ground beetle species used newly planted hedges as stepping stones for dispersal. Results from the same study found that invertebrates that moved passively (attached to mammals and birds), such as snails, benefited most from the hedge-islands compared to actively moving ground beetles and harvestmen.

539: Use traditional breeds of livestock
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:

This intervention involves stocking areas with traditional or rustic breeds of livestock. Traditional or rustic breeds of livestock are often recommended for nature conservation management.


Key Messages:

Two UK studies (one replicated) and a review reported differences in quantities of plant species grazed, vegetation structure and invertebrate assemblages between areas grazed with different breeds of sheep or cattle. A small, replicated study found that Hebridean sheep grazed more purple moor grass than Swaledale sheep, but the resulting density of purple moor grass and heather did not differ. A UK study found that at reduced grazing pressure, traditional and commercial cattle breeds created different sward structures and associated invertebrate assemblages.
One replicated trial from France, Germany and the UK found grazing by traditional rather than commercial livestock breeds had no clear effect on the number of plant species or the abundance of butterflies, grasshoppers, birds, hares, or ground-dwelling arthropods in general.

540: Create skylark plots
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:

Eurasian skylarks Alauda arvensis require short vegetation to nest in. Skylark plots are small (usually 4-16 m2) undrilled patches within cereal fields which provide this short vegetation, with little impact on overall productivity. They are similar to lapwing plots (see ‘Leave uncropped, cultivated margins or plots (includes ‘lapwing plots’)) but much smaller.


Key Messages:

All four studies from the UK and Switzerland (two replicated and controlled, and one review) investigating the effect of skylark plots on Eurasian skylarks, found a positive effect, reporting increases in skylark population size, breeding density, duration or success or a lower likelihood of skylarks abandoning their territory relative to fields without plots. A replicated study from Denmark found that skylarks used undrilled patches within cereal fields more than expected by an even distribution across the landscape.
Four studies reported the effect of undrilled patches on wildlife other than skylarks. Three studies from the UK (including two replicated studies, of which one also controlled and a review) found benefits to plants and invertebrates. Whilst two studies (both replicated, one also controlled) from the UK found no significant differences in the number of some invertebrates or seed-eating songbirds between skylark plots and conventional crop fields. 
One replicated study from the UK investigated different skylark plot establishment techniques. Plots that were undrilled had greater vegetation cover and height than plots established by spraying out with herbicide.

Background information and definitions:

Farmland heterogeneity is thought to be key in determining on-farm biodiversity (Benton et al. 2003). Therefore, increasing the range of different crops grown in a given year may increase the biological value of a farm.

Key Messages:

All four studies (including one replicated, controlled study and one review) from Belgium, Germany, Hungary and unspecified European countries reported a positive effect of crop rotations on ground beetles or plants. Three studies found higher ground beetle species richness and/or abundance and one study found higher plant species richness in rotation fields or on farms with more crops in rotation compared to monoculture fields. 
A study from Hungary found that fields in monoculture had a more stable and abundant ground beetle community than fields within a rotation.

561: Convert or revert arable land to permanent grassland
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:

This intervention involves changing from an arable crop to a sown agricultural grassland, to be used for grazing or silage. It is not the same as the creation of species-rich or other semi-natural grasslands.
See also ‘Provide (or retain) set-aside areas’ for some studies where non-rotational set-aside land was sown with grass, but managed as set-aside rather than as permanent agricultural grassland.


Key Messages:

All seven individual studies (including four replicated studies, of which two also controlled and a review) looking at the effects of reverting arable land to grassland found no clear benefit to wildlife. The studies monitored UK birds in winter and summer, wading birds in Denmark, grey partridges, brown hares in the UK, and plants in the Czech Republic. 
One of the studies, a controlled before-and-after study from the UK, showed that grey partridge numbers fell significantly following the reversion of arable fields to grassland.

562: Leave cultivated, uncropped margins or plots (includes 'lapwing plots')
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This intervention can be introduced for ground-nesting birds (sometimes called ‘lapwing plots’), rare arable plants, or both. It may also provide habitat for insects and foraging sites for mammals and seed- and insect-eating birds (Campaign for the Farmed Environment 2011).
Plots or strips are cultivated, but left undrilled. For ground-nesting birds, the plots are usually at least 2 ha in size. They are different from 'skylark plots', which are much smaller and usually created in groups. If this measure is taken in field margins (6 m strips at the edge of arable fields), no fertilizer is applied, and herbicide applications are minimal, with only spot treatment of particular weeds permitted.
See also ‘Provide (or retain) set-aside areas’, for rotational or long-term fallow land at the field scale not cultivated or implemented specifically for ground-nesting birds.
See also ‘Sow rare or declining arable weeds’ for a study of different management options that could also apply to uncropped, cultivated margins.
Campaign for the Farmed Environment (2011) Guide to voluntary measures 2011 edition. Campaign for the Farmed Environment, Warwickshire.

Key Messages:

Nineteen individual studies looked at the effect of uncropped, cultivated margins or plots on wildlife. Seventeen studies from the UK and northwest Europe (six reviews and seven replicated studies of which two were site comparisons, one a before-and-after trial and one was controlled and randomized) found that leaving uncropped, cultivated margins or plots on farmland provides benefits to some or all target farmland bird species, plants, invertebrates, and mammals. These wildlife benefits included increased species richness of plants, bumblebees, species richness and abundance of spiders, abundance of ground-dwelling invertebrates and ground beetles, increased stone curlew breeding population size, northern lapwing hatching success, Eurasian skylark nesting success and the establishment, abundance or species richness of rare arable plant species. A replicated study found northern lapwing, Eurasian skylark, grey partridge and yellow wagtail bred in lapwing plots.
Two studies (a replicated study and a review) from the UK found that leaving uncropped, cultivated margins or plots on farmland had no effect on 11 out of 12 farmland bird species or ground beetles. A replicated site comparison study in the UK found fewer seed-eating birds on fallow plots for ground-nesting birds in two out of three regions. One review from the UK found evidence that pernicious weeds were more commonly found on uncropped cultivated margins than conservation or conventional headlands. A replicated site comparison from the UK found the proportion of young grey partridges in the population was lower in areas with a high proportion of uncropped cultivated margins and plots.

563: Create open patches or strips in permanent grassland
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:

Open patches and strips in permanent grassland can be used, in a similar way to skylark plots (see ‘Create skylark plots’) to provide short, open swards for ground-nesting birds.

 

Key Messages:

Two studies (both randomized, replicated and controlled) investigated the effects of creating open strips in permanent grassland. One trial from the UK found that more Eurasian skylarks used fields containing open strips, but variations in skylark numbers were too great to draw conclusions from this finding. One trial from Scotland found insect numbers in grassy headlands initially dropped when strips were cleared.

564: Plant cereals in wide-spaced rows
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:

Planting cereals in widely-spaced rows can increase the proportion of farmland habitat for wildlife, including birds, arthropods and plants. Spaces between rows can be left fallow or planted with grass or legumes.

 

Key Messages:

One replicated, controlled randomized study and four reports from the same replicated, controlled study in the UK investigated the effects of planting cereals in wide-spaced rows on birds, invertebrates and plants. Both studies found no or inconsistent differences in plant and invertebrate abundance and/or species richness between wide-spaced row and control fields. The replicated controlled study found higher undesirable weed cover, and one study found no significant difference in weed cover in fields with wide-spaced rows compared to control fields.
One study found significantly lower invertebrate abundances and fewer Eurasian skylark nests in wide-spaced row fields than control fields or fields with undrilled patches. However it also found an increase in the body condition of nestlings over the breeding season in wide-spaced row fields compared with control fields.

Background information and definitions:

Certain agricultural pesticides and chemicals may have detrimental effects on farmland wildlife. This intervention involves restricting the use of certain chemicals either by using less harmful alternatives or limiting the extent of their use.
See also: ‘Reduce fertilizer, pesticide and herbicide use generally’.

 

Key Messages:

A small scale study in the UK found that      using the fungicides Propiconazole and Triadimefon reduced chick food      insect abundance less than using Pyrazophos. A replicated, controlled      trial in Switzerland found that applying metaldehyde slug pellets in a 50 cm band      along the field edge adjacent to wildflower strips provided equivalent      crop protection to broadcasting the pellets across the whole field.

579: Connect areas of natural or semi-natural habitat
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves the creation of habitat corridors between currently isolated natural/semi-natural habitats or the restoration of natural/semi-natural habitats between existing patches.
Habitat fragmentation, as well as destruction, may be an important driver of population declines. Small areas hold fewer species than large ones and if individuals are unable to cross areas of converted habitat then populations in separate habitat patches will become isolated. This potentially makes them more vulnerable to extinction, from natural variations in birth and death rates or sex ratios, from inbreeding depression and from outside pressures; both natural (such as storms or wildfires) and man-made (such as hunting or continued habitat loss). However the precise effects of habitat fragmentation, as opposed to loss, are debated (e.g. Fahrig 1997).
Theoretically, the number of species surviving in a habitat fragment is determined by its size and its effective distance to other habitat patches (MacArthur & Wilson 1967). Connecting remaining areas of natural or semi-natural habitat is therefore often seen as a way to increase the viability of populations, but there is considerable debate as to the effectiveness of such ‘wildlife corridors’ (e.g. Beier & Noss 1998).

Beier P. & Noss R.F. (1998) Do habitat corridors provide connectivity? Conservation Biology, 12, 1241–1252.

Key Messages:

All four studies (including one site      comparison and two replicated trials) from the Czech Republic, Germany and the Netherlands investigating the effects of habitat      corridors or restoring areas of natural or semi-natural habitat between      existing patches found some degree of colonization of these areas by invertebrates      or mammals. However for invertebrates one unreplicated site comparison      reported that the colonization process was slow (Gruttke 1994), and three studies found that the extent of      colonization varied between invertebrate taxa. 
One small, replicated study from the Czech Republic investigated      colonization of two bio-corridors by small mammal species. It found more small      mammal species in the bio-corridors than in an adjacent forest or arable      fields.
All three studies from Germany and the Netherlands looking at the effects on      invertebrates found mixed results. One replicated study found more species      of some wasps (cavity-nesting wasps and caterpillar-hunting wasps) in      grass strips connected to forest edges than in isolated strips. An unreplicated study found that the abundance of      three ground beetle species substantially increased in an arable field      undergoing restoration to heathland but that typical heathland species      failed to colonize over the 12 year period.      One study found that two out of 85 ground beetle species used a meadow      and hedge-island strip extending from semi-natural habitats into arable      farmland. In the      same study the habitat strip did not function well for ground      beetles and harvestmen but was colonized by snails and spiders.

594: Plant wild bird seed or cover mixture
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:

The loss of food supplies, especially seeds, is thought to be a key driver of farmland bird declines. Plants that provide seed food and cover for wild birds include maize, sunflower and cereals. Wild bird cover crops are often planted in blocks or 6 m-wide strips and left unharvested. These are sometimes called ‘game crops’ or ‘game cover crops’. They may also provide benefits for other farmland wildlife.

 

Key Messages:

Thirty individual studies investigated the effects on birds of sowing wild bird seed or cover mixture, 21 studies found positive effects. Fourteen studies from the UK (including one systematic review and nine replicated controlled trials of which four randomized, and three reviews) found that fields sown with wild bird cover mix had higher abundance, density, species diversity and species richness of birds than other farmland habitats. Six studies from the UK (including one review and two replicated studies) found that birds showed a preference for wild bird cover and used it significantly more than other habitats. One review found the grey partridge population increased substantially on farms where conservation measures including cover crops were in place. Nine replicated studies from France and the UK reported mixed or negative effects of wild bird cover on birds compared to other farmland habitats. Six studies found that mixtures including kale or a mixture of kale and/or other species attracted the largest number of bird species or highest bird abundance. 
Twelve studies from the UK looked at the effects of wild bird cover strips on invertebrates. Seven studies from the UK (including one review and four replicated controlled studies of which two were also randomized) found positive effects. Farmland habitats sown with wild bird cover mix were used more by butterflies, and had a higher abundance or species richness of butterflies and/or bees than other farmland habitats. One review found wild bird cover benefited invertebrates. Four studies (including one review and two replicated trials) reported mixed or negative effects of wild bird cover on invertebrate numbers compared with other farmland habitats. One study found that bees and butterflies showed preferences for particular plant species. 
Eight studies from the UK looked at plants and wild bird cover. Six studies (including two reviews and two replicated controlled trials) found that planting wild bird cover mix was one of the three best options for conservation of annual herbaceous plant communities, benefited plants and resulted in increased plant diversity and species richness. However two replicated studies (of which one a site comparison) found mixed/negative effects for plant species richness.
One replicated trial from the UK found that small mammal activity was higher in wild bird cover than in the crop in winter but not in summer.

63: Create uncultivated margins around intensive arable or pasture fields
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:

This intervention allows the field margin vegetation to regenerate naturally, without planting, although it can involve subsequent mowing. The field margins are not fertilized and only spot-treated with herbicides if injurious weeds occur.

 

Key Messages:

Thirty-nine studies (including 13 replicated controlled trials of which three also randomized and four reviews) from eight European countries compared wildlife on uncultivated margins with other margin options. Twenty-four found benefits to some wildlife groups (including 11 replicated controlled trials of which one also randomised, and four reviews). Nineteen studies (including one randomized, replicated, controlled trial) from Germany, Ireland, Lithuania, Norway, the Netherlands and the UK found uncultivated margins support more invertebrates (including bees) and/or higher plant diversity or species richness than conventionally managed field margins or other field margin options. One replicated, controlled study showed that uncultivated margins supported more small mammal species than meadows and farmed grasslands. Four studies (two replicated UK studies, two reviews) reported positive associations between birds and field margins including food provision. A review from the UK found grass margins (including naturally regenerated margins) benefited plants and some invertebrates.


Fifteen studies (including one randomized, replicated, controlled trial) from Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and the UK found that invertebrate and/or plant species richness or abundance were lower in naturally regenerated than conventionally managed fields or sown margins. Six studies (including one randomized, replicated, controlled trial) from Belgium, Germany and the UK found uncultivated margins did not have more plant or invertebrate species or individuals than cropped or sown margins. A review found grass margins (including naturally regenerated margins) did not benefit ground beetles.


Five studies (including three replicated controlled trials) from Ireland and the UK reported declines in plant species richness and invertebrate numbers in naturally regenerated margins over time. One replicated trial found that older naturally regenerated margins (6-years old) had more invertebrate predators (mainly spiders) than newly established (1-year old) naturally regenerated margins.


Five studies (including one replicated, randomized trial) from the Netherlands and the UK found that cutting margins had a negative impact on invertebrates or no impact on plant species. One replicated controlled study found cut margins were used more frequently by yellowhammers when surrounding vegetation was &gt;60 cm tall.


Seven studies (including four replicated controlled trials and a review) from Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway and the UK reported increased abundance or biomass of weed species in naturally regenerated margins.

641: Provide 'sacrificial' grasslands to reduce the impact of wild geese on crops
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:

There have been dramatic increases in many species of goose in recent decades (Madsen et al. 1999) and this has led to increasing conflict with farmers, as many species graze on arable land, potentially ruining crops. One potential solution, to reduce conflict whilst maintaining the populations of geese is to provide ‘sacrificial grasslands’ – areas set aside for geese to feed on, which keeps them away from agricultural fields.
To be useful, such areas need to be more attractive than neighbouring fields. Management to attract geese to these areas can include re-seeding grasslands with grass species or legumes such as clover Trifolium spp., or fertilizing grasslands to increase productivity so that these areas can support more birds.
Madsen J., Cracknell G. & Fox A.D. (1999) Goose Populations of the Western Palearctic. A Review of Status and Distribution. Wetlands International Publication No. 48. Wetlands International, Wageningen, The Netherlands.

 

Key Messages:

All six studies from the UK (including four replicated, controlled trials) found that managing grasslands for geese increased the number grazing there. Two replicated, controlled studies found that fertilized and cut areas were grazed by more white-fronted geese or brent geese than control areas. A replicated, controlled trial found that re-seeded and fertilized wet pasture fields were used by more barnacle geese than control fields, and that fertilized areas were used less than re-seeded ones. A replicated, controlled study found that spring fertilizer application increased the use of grassland fields by pink-footed geese. A replicated study found that plots sown with white clover were preferred by dark-bellied brent geese compared to plots sown with grasses.
However, four of the studies found that the birds were moving within a relatively small area (i.e. within the study site) and therefore the grasslands may not reduce conflict with farmers.

See also ‘Undersow spring cereals, with clover for example’.

 

Key Messages:

A controlled study in Finland found that creating clover leys resulted in higher spider abundance and fewer pest insects than a barley control plot. A study in the UK found that one-year ley plots had significantly lower earthworm species richness and abundance than three-and-a-half-year leys. 
A replicated study in the UK found that grass leys had fewer plant species than nine other conservation measures.

Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:

Wood pastures are open, low-intensity livestock-grazed woodlands with grassland, often of high conservation value. Due to abandonment or agricultural reversion, they have declined greatly in Europe. Initial tree regeneration is an essential component of restoration but may be hampered by grazing.

 

Key Messages:

One replicated controlled trial in Belgium found that protection from grazing enhanced the survival and growth of tree seedlings planted in pasture.
One replicated study in Switzerland found that cattle browsing increased the mortality of tree saplings of four species, and reduced average shoot production and total above-ground biomass. Browsing frequency decreased with increasing height of the surrounding vegetation.

645: Use scaring devices (eg. gas guns) and other deterrents to reduce persecution of native species
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:

Native wildlife can have a significant impact on agricultural crops or features of the farmed landscape through grazing, browsing and uprooting. This intervention involves using scaring devices to discourage native wildlife from areas susceptible to damage.

 

Key Messages:

One replicated, controlled trial in Germany found phosphorescent tape was more effective than normal yellow tape at deterring deer from an area, but had no effect on wild boar or European hare.

646: Leave unharvested cereal headlands in arable fields
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:

Unharvested cereal headlands are strips of cereal crop around the edge of arable fields that are left unharvested throughout the winter. In addition, they are often treated less intensively with few fertilizers and no broadleaved herbicides.

 

Key Messages:

We have captured no evidence for the effects on farmland wildlife of leaving unharvested cereal headlands.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.

647: Maintain upland heath/moorland
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves using management techniques to maintain the conservation value of upland heath or moorland, including unenclosed rough grazing. These semi-natural habitats are predominantly found within unenclosed, extensive landscapes, their ‘open’ nature typically maintained by practices such as grazing, cutting and burning. Treatments tested include removing or reducing grazing, controlling the dominance of grass species by cutting or grazing by goats, and carrying out grouse moor management (rotational burning combined with predator control).
See also ‘Manage heather by swiping to simulate burning’ and ‘Manage heather, gorse or grass by burning’ for studies that investigated specific techniques for managing heather.

Key Messages:

Of 15 individual studies from the UK, eight (including three replicated, controlled trials, of which one also randomized) found that appropriate management can help to maintain the conservation value of upland heath or moorland.
Of these eight studies, four tested the effectiveness of excluding or reducing grazing. Impacts included increases in the abundance of Scottish primrose and other broadleaved plant species, heather cover and numbers of true bugs, biomass of arthropods associated with the bird diet, number and diversity of moths and benefits to black grouse. Among other treatments, repeated cutting and grazing by goats were found to be effective in controlling the dominance of certain grass species. A review found management under the Environmentally Sensitive Areas scheme had broadly positive effects on moorland birds and a reduction in grazing benefited most bird species and increased heath vegetation and heather cover. A replicated before-and-after study found that moorland management under the Environmentally Sensitive Area scheme maintained the number of plant species in two out of three areas.
Three studies (including one before-and-after trial) reported mixed results for invertebrates or birds, where management to maintain upland heath or moorland benefited some but not all species or where the effect depended on the vegetation type. Treatments tested included reducing grazing intensity and grouse moor management (burning and predator control).
Four studies (including one controlled site comparison and two reviews) found that reducing the intensity of livestock grazing reduced the abundance of soil organisms including invertebrates, bacteria or fungi. A randomized, replicated before-and-after study found that heather cover declined over nine years on a moorland site managed under the Environmentally Sensitive Areas scheme in which grazing intensity had increased.

648: Provide supplementary food for birds or mammals
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This intervention may involve the provision of supplementary food for birds or mammals in farmland habitats, such food typically includes seeds. Providing supplementary food for farmland wildlife may be particularly important when food resources in the wider farmed environment are scarce.
Food supply is one of the key factors determining mortality and reproductive rates. Providing supplementary food is therefore often used as a technique to support small populations. However, feeding is only likely to have a positive effect on a population if the food supply is limiting either reproduction or survival.
As with all interventions in this synopsis, studies that investigate population‐level effects are most useful for conservationists. This is especially true for supplementary feeding, as many birds have large foraging ranges and the appearance of increased numbers at a feeding station, or even in the habitat surrounding feeders may not represent an increase in numbers but a redistribution of the same birds, and could even hide a population decline. It is also important to note that the effect of providing food can be confounded by many factors. For example, variations in natural food supplies due to population cycles or irregular fruiting, whilst droughts or other extreme weather and pollution levels can also affect how populations respond to food.
See also ‘Provide other resources for birds (water, sand for bathing)’ for studies which investigate the impact of providing resources other than food.

Key Messages:

A total of 18 individual studies      investigated the effects of providing supplementary food. Nine studies      from France, Sweden and the UK (six      replicated studies, of which five controlled and one also randomized and      paired) found that the provision of supplementary      food increased farmland bird abundance, breeding population size, density,      body mass,      hatching, nestling growth and fledging rates, increased overwinter      survival of a declining house sparrow population and that fed male hen harriers bred with more females than control birds.      Two studies did not separate the      effects of several other interventions carried out on the same study site.      Four studies from the UK and Finland (three replicated studies,      of which one controlled and one randomized) found that farmland songbirds and field      voles (field voles on unmown plots only) used supplementary food when provided,      including the majority of targeted species such as tree sparrow,      yellowhammer and corn bunting.
Five replicated studies from the UK (of which two also controlled) found that the provision of supplementary food had no clear effect on farmland bird breeding abundance, European turtle dove reproductive success, territory size or territory density, overwinter survival of three stable house sparrow populations, tree sparrow nest box use, or the abundance of weed seeds on the soil surface. One replicated, controlled study from Sweden found no effect of supplementary food provision on common starling clutch size or nestling weight, and lower fledging rates in nests which received supplementary food compared to nests without supplementary food in one year.
Four studies from the UK (two replicated of which one was also randomized and controlled) found that the use of supplementary food by farmland birds varied between species and region, depended upon the time of year and proximity to other feeding stations and natural feeding areas.

650: Restore or create upland heath/moorland
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:

Upland heath/moorland typically consists of dwarf shrubs such as heather Calluna vulgaris (Natural England 2011). These areas are important for wildlife including rare birds such as black grouse Tetrao tetrix, as well as invertebrates (Natural England 2011). Moorland can become dominated by scrub or grasses such as purple moor grass Molinia caerulea (Natural England 2011). This intervention involves restoring or creating areas of upland heath/moorland which may benefit birds and other wildlife.
See also ‘Manage heather by swiping to simulate burning’ and ‘Manage heather, gorse or grass by burning’ for studies that investigated specific techniques for managing heather.
Natural England (2011) Upland heath. Available at http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/conservation/biodiversity/englands/habitatofthemonth/uplandheath.aspx Accessed 23 October 2012.


Key Messages:

A small unreplicated trial of heather moorland restoration in northern England found that mowing and flail cutting along with grazing could be used to control the dominance of purple moor grass. The same study found moorland restoration benefited one bird species, with one or two pairs of northern lapwing found to breed in the area of restored moorland, where none had bred prior to restoration.
A review from the UK concluded that vegetation changes took place very slowly following the removal of grazing to restore upland grassland to heather moorland.

651: Create beetle banks
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:

Beetle banks are grassy mounds, about 2 m-wide, that run across the middle of large arable fields. They may be created using two-directional ploughing and sown with a mix of grass species (HGCA 2008). They are intended to provide habitat, especially during winter, for predatory insects such as beetles and spiders. They may also provide foraging habitats for birds and habitat for small mammals.
HGCA (2008) Beneficials on farmland: identification and management guidelines. ADHB-HGCA, London.

 

Key Messages:

Fourteen reports from eight studies out of a total 24 reports from 12 individual studies (including eight replicated studies of which three controlled and four literature reviews) from Denmark and the UK found that beetle banks provide some benefits to farmland biodiversity.
Sixteen reports from eight individual studies looked at invertebrates and beetle banks. Five reports from two replicated studies (of which one controlled) and a review found positive effects on invertebrate densities/numbers, distribution, or higher ground beetle density and species diversity in spring and summer but not winter. Six reports from three replicated studies (of which one randomized and controlled) found that invertebrate numbers varied between specific grass species sown on beetle banks. Two replicated studies (one paired and controlled) found that the effect of beetle banks varied between invertebrate groups or families. Five replicated studies (of which two controlled) found lower or no difference in invertebrate densities or numbers on beetle banks relative to other habitats. One review found lesser marsh grasshopper did not forage on two plant species commonly sown in beetle banks.
Six studies looked at birds and beetle banks. Two reviews and one replicated controlled trial found positive effects on bird numbers (in combination with other farmland conservation measures) or evidence that birds used beetle banks. Two studies (one replicated site comparison) found mixed effects on birds. One replicated study found no farmland bird species were associated with beetle banks.
One replicated, paired, controlled study and a review looked at the effects of beetle banks on plants and found either lower plant species richness on beetle banks in summer, or that grass margins including beetle banks were generally beneficial to plants but these effects were not pronounced on beetle banks.
One controlled study and a review found beetle banks acted as nest sites for harvest mice.

652: Leave headlands in fields unsprayed (conservation headlands)
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:

Conservation headland management involves restricted fertilizer, herbicide and insecticide spraying in a 6 m margin of sown arable crop. The prescription allows selected herbicide applications to control injurious weeds or invasive alien species.

 

Key Messages:

Twenty-two studies from 14 replicated, controlled experiments (of which two randomized) including two reviews, from a total of 32 studies from 20 experiments (of which 17 replicated, controlled) including three reviews from Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and the UK that investigated species richness and diversity of farmland wildlife found that conservation headlands contained higher species richness or diversity of invertebrates or plants than other habitat types. Twelve studies (including a review) from ten replicated experiments (of which eight controlled and three controlled and randomized) found that some or all invertebrates or plants investigated did not have higher species richness or diversity on conservation headlands compared to other habitat types. This included both replicated, controlled studies investigating bee diversity. Two replicated studies from the UK found that unfertilized conservation headlands had more plant species than fertilized conservation headlands.
Positive effects of conservation headlands on abundances or behaviours of some or all species investigated were found by 27 studies from 15 replicated experiments (of which 13 controlled) including five reviews out of a total of 36 studies from 20 experiments (17 replicated, controlled) including five reviews from Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and the UK that investigated birds (some studies looked at number of visits), mammals (some studies looked at number of visits), invertebrates and plant abundance/cover. One review from the UK found a positive effect on grey partridge populations but did not separate the effects of several other interventions including conservation headlands. Nineteen studies from 13 replicated (12 controlled) experiments and a review from Finland, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK found that some or all species of birds, invertebrates or plants investigated were at similar, or lower, abundances on conservation headlands compared to other management. One review from the UK and a study in Germany found conservation headlands had a positive effect on plants and some, but not all invertebrates, or rare arable weeds but did not specify how. 
All eight studies from the UK and Sweden that investigated species’ productivity, from three replicated (two controlled) experiments including two reviews found that grey partridge productivity or survival was higher in conservation headlands (or in sites with conservation headlands), compared to other management. One replicated study from the UK found that conservation headlands did not increase the proportion of young grey partridges in the population. A before-and-after study from the UK found that some invertebrates in conservation headlands survived pesticide applications to neighbouring fields. A review found crop margins reduce the effects of spray drift on butterflies. 
A replicated study from Germany and a review found that conservation headlands appeared to prevent or reduce the establishment and spread of pernicious weeds.

694: Reduce chemical inputs in grassland management
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:

This intervention may involve reducing the amount of chemical inputs applied to permanent grasslands or ceasing inputs altogether. Chemical inputs to permanent grasslands may include fertilizers such as nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), or potassium (K).
Reducing chemical inputs on permanent grasslands is often used in conjunction with other actions such as delaying the first mowing or grazing date on grasslands, see also ‘Reduce management intensity on permanent grasslands’.


Key Messages:

A total of 16 studies (including five reviews) investigated the effects of reducing inputs in permanent grasslands. Six studies from the Netherlands, Switzerland and the UK (including one review and four replicated studies of which one was also controlled and one a randomized and controlled before-and-after trial) found that stopping fertilizer inputs in permanent grassland resulted in an increase in plant species richness, reduced the rate of plant species loss and attracted a higher abundance or species richness of some or all invertebrates studied. One review from the Netherlands found that low fertilizer input grasslands favour common meadow bird species. One review found a study showing that densities of some invertebrates were higher in unfertilized plots compared with those receiving nitrogen inputs.
Two replicated, controlled trials from the Czech Republic and the UK (one randomized) found that applying fertilizer to permanent grasslands reduced plant species richness or diversity and that the effects on plant communities were still apparent 16 years after the cessation of fertilizer application.
Four studies from Ireland, the Netherlands and the UK (including two replicated trials of which one randomized and one controlled and a review) found that reducing fertilizer inputs on grassland had no clear or rapid effect on plant species richness. A review found no clear effect of reducing fertilizer inputs on the density of soil-dwelling invertebrates. One replicated study found that fertilizer treatment only affected seed production of a small number of meadow plants. One replicated study from the UK found lower invertebrate abundance on plots with reduced fertilizer inputs but the differences were not significant.

695: Leave overwinter stubbles
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves leaving crop stubbles in fields until at least February-March. These stubbles may provide an important food source for seed-eating birds over the winter (Campaign for the Farmed Environment 2011).
The availability and extent of overwinter stubbles may have an important influence on bird populations. One study from the UK (Gillings et al. 2005) showed that national population trends of 16 out of 26 bird species were positively influenced by the presence of overwinter stubbles. The same study also predicted that yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella and Eurasian skylark Alauda arvensis population declines would be lessened in areas with a high proportion of stubbles and that 10-year population stability/growth could be achieved by increasing the coverage of stubbles within 1 km squares to 15 ha or 20 ha respectively. Additionally, a 2008 literature review and analysis of the Environmental Stewardship scheme, particularly Entry Level Stewardship in the UK (Vickery et al. 2008), suggested that, for Eurasian skylark, approximately 0.1 km2 of stubble/km2 would be needed to prevent population declines. The authors also suggest that having these patches over 1 km apart would maximize winter use.

Key Messages:

Eighteen studies (including four reviews and one systematic review) investigated the effects of overwinter stubbles on farmland wildlife. Thirteen studies from Finland, Switzerland and the UK (six replicated trials, including two site comparisons, four reviews and a systematic review) found evidence that leaving overwinter stubbles provides some benefits to plants, insects, spiders, mammals and farmland birds. These benefits include higher densities of farmland birds in winter, increased grey partridge productivity, and increased cirl bunting population size (in combination with several other conservation measures) and territory density. 
One replicated site comparison study from the UK found evidence that leaving overwinter stubbles had inconsistent or no effects on farmland bird numbers. Three studies found only certain bird species showed positive associations with overwinter stubbles. Two replicated studies (of which one also randomized and controlled) found that only Eurasian skylark or both Eurasian skylark and Eurasian linnet benefited, out of a total 23 and 12 farmland bird species tested respectively. One study found that only grey partridge and tree sparrow showed positive population responses to areas with overwinter stubbles.
Two studies from the UK (one randomized, one replicated and controlled) found that different farmland bird species benefited from different stubble heights. One replicated site comparison found mixed effects between different stubble management options on seed-eating bird abundance.

696: Maintain traditional water meadows (includes management for breeding and/or wintering waders/waterfowl)
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This intervention may involve using management such as mowing or grazing to maintain plant communities and wildlife typically associated with traditional water meadows. Water meadows are areas of grazing land or hay meadow that have carefully controlled water levels to keep the soil damp. In Europe they provide valuable breeding habitats for wading birds and other biodiversity.
In the Netherlands, the ‘meadow bird agreements’ agri-environment scheme is designed to protect birds associated with wet meadows (Kleijn & van Zuijlen 2004). Fields managed under ‘meadow bird agreements’ must not have any agricultural activities from 1 April to June-July, pesticide use is prohibited as is cultivation and re-seeding, the areas must be mown or grazed at least once a year and water levels must be maintained (Kleijn & van Zuijlen 2004).
See also ‘Restore or create traditional water meadows’ for studies that look at the effects of creating or restoring water meadows.

Key Messages:

Four studies from Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK (including two site comparisons of which one also replicated) found that maintaining traditional water meadows resulted in an increased population size or number of territories of northern lapwing, common redshank and black-tailed godwit and increased plant species richness. However one of these studies also found common snipe declined on all sites under management to maintain traditional water meadows, and another of the studies found that differences in numbers of birds were present before meadow bird management.
Two studies (a replicated study and a review of European studies) found that managing traditional water meadows by grazing had mixed impacts on wildlife and that the productivity of northern lapwings was too low to sustain populations on three of the four water meadows managed for waders. A randomized, replicated, controlled trial in the Netherlands found that cutting in June maintained relatively stable vegetation and a review found mowing could be used to maintain water meadows but had variable effects on plant species richness.
One replicated site comparison from the Netherlands found more birds bred on 12.5 ha plots with management for wading birds (in combination with per-clutch payments), however at the field scale there was no difference in bird abundance or species richness between conventionally managed fields and those managed for birds.

697: Employ areas of semi-natural habitat for rough grazing (includes salt marsh, lowland heath, bog, fen)
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:

This intervention involves grazing semi-natural habitats that are not an integral part of modern farming practice, either enclosed or unenclosed. It includes the use of areas of peat bog, or other undrained wetland, lowland heath, saltmarsh and sand dunes. It does not include management of upland heath and moorland, species-rich grasslands or wood pasture. These are covered under habitat-specific interventions.

 

Key Messages:

A series of site comparison studies from the UK found that areas of heathland that had been re-seeded with grass to improve livestock grazing were avoided by nesting whimbrels but were the main early spring feeding areas for them. There was no difference in whimbrel chick survival between areas of heathland re-seeded with grass and those that had not.
Two replicated studies from the UK found higher butterfly abundance and species richness and a higher frequency of occurrence of songbirds and invertebrate-feeding birds on areas of grazed semi-natural upland grassland than grazed improved pasture. However members of the crow family showed the opposite trend. A review found excluding cattle from fenland reduced the number of plant species, and that low-medium grazing levels could have positive effects on fenland biodiversity but may need to be accompanied by additional management such as mowing.
One study from the UK found northern lapwing nest survival and clutch size were greater on ungrazed than grazed marshes. A replicated site comparison from the UK found the proportion of young grey partridges was negatively associated with rough grazing (in combination with several other interventions).

698: Use mowing techniques to reduce mortality
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:

Mowing and harvesting operations may have a negative impact on farmland wildlife. This intervention involves using different mowing machinery or mowing patterns to reduce the impact of mowing on field-dwelling animals. Adjusting mowing techniques may benefit ground-nesting birds that frequently remain in long grass or crops for as long as possible; mowing from the centre of the field outwards, rather than from the field edge inwards, may allow birds to escape the mowing machinery before the last patch of long grass is harvested.
See also ‘Raise mowing height on grasslands’ for studies that examined the effects of raising the mowing height on grasslands, and ‘Provide refuges during harvest or mowing’ for studies investigating the effects of uncut refuges in mown grasslands.


Key Messages:

Eight studies investigated the effects of different mowing techniques on wildlife. Seven studies (including four replicated trials of which one randomized, and one controlled and three reviews) from Germany, Ireland, Switzerland and the UK found that using specific mowing techniques can reduce mortality or injury in birds, mammals, amphibians or invertebrates. A review found the UK corncrake population increased around the same period that Corncrake Friendly Mowing schemes were introduced.
One replicated trial found that changing the mowing pattern reduced the number of corncrake chicks killed. Sixty-eight percent of chicks escaped mowing when fields were mown from the centre outwards, compared to 45% during conventional mowing from the field edge inwards.
Six studies looked at the effects of using different mowing machinery. Two studies (one review, one randomized, replicated trial) found bar mowers and one report found double chop mowers caused less damage or lower mortality among amphibians and/or invertebrates than other types of mowing machinery. A review found evidence that twice as many small mammals were killed by rotary disc mowers with conditioners compared to double blade mowers. Two studies found that using a mechanical processor or conditioner killed or injured more invertebrates than without a conditioner, however one replicated controlled study found mower-conditioners resulted in higher Eurasian skylark nest survival than using a tedder. A review of studies found that skylark chick survival was four times higher when wider mowing machinery was used, whilst a replicated controlled trial found skylark nest survival was highest when swather mowers and forage harvesters were used.

699: Control predatory mammals and birds (foxes, crows, stoats and weasels)
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves controlling predatory mammals and birds, which may provide benefits to birds nesting on farmland. Predators commonly controlled include carrion crow Corvus corone and red fox Vulpes vulpes.
See also ‘Control mink’ for studies looking at the results of controlling non-native American mink Mustela vison.

Key Messages:

A total of nine individual studies from France and the UK (including five replicated controlled studies and a systematic review) looked at the effects of removing predators on birds. Three studies found controlling predatory mammals or birds (sometimes alongside other interventions) increased the abundance or population size of some birds. One of these studies from the UK found numbers of nationally declining songbirds increased on a site where predators were controlled, but there was no overall difference in bird abundance, species richness or diversity between predator control and no-control sites.
Five studies (two replicated and controlled, two before-and-after trials) from the UK found some evidence for increased productivity, nest or reproductive success or survival of birds following bird or mammal predator control (sometimes alongside other interventions). A randomized, replicated, controlled study found hen harrier breeding success was no different between areas with and without hooded crow removal.
A global systematic review including evidence from European farmland found that reproductive success of birds increased with predator removal.

69: Reduce management intensity on permanent grasslands (several interventions at once)
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Reducing the intensity of grassland management involves reducing or stopping the use of fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides and delaying the mowing date until later in the summer. Studies included here have monitored the effects of carrying out two or more of these management interventions at the same time. All the studies included here monitor the effects of a change of grassland management, or of implementing a regime of reduced management intensity for the purpose of nature conservation, such as an agri-environment scheme.
Studies that only carry out one of these management interventions, rather than several combined, would be included under the relevant separate intervention. See: ‘Reduce inputs in permanent grassland management’, ‘Raise mowing height on grasslands’ and ‘Delay mowing or first grazing date on grasslands’.
See also ‘Pay farmers to cover the cost of conservation measures (as in agri-environment schemes)’ for a study that records the decline in species richness on upland hay meadows over time, following introduction of two main agri-environment schemes in the Yorkshire Dales, UK (Pacha and Petit 2008).
There is also a literature comparing sites without direct intervention, such as Di Giulio et al. (2001), in which wildlife on species-rich grasslands is compared with wildlife on intensive grasslands. Whilst such studies are relevant, they do not demonstrate the effects of direct intervention (reducing management intensity or imposing a reduced management intensity regime) and as such we do not include them.

Key Messages:

A total of 32 individual studies from the Czech Republic, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the UK looked at the effects on farmland wildlife of reducing management intensity on permanent grasslands. Twenty-two studies found benefits to some or all wildlife groups studied. Eleven studies (including four replicated site comparisons and three reviews) found reduced management intensity on permanent grassland benefited plants. Sixteen studies (including eight site comparisons of which four paired and three reviews) found benefits to some or all invertebrates. Five studies (including two replicated site comparisons, of which one paired, and a review) found positive effects on some or all birds.
Twenty-one studies from six European countries found no clear effects of reducing management intensity on some or all plants, invertebrates or birds. Seven studies (including two replicated paired site comparisons and a review) found no clear effect on plants. Ten studies (including four site comparisons and one paired site comparison) found mixed or no effects on some or all invertebrates. Two studies (one review, one site comparison) found invertebrate communities on less intensively managed grasslands were distinct from those on intensively managed grasslands. Four studies (including three site comparisons, of which one paired and two replicated) found no clear effects on bird numbers or species richness.
Five studies from four European countries found negative effects of reducing management intensity on plants, invertebrates or birds. Two studies (one review, one replicated trial) found some plant species were lost under extensive management. Two studies (one paired site comparison) found more invertebrates in grasslands with intensive management. One paired site comparison found fewer wading birds on grasslands with reduced management intensity than on conventionally managed grassland.

700: Pay farmers to cover the cost of conservation measures (as in agri-environment schemes)
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Agri-environment schemes are government or inter-governmental schemes designed to compensate farmers financially for changing agricultural practice to be more favourable to biodiversity and landscape. In Europe, agri-environment schemes are an integral part of the European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and Member States devise their own agri-environment prescriptions to suit their agricultural economies and environmental contexts.
Since agri-environment schemes represent many different specific interventions relevant to conservation, and where a study’s results can be clearly assigned to a specific intervention, they appear in the appropriate section. This section, meanwhile, includes evidence about the success of agri-environment policies overall.
Evidence relating to the Swiss Ecological Compensation Areas with biodiversity monitoring on a landscape scale is placed under ‘Increase the proportion of natural habitat in the landscape’.

Key Messages:

Twenty-six studies from four European countries (including one UK systematic review and three European reviews) looked at the effects of agri-environment schemes on birds. Twenty-four studies (including one systematic review, six site comparisons and nine reviews) found increases in population size, density or more favourable population trends of some or all birds studied on sites with agri-environment schemes compared to non-scheme sites (some of these differences were seasonal). Eleven studies (including one systematic review and four reviews) found negative or no effects. One UK study found higher numbers of some birds where higher tier management was in place, another UK study found no difference between Entry Level or Higher Level Stewardship Scheme fields. One study from the Netherlands found that not all agri-environment scheme agreements were sited in ideal locations for black-tailed godwit.
Eleven studies from five European countries (including three replicated paired site comparisons and two reviews) looked at the effects of agri-environment schemes on plants. Seven studies (including three replicated paired site comparisons and one European review) found agri-environment schemes maintained or had little or no effect on plants, plant diversity or species richness. Three studies found increases in plant species richness in areas with agri-environment schemes, two found decreases. A replicated site comparison study from Estonia found higher flower abundance on farms with agri-environment schemes in two out of four areas. A review found Environmentally Sensitive Areas in England had contributed to halting the loss of semi-natural grassland habitats but were less effective at enhancing or restoring grassland biodiversity.
Ten studies from three European countries (including two replicated paired site comparisons and a review) looked at the effects of agri-environment schemes on invertebrates. Six studies (including two replicated site comparisons) showed agri-environment schemes maintained or had little or no effect on some invertebrates in terms of diversity, abundance, species richness or bee colony growth. Five studies found increases in abundance or species richness of some invertebrates. A UK study found agri-environment scheme prescriptions had a local but not a landscape-scale effect on bee numbers.
Four studies (including two replicated site comparisons and a review) from the UK looked at the effects of agri-environment schemes on mammals. One study found positive effects, three studies found mixed effects in different regions or for different species.
Three of the studies above found higher numbers of wildlife on land before agri-environment schemes were introduced. However two studies collecting baseline data found no difference in the overall number of birds or earthworms and soil microorganisms between areas with and without agri-environment schemes.
A review found two out of three agri-environment schemes in Europe benefited wildlife.

702: Maintain species-rich, semi-natural grassland
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Species-rich, semi-natural grasslands have declined drastically in Europe over the last 100 years (e.g. Poschlod & Bonn 1998, Eriksson et al. 2002) and conservation efforts have been directed to maintaining existing areas of these habitats. This section summarizes the results of studies that tested the effectiveness of interventions in maintaining the conservation value of species-rich grasslands, including hay meadows, litter meadows and other semi-natural pastures. The management regimes tested by these studies involve combinations of interventions, typically involving altered mowing or grazing regimes and reduced inputs, while some studies also tested the effectiveness of mulching or burning.

See also ‘Delay mowing or first grazing date on grasslands’ and ‘Reduce chemical inputs in grassland management’ for studies which tested the effectiveness of individual (uncombined) interventions in maintaining the conservation value of species-rich grassland.

Eriksson O., Cousins S.A.O. & Bruun H.H. (2002) Land-use history and fragmentation of traditionally managed grasslands in Scandinavia. Journal of Vegetation Science, 13, 743-748


Key Messages:

Of 22 studies (including eleven replicated trials, three reviews and a systematic review) from the Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Russia, Slovenia, Switzerland and the UK, 13 identified management regimes that maintained species-rich grassland. Four of these studies were replicated, controlled trials (including two randomized).
Nine studies (including two randomized, replicated before-and-after trials) from Switzerland and the UK examined the effectiveness of existing or historical agri-environment schemes: seven testing the effectiveness of the Environmentally Sensitive Areas scheme in England and two testing the effectiveness of the Ecological Compensation Areas scheme in Switzerland. All except one reported mixed results, with the schemes broadly maintaining plant species richness, but being less effective, for example, in enhancing species richness, preserving the highest quality sites, or overcoming the effects of past intensive management. One study found six Environmentally Sensitive Areas were of ‘outstanding’ significance for their lowland grassland, containing &gt;40% of the English resource of a grassland type. A replicated site comparison study found that on average 86% of Swiss Ecological Compensation Area litter meadows were of ‘good ecological quality’ compared with only 20% of hay meadow Ecological Compensation Areas.
Twelve studies (including a systematic review, six replicated trials of which two also controlled and randomized, and three reviews) from the Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Slovenia, Switzerland and the UK tested the effects of management treatments on species richness or vegetation quality usually involving combinations of mowing, grazing or no fertilizer but some also tested the effectiveness of mulching or burning. All of these studies identified management treatments which benefited or maintained species richness or vegetation quality.


One site comparison from Finland and northwest Russia found that butterfly species richness, diversity and total abundance did not differ significantly between mown meadows and grazed pastures and that grassland age and origin had a greater impact on butterfly communities than present management.

703: Maintain traditional orchards
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:

Traditionally-managed orchards are low-intensity systems that have the potential to provide unique habitats for wildlife and that tend to hold older and rarer varieties of fruit. However, they are threatened in many countries, with 60% of traditional orchards in Britain having been lost and another 30% converted to intensive production since the 1950s.

 

Key Messages:

Two replicated site comparisons from Germany and Switzerland found that, on average, 12% of traditional orchards in Swiss Ecological Compensation Areas were of ‘good ecological quality’, and traditional orchards under a German agri-environment scheme did not have more plant species than paired control sites. Traditional orchards in Ecological Compensation Areas appeared to offer little benefit to birds.
A replicated, controlled site comparison study in Germany found that plant species richness was higher on mown orchards than grazed or abandoned ones, but numbers of species and brood cells of bees and wasps did not differ.

704: Reduce grazing intensity on grassland (including seasonal removal of livestock)
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be ineffective or harmful
Background information and definitions:

Studies summarized within this section tested whether reducing livestock grazing intensity on permanent grassland (including seasonal removal of livestock) increased the abundance or species richness of plants, invertebrates or other wildlife. Permanent grassland habitats studied include species-poor improved grass leys, species-rich grasslands and grazed marshes or fens. Studies tested the effectiveness of reducing grazing intensity throughout the year or seasonally removing grazing, for example during or after silage-making or by seasonally excluding grazing in fenced headlands.
 
See also ‘Maintain upland heathland/moorland’ for the effects of reduced grazing intensity on unenclosed upland grassland areas (including upland acid grasslands).

 

Key Messages:

Of 27 individual studies (including 10 replicated, controlled trials, four reviews and one systematic review) from France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and the UK, 15 (including three randomized, replicated, controlled trials) from four countries found benefits to birds, plants or invertebrates in response to reducing grazing intensity on permanent grassland (including seasonal removal of livestock). 
Of these 15 studies, six (including one randomized, replicated, controlled trial) found that reducing grazing intensity throughout the year increased the abundance and diversity of plants (Tallowin et al. 2005, Marriott et al. 2009), frequency of certain plant species, invertebrate diversity, usage by geese and the number of northern lapwing and common redshank. Six studies (including three replicated controlled trials of which two randomized) found that excluding or delaying summer grazing increased plant species diversity, invertebrate abundance and benefited breeding Eurasian skylark. A review found a study that showed that removing autumn grazing after a silage cut increased the winter abundance of seed-eating birds. A review and a replicated controlled study from the UK found that reduced grazing intensity or seasonal removal of livestock increased the number of invertebrates, plant seed heads and foraging skylark, and that some bird species preferred plots with seasonal removal of livestock.
Three studies (including one randomized, replicated, controlled trial) from the Netherlands and the UK found no benefit to plants or invertebrates from reduced grazing intensity. One randomized, replicated controlled trial excluded grazing in autumn/winter and another study excluded grazing in the summer. A further study found that reducing grazing intensity throughout the year did not increase plant diversity.
Nine studies from France, Germany and the UK reported mixed results for some or all species or wildlife groups considered (including one randomized, replicated, controlled trial and two reviews and a systematic review). Of these, eight studies found that reduced grazing intensity throughout the year benefited some species but not others, one found that the impact depended on the type of vegetation grazed, and one found benefits to bee and wasp abundance but not species richness. One study found that the response of birds to removal of summer grazing varied between functional groups and depended on time of year. A UK review found that reduced grazing benefited invertebrates, plants, rodents and some but not all birds. 
A systematic review of the effects of grazing intensity on meadow pasture concluded that intermediate levels of grazing are usually optimal for plants, invertebrates and birds but that trade-offs are likely to exist between the requirements of different taxa.

70: Apply 'cross compliance' environmental standards linked to all subsidy payments
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:

Cross compliance is when farmers have to meet certain statutory standards to qualify for direct support payments such as those under the first pillar of the current Common Agricultural Policy. The standards could include, for example, keeping the land in ‘good agricultural condition’ or managing soil to avoid erosion. The Swiss Ecological Compensation Areas scheme, under which farmers have to manage 7% of their land to qualify for area-based payments, was made obligatory in Switzerland under cross compliance in 1998. Studies examining the effects of this scheme are included in ‘Increase the proportion of natural/semi-natural habitat in the farmed landscape’.

80: Provide nest boxes for bees (solitary bees or bumblebees)
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves providing nest boxes for solitary bees or bumblebees. The majority of the studies summarized here tested the effect of providing nest sites on solitary bees. Solitary bee species nest either in cavities such as hollow stems or bored holes in wood or masonry, or in the ground. Many of the studies used solitary bee nest boxes consisting of common reed Phragmites australis stems, other options include wood or paper tubes. The success of nest boxes in providing suitable alternative nesting habitats for bumblebees may depend on a number of factors including nest box design, siting and availability of foraging resources (Lye et al. 2011).
Lye G.C., Park K.J., Holland J.M. & Goulson D. (2011) Assessing the efficacy of artificial domiciles for bumblebees. Journal for Nature Conservation, 19, 154-160.

Key Messages:

Ten studies (nine replicated trials and a review of studies) from Germany, Poland and the UK of solitary bee nest boxes all showed the nest boxes were readily used by bees. Two replicated studies found the local population size or number of emerging red mason bees increased when nest boxes were provided. One replicated trial in Germany showed that the number of occupied solitary bee nests almost doubled over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.
Two replicated trials tested bumblebee nest boxes and both found very low uptake, 2% or less.
Occupancy rates of solitary bee nest boxes, where reported (two replicated studies), were between 1 and 26% of available cavities. Five studies (four replicated trials and a review of studies) report the number of bee species found in the nest boxes – between 4.6 and 33 species.
One replicated study from Germany found nest boxes should be placed 150-600 m from forage resources (Gathmann & Tscharntke 2002). A replicated study from Poland found the highest production of red mason bees per nest was from nesting materials of reed stems or wood.
