2654: Cease or prohibit all (mobile and static) fishing gears that catch bottom (demersal) species
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Fishing gears that target fish or invertebrate species that live and feed mostly on or near the seabed (collectively called demersal or groundfish species) consist of a variety of gears, both mobile and static. Mobile gears include those actively towed on or just above the seabed by vessel, such as most types of trawls and some seine nets, and bottom seine nets pulled or drawn in by hand or vessel. Static gears include those when deployed on or near the bottom such as gillnets and longlines. These fishing gears not only selectively remove target and non-target bottom-dwelling fish species or groups, but some can cause disturbance and damage to sensitive bottom habitats, including those that fish may depend on for activities such as spawning. Ceasing or prohibiting some or all mobile and static fishing gears that catch bottom species in an area may protect demersal fish communities from overexploitation, reduce fishing mortality and help to preserve essential fish habitats.
Evidence for similar interventions relating to the use of different fishing gears to target bottom-dwelling fish are summarized under ‘Cease or prohibit mobile fishing gears that catch bottom (demersal) species and are dragged across the seafloor’, ‘Cease or prohibit fishing shellfish dredging’, ‘Cease or prohibit line fishing’ and ‘Cease or prohibit spearfishing’. See also, ‘Establish long-term fishery closures’ and ‘Establish temporary fishery closures’.

Key Messages:

Three studies examined the effects of ceasing or prohibiting mobile and static fishing gears that catch bottom (demersal) species in an area on marine fish populations. One study was in each of the Greenland Sea (Iceland), the North Pacific Ocean (Canada) and the North Atlantic Ocean (USA/Canada).

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Abundance (3 studies): One of three replicated, controlled studies (one paired) in the Greenland Sea, North Pacific Ocean and the North Atlantic Ocean found that an area where fishing gears targeting bottom-dwelling species had been prohibited for 15 years had higher numbers of larger and older cod than openly fished areas. One study found that fish densities in areas closed to mobile and static bottom fish gears (trawls and longlines) for at least 11 years varied between fish species/groups, and also with depth and temperature. The other study found that prohibiting mobile and static bottom fish gears (trawls and hook and line) in protected areas for 2–7 years had no effect on fish densities compared to non-protected areas.
Condition (2 studies): One of two replicated, controlled studies (one paired) in the Greenland Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean found that cod had better growth in areas closed for 5-15 years to mobile and static gears that targeted bottom-dwelling fish, compared to openly fished areas. The other study found that fish size varied between areas closed and open to bottom fish gears (trawls and longlines) and was also affected by depth and temperature.

2655: Establish long-term fishery closures
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Long-term closure of fisheries can be established to protect one or more species of key commercially harvested fish that have suffered continued overexploitation. They differ from other area-based closures based either on gear type(s) alone or those implemented in marine protected areas. This is because they generally apply to only one target fishery/species whilst often allowing other commercial fisheries to operate. In addition, closures of target fisheries do not involve legal protection of the seabed/habitat and may thus be more adaptive and easier to impose or even remove, particularly in response to a recovery of the target fish stock. Long-term fishery closures may be applied to protect commercial/harvested species year-round for an indefinite period. They may help depleted populations of fish to recover by reducing the fishing effort and thus mortality exerted upon them.
Evidence for a related intervention is summarized under ‘Establish temporary fishery closures'. See also ‘Cease or prohibit all (mobile and static) fishing gears that catch bottom (demersal) species’.

Key Messages:

Five studies examined the effects of establishing long-term fishery closures in an area on marine fish populations. One study was in each of the Norwegian Sea (Norway), the North Sea (UK), the Gulf of Maine (USA), the Bismark Sea (Papua New Guinea) and the Kattegat (Sweden/Denmark).

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (4 STUDIES)

Condition (2 studies): One replicated, before-and-after study in the Norwegian Sea found that in the five years after the long-term closure of a commercial coastal fishery, the weights of young salmon returning to rivers were higher than before, and weights of older salmon were similar or lower. One site comparison study in the Gulf of Maine found that there were smaller, but similar condition monkfish inside an area closed year-round to groundfish fishing for six to seven years than an area open to all fishing.
Abundance (4 studies): Two site comparison studies in the Gulf of Maine and Bismark Sea found a higher abundance of only one of seven fish species and lower abundance of monkfish in areas closed to groundfish (bottom-dwelling) fisheries for six to eight years, compared to open areas. One of two replicated, before-and-after studies (one controlled) in the Norwegian Sea and North Sea found that there were more young salmon and similar numbers of older salmon returning to rivers than before, in the five years after the long-term closure of a commercial coastal fishery. The other study found that lesser sandeel biomass and density peaked but there was no overall increase in the three years after a long-term fishery closure compared to before.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)

Behaviour change (1 study): One site comparison study in the Bismark Sea found that in an area closed to customary fishing for eight years, six of seven fish species had a lower flight response distance compared to an area open to customary fishing, making them more vulnerable to capture with spear guns.

OTHER (3 STUDIES)

Reduction of unwanted catch (1 study): One replicated, before-and-after study in the Kattegat found that a combination of long-term fishery closures and areas limited to specific gears reduced unwanted catch of cod compared to before.
Reduction of fishing effort (1 study): One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the North Sea found that long-term closure of a commercial fishery reduced overall fishing effort for lesser sandeel.
Commercial catch abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the North Sea found that annual sandeel catch rates were varied after the indefinite closure of the commercial fishery in an area.

2664: Establish temporary fishery closures
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Like long-term fishery closures, temporary fishery closures in an area can provide relief from fishing mortality to selected species or groups of species that have suffered commercial overexploitation. Unlike long-term fishery closures, temporary closures can be seasonal (occurring in an area during a specific time) or rotational (areas alternately closed and opened to fishing). Seasonal fishery closures may typically be implemented to coincide with known periods during which fish may be more susceptible to the impacts of fishing (e.g. during breeding or spawning). During these periods, many fish species are known to aggregate into denser groups of individuals and may be made up exclusively of individuals of one sex and/or stage of maturity. Rotational fishery closures may be implemented to temporarily reduce fishing effort and mortality on the whole fish population in an area. Prohibiting some or all fishing activity temporarily in an area may protect adult breeding and spawning activity, protect immature fish during settlement and nursing, and reduce fishing mortality, potentially allowing exploited fish populations to recover over time.
Evidence for similar interventions is summarized under ‘Establish long-term fishery closures’. and ‘Protect Reproductive Individuals - Protect spawning fish from capture’.

Key Messages:

Five studies examined the effects of establishing temporary fishery closures on marine fish populations. Two studies were in the North Atlantic Ocean (Canada, UK) and one study was in each of the North Sea (UK), the Philippine Sea (Palau) and the Mediterranean Sea (Spain).

 COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Abundance (1 study): One before-and-after, site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean found no increase in the biomass of the spawning stock of cod following a temporary fishery closure compared to fished areas over nine years.
Survival (1 study): One before-and-after, site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean found no change in the survival of cod following a temporary fishery closure compared to fished areas over nine years.
Condition (1 study): One before-and-after, site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean found no change in the length composition of cod following a temporary fishery closure, compared to fished areas over nine years.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)

Use (1 study): A study in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean reported that over five years tagged adult cod spent nearly a third of time inside a seasonally closed cod spawning area during implementation, and were thus given increased protection from any gears targeting bottom-dwelling fish during the spawning period.

OTHER (4 STUDIES)

Reduction of fishing effort (1 study): One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the North Sea found that fixed temporary closures had little effect on fishing effort for cod, but real-time area closures reduced the annual amount of cod caught (retained and discarded).
Commercial catch abundance (3 studies): One of two replicated (one controlled, one before-and-after) studies in the Philippine Sea and Mediterranean Sea found that during a temporary closure of a grouper fishery, spear fisher catch numbers of other fish groups (herbivores) increased, indicating they were being targeted more compared to the open season. The other study found that in targeted fisheries over 10 years, catch rates of red mullet and total catch (fish and invertebrates combined), but not European hake, increased after temporary closures, compared to before. One before-and-after, site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean found no change over nine years in cod catches following a temporary fishery closure compared to fished areas.

2667: Cease or prohibit all commercial fishing
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Commercial fishing is extraction of marine organisms by any method for sale and profit. It is one of the most widespread human activities in our seas and oceans, and its biggest direct impact on fish is the potential removal of huge quantities of target fish species over large areas. Commercial fishing is done with nearly every gear type, many of which are not highly selective, catching unwanted fish that cannot be sold and so are returned to the sea, often dead or with reduced survival prospects (Benoit et al. 2013; Depestele et al. 2014). If left uncontrolled, commercial fishing can cause depletions, or even total collapse, of entire fish populations (Hutchings & Reynolds 2004; Dickey-Collas et al. 2010). Ceasing or banning all commercial fishing in an area can significantly reduce the overall fishing pressure to levels that should allow commercially targeted fish populations to recover from over-fishing or to maintain existing healthy levels. Prohibiting commercial fishing types may also indirectly benefit non-commercially targeted fish species by reducing disturbance and damage to habitats by the gears used. This intervention is often, but not always, implemented in marine protected areas.
Evidence for similar interventions relating to the ceasing or prohibiting of commercial fishing activity by different gear types is summarized throughout the ‘Spatial and Temporal Management’ section.

Key Messages:

Eight studies examined the effects of ceasing or prohibiting all commercial fishing in an area on marine fish populations. Two studies were in the Tasman Sea (Australia), and one was in each of the Indian Ocean (Australia), the Mediterranean Sea (Spain), the Greenland Sea (Iceland), the Gulf of Mexico (USA), the South China Sea (China) and the South Atlantic Ocean (South Africa).

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Community composition (3 studies): Two before-and-after studies (one site comparison) in the Tasman Sea and South China Sea found that the fish assemblage/species composition was different before and after prohibiting all commercial fishing, in an estuary after two years, and in the nearby wider region surrounding two marine reserves five years after their creation. One site comparison study in the South Atlantic Ocean found no change in species composition between a reserve closed to all commercial fishing for 40 years and unprotected fished areas.
Richness/diversity (2 studies): One site comparison study in the South Atlantic Ocean found no difference in overall fish diversity between a protected area closed to all commercial fishing for 40 years compared to unprotected fished areas. One before-and-after study in the South China Sea found that fish species richness decreased in the wider region five years after all commercial fishing was banned in two marine reserves.

POPULATION RESPONSE (7 STUDIES)

Abundance (7 studies): Two of four site comparison studies (one replicated, one before-and-after) in the Mediterranean Sea, Indian Ocean, south Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico found that in protected areas prohibiting all commercial fishing for five years and 40 years there were higher abundances of three of 12 commercially targeted and non-targeted fish species/groups and one of four commercially targeted fish species, compared to unprotected fished areas. One study found mixed effects on fish densities 30–40 years after banning all commercial fishing, varying with level of commercial exploitation, and higher abundances of five of five commercially exploited species. The other study found there was no increase in white seabream and gilthead bream biomass 2–13 years after closure compared to an unprotected fished area, but it was lower than a no-take area protected for over nine years. One before-and-after, site comparison study in the Tasman Sea found that most fish species in an estuary in a marine reserve had a lower abundance two years after it was closed to all commercial fishing than before, as did one of two reference sites in unprotected adjacent estuaries. One before-and-after study in the South China Sea found that in the five years after the creation of two marine reserves with limits on commercial fishing activity, overall fish density in the nearby wider region increased. One replicated, site comparison study in the Tasman Sea found that in areas of a marine reserve closed to commercial trapping, fish abundance varied over 10 years and was higher for some groups than others compared to reserve sites open to trapping.
Condition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean found that in marine reserve areas banning all commercial fishing for five years, overall fish size was bigger compared to fished areas.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)

Use (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in the Greenland Sea found that areas closed to commercial fishing (trawling) had higher recaptures of tagged smaller immature cod than adult cod over time compared to trawled areas, indicating they were more likely to have an increased protection from fishing.

2668: Cease or prohibit shellfish dredging
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Dredging is done to harvest edible shellfish species (e.g. mussels, clams, scallops, crabs) and is undertaken globally and involves towing a dredge along the seabed. Towed shellfish dredges are usually constructed from a heavy metal frame covered with chain mesh and they vary in size and design depending on the target species. Because of their heavy construction and deployment on the seabed, dredges can cause considerable disturbance, reducing water quality and damaging the seabed, and this has been blamed for decreases in catches of fish (Hoffmann & Dolmer, 2000). They may also capture or damage small unwanted fish. Inside areas where dredging is prohibited, its indirect (disturbance) and direct (fishing mortality) effects on fish are removed, although fishing using other methods may still impact the fish species and populations.
For a related intervention, see ‘Cease or prohibit mobile fishing gears that catch bottom (demersal) species and are dragged across the seafloor’.

2669: Cease or prohibit mobile midwater (pelagic) fishing gears
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Mobile midwater (pelagic) fishing gears are nets deployed in the water column above the seabed, typically used to catch pelagic fish species such as herrings Clupeidae, tunas Thunnus spp. and salmon Salmonidae. They include midwater trawls and semi-mobile gears such as purse seines, ring nets and pelagic drift nets. Mobile pelagic gears are generally considered less damaging to seabed habitats than towed bottom fishing gears as they do not purposefully contact the seabed and thus the impact is reduced. However, they are still capable of catching large numbers of fish of both target and non-target species, and accidental contact with seabed features may still occur. Ceasing or prohibiting fishing with mobile pelagic fishing gears may reduce overall fishing effort and fishing mortality in an area, and subsequently reduce the effects on fish populations.

Key Messages:

One study examined the effects of ceasing or prohibiting fishing with towed (mobile) midwater fishing gears on marine fish populations. The study was in the Norwegian Sea (Norway).

Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Fishing can impact marine fish through species removal or habitat damage from fishing gear coming into contact with the seabed. Non-towed or static fishing gear (various types of nets, longlines, pots and traps) are usually considered less damaging than mobile gears (Broadhurst et al. 2006). However, they can be deployed in areas inaccessible to towed gears and some types can catch large quantities of fish, including unwanted species and sizes. Ceasing or prohibiting all static gears in an area can remove the direct fishing pressure on marine fish and may reduce unwanted fish catch.

2671: Cease or prohibit line fishing
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Commercial line fishing is catching fish using the relatively simple equipment of a cord (fishing line) attached to a hook. Commercial lines vary in construction material and thickness and range in configuration from a single line with several hooks to hundreds or even thousands of hooks attached to one main line (longline) in groups via shorter lines. Hooks are baited with animal or synthetic substances to attract the fish and can be deployed anywhere in the water column or on the seabed depending on the habit of the species being targeted. Although a less destructive fishing technique compared to some others, line fishing can lead to over-fishing, particularly in shallow coastal waters where intensity can be high. In addition, longlines can be responsible for high levels of unwanted fish catch as well as incidentally capturing other marine animals and birds. The control or elimination of line fishing in an area may help reduce fishing pressure and unwanted catch and mitigates the effects of removal of target species and sizes.

2672: Cease or prohibit spearfishing
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Spearfishing is a technique of hunting fish underwater, historically with sharpened or barbed sticks, but in current times often using powered metal spearguns. Spearfishing is done by free diving, snorkelling or scuba diving and is one of the few fishing techniques where each target fish is individually selected, and unwanted catch is virtually nil. However, spearfishing is widely used, is an effective and efficient method of harvesting fish and activities may be concentrated at habitats such as reefs. In heavily targeted areas, local fish populations can be severely depleted (Dulvy & Polunin 2004; Godoy et al. 2010) or may suffer other impacts related to the removal of particular sizes or sexes of fish (Alonzo & Mangel 2004). Spearfishing activity is managed throughout the world with a wide range of restrictions ranging from complete bans to prohibiting the use of scuba or spearguns or allowing only recreational spearfishing. Prohibiting spearfishing may often be implemented in marine protected areas with the aim of preventing localised overfishing or selective removal of parts of the fish population.

2673: Cease or prohibit mobile fishing gears that catch bottom (demersal) species and are dragged across the seafloor
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Mobile bottom-towed fishing gears targeting demersal species (mainly various trawl types and some seine nets) are nets that are hauled or actively towed in contact with the seabed, usually from one or more vessels under power (and hence they are a specific subset of general bottom/demersal fishing gears – see related interventions listed below). Towed mobile bottom-contacting gears typically consist of a conical length of net that gradually tapers in size from a wide opening at the front to a closed end section (codend) that collects the catch. Towed bottom-contacting gears can be deployed over large linear distances for extended periods of time and so can catch large quantities of fish, including unwanted sizes and species. Because they are dragged along the seabed essential fish habitats may be damaged along with non-target fish and organisms that fish may feed on. They can also cause sediment disturbance that reduces water quality (Jones 1992). Banning mobile fishing gears that contact the seabed in an area may reduce overall fishing mortality and the damage and disturbance affecting fish and their habitats.
Evidence for similar interventions relating to the use of towed bottom-contacting fishing gears are summarized under ‘Cease or prohibit all (mobile and static) fishing gears that catch bottom (demersal) species’ and ‘Cease or prohibit shellfish dredging’.

The other study reported no effect of closing an area to all towed bottom fishing gears on the species richness of bottom-dwelling fish after 10 years and compared to areas open to trawling.

 POPULATION RESPONSE (8 STUDIES)

Abundance (5 studies): Two of three replicated studies (one controlled and before-and-after, and two site comparison) and one of two before-and-after studies (one site comparison) in the North Sea, Arafura Sea, North Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea found that ceasing or prohibiting fishing with towed bottom gears resulted in higher total fish biomass after 15 years, higher biomass of adult red mullet after 14 years and increased abundances of long-snouted, but not short-snouted, seahorses after one year, compared to openly fished areas. The other two studies found that a ban on towed bottom fishing gears for five and 10 years had no effect on the abundance of bottom-dwelling fish species after closure compared to before, or the abundance and biomass of fish and invertebrate species (combined) compared to areas open to towed gears/trawling.
Reproductive success (2 studies): One of two before-and-after studies (one site comparison) in the North Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea found that after the closure of an area to all bottom-towed fishing gears for 14 years, recruitment of young red mullet had increased. The other study found that an area closed to bottom trawling did not have higher recruitment of young haddock seven years after closure and compared to a trawled area.
Survival (1 study): One before-and-after, site comparison study in the North Atlantic Ocean found that closing an area to bottom trawling did not increase the survival of young haddock seven years after closure, and compared to a trawled area.
Condition (5 studies): One of four replicated studies (two site comparison and one randomized, site comparison) and one before-and-after study in the Arafura Sea, Mediterranean Sea, Gulf of Mexico and the Indian Ocean found that areas prohibiting bottom towed fishing gears had larger sizes of adult red mullet 14 years after closure than before. Two studies found that the effect on fish size of closing areas to towed bottom gears for 3–6 years or areas with no bottom fishing activity varied between individual fish groups and with habitat type, compared to fished areas. The other two found that areas closed to bottom trawling for five years and 15 years had no effect on the overall size of fish and invertebrate species combined or average fish weight, compared to trawled areas.

Catch abundance (1 study): One replicated, before-and-after study in the Indian Ocean found that areas prohibiting beach and all other seine nets for 3–6 years found overall fish catch rates were higher, and catch rates of individual fish groups were variable, compared to unrestricted areas.

Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Marine Protected Areas are legally protected marine sites in which fish (among other marine animals and habitats) conservation can be promoted through controls on the fishing and other human activities that take place within its boundaries. The level of protection varies widely in protected areas, from the banning of all human access to permitting selected activities including some fishing types. Marine protected areas that want to allow a wide range of human activities are generally divided into zones with different rules on access and use in each. They may typically have reserve zones where all fishing is prohibited and ‘partially-protected zones’ that allow fishing with specified gears or for certain species only. Zoning of marine protected areas is considered an easy management measure to implement (Sale 2002) and is a way of providing or maintaining socio- and economic benefits to local regions and communities.
Evidence for similar interventions relating to prohibiting human activity, including fishing, in marine protected areas is summarized under ‘Cease or prohibit all types of fishing in a marine protected area’, ‘Cease or prohibit all fishing activity in a marine protected area with limited exceptions’ and ‘Restrict fishing activity (types unspecified) in a marine protected area’.

Richness/diversity (1 study): One site comparison study in the Philippine Sea found a higher number of fish species in the no-fishing/no access zone of a multi-zoned marine protected area compared to two partially fished zones and unprotected fished areas 10 to 15 years after implementation. 

POPULATION RESPONSE (4 STUDIES)

Condition (4 studies): Two of four site comparison studies in the southern Atlantic Ocean, Ligurian Sea, Indian Ocean and the Coral Sea found that controlling human activity in marine protected areas with a zonation system of restrictions resulted in larger average lengths of steentjies and three seabream species three years after implementation compared to unprotected fished areas, and lengths were largest within a no-take zone than a partially fished zone. Two other studies found larger sizes of four of four coral reef fish in a zone where nearly all fishing is prohibited compared to an adjacent zone with fewer fishing restrictions two to seven years after protection, and of two of six fish feeding groups in no-entry zones compared to both no-take and fished zones protected between 10 and 20 years.
Abundance (6 studies): Two of four site comparison studies (one replicated) in the Ligurian Sea, Philippine Sea and the Coral Sea found that controlling human activity in protected areas with a zonation system of restrictions resulted in a greater biomass and/or abundance of fish species after 3–15 years compared to unprotected areas outside, and between the zones fish abundance varied with the level of restriction and between individual fish groups and sizes. The other two studies found higher density, biomass, and abundance of fish in non-fished zones (no-entry and no-take) compared to fished zones inside areas protected for 10 to 27 years depending on region, but the effect varied between fish feeding groups, zone protection level and reef region. One site comparison study in the Indian Ocean found higher abundances of four of four reef fish species in a zone where nearly all fishing is prohibited, compared to an adjacent zone with fewer fishing restrictions. One site comparison study in the Southern Atlantic Ocean found that steentjies in a protected zone closed to fishing but open to other recreational activities had a different age and sex structure to a fished multipurpose zone, and both were different to a distant unprotected fished site with low steentjie exploitation.

BEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)

Use (2 studies): Two site comparison studies in the Indian Ocean found that in marine protected areas with zonation systems of activity controls, most of the individuals of the reef fish species tagged and released inside the protected areas were recaptured again at almost the same locations over the following nine or four years, and mainly in the zones where all or nearly all fishing was prohibited for up to 20 years, indicating increased protection from fishing.

2675: Cease or prohibit customary fishing (indigenous fishing for cultural and community needs)
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Customary fishing applies to indigenous communities with a traditional connection to the area being fished and is for subsistence and cultural purposes. Customary fishing may have different fishing rules to commercial or recreational fishing; however, the sustainability of fish stocks is still a priority of customary fishing arrangements. In general, the community leader(s) have the responsibility of maintaining the local fishing laws and decisions may be made for cultural or religious reasons as well as in response to changes in fish catches. For example, closures of areas to fishing might be implemented if fish catches are perceived to decrease in the hope that fish might migrate into the fishing grounds whilst maintaining a good population nearby. Measures might be temporary (less than one year) or permanent (more than one year).

2677: Establish territorial fishing use rights
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Territorial fishing use rights is an area-based way of managing marine resources that gives exclusive harvesting rights to fish in a specified area to certain groups of people. These are usually allocated to and managed locally by groups of fishers working in a cooperative system. They may also be part of co-management systems with the government under national or regional frameworks. Territorial fishing use areas can be used to control fishing mortality and enforce fisher compliance. The benefits may include resource and habitat conservation and improved community participation and decision-making at a local scale.

2678: Allow only small-scale, traditional (artisanal) fishing
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Artisanal fisheries are the commercial component of small‐scale coastal fisheries mostly practiced using traditional methods. They are particularly important in some areas such as the Mediterranean where they constitute about 80% of the fishing fleet (Marengo et al. 2015). Artisanal fishing uses a large range of gear types and techniques but is typically operated by a single fisher or a pair of fishers. They target a high number of species, but the fishing methods employed are generally low technology and non-destructive. Allowing only artisanal fishing in an area helps to regulate fishing pressure while balancing conservation and socio-economic needs of local communities, many of whom rely on marine resources. Co-management agreements involving the artisanal fishers may also encourage compliance and may be more easily used to adapt the local fishing effort and/or selectivity to avoid overfishing.

2679: Allow periodic fishing only
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Allowing fishing activity in an area only for limited frequencies and durations (called periodically harvested closures) is a spatial fisheries management strategy to reduce the impacts of overfishing. They are generally locally managed, small fisheries closures that range from being mostly closed, to mostly open to fishing and are widely implemented in Indo-Pacific regions (Goetze 2016). The aims of periodically harvested closures range from conservation of biodiversity to providing benefits to fisheries through increased catches and fish productivity. Their effectiveness at increasing fish productivity may depend on their size, duration of closure and level of compliance (Goetze 2016).

2680: Restrict fishing activity (types unspecified) in a marine protected area
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Marine Protected Areas are designations for marine sites in which fish (among other marine animals and habitats) conservation can be promoted through management of the fishing and other human activities that take place within them. Restricting fishing activity inside a protected area should reduce the overall fishing mortality and disturbance to fish habitats. In studies where the exact fishing types that are regulated inside a protected area are not reported, it may still be expected that fish populations may respond to an overall reduction in fishing pressure and exploitation.
Evidence for similar interventions relating to prohibiting human activity, including fishing, in marine protected areas is summarized under ‘Cease or prohibit all types of fishing in a marine protected area’, ‘Cease or prohibit all fishing activity in a marine protected area with limited exceptions’ and ‘Control human activity in a marine protected area with a zonation system of restrictions’.

Key Messages:

Two studies examined the effects of restricting (unspecified) fishing activity in a marine protected area on marine fish populations. One study was global and the other was in the Indian Ocean (Tanzania).

 COMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Richness/diversity (1 study): One global review reported that of 11 studies showing effects of protection from restricting fishing activity in marine reserves, one found higher fish species richness inside reserves compared to non-protected fished areas.

Abundance (1 study): One global review reported that 10 of 11 studies showing effects of protection from restricting fishing activity in marine reserves found higher abundance of fish inside the areas compared to areas without fishing restrictions.
Condition (2 studies): One site comparison study in the Indian Ocean found that blackspot snapper inside a marine park with unspecified fishing restrictions and low fishing intensity were of larger average size, reached older ages, but did not have different growth rates compared to more intensively fished areas outside the park. One global review reported that five out of 11 studies showing effects of protection from restricting fishing activity in marine reserves found fish were larger inside reserves compared to non-protected areas without fishing restrictions.

2681: Cease or prohibit all fishing activity in a marine protected area with limited exceptions
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Marine Protected Areas are designations for marine sites in which fish (and other marine animals and habitats) conservation can be promoted through management of the fishing activity and other human activities. Many protected areas are ‘no-take’ areas in which no harvesting or collection of marine organisms is permitted by any method. However, some may prohibit almost all harvesting but permit very limited fishing activity (i.e. only one type of harvest activity and/or target species), typically those that are considered to be more selective and have no impact on the bottom habitat. depending on the purpose and the characteristics of the species or habitats intended to be conserved. Ceasing or prohibiting almost all fishing activity may benefit previously impacted populations by allowing them to recover from the effects of fishing over time, whilst allowing the limited use of other resources in the protected area or for it to be used for a specific purpose with potentially little or no impact.
Evidence for similar interventions relating to prohibiting human activity, including fishing, in marine protected areas is summarized under ‘Cease or prohibit all types of fishing in a marine protected area’, ‘Control human activity in a marine protected with a zonation system of restrictions’ and ‘Restrict fishing activity (types unspecified) in a marine protected area’.

Key Messages:

Four studies examined the effects of ceasing or prohibiting all fishing activity in a marine protected area with limited exceptions on marine fish populations. One study was in each of the Pacific Ocean (USA), the Caribbean Sea (US Virgin Islands), the Great Barrier Reef (Australia) and the Skagerrak (Norway).

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Richness/diversity (1 study): One site comparison study in the Caribbean Sea found that in marine protected areas closed to all fishing with limited exceptions for up to seven years, there was lower total fish species richness compared to unprotected areas.

POPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Abundance (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in the Pacific Ocean found that abundance of copper rockfish, quillback rockfish, china rockfish and lingcod was similar between non-voluntary and voluntary ‘no-take’ reserve sites where all fishing with limited exceptions had been prohibited for one to eight years, and sites open to fishing. One site comparison study in the Caribbean Sea found that restricting all fishing activity except for bait fishing in marine protected areas for seven years resulted in similar total fish biomass and lower total fish density, compared to unprotected areas.


Survival (1 study): One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the Skagerrak found that cod survival increased inside a marine protected area in the eight years after almost all fishing was prohibited, compared to outside areas fished with a wider range of gear types.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)

Use (1 study): One replicated study in the Great Barrier Reef found that immature pigeye sharks and adult spottail sharks were detected frequently and over long time periods inside marine protected areas five years after prohibiting almost all fishing except restricted line fishing and bait netting, thus reducing the overall likelihood of fishing mortality.

2682: Cease or prohibit all types of fishing in a marine protected area
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Fishing can impact fish populations directly by species removal or indirectly by changes to the food chain or damage to fish habitats from contact with fishing gears (Collie et al. 2000). Specific marine areas can be given protected status, and the human activities undertaken within the areas managed to control potentially harmful impacts. One such measure is to ban all types of fishing in a protected area. These areas are often known as marine reserves or sanctuaries, or ‘no-take’ areas. Inside no-take areas, fish are protected from fishing mortality and may allow depleted populations to recover. Fish may also benefit from the reduction in disturbance, particularly during sensitive periods such as spawning, and potential damage to important spawning habitats. Fish that spend a large proportion of time inside no-take protected areas may be expected to have higher protection from fishing mortality than longer-ranging species or individuals, and level of protection may also depend on the size of the protected area (Chateau & Wantiez, 2009).
Evidence for similar interventions relating to prohibiting human activity, including fishing, in marine protected areas is summarized under ‘Control human activity in a marine protected with a zonation system of restrictions', 'Cease or prohibit all fishing activity in a marine protected area with limited exceptions’ and ‘Restrict fishing activity (types unspecified) in a marine protected area’.

Key Messages:

Seventy-nine studies examined the effects of ceasing or prohibiting all types of fishing in a marine protected area on fish populations. Fifteen studies were in the Indian Ocean (Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa, Mozambique, Madagascar, multiple African countries, Australia). Twelve studies were in the Mediterranean Sea (Spain, France, Italy). Ten studies were in the Pacific Ocean (New Zealand, USA, Hawaii, New Caledonia, Costa Rica, Tonga, Vanuatu, Solomon Islands). Seven studies were in each of the Coral Sea (Australia, Vanuatu), the Tasman Sea (New Zealand, Australia) and the Atlantic Ocean (Brazil, USA, Puerto Rico, Argentina, South Africa, UK, Canary Islands, Portugal, Turks and Caicos Islands). Four studies were in the Philippine Sea (Philippines). Three studies were in the Caribbean Sea (Belize, Puerto Rico). One study was in each of the Gulf of Mexico (USA), the Java Sea (Indonesia), the Pacific and Indian Oceans (multiple countries), the Sulu Sea (Malaysia) and the North Sea (Norway). Six studies were reviews of marine reserves (New Zealand, Latin America/Caribbean, regions unspecified and across the world).

 COMMUNITY RESPONSE (26 STUDIES) 

Community composition (7 studies): Seven site comparison studies (two replicated, and one before-and-after) in the Mediterranean Sea, Indian Ocean, Philippine Sea and the Atlantic Ocean found that protected areas where all fishing had been prohibited for between three and 16 years, had a different fish community composition, compared to fished areas. 


Richness/diversity (22 studies): Fourteen of 20 site comparison studies (eight replicated, one replicated and paired, and one before-and-after) in the Indian Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, Philippine Sea, Tasman Sea, Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, Coral Sea and the Pacific Ocean, found that marine protected areas that had prohibited all fishing for between one to more than 25 years, had higher fish species/richness compared to fished areas. Six studies found similar fish species/richness between one and 20 years after all fishing was banned in protected areas, compared to fished areas. One systematic review in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans found no difference in species richness between unfished protected areas and fished areas. One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean found that the effects of prohibiting all fishing on fish species richness/diversity after 15 years varied with the sampling method used.

POPULATION RESPONSE (66 STUDIES)

Abundance (64 studies): Thirty of 54 site comparison studies (18 replicated, eight replicated and paired, two before-and-after, one paired and before-and-after, and one replicated and before-and-after) in the Indian Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, Pacific Ocean, Tasman Sea, Coral Sea, Philippine Sea, Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and the Sulu Sea, found that marine protected areas that had been prohibiting all fishing for up to 25 years or more, had higher abundances (density and/or biomass) of all fish (total fish biomass, total fish density), fishery targeted fish species, non-fishery targeted fish species and all or most of the individual fish species/groups monitored, except fish densities (all or most) and non-fishery targeted species, compared to unprotected fished areas and/or partly-fished protected areas. The studies also found that in some cases where the total fish biomass or densities were higher in no-fished areas, the effect varied between individual groups of fish based on species family and/or position in the food chain, commercial target and non-target species, fish sizes, depth and habitat types. Eight studies found that inside protected areas prohibiting all fishing there were similar abundances of all fish, and all or most of the individual fish species/groups monitored, compared to fished areas between one and 20 years after implementation. The other sixteen studies found that the effect of prohibiting fishing in protected areas for three to 20 years on fish abundance varied between fish species or groups and on their fished status (fishery target or non-target) and/or position in the food chain. One also found that the effect varied with size or age of the protected areas. Five of six reviews (three systematic) across the world, in the Pacific and/or Atlantic Oceans and in unreported regions found that non-fished marine reserves with one to 27 years of protection had higher abundances of all fish, all fish and invertebrates combined and blue cod compared to fished areas, but there were differences between species/groups and fishing intensity outside reserves. The other review found that fish abundance varied between species in no-take marine reserves between one and 25 years old, and was affected by food chain position, level of exploitation and duration of protection. One replicated study in the Pacific Ocean found a long-term decline in the abundance/presence of eight of 12 shark and ray species inside an established (&gt;15 years) no-fishing protected area, however enforcement was poor. One before-and after, site comparison study in the Pacific Ocean, found no differences in overall fish abundance between a marine reserve closed permanently to fishing for five years and a closed area that was harvested for two years during the same period. One site comparison study in the Coral Sea found that in a no-take zone of an area protected for at least 10 years, fish abundance of four of six fish groups were similar to no-entry and fished zones, but two had lower abundance than the no-entry zone. One replicated, paired, site comparison study in the Tasman Sea found that in a non-fished marine park zone abundance of commercially targeted fish was higher than partly fished zones but lower than unprotected areas after four to eight years.
Reproductive success (1 study): One site comparison study in the Mediterranean Sea found more eggs of four commercially targeted fish species inside a non-fished marine reserve enforced for three years than in fished areas outside the reserve.
Survival (1 study): One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean found that prohibiting all fishing in a marine protected area for three years resulted in similar survival of red hind grouper, compared to fished areas.
Condition (20 studies): Two global review studies (one systematic) and two systematic reviews in the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans found that prohibiting all fishing in marine protected areas for one to 27 years resulted in larger fish overall and larger blue cod compared to fished areas, but there were differences between individual fish families or species. Eight of 11 site comparison studies (four replicated, one before-and-after, one paired, and one replicated and paired) in the Tasman Sea, Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, Atlantic Ocean, Java Sea and the Philippine Sea, found that non-fished protected areas had larger fish overall and larger individuals of all or most of the fish species/groups monitored, compared to fished areas, after one to 22 years. The other three studies found similar fish sizes of all or all but one species, compared to fished areas one to 16 years after all fishing was prohibited. Three site comparison studies (one replicated) in the Coral Sea, Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean found that fish size in protected areas that had not been fished for six to more than 20 years, varied between fish species or food chain groups. One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean found that red hind grouper were larger, but had similar growth, in an area protected from fishing for three years compared to fished areas. One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean found that young lemon sharks in areas protected from fishing for 20 years had similar growth rates, but lower condition, than sharks in unprotected fished areas.

BEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES) 

Behaviour change (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in the Pacific and Indian Oceans found that surgeonfish and parrotfish inside established protected areas where fishing was prohibited, showed a similar avoidance response to fishing gears as in fished areas, and this increased with increasing fishing intensity outside the protected areas. One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean found that in non-fished areas protected for one and 24 years, fish grazing rates were higher compared to fished areas.

 OTHER (15 STUDIES)

Use (7 studies): Four of six site comparison studies in the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean and the Tasman Sea found that marine protected areas where all fishing had been prohibited for at least five to 15 years, were used for a large proportion of time by shark and ray species and commercially important reef fish species, compared to fished areas, thus were provided protection from fishing. Two other studies found that time spent inside areas closed to all fishing for 20 years and over 30 years, varied between species and with size for three shark species and with size for giant trevally. One replicated study in the Indian Ocean found that most individuals of five fish species remained inside a marine reserve zone closed to fishing over a nine-year period.


Catch abundance (2 studies): One of two site comparison studies in the Mediterranean Sea and Pacific Ocean found that commercial fish catch rates in small-scale traditional fisheries were highest closest to a marine reserve closed to all fishing for 22 years, and decreased with increasing distance from the reserve. The other study found that there was no increase in fish catch rates in commercially landed catch in the five years after a no-fishing zone was implemented in a co-managed protected area.
Stock biomass (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean found that the stock biomass (the harvested portion of the population) of reef fish species was highest in enforced protected areas closed to all fishing, compared to various other area management regimes. 


Fishing mortality (2 studies): Two site comparison studies in the North Sea and Pacific Ocean found that prohibiting fishing in protected areas resulted in reduced commercial fishing mortality of corkwing wrasse tagged inside non-fished marine reserves compared to fished areas, and that the overall fishing mortality of grey reef sharks tagged inside protected areas was low.

2683: Deploy fishing gear at selected depths to avoid unwanted species
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
The depths fish are found throughout the water column depends not only on the species and their preferred habitat, but also on factors such as behaviour (e.g. for feeding or spawning) and age structure. It is also highly influenced by environmental conditions like water temperature and salinity, among others, and may change over short timescales, such as different times of the day. Different fishing gears exploit the known depth distributions of fish and are deployed either on the seabed or at specific depths in the water column to maximise catches of the desired fish (aided by sonar technology in many cases). Conversely, this knowledge may also be used to avoid the capture of fish, potentially rare or threatened species and commercial unwanted species or sizes.
Evidence for similar interventions is summarized under ‘Deployment of fishing gear and mode of operation - Deploy fishing gear at selected times (day/night) to avoid unwanted species’ and ‘Selectively avoid unwanted fish based on temperature distribution’.

Key Messages:

Five studies examined the effect of deploying fishing gear at selected depths to avoid unwanted species on marine fish populations. Three studies were in the Atlantic Ocean (Florida, Brazil, Canary Islands), and one study was in each of the Pacific Ocean (Hawaii) and the Tasman Sea (Australia).

Reduction of unwanted catch (5 studies): Four of five replicated studies (three controlled, one paired and controlled) in the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean and the Tasman Sea found that deploying fishing gear (longlines, handlines and traps) at selected depths, including above the seabed instead of on it, reduced the unwanted catches of five of 17 fish species, three of eight shark/ray species, non-commercially targeted fish species and Harrison’s dogfish, compared to depths usually fished. The other study found that different shark species were hooked at different depths in the water column during bottom-set longlining deployments.

2684: Deploy fishing gear at selected times (day/night) to avoid unwanted species
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Many marine species undertake daily vertical migrations through the water column during day/night cycles, influenced by factors such as temperature, light levels, and prey availability. Some shark species, for example, swim closer to the sea surface at night than during the day (Bromhead et al. 2012). There is also evidence that in sufficient levels of light some fish are better able to detect, and thus better avoid, approaching trawl gear (Glass & Wardle 1989) or escape from parts of the net after entering it (Gabr et al. 2007). The timing of setting and hauling gear can, therefore, affect catch rates (Gilman et al. 2008), so fishing at a specific time of day/night may help to avoid unwanted or threatened fish species whose distribution or behaviour decreases the likelihood of capture.
Evidence for similar interventions is summarized under ‘Deployment of fishing gear and mode of operation - Deploy fishing gear at selected depths to avoid unwanted species’ and ‘Selectively avoid unwanted fish based on temperature distribution’.

2685: Selectively avoid unwanted fish based on temperature distribution
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Multispecies fisheries are often managed on a quota system whereby fishers must avoid vulnerable or weak stocks while trying to maintain catches of stronger stocks. One way to do this may be to selectively avoid fish based on differences in distribution between non-target and target species caused by oceanographic features such as temperature. Temperature influences the distribution and abundance of fish seasonally, not only at different geographical locations, but also throughout the water column at different depths. Based on this, Dunn et al. 2016 suggested that unwanted Atlantic cod could largely be avoided in the spring in the North Atlantic Ocean, when their distribution differed from 38–54% of other species.
Evidence for similar interventions is summarized under ‘Deployment of fishing gear and mode of operation - Deploy fishing gear at selected times (day/night) to avoid unwanted species’ and ‘Deploy fishing gear at selected depths to avoid unwanted species’.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of selectively avoiding fish by their temperature distributions on marine fish populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.

2686: Reduce duration of fishing gear deployments
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
The length of time for which fishing gear is deployed, also known as soaking time, can affect the amount of unwanted species caught, catch efficiency, and the condition and survival of released unwanted catch. Shorter gear deployments reduce the amount of time that the gear is in the water and consequently can minimise potential interactions with the wider ecosystem. In longline fisheries, for example, catch rates are initially high after gear deployment, but then decrease (Løkkeborg & Pina 1996), and shorter gear deployments may reduce the amount of unwanted catch. Furthermore, unwanted catch that remains hooked for a shorter amount of time may be more likely to survive after being released. In towed gears such as trawls, shorter gear deployments can reduce the physiological effects of stress and crowding during capture in the gear on unwanted catch, again potentially increasing post-release survival (Heard et al. 2014).
Evidence for similar interventions is summarized under ‘Deployment of fishing gear and mode of operation - Reduce duration of fishing gear deployments’ and ‘Reduce the hauling speed of a trawl net’. See also ‘Handling of Catch’.

Survival (2 studies): Two replicated, controlled studies in the North Sea found that survival of unwanted plaice and/or sole released after capture in beam or pulse trawls was higher after shorter duration trawl deployments, but that the opposite was true for plaice captured in otter trawls, over tow durations of between one and two hours.

Reduction of unwanted catch (1 study): One of two replicated studies (one paired and controlled) in the Barents Sea/Atlantic Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean found that catch rates of unwanted sharks caught in longline gear decreased with decreasing time the gear was deployed in the water, over durations of up to 10 hours. The other study found that shorter tow durations caught similar amounts of small haddock, but more small cod, than longer durations, in bottom trawls fished for between five minutes and one hour.
Improved size-selectivity of fishing gear (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in the Barents Sea/Atlantic Ocean found that varying bottom trawl fishing durations between five minutes and two hours had no effect on the size-selectivity of Atlantic cod, haddock or long rough dab.

2687: Change the towing speed of a trawl net
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Trawling is a method of fishing that involves pulling a fishing net (trawl) through the water behind one or more vessels. Fish entering the net will either be retained by it or may escape through the gaps in the mesh of the trawl netting during fishing. Many factors can influence the likelihood of a fish being caught or escaping from a trawl (termed selectivity or efficiency) including species, size of fish, time of day, trawl configuration and towing speed. The towing speed of a net may affect the size and shape of the meshes through which fish may escape. But it may also affect how likely a fish is to avoid entering the net in the first place. Fish behaviour differs on encountering different trawl nets (Krag et al. 2014) and the towing speed of the net may further change the ability of fish to escape in response to the altered hydrodynamics that may require a different swimming behaviour. Fish have been seen to actively escape trawl nets by accelerating in bursts or changing direction, or, more commonly, escaping in response to contact with the net (Jones et al. 2008). Depending on the species, a faster or slower towing speed may allow more fish to escape.
Evidence for similar interventions is summarized under ‘Deployment of fishing gear and mode of operation - Reduce duration of fishing gear deployments’ and ‘Reduce the hauling speed of a trawl net’. See also ‘Handling of Catch’.

2688: Reduce the hauling speed of a trawl net
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Hauling a trawl net back to the surface at a slow speed might allow fish to swim forward and escape the net, or if the trawl is equipped with a catch reduction device it might further encourage escape opportunities (Eayrs 2007). Whilst this may reduce the catch of unwanted fish, there is an increased potential for commercially valuable fish to also escape the trawl if hauling speed is too slow. Hauling at a slower speed may also reduce fish stress and physical damage which may result in higher survival if discarded.
Evidence for similar interventions is summarized under ‘Deployment of fishing gear and mode of operation - Reduce duration of fishing gear deployments’ and ‘Change the towing speed of a trawl net’. See also ‘Handling of Catch’.

2689: Use a different method to sort or bring catch onboard
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
The process of fish being lifted out of the water in fishing nets and on to a vessel for sorting can create extreme stress (Ashley 2006). In trawl nets there is also an increased likelihood of crush or puncture injuries under the weight of the catch. In addition, depending on the duration of time exposed during the catch sorting process , fish survival is decreased, not only due to factors such as oxygen deprivation, but also to the drying out of the fishes’ protective layer. Using different methods to move and sort fish (e.g. using water) may help improve the survival of discarded fish that after sorting are returned to the sea, by minimising air exposure and overall damage, including disruption to their mucus layer and scales (Hürlimann et al. 2014). One potential sorting method to reduce discard mortality, using a water-filled sorting tray instead of a conventional dry tray, led to fewer deaths of discarded fish during longer sorting times (Broadhurst et al. 2008).

2690: Reduce the duration of exposure to air of captured fish before release
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
In all types of fishing activity, fish are exposed to the air when the fishing gear they have been captured with is retrieved from the water. In commercial fisheries, the duration of air exposure can vary widely and depends on fishing method, the amount and type of catch and the processes used to sort it. When fish leave the water the surface area of their gills is drastically reduced and oxygen uptake into the bloodstream virtually stops (Ferguson & Tufts 1992). They are likely to suffer external injury as well as internal damage as a response to the acute stress. A fish will ultimately die if left out of water. However, some fish species are more tolerant to exposure than others and can survive for a relatively long time in air. Reducing the length of time fish are exposed to air before being returned to the water may influence survival by reducing physical injury and damage caused by lack of oxygen. Normal gill function returns when live fish are returned to water.

2691: Release protected or species of concern alive after capture
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Releasing protected or other threatened fish species alive after incidental capture should, in theory, protect the released individuals and wider populations, particularly weaker ones, from fishing mortality and overexploitation. However, the effectiveness of live release relies on a range of factors affecting the survival of fish post-capture, including: the extent of damage from the gear, fishing duration, catch size, exposure to the air and temperature changes, depth of capture and behavioural impairments that increase the chance of predation after release (Davis 2002). In some countries where commercial fish catches are managed by quota limits, there are policies that state fish cannot be returned to the sea unless certain conditions are met, such as evidence of the species having a high likelihood of survival (Ellis et al. 2016). Survival may depend on multiple factors including species vulnerability, capture method (and depth of capture), duration of time exposed to the air and handling techniques.

One study found that nearly all yelloweye rockfish survived for four days after capture and release, but canary rockfish survival decreased with increasing capture depth.

2692: Establish handling and release protocols in non-recreational fisheries
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Releasing alive unwanted animals from fishing catches back into the sea helps reduce the ecosystem impacts of fisheries (Raby et al. 2018). There is a presumption that a released animal is likely to behave normally and survive, but some captured fish show signs of lethargy before release (Davis 2000). Lethargic fish are at risk of reduced survival and may be more prone to predation by other marine animals and seabirds upon release (Broadhurst 1998). Adopting handling and release protocols which may improve vitality of returned fish would reduce the likelihood of their post-release predation. Efficient handling and release methods may also reduce fish injuries and any impacts of exposure of fish to the air. The minimising of both of these factors may help improve survival.

2693: Set catch limits or quotas for non-targeted commercial catch
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Fishing catch limits (sometimes called quotas) set a maximum limit on the seasonal or annual quantity of fish that can be caught by a vessel in a given area or fishery and may apply to one or more species. One such type of quota (termed individual transferable quota or ITQ) is used to restrict the overall amount of fish a fishing fleet can catch. As the name suggests, transferable quotas can be bought, sold or leased between vessels. However, another type of quota (termed individual vessel bycatch quota or ITBQ) can be implemented. Unlike ITQs, ITBQs are not transferable and put a limit on the unwanted/discarded proportion of fish a vessel can catch that isn’t retained for market (fish may not be kept for market for a variety of reasons, including the species being of no value and/or target species that are undersized or exceed the quota). They aim to reduce unwanted catches of fish by not only limiting overall fishing mortality, but by also encouraging active avoidance of unwanted catch by fishers that may have to stop fishing once their non-target quota is reached (O’Keefe et al. 2014).

2694: Legislate to oblige fishers to retain and land all catch of species managed by quotas
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
In commercial fisheries, fish are returned back into the sea after capture, or discarded, for a number of reasons including fish being too small, of no/low value, or because the fisher has already met their maximum allowed catch (quota) for a species. Discarding is widely considered a wasteful practice if the fish is dead upon capture or is likely to die once returned (Condie et al. 2014). Legislation has recently come into force in European fisheries, obliging fishers to retain all (e.g. all sizes etc) catches of commercially-caught quota species (although a few exemptions exist, such as if there is clear evidence a species is likely to survive post-release). Historically, discarding of rockfish in the British Columbia groundfish trawl fishery has been prohibited, as well as a full discard ban in the Faroe Island fisheries (Condie et al. 2014) and a discard ban for Pacific cod and pollock in the US Alaskan groundfish fisheries. The aim is that banning discarding will incentivise fishers to operate more selectively, using gear which help avoid capture of small or unwanted fish in the first place.

2695: Use artificial light on fishing gear
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Many fishing gears incidentally capture unwanted non-commercially targeted species or sizes. Different species show different behavioural responses to light (Ryer & Olla 2000; Ryer & Barnett 2006; Walsh & Hickey 1993). Some may be attracted to the presence of lights, however, some may avoid them or they may enable some fish to see the fishing gear and move away from it. Fitting artificial lights (e.g. LEDs) to fishing gear during deployment may reduce the amount of unwanted species that interact with and are retained by fishing gear.

2696: Attach an electropositive deterrent to fishing gear
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Many fishing gears, as well as catching target commercial species, catch unwanted species. These may be species for which a quota has been reached, those of conservation concern or species that hold no commercial value. Fishing gears may be fitted with devices or substances that exploit a species’ natural reaction to sensory stimulation to deter them from interacting with fishing gear and reduce incidental catch. Elasmobranchs (sharks, skates and rays), for example, have specialized electroreceptors that aid in the detection of prey, predators and potential mates (Rivera-Vicente et al. 2011), and fitting electropositive metals and/or permanent magnets (i.e. substances that generate an electrical or magnetic field) to fishing gear may elicit avoidance behaviour to gears or baits in such species.
Evidence for similar deterrent devices on fishing gear is summarized under ‘Fishing gear modification - Use artificial light on fishing gear’.

The other study found that a potentially deterrent material did not reduce bait consumption by bonnethead and young lemon sharks compared to non-deterrents. One of the studies also found that the bait consumption behaviour of commercially valuable Pacific halibut was unaffected by deterrent materials.

The other two studies, and a global systematic review found that electropositive deterrents on fishing gear resulted in similar catches of unwanted spiny dogfish, sharks (total catch), blue shark and sharks and rays (total catch), compared to gear with no deterrents.

2697: Use a larger mesh size
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Numerous fishing methods involve the use of panels of meshed netting to harvest the target species. Fishing with a net may be active (or mobile) whereby the net is dragged or hauled through the water, or it may be passive whereby the net is deployed in a fixed or semi-fixed location for a period of time. The size and shape of fish that are caught by the net is determined by the shape and the size of the mesh. As well as the target fish, fishing nets may catch immature and undersized fish or fish of unwanted species. To reduce the amount of unwanted species and/or smaller sizes caught, and thus make the net more selective, a larger size of mesh may allow unwanted individuals to escape capture while retaining the commercially targeted species or sizes (Burgos‐León et al. 2009).
Note: The mesh sizes reported here are typically the ‘nominal’ measurements of the mesh sizes’ given in the studies, i.e. the approximate intended size of the meshes in a net. The actual mesh size, usually measured as the average size of several meshes stretched under tension, may vary depending on factors like the configuration of the knots or twine characteristics. In addition, during use, the effective size (or gap opening) of the meshes may also change with how the net is deployed (e.g. towing speed for trawl nets) and the size of the catch.
Evidence for interventions describing other modifications to fishing net mesh (size and/or shape) is summarized under ‘Fishing gear modification – Use a square mesh instead of a diamond mesh codend on trawl nets; Modify gillnet or entangling (trammel/tangle) net configuration’ and ‘Rotate the orientation of diamond mesh in a trawl net’.

One study found that amounts of unwanted fish were reduced with larger mesh at smaller catch sizes but were similar between large and small meshes at larger catch sizes, and one found that increasing a trawl codend mesh size reduced the unwanted catch of one of two fish species compared to a standard mesh. Three found that larger mesh sized fishing nets did not typically reduce the unwanted fish catch compared to nets of smaller mesh sizes. One study found that increasing both the mesh size and minimum size limit reduced catches of the youngest fish.
Improved size-selectivity of fishing gear (23 studies): Nineteen of 21 replicated studies (eight controlled, four paired and controlled, three randomized and controlled, and one paired) and one review, in the North Sea, Aegean Sea, Baltic Sea, Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, Tasman Sea, Arabian Sea, Persian Gulf, Barents Sea and the Mediterranean Sea found that larger mesh sizes (both diamond and square) of the netting of various gear types improved the size-selectivity for all fish species assessed and in one, for two of three fish species, compared to smaller mesh sizes. One study found that size-selectivity for fish was not improved with larger mesh size in the netting of fish traps. The other found that increasing the codend mesh size of trawls fitted with size-sorting escape grids resulted in similar size-selectivity of the codend for fish compared to smaller codend mesh sizes. One controlled study in the English Channel found that a trawl net codend with a larger size of square mesh had similar size-selectivity for Atlantic mackerel as a smaller diamond mesh codend.

2698: Use a different hook type
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
In hook and line fishing, a fishing line is set with single or multiple baited hooks to attract fish. Whilst hook and line fishing is generally considered to be relatively selective, resulting in less unwanted catch than other gears, the type of hook used can influence the species and size of fish captured as well as the extent of hooking injury. Larger hooks, for example, may be effective at avoiding capture of smaller unwanted fish, whilst hooks of different shapes can also affect catch composition. Circle hooks, for example, are hooks on which the point is curved backwards in a circular shape, perpendicular to the main shaft, as opposed to a ‘J’ hook, which has the point parallel to the main shaft. Circle hooks may therefore reduce the incidence of hook swallowing in captured fish, minimising the severity of hooking injury and increasing survival in unwanted catch after release. Other modifications may include attaching inedible objects to hooks to act as deterrents to smaller fish or modifying the configuration of hooks on the mainline, such as changing the attachments.
Evidence for similar interventions affecting the capture of fish on hook and line is summarized under ‘Fishing gear modification - Use a different bait type’ and ‘Modify longline configuration’. See also, ‘Deployment of fishing gear and mode of operation - Deploy fishing gear at selected depths to avoid unwanted species’.

Nine studies were in the Atlantic Ocean (Portugal, South Africa, USA, Brazil, Portugal, Iceland), six studies were in Pacific Ocean (New Zealand, Japan, Costa Rica, Hawaii, Fiji) and two studies were in the Mediterranean Sea (Spain, Italy). One study was in each of the Barents Sea (Norway), the Denmark Strait (Greenland), the Coral Sea (Australia) and the Strait of Gibraltar (Spain/Morocco).

Survival (10 studies): Four of seven replicated, controlled studies in the Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean and Coral Sea and two of three worldwide systematic reviews, found that using different hook types in longline or recreational fisheries, including sizes, styles and other modifications to hooks, reduced the incidence of fish hook injuries (associated with higher post-release mortality), and reduced the capture mortality of some species of unwanted sharks and rays and non-target billfish species, compared to conventional hooks or other hook types. The other four studies found that using a different hook type did not reduce the post-release mortality of young sea breams, or the capture mortality of sharks species and non-target fish species, but did reduce the incidence of deep-hooking in some cases.

Reduction of unwanted catch (20 studies): Eight of 16 replicated studies (13 controlled, one randomized) in the Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean, Barents Sea, Mediterranean Sea, Denmark Strait and Coral Sea, found that using a different hook type, including different sizes, styles and hook modifications, reduced the unwanted catch in longline and recreational hook fisheries of non-commercially targeted and targeted fish species, small non-target fish species, overall fish catch, overall discarded bony fish catch but not sharks and rays, undersized haddock, two of three unwanted fish species, non-target sharks and rays and non-target rays and sailfish, compared to standard hooks or hooks of other types. Seven studies found that changing hook type did not reduce the unwanted catch of young or non-target fish species, unwanted sharks and rays, unwanted blue shark, unwanted roughhead grenadier or non-target pelagic stingray and silky shark, compared to standard or other hook types. The other study found that catch rates of young groupers, and non-target fish and shark species varied with hook design, and larger hooks caught fewer non-target fish species overall, but more undersized grouper and sharks compared to other hook types. Four global systematic reviews found that hook style did not affect the unwanted catch of billfish species, sharks and rays or sharks, compared to standard styles.
Improved size-selectivity of fishing gear (3 studies): Two of three replicated studies in the Atlantic Ocean and Strait of Gibraltar, found that increasing hook sizes improved the size-selectivity (by increasing the average catch length) of hottentot and black spot seabream compared to smaller hook sizes. The other study found that a different hook size improved size selectivity for two of five commercially targeted fish species and was also affected by bait size.

Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Avoiding the capture of unwanted fish in longline fisheries or reducing the damage to hooked fish helps reduce fishing mortality and improve survival after release (Amengual-Ramis et al. 2016). Modifying the parts of a longline may make it more difficult for certain species or sizes to approach and consume the baited hooks.
Evidence for similar interventions affecting the capture of fish on hook and line is summarized under ‘Fishing gear modification - Use a different hook type’ and ‘Use a different bait type’. See also, ‘Deployment of fishing gear and mode of operation - Deploy fishing gear at selected depths to avoid unwanted species’.

2700: Use a different bait type
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Some static (non-mobile) fishing gears typically attract fish using bait, as opposed to mobile gears that move through the water column to capture fish, or other static gears that passively allow fish to swim into the gear. The use of bait exploits a species’ natural feeding behaviour to increase the chances of capture, for example by encouraging entry into traps where exit is limited, or by taking bait from hook and line and becoming caught on the hook. Static gear fishing is highly dependent on the feeding ecology of the target species (Løkkeborg et al. 2014) and changing the type or size of bait may influence fishing efficiency and the amount of unwanted species or sizes caught. For example, the size of prey consumed is limited by fish gape size (Mittelbach & Persson 1998), and using larger bait may therefore limit the capture of smaller fish, whilst one type of bait may be less attractive to non-target and unwanted species over another and reduce their capture.
Evidence for similar interventions affecting the capture of fish on hook and line is summarized under ‘Fishing gear modification - Use a different hook type’ and ‘Modify longline configuration’. See also, ‘Deployment of fishing gear and mode of operation - Deploy fishing gear at selected depths to avoid unwanted species’.

2701: Modify gillnet or entangling (trammel/tangle) net configuration
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Gillnets are walls of single netting hung vertically on the seabed or in the water column, in which fish get stuck by their gills. Trammel and tangle nets (also known as entangling nets) are variations of the gillnet, used in a similar way, and may be single, double or three-walled nets in which fish or crustaceans will entangle. All of these types of net are commonly used in commercial fisheries and can be set at any depth on a range of bottom-types (Carol & García-Berthou 2007). They have floats on the upper line and weights on the bottom line and can be set anchored to the bottom or left drifting, free or connected to a vessel. Gillnets are considered as relatively selective fishing gears, in terms of fish species and sizes, but entangling nets will catch a wider variety of fish sizes. To help reduce unwanted catch, modifications to the configuration of gillnets and entangling nets may change how they fish in the water, allowing some fish to avoid capture. The behaviour of individual fish species may also influence how effective the net is at allowing escape.
Evidence for a related intervention is summarized under ‘Fishing gear modification – Use a larger mesh size’.

2702: Modify fishing trap/pot configuration
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Fishing traps are a widespread traditional method for catching fish and crustacean species. They are passive gears, relying on bait or tidal currents to catch the desired species. Traps vary widely in design and are commonly in the form of portable pot- or bottle-shaped cages. However, some fishing nets are also called fish traps (e.g. fyke nets) and consist of much larger fixed or semi-fixed structures involving several sections of staked netting leading to a collecting bag/basket. The type and location of traps depends on the species being targeted. Types that target adult fish and eels (e.g. pound nets or fyke nets) or certain crustacean species like prawns/shrimps, may also catch considerable quantities of immature fish. In certain conditions (e.g. shallow estuaries in summer), trapped immature fish may die before they are released. Fish caught in crustacean traps may also suffer damage and mortality caused by the commercially targeted species. Modifications to traditional trap designs may help to prevent unwanted fish species or sizes from being retained in traps and thus reduce fish mortality.

Key Messages:

Twenty-three studies examined the effects of modifying fishing trap or pot configuration on marine fish populations. Five studies were in the Atlantic Ocean (USA, Brazil, Canary Islands, Canada). Three studies were in each of the Bothnian Sea (Sweden), the Baltic Sea (Poland, Sweden), the Tasman Sea (Australia) and the Indian Ocean (Kenya, South Africa). One study was in each of the Kattegat (Denmark), the Mediterranean Sea (Spain), the Adriatic Sea (Italy), the Southern Ocean (Australia), the Pacific Ocean (Canada) and the Barents Sea (Norway).

Reduction of unwanted catch (20 studies): Sixteen of 20 replicated studies (11 controlled, one randomized, paired and controlled, one randomized and controlled, two paired and controlled and one randomized) and one before-and-after study in the Atlantic Ocean, Baltic Sea, Mediterranean Sea, Southern Ocean, Tasman Sea, Adriatic Sea, Bothnian Sea, Indian Ocean, Pacific Ocean, the Kattegat and the Barents Sea, found that modifications to trap configuration (various, including using a different trap type, increased mesh size and fitting an escape device) reduced the unwanted (undersized, discarded or non-commercial target) catches of fish (overall, or all of multiple study species), brown trout, black sea bass, herring, bluethroat wrasse and leatherjacket, cod, protected rockfishes, whitefish, black sea bass, American eel and winter flounder, sharks/rays and of salmon and rainbow trout in one of two cases, compared to unmodified conventional traps or traps of other designs. One of these also found that the number of unwanted species (fish and invertebrates) was lower in modified traps. Three other studies, found that trap modification or type had no effect on unwanted catches of white croaker, non-commercial fish or undersized Atlantic cod, and non-target haddock catches were increased. However, one of these also reported that traps (creels) did not catch high proportions of immature fish, unlike bottom trawls.
Improved size-selectivity of fishing gear (4 studies): Three of four replicated studies (two controlled and one randomized, paired and controlled) in the Baltic Sea, Tasman Sea, Indian Ocean and Atlantic Ocean found that traps or pots modified with a square mesh escape window or larger mesh sizes improved the size-selectivity of Atlantic cod, black sea bass and most fish species compared to smaller mesh and/or standard gear. The other found that increasing mesh size of a trap escape panel had no effect on size-selectivity of panga.

2703: Fit escape devices (panels/grids) to encircling nets
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Encircling fishing gears consist of most types of seine nets and also encircling gillnets or ring nets. They can be deployed by hand from the shore or by boat, or by powered gear on larger vessels. Encircling gears can have very large nets, or sweep the entire water column in shallow areas, meaning that large numbers of unwanted species can be caught as well as those being fished for. Species that are not commercially valuable are often discarded or thrown back dead, resulting in unnecessary mortality (Bellido et al. 2011, Feekings et al. 2012). The use of fish escape devices in encircling nets similar to those used in trawls, such as mesh windows/panels and size-sorting grids, may allow unwanted fish of certain sizes or species to escape from the nets as they are hauled in.

2704: Modify the design or configuration of trawl gear (mixed measures)
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Fishing using trawls involves towing trawl gear either through the water column or along the seabed, behind one or more fishing vessels. There are many different types of trawl gear and they vary according to the species being targeted and the characteristics of the fished area. However, in general they consist of the main trawl net – made from one or more panels of netting – held open by either a metal beam (beam trawl) or solid doors (e.g. otter boards), attached to the trawl net by long wires (“sweeps” and “bridles”). Trawls often have floats attached to the rope at the top of the net opening (“headrope”) to help keep the net open while fishing and, in the case of bottom trawls, solid discs (“bobbins” or “rockhoppers”) along the rope at the bottom (footrope) to reduce the likelihood of the net getting caught or damaged on the seabed (Grieve et al. 2014). Some trawl gear may be towed as a single, double, or even triple-net configuration. Individual trawl components can be adjusted or modified to improve efficiency and catch rates of commercially targeted species. However, modifications may also reduce the catches of unwanted fish species or sizes. The evidence summarized here covers a range of potential modifications to the configuration of trawl gear or one or more of its many components (e.g. netting length, panel dimensions, footrope and bridle configurations), however, it does not include other potential modifications to the trawl net that deal specifically with reducing unwanted catch and improving size-selectivity (e.g. mesh configuration and unwanted catch reduction devices).

One of these also found increased catch rate of one commercial species and for another two species the effect varied with fish size. Two studies found that modified trawl gear reduced the unwanted catch of only a small proportion of the number of individual fish species caught compared to other trawl configurations, and also that unwanted fish catches varied between day/night. One study found that different trawl configurations had mixed effects on the numbers and sizes of non-target fish catch. The other study found no reduction in catches of discarded finfish between a modified and standard trawl codend.
Improved size-selectivity of fishing gear (5 studies): Five replicated, controlled studies in the North Sea and Mediterranean Sea found that various modifications to trawl gear, including changes to the length of the extension piece, the codend strengthening bag, the method of weaving, the number of codend layers and overall design improved the size-selectivity for unwanted (non-target/discarded) fish species or sizes, and annular seabream in one of two cases, compared to unmodified standard trawl gear or other design configurations.

Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Trawling is a method of fishing that involves pulling a fishing net (trawl) through the water behind one or more vessels. Fish entering the net will either be retained by it or may escape through the gaps in the mesh of the trawl netting during fishing. Many factors can influence the likelihood of a fish being caught or escaping from a trawl (termed selectivity or efficiency) including species, size of fish, time of day, and trawl configuration. One factor that may affect selectivity is gear size. Fish behaviour can differ on encountering different trawl nets (Krag et al. 2014) and changing the size of trawl gear alters the overall dimensions (such as the width and height at the trawl mouth) and can subsequently affect the numbers of fish able to avoid it. Fish have been observed to actively escape trawl nets by accelerated swimming in bursts or changing direction, or, more commonly, escaping in response to contact with the net (Jones et al. 2008).

Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Trawling is a method of fishing that involves pulling a fishing net (trawl/seine) through the water behind one or more vessels. In many fisheries, particularly edible crustacean fisheries (e.g. prawns), trawls often retain unwanted small non-target or non-commercial fish species. Behavioural differences between species can be exploited to reduce the amount of unwanted catch retained in a trawl net. In trawl nets with a smaller circumference, the lateral openings of the netting mesh are larger than in larger circumference trawls, which allows more fish to pass through the netting (Armstrong et al. 1990). This may be due to different hydrodynamic pressures in the codend, which may stimulate a behavioural response in fish and contribute to their escape, which may not occur in crustaceans and other groups of species (Broadhurst & Kennelly 1996).

Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Trawling is a method of fishing that involves pulling a fishing net (trawl) through the water behind one or more vessels. Trawl doors are large wooden boards or metal plates (otter boards) attached to the mouth of the trawl net by “bridles” and keep the mouth of the trawl net open as it is pulled through the water. As they are towed through the water, trawl doors and the attached bridle system cause physical damage to the seabed and herd fish into the path of the trawl (Dickson 1993). The design of trawl doors can be modified, for instance by using smaller otter boards, mounting otter boards on a sled, or changing the angle of towing attack, to reduce sediment penetration. Reducing physical contact with the seabed, and therefore sediment penetration, may reduce the herding effect of the doors and bridles and the amount of unwanted fish that move into the path of the trawl gear.

2708: Modify a bottom trawl to raise parts of the gear off the seabed during fishing
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
 
Trawling involves towing a trawl net through the water by one or more fishing vessels. Bottom trawl nets consist of various components, some of which are in physical contact with the seabed during fishing. These gear components can contribute to the catching process by forcing species to swim off the seabed and herding them into the net. The footrope, for example, consists of a rope or wire across the lower edge of the trawl mouth that creates weight to keep the trawl net on or near the seabed. The configuration of the footrope varies between trawls and is different between different seabed habitats and target species. Different footrope designs affect the catch composition (Hannah et al. 2003) and the extent to which the gear is in contact with the seabed and hence the amount of physical disturbance (Jones 1992). The trawl bridles are lines that attach the trawl to the otter boards, which keep the trawl net open during towing and also contribute to herding fish into the net. Raising such parts of the gear off the seabed, for example with floats, may therefore reduce seabed bottom contact and the amount of unwanted catch. Behavioural information may also be used to avoid catching certain species. For example, Krag et al. (2010) demonstrated how unwanted cod may escape beneath a trawl with its fishing line raised 60 cm above the seabed while targeted haddock are retained.

2709: Modify design or arrangement of tickler chains/chain mats in a bottom trawl
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Trawl nets are towed through the water by fishing vessels. Some types of bottom trawl, particularly beam trawls, are rigged with ‘tickler’ chains or a chain mat, that spread from one side of the trawl mouth to the other, contacting the seabed. Tickler chains and chain mats physically disturb the seabed to increase the likelihood of animals entering the mouth of the trawl. However, they often cause unwanted species to enter the trawl as well as those targeted commercially. Modifying tickler chain arrangement (such as reducing the size of chain links, or attaching only one end of the chain to the beam; Bergman & Van Santbrink 2000; Broadhurst et al. 2015), or even removing them altogether, may reduce the seabed disturbance and therefore result in fewer unwanted fish species/sizes being retained by the gear.

Reduction of unwanted catch (2 studies): One of two replicated, paired, controlled studies in the North Sea and Atlantic Ocean found that removing the tickler chain from a trawl reduced catches of non-commercial target skates/rays and sharks, and individuals were larger, compared to trawling with the chain. The study also found that catches of commercial target species were typically unaffected. The other study found that two modified tickler chain arrangements did not reduce discarded fish catch compared to a standard arrangement.

2710: Use a different twine type in a trawl net
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Although many commercial fishers must abide to set rules around the size of mesh they can use in their trawls, altering the thickness of mesh twine can impact the effectiveness of the mesh size. A thin twine allows the mesh to be more flexible which might help more fish smaller than the mesh opening to escape when forcing themselves against the trawl (Lowry & Robertson 1996) but the thinner twine might be weaker against heavy catch loads. A thick twine creates a more rigid, strong mesh (Lowry & Robertson 1996). It is believed that this thicker twine could present a greater visual barrier to fish which might discourage them from escape attempts.
Evidence for similar interventions is summarized under ‘Fishing gear modification - Modify the design or configuration of trawl gear (mixed measures)’. See also, ‘Use a larger mesh size’.

2711: Use a separator trawl
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Capture of fish in trawls depends on the behavioural reaction of fish to the presence of the net. When a trawl approaches, fish turn and swim in the same direction as the net until exhausted, at which point they enter the net, albeit at different vertical positions. Some species (e.g. haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus, whiting Merlangius merlangus) swim high in the net and others (e.g. cod Gadus morhua, flatfish) stay low in the trawl. In separator trawls, a horizontal net panel is fitted into the trawl net that splits the trawl into upper and lower sections and into separate upper and lower codends. Catch is then separated into each codend, which can be made of different mesh sizes to allow more or less of the catch in each to be retained. For example, in mixed flatfish and haddock fisheries, separator trawls with larger mesh upper codends may allow less unwanted cod to be caught whilst retaining target catches (Ferro et al. 2007).
Evidence for similar interventions describing the effects of using modified trawl types to reduce unwanted catch is summarized under ‘Fishing gear modification - Use a topless (coverless) trawl’ and ‘Use an electric (pulse) trawl’.

Trawls may capture significant numbers of unwanted species when they are towed through the water.

2713: Use an electric (pulse) trawl
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Pulse-equipped trawls are mainly beam trawls targeting flatfish (sole/plaice), but also shrimps. The tickler chains are replaced by electrodes that give off short electrical pulses, stunning the fish and raising them off the bottom and making them easier to catch (Polet et al. 2005). It is a highly controversial method and is prohibited in the USA, China and several other countries. It is also technically illegal in EU waters. However, an exception to the rules allows countries to catch up to 5% of their annual fishing quota in the North Sea using "innovative methods" for research, and the use of pulse trawls predominantly occurs here. The Netherlands is the biggest user of this method and in 2018, there were around 80 trawlers holding permits issued by the Dutch government. Despite attempts to ban it altogether, pulse fishing is still ‘allowed’ in EU waters until mid-2021. Many fishers and opposers to the method believe it harms the fish it is designed to catch and kills other marine life (Polet et al. 2005). However, there is evidence that suggests pulse-equipped trawls catch less unwanted marine life, including unwanted fish, than other trawlers (ICES 2020, Polet et al. 2005) and cause less damage to the sea floor (ICES 2020). Furthermore, the body of research assessing the effects of pulse trawling has recently been extended (see references in ICES 2020) and is therefore not within the scope of the current synopsis.

2714: Use a square mesh instead of a diamond mesh codend in a trawl net
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Commercial fishing trawlers conventionally use a net constructed of diamond shaped mesh due to its ability to capture and retain a wide range of sizes and species (Sala et al. 2008). However, many of the fish species or individuals are often small, immature, or unmarketable, and will not yet have had the chance to spawn and even if returned to the sea, might not survive (Sala et al. 2008). It is difficult for many fish to escape from diamond mesh trawl codends because the mesh openings close under tension during fishing deployments (Isaksen & Valdemarsen (1986). Square shaped mesh however, retains its shape better under strain and maintains a larger size of the gaps in the meshes, potentially allowing greater escape opportunities for smaller fish and invertebrates (Robertson & Stewart, 1986). Square mesh trawl codends instead of diamond mesh codends may therefore increase the escape of small fish from trawl nets and reduce fishing mortality.
Evidence for a similar intervention applied to trawl nets only is summarized under ‘Fishing gear modification – ‘Rotate the orientation of diamond mesh in a trawl net’. For interventions describing the effects of different mesh types in fishing gear more generally, but including trawl nets, see ‘Fishing gear modification - Use a larger mesh size’. Evidence of this intervention when used in combination with other interventions to reduce unwanted catch in trawl nets is summarized under ‘Fishing gear modification - Fit mesh escape panels/windows to a trawl net and use square mesh instead of diamond mesh codend’ and ‘Fit a size-sorting escape grid (rigid or flexible) to trawl nets and use a square mesh instead of a diamond mesh codend’.

Reduction of unwanted catch (16 studies): Ten of 16 replicated, controlled studies (including five paired, three randomized and three randomized and paired) in the Greenland Sea, Aegean Sea, Atlantic Ocean, Tasman Sea, Pacific Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, English Channel, Bristol Channel and Coral Sea, found that square mesh codends reduced the unwanted (non-target or non-marketable/discarded) catches of all fish species monitored, young individuals of half or most commercially targeted fish, total unwanted catch (fish and invertebrates), and discarded fish in deeper but not shallower fishing areas, compared to diamond mesh codends; and two of those studies also found that there was a variable effect on unwanted catch between individual fish species/groups. Four studies found no reduction in catches of unwanted small rockfish and flatfish, three of four commercially important bottom fish species, total unwanted catch (fish and invertebrates), or the total number of unwanted species (fish and invertebrates), compared to diamond mesh codends. One study found that square mesh codends retained more fish overall than diamond mesh but varied for individual species by fish shape and size. One study found that unwanted fish catch depended on codend mesh size as well as configuration (square or diamond). Two of the studies, where square mesh codends had no or a varied effect, also found that size selectivity increased with increases in mesh size for both square and diamond mesh codends.
Improved size-selectivity of fishing gear (14 studies): Six of 14 replicated, controlled studies (including three paired, one randomized and one randomized and paired) in the Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, Adriatic Sea, Aegean Sea, English Channel, Pacific Ocean, Tasman Sea and the Kattegat and Skagerrak, found that using a square mesh codend in a trawl net (bottom and pelagic) improved size selectivity for silver hake, horse mackerel, European hake, axillary seabream, poor cod, greater forkbeard, blue whiting, discarded fish and three of four commercially targeted fish, compared to diamond mesh codends. Five studies found no difference in size selectivity between square and diamond mesh codends for Atlantic mackerel, long rough dab, yellowtail scad and striped seapike, rockfish and flatfish, and three of four commercially important bottom fish species. The other three studies found that the effect of square mesh instead of diamond mesh codends varied with fish body shape (round or flat), and for three of three and five of five roundfish species size selectivity was improved, but not for one flatfish. Two of the studies, where square mesh codends had either no or a varied effect, also found that size selectivity increased with increases in mesh size for both square and diamond mesh codends.

2715: Rotate the orientation of diamond mesh in a trawl net
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Trawl fisheries are a common type of fishing practice around the world. The codend of a trawl net is designed to retain fish and often leads to large numbers of unwanted fish being caught. This can be reduced by modifying the codend design to increase the size selectivity of the gear. One way this might be done is to change the orientation of the meshes of the net. Standard trawl codends are constructed from diamond shaped meshes. During deployment the diamond meshes close under tension and the size of the opening through which fish can escape is drastically reduced. Rotating or turning the orientation of diamond mesh involves the knots of the meshes being tied in such a way that the mesh is turned through 90 degrees to the water flow (often referred to as T90 mesh). This results in the meshes being held more open under tension and maintains a larger gap through which fish can escape. This may in turn help to reduce the catches of unwanted smaller fish.
Note: Rotated, or T90, diamond mesh is not to be confused with nets made of square mesh, which consist of diamond mesh turned through 45 degrees to the water flow to create a square shape ensuring the meshes remain almost fully open (see ‘Fishing gear modification – ‘Use a square mesh instead of a diamond mesh codend in a trawl net’.).
Evidence for a similar intervention applied to trawl nets only is summarized under ‘Fishing gear modification – ‘Use a square mesh instead of a diamond mesh codend in a trawl net’. For interventions describing the effects of different mesh types in fishing gear more generally, but including trawl nets, see ‘Fishing gear modification - Use a larger mesh size’.

2716: Fit mesh escape panels/windows to a trawl net
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Escape windows in trawl nets are sections or panels of netting with a mesh size and/or mesh shape (diamond or square) different to the rest of the codend or extension piece and are designed to provide an additional escape opportunity for fish. Factors that may affect the species and/or sizes of fish that are able to successfully escape through the meshes include: whether they are square- or diamond-shaped, mesh size, where they are placed in the trawl net (top or bottom, near or further away from the codend), the number of windows/panels and the behaviour of the fish. For example, top square mesh escape windows/panels have been used extensively in commercial prawn trawl fisheries to try and allow non-target fish to escape while retaining the target prawn/shrimp catch. Mesh escape windows/panels in trawl nets should thus reduce the amount of unwanted (non-target and/or non-marketable species) fish captured and allow the release of smaller individuals.
Evidence for a related intervention is summarized under ‘Fishing gear modification - Modify the configuration of a mesh escape panel/window in a trawl net’. Evidence of this intervention when used in combination with other interventions to reduce unwanted catch in trawl nets is summarized under ‘Fishing gear modification - Fit mesh escape panels/windows to a trawl net and use square mesh instead of diamond mesh codend’ and ‘Fit mesh escape panels/windows and a size-sorting grid (rigid or flexible) to a trawl net’.

The other five studies and a review study of mesh escape panel/window use in the Kattegat and Skagerrak, found that square mesh panels/windows did not reduce the unwanted catches of fish, Atlantic cod and three of three commercial bottom fish species, compared to diamond mesh nets without panels/windows. Four of five replicated, controlled studies (including three paired) in the North Sea, Northeast Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Maine, found that large diamond mesh escape panels in diamond mesh trawl nets (beam and bottom) reduced unwanted catches of cod, whiting and haddock, and discarded catch (fish and invertebrates), but not of whiting in one study, compared to nets without large diamond mesh panels, and the effect varied with panel design and vessel size. The other study found that the unwanted catches of only one of seven species/groups of non-target fish was reduced by a large diamond mesh panel. Two replicated, paired, controlled studies in the North Sea and Baltic Sea found that new or different configurations of square mesh panels/windows in diamond mesh trawl nets reduced unwanted fish and cod catches, compared to existing/standard panels or windows. One replicated, paired, controlled study in the Gulf of Carpentaria found that diamond mesh trawl nets with either a top square mesh escape panel or a large supported opening ('Bigeye') reduced unwanted shark, but not ray and sawfish catches compared to standard trawl nets. One before-and-after study in the Bay of Biscay found that supplementing a top square mesh escape window in a prawn trawl net with either a bottom window, a flexible escape grid or an increased mesh size diamond codend, did not reduce the unwanted hake catch

The other two studies found no effect on the size selectivity of undersized fish, haddock, saithe or Atlantic cod, compared to standard trawl nets. One review study of gear size selectivity in the northeast Atlantic Ocean found that the effect of fitting square mesh panels to trawl nets on haddock selectivity varied with panel mesh size, position, and time of year. One replicated, controlled study in the Norwegian Sea found no difference in the size selectivity of cod and haddock between diamond mesh trawl nets fitted with either square mesh escape windows, rigid size-sorting escape grids or a large diamond mesh codend.

2717: Modify the configuration of a mesh escape panel/window in a trawl net
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Most types of commercial fishing gear catch unwanted fish that are unable to escape before being brought to the surface. To minimise this, escape panels can be fitted to some types of fishing gear, usually traps and trawl nets. Trawling is a method of fishing that involves pulling a fishing net (trawl) through the water behind one or more vessels. Fish entering the net will either be retained by it or may escape through the gaps in the mesh of the trawl netting during fishing. Some trawls are fitted with escape panels to allow small fish to escape from the net and avoid being caught. These panels often have square mesh and tend to have larger mesh than the rest of the trawl net. Escape panels need to be positioned correctly, and the positioning depends on which species they are targeting (Suuronen 2005). The mesh size of escape panels, and size of the panel itself, can affect the size, and therefore quantity, of fish that can escape through it.
Evidence for the related intervention is summarized under ‘Fishing gear modification - Fit mesh escape panels/windows to a trawl net’.

2718: Use netting of contrasting colour in a trawl net
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Trawling is a method of fishing that involves pulling a fishing net (trawl) through the water behind one or more vessels. Fish entering the net will either be retained by it or may escape through escape panels, if fitted, or the gaps in the mesh of the trawl netting. Many factors can influence the likelihood of a fish being caught or escaping from a trawl (termed selectivity or efficiency) including species, size of fish, time of day, and trawl configuration. Changing the colour of parts of a trawl net to alter the visibility and contrast of the net to fish could potentially manipulate fish behaviour and likelihood of escape.

2719: Fit rigid (as opposed to mesh) escape panels/windows to a trawl net
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Modifying fishing trawl nets is a common practice to improve selectivity, helping fishers to catch only the species and sizes they are commercially targeting. How trawl nets are modified depends largely on the sizes/shapes of the unwanted species and also behavioural characteristics. For example, the avoidance response of some species to trawl gear is to swim upwards, while some may attempt to flee in other directions. The use of panels or windows of modified netting (different orientation and/or mesh size) in trawl net codends has been assessed as one means to allow the escape of unwanted fish (see ‘Fishing gear modification – Fit mesh escape panels/windows to a trawl net’). Rigid escape windows are intended to work on the same principle as mesh escape windows but are specifically designed to enable the potential escape of flatfish species. Unlike mesh windows, rigid escape windows are made of steel and have a grid-like construction that creates well defined rectangular escape openings. They are located with the aim that unwanted flatfish (plus small or undersized roundfish species) can pass through the window in a natural swimming orientation and escape.

2720: Fit a size-sorting escape grid (rigid or flexible) to a fish trawl net
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Escape grids are frames of metal, plastics or mesh that are inserted in or near the codend of trawl nets to try and prevent unwanted species or sizes of catch from entering the codend. They are size selection mechanisms, with the sizes at which individuals are sorted dependent on the type of grid and the spacing between the bars of the grid. In some types of grid such as those used in multi-species fish trawls, the aim is to allow smaller fish to escape through the grid and keep the larger marketable sizes of fish. However, in some industrial trawl fisheries (such as for Norway pout), the grid has an opposite purpose of aiming to sort out large fish from the smaller-sized target fish catch. Behaviour of individual fish species may also influence how effective the grid is at allowing escape.
When the fitting of size-sorting escape grids is implemented in prawn/shrimp trawl nets, the evidence has been summarized under ‘Fishing gear modification - Fit a size-sorting escape grid (rigid or flexible) to a prawn/shrimp trawl net’. Evidence for interventions related to the use of different types or configurations of grids in trawls is summarized under ‘Fishing gear modification – Use a different design or configuration of size-sorting escape grid/system in trawl fishing gear (bottom and mid-water)’.

Reduction of unwanted catch (14 studies): Eleven of 14 replicated studies (three paired and controlled) in the North Sea, North Atlantic Ocean, Barents Sea, South Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, Adriatic Sea, Gulf of Maine and Baltic Sea found that fitting size-sorting escape grids of various types and configurations to fish trawl nets reduced the catches of unwanted small mackerel, small monkfish, non-target whiting and haddock, small hake, unwanted spiny dogfish, non-target herring, prohibited halibut, unwanted sizes of cod and other non-target fish, relative to the retained codend catch or compared to trawls without grids. One study found that fitting size-sorting escape grids of three designs to fish trawl nets reduced the discarded catch of nine of 12 fish species and the overall amount of discarded catch (fish and invertebrates combined), relative to the retained codend catch. One study found that fitting size-sorting escape grids had a mixed effect on the reduction of unwanted and/or undersized fish catch relative to the retained codend catch depending on fish ecological group. The other study found that, compared to standard trawl nets without escape grids, trawls with size-sorting escape grids reduced the overall catch of whiting, but not of undersized whiting.
Improved size-selection of fishing gear (3 studies): Two of three replicated studies (two paired and controlled and one controlled) in the North Sea and Norwegian Sea, found that a size-sorting escape grid fitted to trawl nets improved the size-selection of haddock, but not saithe or cod, compared to standard nets without grids. One study found that trawl nets fitted with an escape grid did not improve the size-selection of cod and haddock compared to trawl nets fitted with square mesh escape windows.

2721: Fit a size-sorting escape grid (rigid or flexible) to a prawn/shrimp trawl net
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Commercial shrimp or prawn trawl nets are made of small mesh codends that retain the smaller sized crustacean species. But this results in large amounts of other marine animals, like fish, also being caught. The unwanted catch of fish and other large marine animals in shrimp/prawn fisheries has long been considered unacceptable and ways to reduce it have been developed since at least the 1970s (Jenkins 2012). One way is a specialized grid (‘bycatch reduction device’ or ‘turtle excluder device’) to exclude fish from the net whilst not losing the commercial catch of shrimps or prawns. The grid is installed in a net at an angle in front of the codend and has an escape opening for fish and other marine animals either at the top or bottom. Grids can be made from metal, plastics or mesh netting and have either vertical or horizontal bars. Grids are designed to work by creating a barrier to fish that are too large to pass through the spaces between the bars and instead they pass out of the trawl net through the escape openings. Grids may also feature guiding panels or other mechanisms to further encourage fish escape and reduce the overall amount of unwanted fish catch.
When the fitting of size-sorting escape grids is implemented in trawl nets targeting fish, the evidence has been summarized under ‘Fishing gear modification - Fit a size-sorting escape grid (rigid or flexible) to a fish trawl net’. Evidence for interventions related to the use of different types or configurations of grids in trawls is summarized under ‘Fishing gear modification – Use a different design or configuration of size-sorting escape grid/system in trawl fishing gear (bottom and mid-water)’.

Reduction of unwanted catch (30 studies): Seven of seven replicated studies (including one controlled) in the northeast Atlantic Ocean, North Sea, North Atlantic Ocean, Greenland Sea, Gulf of Thailand, Tyrrhenian Sea and the Skagerrak and Kattegat found that fitting rigid or flexible size-sorting escape grids, of various types and configurations, to prawn/shrimp trawl nets reduced unwanted fish catches (non-commercial species and discarded commercial species/sizes) by allowing the escape of unwanted sharks and the other fish species monitored. Two of two before-and-after studies in the Gulf of Maine and Pacific Ocean found that after the introduction of size-sorting escape grids to trawl nets in fisheries for shrimp, the capture of non-target and unwanted fish was reduced compared to before grids were used. Eleven of 20 replicated studies (including one controlled and 19 paired and controlled) in the Tasman Sea, Coral Sea, Gulf of Carpentaria, North Sea, Indian Ocean, Bay of Biscay, Skagerrak and Kattegat, Pacific Ocean, South Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of St Vincent and Persian Gulf found that prawn/shrimp trawls with size-sorting escape grids, of various types and configurations, had lower catches of all or all but one undersized or otherwise unwanted fish and shark/ray species monitored, and unwanted total catch (fish and invertebrates), compared to trawl nets without escape grids. Two found that escape grids reduced non-target catches of most sizes of whiting and plaice and larger sizes of total fish, but increased the retention of small cod and haddock. Three studies found a variable effect of fitting escape grids to shrimp/prawn trawl nets on unwanted fish catch compared to nets with no grids, and the effect varied with year, site and grid type. Three found that grids had no effect on the reduction of unwanted fish and catches were similar for all or most of the unwanted non-commercial and commercial fish species/groups and for the total unwanted catch (fish and invertebrates). The other study found that fewer unwanted fish of 10 of 11 species/groups were retained in a shrimp/prawn trawl net with an escape grid used in combination with a diamond mesh codend with the mesh orientation turned by 90°, compared to a conventional diamond mesh net with no grid. One replicated, randomized study in the North Atlantic Ocean found that the reduction in catch of unwanted sharks depended on the type of escape grid and shrimp/prawn trawl net used.

2722: Fit a size-sorting mesh funnel (a sieve net) to a prawn/shrimp trawl net
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Trawling is considered a non-selective method of fishing as large proportions of fish that enter the gear may be retained in the net. To help reduce the capture of unwanted fish, a sieve net (a “bycatch reduction device”) can be used to help sort the catch into different species or sizes and allow the escape of some. A sieve net is attached to the full circumference of prawn or shrimp trawl nets and tapers to an apex near the trawl’s codend. An exit opening is made where the sieve net and codend join, allowing fish and other larger animals to pass through the sieve and escape, whereas the shrimp pass through the sieve and into the codend (Revill & Holst, 2004). Mesh sieve or sorting panels work in a similar manner, intending to separate unwanted species from prawn catches by mechanical and behavioural means (Santos et al. 2018).
Evidence for a similar intervention relating to prawn/shrimp trawl nets is summarized under ‘Fishing gear modification - Fit a size-sorting escape grid (rigid or flexible) to a prawn/shrimp trawl net’.

2723: Fit large, supported escape openings (such as Fisheyes, Bigeyes and radial escape sections) to trawl nets
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Large, supported openings in trawl nets are catch reduction devices consisting of a large slit or hole, held open by floats and weights (e.g. Bigeye) or by supporting frames (e.g. Fisheye). They are typically used in prawn/shrimp trawls with the aim of allowing unwanted fish catch to escape while retaining the target crustacean species. Unlike other escape devices used in prawn/shrimp trawls such as size-sorting grids, these devices work by exploiting the behaviour of fish that are able to swim back and escape through the exit openings. Here, we also include radial escape sections that consist of a section of multiple large rigid openings running around the circumference of the net, because they too enable fish that can swim forward away from the codend to escape through the openings, unlike the prawns/shrimps. Use of large, supported openings in trawls potentially facilitate the escape of unwanted fish, including immature small fish, from the codend. They may also be used in addition to size-sorting escape grids to further increase the overall selectivity of the trawl net by providing another area for fish escape.
Evidence of the effect of this intervention when used in combination with another intervention to reduce unwanted catch in trawl nets is summarized under ‘Fishing gear modification - Fit a size-sorting escape grid (rigid or flexible) and large, supported escape openings to trawl nets’.

2724: Fit mesh escape panels/windows to a trawl net and use square mesh instead of diamond mesh codend
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Mesh escape panels (or windows) in commercial trawl nets are sections of net inserted in the codend or extension piece of a different mesh size and/or orientation (i.e. square) to the rest of the codend. They were developed to provide an area of escape for some fish while retaining target species such as prawns/shrimps that are expected to pass underneath. Square mesh codends provide another area for selection in a trawl net and may allow the escape of smaller fish. Square meshes, as opposed to conventional diamond meshes, are more likely to stay open under tension during trawling and thus create a larger gap through which fish can more easily pass. Thus, the combination of a mesh panel and square mesh codend should allow a larger number and range of individuals to escape from a trawl net than a conventional diamond mesh codend, or one or other of the escape panel or square mesh codend alone. However, likelihood of escape may depend on the species being targeted and the fish assemblages in the area being fished.
The effects of using just mesh panels or just a square mesh codend are summarized under ‘Fishing gear modification - Fit mesh panels/windows to a trawl net’ and ‘Use a square mesh instead of a diamond mesh codend in a trawl net’, respectively. Similar interventions of various combinations of unwanted catch reduction devices, including mesh panels and square mesh codends are summarized under ‘Fishing gear modification’.

Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Escape grids are frames of metal, plastics or mesh inserted in or near the codend of trawl nets to try and prevent unwanted species or sizes of catch from entering the codend. They are size selection mechanisms, the sizes at which individuals are sorted dependent on the type of panels and the mesh size and shape. Behaviour of individual fish species may also influence how effective a grid is at allowing escape; some fish will swim upwards in a net whilst others might swim down or to the sides. The effectiveness of escape panels is therefore likely to be dependent on the behaviour, shape, and size of the unwanted fish. Furthermore, constructing the codend using a square shaped mesh instead of a diamond mesh helps to maintain the net’s structure under strain, allowing a greater chance for fish to escape through the gaps of the mesh. Combining an escape grid with a square mesh codend may further increase the chance of fish escape for a greater range of species or sizes.
The effects of using just a size-sorting escape grid or just a square mesh codend in trawl nets are summarized under ‘Fishing gear modification - Fit a size-sorting escape grid (rigid or flexible) to a fish trawl net’, ‘Fit a size-sorting escape grid (rigid or flexible) to a prawn/shrimp trawl net’ and ‘Use a square mesh instead of a diamond mesh codend in a trawl net’, respectively.

Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Trawling is a method of fishing that involves pulling a fishing net (trawl) through the water behind one or more vessels. Trawl nets may be fitted with devices that aim to enable unwanted catch to escape (“bycatch reduction devices”). A wide variety of different devices have been developed, including size-sorting escape grids and supported openings, each designed to allow specific species or sizes to escape while at the same time minimising losses of marketable catch. Fitting escape grids in combination with a large, supported opening should increase the likelihood of fish escape by providing fish (potentially of different species or sizes) with an additional opportunity to make contact with one or other of the devices.
Evidence for the individual effects of size-sorting escape grids and large, supported escape openings in trawl nets is summarized under ‘Fishing gear modification - Fit a size-sorting escape grid (rigid or flexible) to a fish trawl net’, ‘Fit a size-sorting grid (rigid or flexible) to a prawn/shrimp trawl net’, and ‘Fit large, supported escape openings (such as Fisheyes, Bigeyes and radial escape sections) to trawl nets’.

Trawling is a method of fishing that involves pulling a fishing net (trawl) through the water behind one or more vessels. Trawls may be fitted with devices to allow unwanted catch to escape (often termed “bycatch reduction devices”). A variety of unwanted catch reduction devices have been developed aiming to enable specific sizes or groups of unwanted fish to escape the trawl net. These include rigid or flexible size-sorting or excluder grids, and also large square-, or diamond-mesh panels, fitted into the codend of a trawl net (Sinclair & Valdimarsson 2003). Positioning of both types of devices as well as opening size, mesh size or bar spacing and orientation can affect the type and sizes at which fish can escape.

2728: Use a different design or configuration of size-sorting escape grid/system in trawl fishing gear (bottom and mid-water)
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
In some trawl fisheries, the commercially targeted species are small (e.g. shrimp and prawn fisheries, but also fisheries for mixed fish species) and so the nets have small mesh sizes to help prevent commercial catch from passing through them and escaping. Whilst this might be effective for retaining target catch, unwanted species or sizes of fish are also unable to escape. To minimise the amount of unwanted catch, a grid device (an excluder or size-sorting grid) can be fitted to a trawl net that helps to stop unwanted fish from entering the codend (He & Balzano 2007, Sistiaga et al. 2011). However, the effectiveness of grids in any given fishery may largely depend on the body shape as well as size of the unwanted species and/or their escape behaviour (i.e. whether they tend to swim up or down to avoid the net). Using a different design or configuration of escape grid or system (such as two grids) may help to further reduce unwanted catch by tailoring the modifications to suit specific species or sizes of unwanted fish, for example if having horizontal or vertical grid bars, or two grids instead of one, increase the likelihood of escape.
Evidence for related interventions is summarized under ‘Fishing gear modification – Fit a size-sorting escape grid (rigid or flexible) to a fish trawl net’ and ‘Fit a size-sorting escape grid (rigid or flexible) to a prawn/shrimp trawl net’. Similar interventions of various combinations of unwanted catch reduction devices, including escape grids, are summarized under ‘Fishing gear modification’.

Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Trawl nets, particularly in fisheries targeting small crustaceans such as prawns and shrimps, can also catch large amounts of unwanted small fish. To try and reduce this, various ‘bycatch reduction devices’ have been developed that force or encourage fish to escape through specific areas or sections of the net. Introducing an active stimulus, i.e. moving and/or vibrating parts, inside a net may be a way of encouraging fish to approach and make contact with the trawl netting (and thus increase the likelihood of escape through it), and works by creating either a barrier or vibrations that stimulate fish to swim in a particular direction. They may consist of fluttering sections of netting or rope, or tightly strung wires. Active stimulating devices may be used in addition to other bycatch reduction devices such as square mesh windows or grids, to herd fish towards the escape openings.

2730: Use an alternative commercial fishing method
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Almost all fishing methods catch small or unwanted fish that are thrown back into the sea after capture. There are many different types of fishing gear including trawls, which are towed through the water or over the seabed, traps which are usually baited and left on the seabed for a period of time, lines with baited hooks, and nets which can be left in the water or towed by fishing vessels to encircle schools of fish. Some types of fishing gears are more selective than others (i.e. they are better at only catching the desired species for market) and using an alternative type of fishing gear to catch the same commercially targeted fish could reduce the catches of unwanted fish.
Evidence for a similar intervention is summarized under ‘Alternative harvesting methods - Use hook and line fishing instead of other commercial fishing methods’. See also ‘Fishing gear modification - Use a separator trawl; Use a topless (coverless) trawl’ and ‘Use an electric (pulse) trawl’.

Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Zooplankton (tiny drifting organisms) is a valuable source of protein and is harvested in the wild for use as aquaculture feed and pet fish food (Wiborg 1976). Fishing for zooplankton is done using fine-meshed trawls that results in lots of unwanted organisms being caught, including fish eggs and larvae. To help reduce mortality of unwanted fish eggs and larvae, an alternative method of plankton harvesting using air bubbles may enable selective transport in the water column of the targeted zooplankton such as copepods, up towards the surface (bubble flotation method). These can then be harvested by a plankton trawl leaving the fish eggs and larvae untouched at lower depths.

2732: Use hook and line fishing instead of other commercial fishing methods
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Hook and line fishing involves setting fishing line in the water with baited hooks and is done by hand or using a rod and reel or longlines. In large-scale commercial and offshore fisheries, hook and line fishing usually comprises longline fishing, consisting of a long length of fishing line (up to many kilometres) with multiple branching lines with baited hooks. Longline gear may be set in the water column or on the seabed to target pelagic or demersal species. Hook and line fishing is considered more species- and size-selective than other types of fishing such as trawling (Løkkeborg & Bjordal 1992) and so may capture fewer numbers of non-target species and unwanted smaller fish. In addition, survival of unwanted fish catch may also be higher after capture by hook and line (Sureda et al. 2020) and this method of fishing may have little direct impact on the seabed and fish habitats.
Evidence for a related intervention is summarized under ‘Alternative harvesting methods - Use an alternative commercial fishing method’.

Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Fishing can impact marine fish through species removal or habitat damage from fishing gear contacting the seabed. Removing fish that are carrying/brooding eggs (females or males) or live young (such as many sharks) not only kills the adult but prevents successful spawning or rearing of the young and limits the overall reproductive potential of the population. Releasing fish with eggs or live young may help sustain fish populations and protect the hatching or rearing of young fish.

2735: Set a minimum landing size for commercially fished species
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Fishing can impact marine fish through species removal or habitat damage from fishing gear contacting the seabed. Removal of small fish before they have matured and had an opportunity to reproduce limits the overall reproductive potential of the population and can cause severe depletions. The minimum landing size is the smallest fish measurement (usually total length) at which it is legal to retain a fish and is dependent on species (e.g. size at maturity) and sea region. Setting a minimum size at which fish can be landed may help ensure that fish grow to a size that gives them the opportunity to spawn at least once, thus helping to maintain the population. However, to ensure that discarding of fish below a given minimum size is minimized, the size-selectivity of the fishing gear may also need to be improved to better match the size limit.
For similar interventions, see ‘Protect Reproductive Individuals - Set a maximum landing size for commercially fished species’ and ‘Specify a size range of capture for commercially fished species’.

Key Messages:

Five studies examined the effects of setting a minimum landing size for commercially fished species on marine fish populations. One study was a global review and one study was in each of the Tasman Sea (Australia), the Baltic Sea (Northern Europe), the Ionian Sea (Greece) and the Northwest Atlantic Ocean (USA).

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Reproductive success (2 studies): One global review reported that one of five swordfish fisheries showed an increase in swordfish recruitment after the setting of recommended minimum landing sizes and catch limits, with recruitment in the other fisheries either highly variable or unable to be assessed. One replicated study in the Ionian Sea reported that, despite established minimum sizes, most fish landed in commercial catches were immature, and thus had never spawned.

BEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)
OTHER (3 STUDIES)

Reduction of unwanted catch (3 studies): One of three before-and-after studies (one replicated) in the Atlantic Ocean, Tasman Sea and Baltic Sea found that following an increase in the set minimum landing size and mesh size of gill nets the catches of the youngest southern flounder were reduced. The other two found that increasing the minimum landing size did not reduce the catches of discarded dusky flathead and Atlantic cod3, and discarding of flathead increased in one of three cases.

2736: Set a maximum landing size for commercially fished species
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Fishing can impact marine fish through species removal or habitat damage from fishing gear contacting the seabed. For many fish species the reproductive potential (e.g. the annual numbers of eggs/young produced by the females) increases with size and/or age. Removal of the larger fish from a population thus reduces the overall reproductive potential and may also apply a genetic selection pressure that favours fish that mature at a smaller size that may continue breeding (Borrell 2013). Setting a maximum landing size (i.e. the largest fish measurement – usually total length – at which it is legal to retain a fish) may protect the largest fish with the highest reproductive potential, thus helping to maintain the population.
For similar interventions, see ‘Protect Reproductive Individuals - Set a minimum landing size for commercially fished species’ and ‘Specify a size range of capture for commercially fished species’.

Background information and definitions:
Fishing can impact marine fish through species removal or habitat damage from fishing gear contacting the seabed. Removal of the smaller or larger sizes of fish from a population reduces the overall reproductive potential by killing either the immature fish before they have reached maturity or the larger fish that produce the highest numbers of eggs. Setting specific fish size ranges that allow harvesting of intermediate sizes may help protect the overall reproductive potential by avoiding fishing mortality of the smallest and largest individuals.

Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Marine fisheries throughout the world are often highly regulated and may be subject to many different international or national laws and byelaws. Compliance with these measures is important to protect commercially targeted and non-targeted species and their habitats: non-compliance has been shown to have a negative impact on the biomass of targeted species in no-take marine reserves (Bergseth et al. 2013). One way to enforce compliance is to deploy dedicated fisheries patrol boats. Fisheries enforcement patrols have the powers to board vessels to inspect for non-compliance and any illegal activity and heavy financial penalties can be issued. These may act as deterrents to fishers and help prevent attempts at illegal fishing altogether. The fish resource and habitats may thus be sustained or conserved by ensuring that the aims of management regulations have the best chance of being met.

Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Marine fisheries throughout the world are often highly regulated and may be subject to many different international or national laws and byelaws. Some however may have no regulation and fishing activity takes place unchecked with unknown consequences to marine fish populations. In response to increased illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing activity towards the end of the 20th century, ways to regulate and monitor fishing vessel activity were established (Dunn et al. 2015). These included catch documentation schemes and international surveillance networks. More recently, electronic vessel monitoring systems, such as satellite, drones or even drifting fish attraction devices (Toonen & Bush 2020) have been developed to track fishing activity. As well as being able to help detect and subsequently prevent illegal fishing activity, monitoring systems may also provide unbiased information on the patterns of fisheries activity on annual and seasonal scales. Such data can be used to inform fisheries management plans to help enhance conservation and biodiversity objectives.

2740: Use human observers onboard fishing vessels to monitor catches and discards
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Marine fisheries throughout the world are often managed by a series of technical or spatial measures that aim to ensure the sustainable harvest of an important food resource whilst conserving and enhancing the marine environment. The success of such management plans relies on compliance with the regulations as well as accurate information on commercial and non-target catches and fishing effort, as well as discards and the operational characteristics of fisheries. One way to encourage compliance and at the same time provide useful unbiased data may be to use trained scientific observers onboard commercial vessels to record the details of catches and fishing deployments. Onboard human observation can document and interpret many at-sea activities that other monitoring systems are unable to provide, for example, catch composition, discarding activity, bycatch handling and determining bycatch condition and fate on release (Ewell et al. 2020). This may ultimately help ensure better compliance and management of the fisheries and improved protection of fish habitats.

Background information and definitions:
Marine fisheries throughout the world are often highly regulated and may be subject to many different international or national laws and byelaws that control what can be caught, where and how much. However, regulations also extend to the landing and recording of catches at ports. Port fisheries controls include limiting the numbers of ports where commercial fishers can land sensitive species or large volumes of fish (sometimes termed as “designated ports”) making it easier to control and accurately record such catches and landings. Other port controls include monitoring licensed vessels and their landings for undersized or illegal fish, and authorisation of documentation to verify or validate landings for ongoing sale or export. Effective enforcement of port controls may act as a deterrent to prevent illegal fishing by making it more difficult to land and sell illegal fish thus helping to protect fish populations from the threat of overexploitation.

2768: Use flags to signal the legal nationality of a fishing vessel
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
When a fishing vessel is registered, it means that the vessel has the nationality of the country and can fly the flag of that country. This is called the law of the flag. The registered country is often referred to as the flag state and as such has exclusive legal jurisdiction over its vessels in international waters. Vessels can be without nationality, (often called stateless, flagless, or unregistered vessels) but they undermine the law of the flag regime because no state can exercise control over them. Being able to openly identify the registered state or nationality of vessels that, for instance, are suspected to be engaging in illegal fishing activity or otherwise contributing to overexploitation, may help to prevent these activities by allowing the flag state or other states to take enforcement action to deal with the threat.

2769: Eliminate flags of convenience
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Fishing vessel owners are required to register or licence their vessel in a country and it is subsequently deemed the nationality of the vessel, falling under the laws and jurisdiction of that country. This is called its “flag state” (see ‘Enforcement and Compliance to Reduce Illegal Fishing - Use flags to signal the legal nationality of a fishing vessel’). A flag of convenience is a business practice whereby a vessel is registered in a country other than that of the vessel’s owner. Adopting a flag of convenience can make it easier to engage in illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing activity (Gianni & Simpson 2005). Elimination of flags of convenience may thus help prevent illegal fishing and protect fish populations and marine environments from the threat of over exploitation.
Evidence for a related intervention describing the use of the flag on marine vessels is summarized under ‘Enforcement and Compliance to Reduce Illegal Fishing - Use flags to signal the legal nationality of a fishing vessel’.

Across the globe fish stocks are at risk of collapsing due to overexploitation and a factor that contributes to the problem is illegal fishing. Using methods to trace the source of catches should provide the transparency and openness required to confirm and validate legal fish catches. This may deter or prevent illegal fishing if fishers know they may be caught if they try to land illegally caught fish. One such method is DNA testing that can differentiate fish populations of the same species from where they were caught. That means telling, for instance, the difference between Atlantic cod captured legally in the Eastern Baltic and cod caught illegally in the North Sea. Or it can mean identifying prohibited or endangered species such as sharks (Feitosa et al. 2018).

Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
One of the core aims of any management plan to sustainably harvest the marine fish resource is to only remove specific sizes or species, thereby minimizing unwanted catch and mortality. This can partly be achieved by making fishing gear as selective as possible. Fishers have knowledge and information about the marine environment that may be invaluable in informing the design and potential uptake of new fishing gear. Fishers are unlikely to use new gear that is impractical to handle and deploy or that causes large losses of their commercial target catch. Involving fishers in the process may not only help encourage development of more selective fishing gears, but it may ensure more successful uptake if the potential solutions have fisher buy-in and approval (Eliasen et al. 2019; Feekings et al. 2019).

Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Engagement and agreement of stakeholders and fishers in scientific research and data collection is believed to be essential for shared problem solving and ultimately for any management plan to succeed (Mackinson et al. 2011). Engaging fishers to collect scientific data may improve the coverage of data and help give fishers a better understanding of the information underpinning management plans. This in turn may improve compliance and buy-in to proposals and help reduce the impacts of fishing.

Fishers commonly share information through social relationships, and this may lead to increased fishing success (Turner et al. 2014). However, knowledge exchange between fishers could also be used as a tool to help promote sustainable practices, particularly if the central fishers in information-sharing networks can be identified and co-opted to assist managers in the spreading of conservation information (Mbaru & Barnes 2017).

2910: Involve fishers and stakeholders in co-management
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Co-management can be defined as a partnership arrangement in which local stakeholders such as fishers or tourist organisations share the responsibility and authority for the management of resources with national or local state bodies. This type of management is thought to be more effective as the stakeholders often have local knowledge and are involved in the decision making and management of the resource (Pomeroy & Rivera 2006). This gives stakeholders a platform to express their views and may lead to improved compliance or uptake of new management plans.

2938: Protect spawning fish from capture
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Fishing can impact marine fish through species removal or habitat damage from fishing gear contacting the seabed. Many fish species are known to aggregate into denser groups of individuals during specific times to reproduce (spawn) or during early development (nursery areas). The groups may be made up exclusively of fish of one sex and/or stage of maturity. The months during which spawning activity takes place differs between species and areas and the onset is normally dependent on water temperatures. But for any given species/area the overall timing of these periods can be relatively stable between years. As well as taking place at regular times, spawning activity may also take place at the same sites each year, making their occurrence more easily predicted. In the same way nursery habitats used by groups of very young fish are often identifiable. Protecting known spawning or nursing individuals by prohibiting or limiting fishing activity may reduce fishing mortality during highly sensitive periods and allow reproduction or early development to take place with minimal disturbance.
Evidence for a similar intervention relating to the protection of spawning activity is summarized under ‘Spatial and Temporal Management - Establish temporary fishery closures’.

Key Messages:

Four studies examined the effects of protecting spawning fish on marine fish populations. Two studies were in the North Atlantic Ocean (Canada, UK) and one study was in each of the Philippine Sea (Palau) and the Tasman Sea (Australia). 

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Abundance (1 study): One before-and-after, site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean found no increase in the biomass of the spawning stock of Atlantic cod in the nine years following implementation of a seasonal fishery closure to protect spawning cod, compared to fished areas.
Survival (1 study): One before-and-after, site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean found no change in Atlantic cod survival in the nine years after a seasonal fishery closure to protect spawning cod was implemented, compared to fished areas.
Condition (1 study): One before-and-after, site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean found no change in the length composition of Atlantic cod in the nine years following a seasonal fishery closure to protect spawning cod, compared to fished areas.

BEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)

Use (2 studies): One site comparison study and one study in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean and Tasman Sea reported that spawning and/or nursery areas closed seasonally or permanently to fishing were used by tagged adult Atlantic cod for nearly a third of time during spawning, and by school sharks less than one year old for up to 80% of time, but by school sharks between one and two years old for 18% of time, compared to areas outside.

OTHER (2 STUDIES)

Commercial catch abundance (2 studies): One before-and-after, site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean found no change over nine years in commercial catches of Atlantic cod following a seasonal fishery closure to protect spawning cod compared to fished areas. One replicated, controlled study in the Philippine Sea found that during seasonal closure of a grouper fishery to protect spawning individuals, the commercial catch numbers of other fish groups (herbivores) increased, indicating they were being targeted more by spear fishers compared to the open season.

Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Overfishing leads to volumes of fish being caught that are unsustainable, both ecologically and economically, as well as to damage of fish habitats. Restriction of fishing capacity or effort may therefore help to reduce the effects of overfishing. One way to achieve this may be to limit the duration of fishing by capping the number of days that may be spent at sea. However, other measures may also be needed (by limiting the number of licenced vessels, for example) to prevent the same amount of fish being caught in a shorter period by an increased number of vessels, as was reported for Pacific halibut in the late 1980s (Szymkowiak et al. 2020).

Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Beam trawling can affect bottom fish communities through unwanted mortality and the effects of physical impact to the seabed (Jennings et al. 2012). The net of a beam trawl is kept open horizontally by a steel beam, the length of which varies between 4 and 12 m depending on the size of the vessel. Limits on the width of the beam trawl would reduce the area swept by the gear and may reduce the effects on fish communities, particularly flatfish, by limiting unwanted fish catch and mortality, as well as help reduce effects from impact to the seabed.

3807: Limit the number of traps or pots per vessel
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Traps and pots are used to commercially harvest fish or marine invertebrates such as crabs and lobsters. They are passive gears usually consisting of rectangular or circular frames of wicker or metal, covered with polypropylene or mono-metal netting. These are baited, and have shaped access funnels in the side or top to allow entry and then retention of feeding fish or invertebrates. Traps and pots can be set in multiple ‘strings’ or lines, with anywhere between a few and 500 in number set on a single line depending on the fishery. Traps and pots have the potential to capture varying volumes of unwanted fish, so limiting the number that can be fished by a vessel may reduce fishing effort in an area and/or season and thus reduce the amount of unwanted fish catch.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of limiting the number of traps or pots per vessel on marine fish populations.

Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Static fishing nets such as long lines and gill nets, are used to commercially harvest fish or marine invertebrates. They are passive gears that can be left either anchored or drifting and fish are captured by numerous baited hooks or by entanglement in the net. Length of gill nets can vary from 50 to 200 m, and they can be set in ‘fleets’ of up to 2,000 m. Similarly, long lines can be set in lengths averaging 45 km long (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, USA) with thousands of hooks. Limiting the permitted number or length of static nets may reduce effects of overfishing by reducing fishing effort, fish mortality and unwanted fish catch.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of limiting the number or length of static fishing nets in an area on marine fish populations.

3809: Limit fishing activity by vessel size and/or engine power
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Overfishing leads to volumes of fish being caught that are unsustainable, both ecologically and economically, as well as to damage of fish habitats. Restriction of fishing effort or capacity may therefore help to reduce the effects of overfishing (Tidd 2013). One way to achieve this may be to limit fishing activity according to vessel size and engine power. Larger vessels typically have higher engine power and a greater ability than smaller vessels to operate or tow large and heavy fishing gear. They also have the capacity to travel further afield and for longer durations to engage in fishing activity. Restricting vessel size and engine power in an area may reduce overall fishing effort by limiting the number and type of vessels allowed to fish there. However, in some cases fishers may be permitted to respond to such restrictions by derating the power of their engines in order to continue fishing in an area rather than move out of it (Pascoe & Robinson 1998).

Background information and definitions:
Commercial fishing is carried out using many different gear types, and each has its own characteristics regarding fishing power and selectivity (the potential to catch only the intended species and/or sizes of fish). Prohibiting certain gear types while allowing others may help to reduce the effects of excessive fishing effort and selective fish removal that may be particular to an area or species due to the fishing method(s) used.

3811: Introduce an overall catch limit (quota cap or total allowable catch) by fishery or fleet
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
An overall catch limit, also known as total allowable catch or quota cap, prescribes the maximum amount (weight or number) that a fishery or fleet is permitted to harvest from a commercial fish stock. Catch limits may be set annually, biannually or for a season by an advisory body, generally based on scientific advice derived from an assessment of stock status. Catch limits may be implemented for stocks that are shared and jointly managed between countries and can be exchanged between them. When a country’s prescribed national limit for a species has been used up, it must close the fishery. Setting overall catch limits may control fishing effort and mortality and thus help avoid over-fishing and depletion of both commercial and non-commercially targeted fish populations.

Key Messages:

Nine studies examined the effects of introducing overall catch limits by fishery or fleet on marine fish populations. Three studies were worldwide, two studies were in the South Atlantic Ocean (Namibia/South Africa), two studies were in the North Sea (Northern Europe), and one study was in each of the North Sea and Atlantic Ocean (Scotland) and the North Atlantic Ocean (Canada).

One replicated, controlled study of fish stocks worldwide found that overfished stocks of tunas and billfishes had faster increases of biomass when managed using overall catch limits, compared to stocks with other types of control or no management.
Reproductive success (1 study): A global review reported that after overall catch limits and minimum landing size were introduced there was strong recruitment of broadbill swordfish for one key stock, while recruitment for four other stocks could not be assessed due to limited data.
Survival (2 studies): One before-and-after study and one replicated, controlled study in the North Atlantic Ocean and worldwide found that for fish species with overall catch limits there was a decrease or lower fishing mortality, compared either to before implementation or to stocks without catch limits and those with other controls.

Reduction of unwanted catch (1 study): One replicated, before-and-after study in the North Sea and North Atlantic Ocean found that overall catch limits did not reduce unwanted megrim catch despite a reduction in discards, however this was due to retention of more small but legal-sized megrim, previously discarded.
Reduction of fishing effort (1 study): One replicated, before-and-after study in the North Sea found that when annual total allowable catch limits were changed (increased or decreased), half of the otter trawl fleet had corresponding changes in fishing effort (increased or decreased), but there were no changes for the beam trawl fleet.
Stock status (1 study): One global systematic review found that in terms of reaching biomass-based management targets fisheries with fleet-wide catch quotas were no different to fisheries managed either by catch shares or effort controls. However, along with catch share fisheries, fewer catch quota stocks were over-exploited than those with effort controls.

3812: Introduce catch shares
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Catch share is a fishery management system that allocates harvest rights to individuals or communities. The system has developed over the years, and it may now be described as falling into two main types: quota- and area-based catch shares. Quota-based systems set a species or fishery-wide catch limit (or in some cases fishing effort limit), a portion of which is assigned to individuals or groups for harvest. Participants are directly accountable for staying within the limits. Area-based systems allocate participants an exclusive privilege to harvest a specific area. Combinations of catch share systems may also be employed. This intervention covers any evidence of fisheries managed by catch shares where the type is not specified, and/or the measures are mixed. Introducing catch shares may limit fishing effort and mortality and help ensure sustainability by reducing effects of overfishing.
Evidence for related interventions is summarized under ‘Introduce an overall catch limit (quota cap or total allowable catch) by fishery or fleet’, ‘Set catch shares by area’ and Set catch shares by species‘.

Background information and definitions:
Catch share is a fishery management system that allocates harvest rights to individuals or communities. There are two main types: quota- and area-based catch shares. Quota-based systems set a species or fishery-wide catch limit (also referred to as the total allowable catch or TAC), a portion of which is assigned to individuals or groups for harvest, with the participants being directly accountable for staying within the limits. Such systems are typically called ‘Individual Fishing Quotas’ (IFQs) but variations may also be referred to as ‘Limited Access Privileges’ or LAPs (Anon. 2021). In some regions such as Australia, quota can be based on fishing effort entitling a fisher to use a certain amount of fishing gear (length of net, number of hooks etc.). Fishers can only use the amount of fishing gear for which they have quota. When the catch shares are transferable (between stakeholders) they are known as ‘Individual Transferable Quota’ (ITQs) and if entities want to fish more than their individual quota they have to buy quota from other fishers. Introducing catch share systems in the form of quotas by species or fishery may limit fishing effort and mortality and help ensure sustainability by reducing effects of overfishing.

Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Move-on rules require fishing activity to reduce or cease in an area. They may be triggered by catch thresholds being reached, or by a single sighting or capture for some protected species. The rules may involve temporary fishing restrictions including total closure of an area and/or moving to an alternative area with lower fish abundance of the species concerned located a minimum distance away. Establishing move-on rules may immediately limit fishing effort and reduce fish mortality.

Background information and definitions:
Commercial fishing can lead to unsustainable depletion of fish populations through removal of fish and mortality of discards. To attempt to regulate fishing activity in an area, permits/licences or charters may be implemented that represent an agreement between the fishers and fisheries managers. To be authorized to fish, each fisher must abide by the rules stipulated by the permit or charter. This may include measures such as communicating details of their catches and setting limits on fishing periods and/or how much gear can be fished. Fishing effort may be able to be controlled so that the effects of over-fishing are avoided (Cadiou et al. 2009). Compliance and enforcement of illegal activity may also be improved.

Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Restrictions on the number of permits or licences issued to fish in an area or fishery is often termed ‘limited entry’. This prevents the entry of new fishing vessels and/or fishers operating without vessels (fishing from shore for example), with the aim of controlling fishing effort and capacity of a fleet, and in turn reduce the effects of overfishing on fish populations. However, the effectiveness of permits/licences may depend partly on other mechanisms to prevent increases in capacity by other means, such as increases in vessel horsepower or size, gear changes or improvements or changes in fishing periods or areas (Ward et al. 2004).

3820: Eliminate fisheries subsidies that encourage overfishing
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Fisheries subsidies are direct or indirect financial transfers by the government of a country to its fishing sector, usually to help offset the cost or increase in cost of a critical resource such as fuel, fishing gear or new vessels (Sumaila et al. 2008). It is argued these payments may drive overexploitation of fish populations by providing an economic incentive to continue fishing even when stocks are declining. They may also benefit illegal fishing activities. The elimination of harmful fisheries subsidies may help control fishing effort and prevent declines in fish populations due to fishing.

3821: Implement vessel decommissioning schemes
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Decommissioning of a fishing vessel is the permanent withdrawal (often by scrapping) of that vessel from operation within the fishing industry. Decommissioning schemes usually involve the payment of a grant to the owner of the vessel to encourage uptake in the scheme and to compensate for the loss of the vessel. The aim of decommissioning schemes is to reduce fishing effort by reducing the size of a fleet that operates in an area or is commercially targeting a species of conservation concern. Reduced fishing effort may lead to reduced fish mortality and hence allow depleted populations to recover from the effects of overfishing. However, the effectiveness of decommissioning schemes may depend on their success at specifically targeting areas where they would have most impact. i.e., successful removal of vessels exhibiting the highest degree of fishing effort (Anon. 2006).

3822: Prohibit the catching and/or landing of specific fish species
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Fishing activity contributes to the threat to uncommon or declining fish species, along with habitat loss, pollution and diseases. Some species are listed as endangered and are highly vulnerable to even small amounts of fishing mortality. Making certain fish illegal to catch and/or land may help sustain the population of a species or group of species by limiting mortality. It may also provide an incentive for fishers to avoid fishing in certain areas, with particular gears or at specific times, resulting in reduced effort and impacts to fish habitats. Prohibiting the landing of species may occur in jurisdictions adjacent to those without similar restrictions to protect conservation measures in place (Kabula 2000).

3823: Prohibit high grading in which only the most profitable individuals or species are landed
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
High grading is the practice by fishers of discarding marketable fish that have the lowest commercial value so they can land more fish of higher value (e.g. to maximise profit). It occurs in fisheries managed by catch limits (e.g. quotas/catch shares) or by measures requiring the landing of their total catch. Because survival of the discarded fish can be low, a ban on high grading may reduce overall fishing effort and mortality. In 2009, high grading was made an illegal practice in European Union waters. However, there is evidence that suggests its effectiveness may depend on the ability to detect and enforce it (Batsleer et al. 2015).

3824: Implement multi-species management strategies
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
The status of commercial fish stocks is typically assessed separately by species and managed using reference points or target yields estimated for a single species. However, where there is a large number of species in the catch, this can make it difficult for these multi- or mixed-species fisheries to comply with management requirements because fishing may have a greater impact on some species than others. Management strategies that evaluate the risks and effects of management for all species, may help to ensure that fish caught in multiple species fisheries are protected from overexploitation and have more sustainable populations. This approach needs to take into account the possibility that in a multispecies assemblage, one highly desirable species with a low total allowable catch could trigger an early closure of the whole assemblage by becoming what is known as a ‘choke’ species, of which an example is cod in the mixed gadoid fishery in the North Sea (Ulrich et al. 2011).

3825: Implement multi-year or long-term management strategies
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Commercial fish stocks may be managed annually using reference points or target yields estimated for a single species, the status of which may typically be assessed by separate species. However, the effectiveness of management measures may not occur over a single year so multi-year or long-term management plans may be implemented that may be more effective over time to ensure stocks are sustainable and exploited populations allowed to recover from the effects of overfishing.

Key Messages:

One study examined the effects of implementing multi-year or long-term management strategies on marine fish populations. The study was worldwide.

Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Fleet communication systems in commercial fisheries report near real-time observations of hotspots of unwanted species to enable a fishery to operate in a coordinated way to reduce the capture of those species across the fleet (Gilman et al. 2006). They utilise various forms of technology for effective communication; from email via satellite-based vessel monitoring systems and other satellite-based systems, to radio and phone. A combination of these technologies may also be used for communication between vessels and to transmit information to a designated hub. Using technology to communicate near real-time catch information may reduce the catches of protected species and other unwanted fish by facilitating avoidance across cooperating vessels.

3827: Employ adaptive management methods to achieve long-term goals
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Adaptive management is an approach to natural resource management that deals with uncertainty about the impacts of actions/decisions or policy choices (Walters 2007). It seeks to continually improve management strategies in response to new information and measured changes (e.g. in climate or population). However, adaptive management methods are often based on predicted outcomes, for example using Management Strategy Evaluation (Edwards & Dankel 2016) and therefore not including in the evidence here. Employing adaptive management in fisheries may help prevent over-fishing or restore depleted populations.

3828: Introduce gear exchange programs
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Gear exchange programmes aim to remove and replace what may be considered as more destructive, less selective, or even illegal fishing gears. They typically involve financial help and incentives for fishers, particularly those with low income or in poverty. Gear exchange programmes may reduce unwanted catch by providing more selective gears to reduce fish mortality, damage to fish habitats and the impacts of illegal fishing (Signa et al. 2008).

Background information and definitions:
Dredging on the seabed mainly occurs for harvesting of shellfish but can impact fish populations through the fish mortality associated with unwanted catch and discarding. Pausing or stopping the dredge midwater during hauling may reduce unwanted fish catch, particularly flatfish, and decrease fish mortality (Grothues et al. 2017).

3830: Enforce gear and vessel restrictions (e.g. cap engine power, ban gears)
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Overfishing leads to volumes of fish being caught that are unsustainable, both ecologically and economically, as well as being damaging to fish habitats. Regulation of fishing activity, for example restricting gear types or time fished within an area, and/or fleet controls such as limiting power and capacity, may help to reduce the effects of overfishing (Tidd 2013). However, such regulations may only be successful if they are effectively enforced. Illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing has long been considered one of the greatest threats to marine fish populations and ecosystems (FAO 2006) and undermines national and regional efforts to manage fisheries sustainably and to conserve marine biodiversity (Long et al. 2020). Enforcement may be one tool to help combat this risk, the causes and behaviours behind such crime being complex (Petrossian 2015).
