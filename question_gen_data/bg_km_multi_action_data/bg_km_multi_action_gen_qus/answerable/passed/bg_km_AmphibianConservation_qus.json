    "question": "What actions can be taken to protect amphibians from the negative impacts of roads?",
    "answer": "Several actions have been studied. Installing culverts or tunnels, often with barrier fencing, can decrease amphibian road deaths (884, 756). Closing roads during migration periods also protects large numbers of amphibians (842). Modifying gully pots by moving them away from the kerb can decrease the number of newts that fall in (782). Restoring connectivity by raising a road on a viaduct has also been shown to decrease deaths of migrating amphibians (840). Conversely, using volunteers to assist toads across roads has been associated with long-term population declines (784), and warning signs may be ineffective (841).",

    "question": "What does the evidence show about the overall success of translocating amphibians to establish new breeding populations?",
    "answer": "The evidence for translocation success is mixed but generally positive. A global review found that 65% of 54 amphibian translocations resulted in established breeding populations or substantial recruitment (854). Success varies by group: translocations of wood frogs (856) and salamanders/newts (860, 858) frequently established breeding populations. Toad translocations have also been successful, though one study on boreal toads failed (855, 859). Frog translocations have established populations, but some went extinct within five years (861). One review found that translocations of over 1,000 animals were more successful (854).",

    "question": "On agricultural land, how does the effectiveness of managing livestock grazing for amphibians vary between species and habitat contexts?",
    "answer": "The effects of livestock grazing are highly variable. One study found that excluding livestock by fencing did not increase overall amphibian abundance but did increase larval abundance of some species, while other studies found that American toad and green frog abundance was higher with grazing (746). Managing grazing regimes also shows mixed results; one study found grazed plots had lower common toad abundance than ungrazed plots (780). However, several studies found that reintroducing grazing as part of broader habitat management increased or maintained populations of green toads and natterjack toads (780). One study noted that excluding livestock from temporary pools caused them to dry out 50 days earlier, which could be detrimental (746).",
