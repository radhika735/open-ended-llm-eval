    "question": "What is the evidence for the effectiveness of providing supplementary food to primates continuously versus only during periods of resource scarcity?",
    "answer": "Studies on regularly and continuously providing supplementary food have shown mixed results, with some primate populations increasing and others declining (1526). Similarly, providing supplementary food only during resource-scarce periods has shown that a majority of chimpanzees and olive baboons survived post-reintroduction (1527). Providing supplementary food for a limited time only also has mixed results, with some populations increasing, some declining, and survival rates varying significantly across different reintroduction projects (1528). All these interventions have an effectiveness rating of 'Unknown effectiveness'.",

    "question": "To mitigate the impacts of logging on primates, what evidence exists for the effectiveness of altering logging practices?",
    "answer": "There is some evidence for using selective logging instead of clear-cutting, though results are mixed, with some studies showing higher primate densities in low-intensity logged forests and others finding similar densities across different logging intensities (1485). One study found a black howler monkey population increased after important food trees were preserved during logging (1494). However, for many other logging-related interventions, no evidence was found. These include using patch retention harvesting (1486), implementing small and dispersed logging compartments (1487), using shelter wood cutting (1488), leaving hollow trees for sleeping sites (1489), and closing non-essential roads after operations (1496).",

    "question": "What actions are available to reduce primate poaching through patrols and law enforcement?",
    "answer": "Several actions focus on this. Conducting regular anti-poaching patrols is rated \u2018Likely to be beneficial\u2019, with studies showing increased gorilla populations and reduced illegal hunting (1471). This can be supported by regularly de-activating/removing ground snares, which is also \u2018Likely to be beneficial\u2019 and has been linked to increased gorilla numbers and reduced snare counts (1475). Providing better equipment (1476) and training (1477) to ranger patrols can improve their effectiveness, with studies showing positive outcomes like increased gorilla populations and no poaching incidents. Implementing monitoring surveillance strategies like SMART can also improve patrol effectiveness, with one study showing an increase in observed gorillas and chimpanzees after implementation (1481).",

Studies have shown that species like black lion tamarins, capuchins, black howler monkeys, and various lemurs use these bridges to cross roads and other gaps (1457). Another potential alternative is installing green bridges (overpasses), though no evidence was found for the effect of this action on primate populations (1456).",

    "answer": "Running tourist projects is rated as a 'Trade off between benefit and harms'. On the beneficial side, some studies found that mountain gorilla and black howler monkey populations increased after tourism projects were initiated (1512). However, there are also negative impacts. One study found that Tana River red colobus and crested mangabey numbers decreased despite a tourism project. Another study noted that an intensive tourism project for Tibetan macaques increased their stress levels and infant mortality. For lemurs, one project led to a decline in population size for two species, while one species increased (1512). Habituation to human presence, often a part of tourism, also shows mixed results, with some populations increasing and others declining (1519).",

    "question": "What factors are associated with the success or failure of primate reintroduction projects?",
    "answer": "Several factors appear to influence reintroduction outcomes. Reintroducing primates into habitats where the species is absent is rated 'Likely to be beneficial', with several studies showing population increases or high survival rates (1590). Allowing primates to adapt to local conditions before release shows mixed results, with some studies showing increased survival and others showing population declines or poor performance (1564). The rearing environment of captive-bred individuals is also a factor; primates born and reared in cages had poorer outcomes (e.g., higher mortality, different diet) compared to those with some free-ranging experience (1594, 1595). Fostering appropriate behaviours like foraging can help, though results are not always positive (1600). The success of reintroductions often depends on a combination of these and other interventions, such as health screening (1553) and post-release support.",
