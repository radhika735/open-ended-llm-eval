    "question": "What actions can be taken to restore vegetation on peatlands after mining or peat extraction?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests a couple of approaches. Replacing blocks of vegetation after mining has been shown to be effective, with transplanted blocks retaining their original peatland plant community in both bogs and fens [1738]. Another approach is to fill or block ditches created during extraction. Studies show that blocked or filled ditches can be colonized by herbs and bryophytes within a few years, with one study in a fen finding vegetation cover was restored to undisturbed levels [1805].",

    "question": "How do prescribed burning and mowing compare for controlling problematic plants on peatlands?",
    "answer": "Evidence for both methods is limited. For mowing, studies in fens and bogs found it had no significant effect on overall plant community composition in some cases, but did increase Sphagnum moss cover and reduce purple moor grass in one study [1770]. Prescribed fire has been shown to reduce heather cover in bogs and increase cottongrass cover, but also reduce overall plant species richness [1774]. Notably, using fire carries a 'Trade off between benefit and harms' rating, while mowing's effectiveness is rated as 'Unknown'.",

    "answer": "The evidence base is very limited. No studies were found that evaluated creating habitat corridors in developed areas [1720], in areas of energy production or mining [1739], or across service corridors [1742]. There is evidence from a single study on creating corridors in farmed areas, which found that a peat swamp forest corridor in Indonesia contained a high density of trees (5,819 trees/ha) and between 18-29 tree species [1730].",

    "answer": "The use of grazing to restore disturbance has a 'Trade off between benefit and harms' rating based on four studies in fens or fen meadows [1762]. Potential benefits include increased cover of some herbs like cottongrasses and sedges, and in one case, an increase in plant species richness. However, negative impacts were also recorded, including reduced Sphagnum moss cover and fewer fen-characteristic plant species compared to mown meadows. In one study, grazing had no effect on species richness [1762].",

    "question": "What are the alternatives to prescribed fire for managing peatland vegetation and restoring disturbance?",
    "answer": "Several physical management techniques can serve as alternatives to fire. Cutting or mowing herbaceous plants in fens and fen meadows has been shown to increase plant species richness and alter community composition [1759]. For larger woody plants, cutting trees and shrubs can increase the cover and biomass of herbs [1761]. Physical removal of problematic plants, such as moss carpets on fens, can increase the cover of fen-characteristic plants [1768]. Finally, using grazing to restore disturbance has shown some benefits, like increasing herb cover, but results are mixed and there can be negative impacts on mosses [1762].",

    "question": "To restore vegetation on degraded bogs, what are the most beneficial planting techniques and supplementary actions?",
    "answer": "Based on effectiveness ratings, several actions are beneficial for restoring bog vegetation. Spreading moss fragments [1821] or mixed vegetation fragments [1822] onto the bog surface are both rated as 'Beneficial', leading to the establishment of Sphagnum and other peatland plants. Direct planting of individual mosses [1818], herbs [1819], or shrubs/trees [1820] is rated as 'Likely to be beneficial', with studies showing good survival and growth. To support these planting efforts, adding a cover of organic mulch [1828] or other materials like plastic mesh [1829] after planting is also 'Likely to be beneficial', as it can increase survival, growth, and vegetation cover by protecting the new plants.",

    "question": "When removing forest plantations from bogs and fens, what factors influence the success of vegetation recovery?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests that simply cutting or removing the forest plantation is 'Likely to be beneficial', leading to increased herb cover and species richness in fens, though with mixed effects on mosses [1731]. However, a key factor for greater success appears to be combining tree removal with rewetting the peat [1732]. This combined action is also rated 'Likely to be beneficial' and has been shown to increase the abundance of wetland-characteristic plants, Sphagnum mosses, and herbs like cottongrasses and sedges. While the effect of the combined action on overall species richness is variable, adding rewetting seems to produce a more comprehensive vegetation response than tree removal alone.",
