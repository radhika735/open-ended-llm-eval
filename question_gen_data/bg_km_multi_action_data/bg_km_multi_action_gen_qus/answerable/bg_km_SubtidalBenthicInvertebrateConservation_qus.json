    "question": "What is the evidence comparing the effects of leaving offshore pipelines in place versus removing them after decommissioning?",
    "answer": "We found no studies that evaluated the effects of leaving pipelines and infrastructure in place following decommissioning on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations (2059). Similarly, no studies were found that evaluated the effects of removing pipelines and infrastructure following decommissioning (2060). Therefore, there is no evidence to compare the effects of these two actions.",

    "question": "To mitigate the impacts of the oil and gas industry, what options exist for managing drill cuttings, and what is their proven effectiveness?",
    "answer": "Several options exist to manage drill cuttings, including ceasing or prohibiting their deposit on the seabed (2062), disposing of them on land instead (2063), removing them after decommissioning (2064), limiting their thickness (2065), and burying them in the seabed (2066). However, for all these interventions, we found no studies that evaluated their effects on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations. Therefore, their effectiveness is unknown and there is no evidence to indicate whether they have any desirable or harmful effects.",

    "answer": "There is evidence that ceasing aggregate extraction is beneficial for subtidal benthic invertebrates. Seven studies found that after cessation, invertebrate community composition, richness, diversity, and abundance became more similar to pre-extraction or natural sites (2070). In contrast, the effectiveness of extracting aggregates from a moving rather than static vessel is unknown. One study found that a site dredged by a moving vessel had higher invertebrate abundance but lower diversity compared to a site dredged by a static vessel (2071).",

    "question": "Which fisheries management actions have the most evidence of being beneficial for subtidal benthic invertebrate conservation?",
    "answer": "Several fisheries management actions are rated as beneficial or likely to be beneficial. Ceasing or prohibiting all towed (mobile) fishing gear was found to be beneficial, with eight studies showing it led to different community compositions, greater richness/diversity, and greater biomass of invertebrates like scallops and starfish (2102). Prohibiting all types of fishing in a Marine Protected Area is also likely beneficial, with thirty studies showing benefits such as greater overall invertebrate abundance, biomass, and size, and particularly higher abundance and larger sizes for crustaceans (2224). Ceasing or prohibiting bottom trawling (2099), dredging (2101), and using a semi-pelagic trawl instead of a demersal trawl (2118) are also considered likely to be beneficial based on a smaller number of studies.",

    "question": "For trawl fisheries, what are some alternative gear modifications to reduce unwanted invertebrate catch, and how effective are they?",
    "answer": "Several modifications to trawl nets can be used as alternatives to reduce unwanted invertebrate catch. Fitting one or more mesh escape panels or windows is likely to be beneficial; seven studies found this reduced unwanted catch or increased survival of escaped invertebrates (2132). Fitting grids or frames to nets is also likely beneficial, with two studies showing they reduced unwanted catch of sponges, crabs, and cuttlefish (2133). Using a larger codend mesh size is also likely beneficial, with one study finding it caught fewer species and lower biomass of unwanted invertebrates and fish (2135). The effectiveness of using a square mesh codend instead of a diamond mesh is unknown, with one study finding it caught less unwanted catch in one of two areas (2136).",

    "question": "What are the general effects of creating artificial reefs on the diversity and abundance of subtidal benthic invertebrates?",
    "answer": "Creating artificial reefs is likely to be beneficial for subtidal benthic invertebrates, though the communities that develop may differ from natural reefs. Studies have found that while invertebrate communities on artificial reefs can be different from natural reefs, they can host a high number of species (2258). Some studies found lower species richness and diversity compared to natural reefs, but others reported increases in species richness over time or higher richness than adjacent mudflats (2258). For abundance, results are mixed; some studies found lower abundance in sediments near reefs, while others found higher invertebrate biomass on the reef structure itself compared to adjacent natural sediments (2258). The design and material of the reef can also influence the composition and abundance of the communities that develop (2259). Repurposing obsolete offshore structures as reefs has also been documented to host diverse invertebrate assemblages (2262).",

    "question": "What are the documented benefits for crustacean populations when all fishing is prohibited within a Marine Protected Area?",
    "answer": "Prohibiting all types of fishing in Marine Protected Areas is likely to be beneficial for crustacean populations. Evidence from thirty studies shows that these 'no-take' areas typically have more lobsters compared to partially protected or fished areas. Multiple studies found that inside protected areas prohibiting all fishing, the abundances and/or biomasses of lobsters and crabs were higher, and individuals were larger, compared to areas where fishing was allowed (2224). In addition, some studies found greater lobster egg production potential and more egg-bearing females in these protected areas (2224). In contrast, in protected areas that only prohibit commercial fishing but still allow recreational harvesting, studies found that lobster abundance and size did not necessarily increase (2225).",
