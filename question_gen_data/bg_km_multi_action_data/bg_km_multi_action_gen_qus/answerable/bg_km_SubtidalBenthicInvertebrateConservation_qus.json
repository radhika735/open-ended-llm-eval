Fitting grids or frames to nets is also likely beneficial, with two studies showing they reduced unwanted catch of sponges, crabs, and cuttlefish (2133). Using a larger codend mesh size is also likely beneficial, with one study finding it caught fewer species and lower biomass of unwanted invertebrates and fish (2135).

Studies have found that while invertebrate communities on artificial reefs can be different from natural reefs, they can host a high number of species (2258). Some studies found lower species richness and diversity compared to natural reefs, but others reported increases in species richness over time or higher richness than adjacent mudflats (2258). For abundance, results are mixed; some studies found lower abundance in sediments near reefs, while others found higher invertebrate biomass on the reef structure itself compared to adjacent natural sediments (2258). The design and material of the reef can also influence the composition and abundance of the communities that develop (2259). Repurposing obsolete offshore structures as reefs has also been documented to host diverse invertebrate assemblages (2262).",

Evidence from thirty studies shows that these 'no-take' areas typically have more lobsters compared to partially protected or fished areas. Multiple studies found that inside protected areas prohibiting all fishing, the abundances and/or biomasses of lobsters and crabs were higher, and individuals were larger, compared to areas where fishing was allowed (2224). In addition, some studies found greater lobster egg production potential and more egg-bearing females in these protected areas (2224). In contrast, in protected areas that only prohibit commercial fishing but still allow recreational harvesting, studies found that lobster abundance and size did not necessarily increase (2225).",

Ceasing aquaculture showed that invertebrate communities remained different from unfarmed sites, although abundance of health-indicating worms increased (2185).
