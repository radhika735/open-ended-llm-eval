    "question": "In a captive setting, what are the most and least effective methods for treating chytridiomycosis in amphibians?",
    "answer": "Increasing enclosure or water temperature to 30–37°C for over 16 hours was found to cure frogs and toads of chytridiomycosis in four of five studies (770). Treatment with antifungal chemicals, particularly itraconazole, has also been shown to be effective at curing amphibians in the majority of studies (882). In contrast, some other treatments are less effective. Treatment with trimethoprim-sulfadiazine increased survival time but did not cure frogs (763). Adding antifungal bacteria to amphibian skin did not reduce infection rate or death in three of four studies (764). Similarly, vaccinating frogs with formalin-killed chytrid fungus did not significantly reduce infection rate or mortality (765).",

    "question": "What are the observed outcomes of creating new ponds for amphibian conservation?",
    "answer": "Creating ponds is generally beneficial, with most studies showing that amphibians use and colonize created ponds (869). For specific groups, outcomes are positive: created ponds have led to the establishment of breeding populations of great crested newts (863), frogs (865), salamanders (867), and various toad species (864, 866, 868). Comparisons to natural ponds show that created ponds can have similar or even higher numbers of species, although species composition sometimes differs (869). However, one study found that natterjack toad tadpoles in created ponds suffered higher mortality from invertebrate predation than in natural ponds (866).",

    "question": "Within managed forests, what are the potential negative impacts on salamanders from timber harvesting techniques other than clearcutting?",
    "answer": "Various partial harvesting techniques have been found to negatively impact salamanders compared to unharvested forests. Harvesting trees in small groups significantly decreased salamander abundance and changed species composition (844). Leaving a low density of trees (leave-tree harvesting) also decreased salamander abundance and altered species composition (846). Shelterwood harvesting similarly decreased salamander abundance in two of three studies (851). Thinning trees had mixed effects, with one study finding a negative overall response for amphibians and another showing decreased body condition of ensatina salamanders (852). A meta-analysis found that all types of partial harvest, including these, decreased salamander populations (852).",

    "question": "When managing commercial forests, how does thinning trees compare to shelterwood harvesting in terms of impacts on amphibian populations?",
    "answer": "Both thinning and shelterwood harvesting generally have less negative impacts than clearcutting, but still cause population declines compared to unharvested forest. For thinning, two studies found it resulted in higher amphibian abundance or a less negative overall response compared to clearcutting (852). For shelterwood harvesting, studies found it resulted in higher or similar salamander abundance compared to clearcutting (851). Compared to unharvested forest, both techniques were found to decrease salamander abundance (851, 852). One study found that emigrating salamanders used thinned forest significantly more than clearcuts, while use was similar to unharvested forest (852).",

    "question": "Besides creating artificial hibernacula, what other actions can be taken to provide or enhance refuge habitats for amphibians?",
    "answer": "Several actions can create refuge habitats for amphibians. Leaving coarse woody debris (fallen dead trees and branches) in forests provides valuable microhabitats (843), and reintroducing coarse woody debris during forest restoration was found to increase frog species in one study (772). Adding coarse woody debris to forest floors had mixed effects on the abundance of individual species (772). Providing artificial refugia made of other materials has also been shown to be used by translocated frogs and hellbenders (772).",

    "question": "What factors are associated with the success or failure of captive breeding programs for frogs and toads?",
    "answer": "The success of captive breeding is influenced by several factors. Simulating natural environmental cycles, such as a wet and dry season, was found to be important for inducing reproduction in some frogs and toads (835, 836). Temperature can also affect reproductive success and tadpole development (835). For toads, housing them in outdoor enclosures led to higher reproductive success than indoor tanks (848). Parental care and tadpole density were also found to affect development (835). Hormone treatments can induce sperm and egg production, but success depends on the type, amount, and number of doses of hormone used (883).",

    "question": "What is the evidence for the long-term success of conservation interventions for toads and newts?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests that long-term success can be challenging to achieve. For great crested newts, one study found that vegetation clearance and other management maintained a population for six years, but not in the longer term (761). Another review found that after translocation, breeding failed in 48% of ponds within three years (858). For toads, assisting them across roads during migration did not prevent population declines, with 64–70% of populations declining over 6–10 years (784). However, one study found that translocated Cape platanna metamorphs survived up to 23 years at one site (855).",
