    "question": "What are the most beneficial actions for reducing human-wildlife conflict with bears?",
    "answer": "Several actions are rated as beneficial for reducing human-wildlife conflict with bears. Excluding or limiting the number of visitors to reserves was found to result in fewer bears being killed to protect humans (2330). Preventing bears from accessing food sources, for example by using electric shock devices on bird feeders, has been shown to be effective (2346). Scaring or deterring bears, such as by chasing them with dogs, can cause them to stay away from human-occupied areas (2347), and using non-lethal deterrents like pepper spray or rubber bullets has been found to repel them (2385). In contrast, translocating problem bears is rated as likely to be ineffective or harmful, as studies found they often had low survival rates, returned to their capture sites, or continued to cause nuisance behaviour (2336).",

    "question": "What are the comparative effects on survival of releasing captive-bred or translocated mammals from holding pens versus releasing them directly into the wild?",
    "answer": "The evidence shows mixed results. For wild-caught translocated mammals, two studies found that using holding pens at the release site resulted in higher survival for water voles and female European rabbits compared to direct release, but other studies found similar or lower survival for species like swift foxes, gray wolves, and American martens (2434). For captive-bred mammals, one study found that using holding pens prior to release resulted in greater post-release survival for water voles, but two other studies found similar survival rates for eastern barred bandicoots and swift foxes compared to those released directly (2510).",

    "question": "What is the extent of the evidence base for reducing human disturbance to mammals by setting approach distances, providing paths, or using voluntary agreements with local people?",
    "answer": "For all three interventions, the evidence base is currently empty. No studies were found that evaluated the effects of setting a minimum permitted distance for approaching mammals (2327), providing paths to limit the extent of disturbance (2337), or using voluntary agreements with local communities to reduce disturbance (2339). Therefore, there is no evidence to indicate whether these interventions have desirable or harmful effects.",

    "question": "What are the observed effects on mammal populations of creating or enhancing habitat features like wildflower areas, uncultivated margins, and hedgerows on farmland?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests these actions are generally beneficial. Establishing wild flower areas was found to support more small mammals compared to other field types (2359). Planting or maintaining hedgerows also increased small mammal abundance (2383). Creating uncultivated margins around fields was found to have higher numbers of small mammals and brown hares in some studies (2365). Planting specific crops for wildlife also led to higher abundance of small mammals and European rabbits (2394). However, retaining set-aside areas under conventional management did not appear to enhance small mammal or hare numbers in the studies found (2377).",

    "question": "What are the documented benefits and negative impacts of translocating 'problem' mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests translocation of 'problem' mammals has significant negative impacts and questionable benefits. Translocating predators like leopards away from human-dominated areas was found to lead to more attacks on humans and livestock than before translocation (2336). For black bears, translocation is rated as likely to be ineffective or harmful due to low survival, high rates of return to capture sites, and continued nuisance behaviour (2336, 2341). Similarly, translocating predators away from livestock often resulted in reduced survival, and animals continued to predate livestock or return to their capture sites (2436). Translocated crop-raiding elephants also showed lower survival rates than non-translocated elephants (2485). Therefore, while translocation moves an individual animal, it often leads to poor outcomes for the animal and may not resolve the conflict.",

    "question": "What interventions are available to reduce the threats posed to wild mammals by domestic cats and dogs?",
    "answer": "To reduce predation by domestic cats, evidence suggests that keeping them indoors or in outside runs is likely to be beneficial (2326), and using collar-mounted devices such as bells or sonic devices is beneficial (2332). For dogs, keeping them indoors or in enclosures has been proposed to reduce threats to wild mammals, but no studies evaluating this were found (2334). Other suggested interventions for which no evidence was found include keeping domestic cats and dogs well-fed (2335) and sterilizing them (2579).",

    "question": "What factors have been found to influence the success or failure of mammal translocation programmes?",
    "answer": "Several factors influencing translocation success have been identified. For nuisance black bears, success was higher when younger bears were moved over greater distances and across geographic barriers (2341). For ungulates, success was higher when larger numbers of animals were released (2397). Releasing animals in larger groups was found to increase reproductive success and survival for black-tailed prairie dogs (2462). The presence of invasive predators is a major factor; a review of marsupial translocations found much higher success on predator-free islands (2464). The overall success of ungulate translocations was also found to be higher when a population had more mature individuals and an equal sex ratio (2397).",
