    "answer": "Studies on regularly and continuously providing supplementary food have shown mixed results, with some primate populations increasing and others declining (1526). Similarly, providing supplementary food only during resource-scarce periods has shown that a majority of chimpanzees and olive baboons survived post-reintroduction (1527). Providing supplementary food for a limited time only also has mixed results, with some populations increasing, some declining, and survival rates varying significantly across different reintroduction projects (1528). All these interventions have an effectiveness rating of 'Unknown effectiveness'.",

However, for many other logging-related interventions, no evidence was found. These include using patch retention harvesting (1486), implementing small and dispersed logging compartments (1487), using shelter wood cutting (1488), leaving hollow trees for sleeping sites (1489), and closing non-essential roads after operations (1496).",

Providing better equipment (1476) and training (1477) to ranger patrols can improve their effectiveness, with studies showing positive outcomes like increased gorilla populations and no poaching incidents.

Reintroducing primates into habitats where the species is absent is rated 'Likely to be beneficial', with several studies showing population increases or high survival rates (1590). Allowing primates to adapt to local conditions before release shows mixed results, with some studies showing increased survival and others showing population declines or poor performance (1564). The rearing environment of captive-bred individuals is also a factor; primates born and reared in cages had poorer outcomes (e.g., higher mortality, different diet) compared to those with some free-ranging experience (1594, 1595). Fostering appropriate behaviours like foraging can help, though results are not always positive (1600). The success of reintroductions often depends on a combination of these and other interventions, such as health screening (1553) and post-release support.",
