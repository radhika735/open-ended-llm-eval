    "question": "What methods can be used to prepare soil before seeding to enhance grassland restoration?",
    "answer": "Several soil preparation methods exist. Disturbing soil by ploughing or tilling can increase plant emergence and seedling richness (3413). Removing topsoil before seeding can increase the similarity to intact steppe, boost plant species richness, and improve the survival of planted seedlings (3415). Applying herbicide can also increase sown species richness and abundance (3418). Conversely, removing leaf litter before sowing has shown mixed or no significant effects on seedling emergence or sown species cover (3414).",

    "question": "When restoring grassland in the UK, how does the effectiveness of strip seeding compare with other soil preparation and sowing methods?",
    "answer": "In the UK, strip seeding was found to increase both grass and forb species richness (3411). However, one review noted that it often resulted in failed introductions of sown species (3411). For comparison, removing turf before sowing also increased grass and forb species richness, more so than just disturbing the soil (3415). Disturbing soil by rotovating before sowing also increased grass and forb richness compared to harrowing (3413).",

    "question": "To increase plant diversity in a species-poor grassland, what are the most effective seeding strategies?",
    "answer": "Sowing seeds of parasitic species like yellow rattle is a highly effective strategy, with five out of six studies finding it increased plant species richness or diversity (3404). Increasing the number of species in a seed mix also directly increased the richness of sown plants in two US studies (3406). Planting grassland plants, especially forbs, was also effective, increasing forb species richness in 83% of cases in one UK study (3399). Sowing forb seeds alone was only examined in one study, which found no increase in seedlings (3398).",

    "answer": "Adding soil amendments can have negative effects. Adding sulphur before sowing was found in one UK study to reduce overall vegetation cover and plant species richness (3428). Adding carbon to the soil after sowing seeds was found in two US studies to either reduce or not alter the density of sown forb species (3433). While adding fertilizer can increase overall vegetation cover, some studies found it did not alter sown forb density and one study found it reduced the growth of a native prairie plant (3427).",

    "answer": "Instead of a standard grass mix (3397), several alternatives exist. Sowing native grass and forb seeds is a common approach, with sixteen studies showing it increased overall species richness (3432). Using seeds from a local source can increase plant species richness compared to commercial mixes (3400). For grasslands dominated by competitive grasses, sowing parasitic species like yellow rattle can increase overall plant diversity by suppressing grass growth (3404). Sowing seeds of nurse plants has also been tried, but one study found it did not increase species richness and actually reduced similarity to intact steppe (3401).",

The effect on sown species abundance was inconsistent: one study found drilling increased the density of two sown grass species, while another two found no change or a reduction compared to hand sowing or hydroseeding (3410). One study on hydroseeding found it increased the abundance of half of the sown plant species compared to drill seeding (3412).",

In the USA, the results were less clear. One study found that using local seeds increased vegetation cover over time compared to non-native seeds, but another found no difference in vegetation cover compared to commercial grass seed.

Sowing seeds in only part of a site also showed mixed success; one study found sown species spread to unsown areas, but another found no change in the cover or richness of sown species (3408). Sowing seeds into prepared gaps was found in one study to lead to greater cover of sown target plants in large gaps compared to small ones (3409).",

For sowing native grass and forbs, some studies found that species richness increased in the first year but this effect disappeared or reversed after 3-13 years, while another found an increase only after eight years (3432). When inoculating soil with mycorrhiza, one study found an initial increase in vegetation cover, but after three years, there was no difference compared to uninoculated areas (3429).",
