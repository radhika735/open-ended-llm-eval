Three out of four studies found this approach led to higher numbers of natural enemies (724). In contrast, using manufactured attractive chemicals showed more variable results; while five of thirteen studies found an increase in natural enemies, eight studies found the positive effects varied between enemy groups, sites, or study dates (754).",
