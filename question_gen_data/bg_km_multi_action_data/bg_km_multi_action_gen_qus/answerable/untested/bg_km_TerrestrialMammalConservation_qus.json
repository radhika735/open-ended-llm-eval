    "question": "What are the most beneficial actions for reducing human-wildlife conflict with bears?",
    "answer": "Several actions are rated as beneficial for reducing human-wildlife conflict with bears. Excluding or limiting the number of visitors to reserves was found to result in fewer bears being killed to protect humans (2330). Preventing bears from accessing food sources, for example by using electric shock devices on bird feeders, has been shown to be effective (2346). Scaring or deterring bears, such as by chasing them with dogs, can cause them to stay away from human-occupied areas (2347), and using non-lethal deterrents like pepper spray or rubber bullets has been found to repel them (2385). In contrast, translocating problem bears is rated as likely to be ineffective or harmful, as studies found they often had low survival rates, returned to their capture sites, or continued to cause nuisance behaviour (2336).",

For wild-caught translocated mammals, two studies found that using holding pens at the release site resulted in higher survival for water voles and female European rabbits compared to direct release, but other studies found similar or lower survival for species like swift foxes, gray wolves, and American martens (2434). For captive-bred mammals, one study found that using holding pens prior to release resulted in greater post-release survival for water voles, but two other studies found similar survival rates for eastern barred bandicoots and swift foxes compared to those released directly (2510).",

No studies were found that evaluated the effects of setting a minimum permitted distance for approaching mammals (2327), providing paths to limit the extent of disturbance (2337), or using voluntary agreements with local communities to reduce disturbance (2339).

    "answer": "Evidence suggests these actions are generally beneficial. Establishing wild flower areas was found to support more small mammals compared to other field types (2359). Planting or maintaining hedgerows also increased small mammal abundance (2383). Creating uncultivated margins around fields was found to have higher numbers of small mammals and brown hares in some studies (2365). Planting specific crops for wildlife also led to higher abundance of small mammals and European rabbits (2394). However, retaining set-aside areas under conventional management did not appear to enhance small mammal or hare numbers in the studies found (2377).",

    "question": "What are the documented benefits and negative impacts of translocating 'problem' mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests translocation of 'problem' mammals has significant negative impacts and questionable benefits. Translocating predators like leopards away from human-dominated areas was found to lead to more attacks on humans and livestock than before translocation (2336). For black bears, translocation is rated as likely to be ineffective or harmful due to low survival, high rates of return to capture sites, and continued nuisance behaviour (2336, 2341). Similarly, translocating predators away from livestock often resulted in reduced survival, and animals continued to predate livestock or return to their capture sites (2436). Translocated crop-raiding elephants also showed lower survival rates than non-translocated elephants (2485). Therefore, while translocation moves an individual animal, it often leads to poor outcomes for the animal and may not resolve the conflict.",

For dogs, keeping them indoors or in enclosures has been proposed to reduce threats to wild mammals, but no studies evaluating this were found (2334). Other suggested interventions for which no evidence was found include keeping domestic cats and dogs well-fed (2335) and sterilizing them (2579).",

    "question": "What factors have been found to influence the success or failure of mammal translocation programmes?",
    "answer": "Several factors influencing translocation success have been identified. For nuisance black bears, success was higher when younger bears were moved over greater distances and across geographic barriers (2341). For ungulates, success was higher when larger numbers of animals were released (2397). Releasing animals in larger groups was found to increase reproductive success and survival for black-tailed prairie dogs (2462). The presence of invasive predators is a major factor; a review of marsupial translocations found much higher success on predator-free islands (2464). The overall success of ungulate translocations was also found to be higher when a population had more mature individuals and an equal sex ratio (2397).",

Limiting visitor access to protected areas resulted in fewer bears being killed to protect humans (2330). Conversely, issuing enforcement notices for bear-proof dumpsters did not reduce garbage accessibility (2345). Scaring bears using noise, pain deterrents, or dogs has shown mixed results, with some studies finding it effective and others not (2347). Translocating problem bears away from residential areas is often ineffective, as many return and continue nuisance behaviour, and it can lead to increased attacks on humans and livestock (2336). Habituation may reduce aggression, with one study finding highly habituated brown bears showed less aggression than non-habituated ones (2340).",

Two of seven studies found higher survival for species like water voles and European rabbits compared to direct release, while four studies found similar survival for species like swift foxes and gray wolves (2434). Holding wild-caught mammals in pens also reduced the tendency of sea otters and gray wolves to return to their capture site (2434). For captive-bred mammals, using holding pens resulted in greater post-release survival for water voles in one study, but two other studies found similar survival rates for eastern barred bandicoots and swift foxes compared to direct release (2510).

Guardian animals are also 'Beneficial', with four of seven studies finding they reduced attacks, although results were mixed depending on the livestock and pastoralist practices (2433). Using flags (fladry) is 'Likely to be beneficial' for deterring wolves but not coyotes (2421). Taste-aversion is also 'Likely to be beneficial', with three of seven studies showing it reduced killings by coyotes, but four studies found no effect (2429). Shock collars are rated 'Beneficial', with multiple studies finding they reduced predation or bait consumption by wolves and coyotes (2446). Using loud noises (2435) or a combination of lights and sound (2449) was found to deter predators in three studies each. In contrast, visual deterrents like scarecrows showed mixed results, with one study finding more predation and another finding a combination of deterrents was effective (2427).",

    "answer": "This intervention has a mixed record. In terms of benefits, translocating 'nuisance' black bears from recreational areas in the USA and Canada sometimes works, with success being higher for younger bears moved over greater distances (2341). However, almost half of translocated bears returned to their capture locations in one study (2341). The harms are significant, leading to an effectiveness rating of 'Likely to be ineffective or harmful' when moving animals from residential areas (2336). Survival rates of translocated bears and deer are often lower than non-translocated animals. For example, a US study found grizzly bears had lower survival, and another found fewer than half of translocated black bears survived for a year (2336). Furthermore, five studies in the USA and Canada found that translocated bears often returned to their capture site or continued to cause nuisance elsewhere (2336).",

Providing diversionary feeding is 'Likely to be beneficial'; three of six studies in Europe and Canada found it reduced damage by red squirrels, European rabbits, and red deer, though two studies found it ineffective for voles and wild boar (2457). Using loud noises, such as bangers, is also 'Likely to be beneficial'. Five of six studies found that motion-activated noises reduced crop damage, but three studies found regularly sounding noises were ineffective against rabbits and deer (2460). Planting crops specifically to provide supplementary food is also a 'Beneficial' action, with studies in the UK and Spain showing it increased rabbit abundance and small mammal abundance in winter, presumably reducing pressure on primary crops (2394).",

The number of animals released is important; a worldwide review found that translocating ungulates was more successful when larger numbers were released (2397). Releasing animals in social or family groups is rated as 'Beneficial'. Studies found that black-tailed prairie dogs translocated as family groups had higher reproductive success, and releasing African wild dogs or lions in social groups led to high survival and stable home ranges (2463). Releasing larger, unrelated groups can also be beneficial, with one study finding that black-tailed prairie dogs released in larger groups had higher reproductive success and survival (2462). The timing of release matters; four of five studies found that releasing animals like black bears and Canada lynx in a specific season led to higher survival rates (2447). Finally, providing artificial refuges/breeding sites at the release site is 'Beneficial', with studies showing they increased abundance of European rabbits and were used by various species, likely improving establishment (2453).",
