    "question": "What actions can be taken to mitigate the environmental pollution caused by waste from salmon farms?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests several methods. Fallowing farm sites for two cycles can help sediment community structure recover (1027). Integrated aquaculture systems, such as growing blue mussels or algae near salmon farms, can absorb waste and enhance growth (932). Constructing artificial reefs can also provide a substrate for organisms that have the potential to remove organic compounds from effluents (934).",

    "answer": "Several methods have been studied in Norway. Reducing the intensity of artificial lighting was reported to lower the number of lice on salmon (741). A diet with 28% plant-based protein reduced lice by 28%, and adding beta-glucans to this diet decreased lice infection by a further 28% (732). While not studied in Norway specifically, a study in Scotland also recorded lower lice numbers when using a fallowing system (1026).",

Replacing fish meal with plant-based protein has led to decreased growth rates and final body weights in several studies, though some found no difference (924). Using bacterial or yeast protein substitutes showed similar growth rates to fish meal up to certain concentrations (918, 920). Using krill meal also resulted in similar final weight gain (916). Replacing fish oil with vegetable oil resulted in similar or sometimes higher growth rates and did not affect broodstock fecundity, but it did alter the fatty acid profile of the flesh (926).",
