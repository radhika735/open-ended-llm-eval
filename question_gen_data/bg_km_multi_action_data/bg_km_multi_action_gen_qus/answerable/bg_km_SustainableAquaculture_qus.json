    "question": "What actions can be taken to mitigate the environmental pollution caused by waste from salmon farms?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests several methods. Fallowing farm sites for two cycles can help sediment community structure recover (1027). Integrated aquaculture systems, such as growing blue mussels or algae near salmon farms, can absorb waste and enhance growth (932). Constructing artificial reefs can also provide a substrate for organisms that have the potential to remove organic compounds from effluents (934).",

    "question": "What are the most effective methods for controlling sea lice on salmon farms in Norway?",
    "answer": "Several methods have been studied in Norway. Reducing the intensity of artificial lighting was reported to lower the number of lice on salmon (741). A diet with 28% plant-based protein reduced lice by 28%, and adding beta-glucans to this diet decreased lice infection by a further 28% (732). While not studied in Norway specifically, a study in Scotland also recorded lower lice numbers when using a fallowing system (1026).",

    "question": "What are the effects of altering the diet of farmed Atlantic salmon away from traditional fish meal and oil?",
    "answer": "The effects are mixed and depend on the substitute. Replacing fish meal with plant-based protein has led to decreased growth rates and final body weights in several studies, though some found no difference (924). Using bacterial or yeast protein substitutes showed similar growth rates to fish meal up to certain concentrations (918, 920). Using krill meal also resulted in similar final weight gain (916). Replacing fish oil with vegetable oil resulted in similar or sometimes higher growth rates and did not affect broodstock fecundity, but it did alter the fatty acid profile of the flesh (926).",

    "answer": "Fallowing has documented benefits for both disease control and pollution reduction. A study in Scotland recorded lower numbers of sea lice on Atlantic salmon in cages that used a fallowing system (1026). For pollution, a trial in Tasmania found that over two fallowing cycles, the sediment community structure under salmon cages became more similar to non-impacted sites (1027). However, an Australian study found fallowing had no effect on mortality from Amoebic Gill Disease (1026).",

    "question": "How does replacing fish meal with plant-based proteins compare to using bacterial proteins for salmon growth in studies from Norway?",
    "answer": "Evidence from Norway suggests bacterial protein may be a more consistent substitute for fish meal than plant-based proteins. Several Norwegian studies found that including plant-based proteins led to decreased growth rates and reduced final body weights compared to fish meal diets (924). In contrast, two Norwegian studies found similar growth rates when replacing up to 25% of fish meal with bacterial protein, and another reported higher growth rates with 18-36% bacterial protein (918).",

    "answer": "Several non-chemical methods show promise. Vaccinations have been shown to lead to higher survival rates after exposure to various bacteria (733). Selectively breeding for high resistance to diseases like infectious pancreatic necrosis has also increased survival levels (735). Aerobic training, particularly interval training, was found to result in higher survival rates after exposure to the same disease (740). Finally, feeding salmon a probiotic increased survival after exposure to four different disease-causing bacteria (732).",

One study found that freshwater bathing reduced the number of amoebae on gills for up to 10 days, but another replicated, controlled study found similar levels of amoebae in treated and untreated salmon (739). Another replicated study in Australia recorded lower levels of AGD in salmon kept within larger cages compared to smaller ones (742). Fallowing, however, was found to make no difference to mortality from AGD in one Australian study (1026).",
