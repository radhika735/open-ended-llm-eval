    "question": "What non-lethal methods are available to mitigate human-wildlife conflict with bats in agricultural and urban settings?",
    "answer": "Education and non-lethal deterrents are two approaches. Educating the public may lead to more positive perceptions of bats (1000). For fruit growers, using deterrent sprays, flags, or netting has been shown to reduce fruit damage by flying foxes (1953). There is also evidence that educating hunters about the ecological roles of bats can reduce their intention to hunt them (1973). In urban areas, educating homeowners about planning laws is another proposed method, though its effect on bat roost disturbance has not been studied (1931).",

This includes increasing the turbine 'cut-in' speed, where ten of twelve studies found this reduced bat fatalities (1960). Similarly, preventing turbine blades from turning at low wind speeds ('feathering') was found to reduce fatalities in five of six studies (970). Actions rated 'Likely to be beneficial' include slowing turbine blade rotation at low wind speeds, which reduced fatalities in one study (2939), and automatically reducing rotation when bat activity is high, which reduced fatalities in two studies (971).",

For caves, installing gates to restrict public access led to more or similar numbers of bats in three of four studies, and populations increased or stabilised for many Indiana bat colonies (999). However, gates can be harmful; bats were found to circle more and enter caves less after gate installation, and one study found bats lost more body mass in a gated cave (999). Similarly for mines, gates can cause bats to circle more and enter less frequently, and one study found fewer bat species entered mines after gates were installed (1963).

In terms of design, black boxes were used more than lighter colored ones, and larger boxes sometimes had higher occupancy. Concrete boxes had higher occupancy than wooden ones in one study. Specific designs like rocket boxes were preferred by Indiana bats, and multi-chambered boxes were preferred during breeding season. Regarding placement, box orientation and sun exposure were found to affect occupancy in three studies. Height was a factor in two studies but not two others. Boxes on buildings were occupied more than those on trees, and occupancy was higher in areas where bats were already known to roost. Finally, installing a greater number of boxes at a site increased the likelihood of occupation (1024).",
