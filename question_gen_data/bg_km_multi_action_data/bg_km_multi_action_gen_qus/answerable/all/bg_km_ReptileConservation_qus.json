Evidence shows successful reproduction following release for European pond turtles, some lizards, and Chinese alligators (3770, 3771, 3772). Survival rates also vary widely, from 0% for some snakes to 66-100% for some tortoises and turtles over monitoring periods of six months to two years (3770, 3771). Some released individuals, like Kemp's ridley sea turtles, have been documented surviving for over 19 years and returning to nest (3768).

In contrast, a study found that dyed bait did not reduce the capture of olive ridley, green, or loggerhead turtles (3611). Adding LED or UV lights to gillnets (not longlines) was found to reduce bycatch of green and loggerhead turtles in four studies (3554). Deploying longline hooks at depths below 22 m reduced loggerhead turtle bycatch but not leatherback turtle bycatch (3547).",

In the Philippines, engaging the community, combined with an education campaign, was followed by a decrease in crocodile killings and a population increase (3681, 3682). In Mozambique and Costa Rica, community involvement in monitoring nesting beaches was associated with decreased poaching of sea turtle eggs (3541, 3681). Introducing alternative income sources, such as turtle management projects, led fishers in St Kitts to report ceasing turtle fishing (3542). However, no studies were found that evaluated engaging landowners and volunteers to manage land for reptiles (3485).",

Restored mining areas often have lower reptile species richness and abundance compared to unmined sites, though richness can increase over time after restoration (3497). A study on Napoleon\u2019s skinks found they quickly left a restored mining site for unmined forest (3497). Specific restoration actions may be more effective. For example, creating or restoring rock outcrops has been shown to be used by multiple lizard and snake species and can increase the abundance and survival of velvet geckos (3732). Similarly, adding woody debris can increase reptile abundance in some cases, although several studies found no effect (3718).",

Lethal control of predators like raccoons, feral pigs, and foxes has been shown to reduce nest predation for both sea turtles (3671) and freshwater turtles/tortoises (3672), although one study found short-term fox control was ineffective for artificial turtle nests (3672). Artificial nest covers, such as cages, have also been effective in reducing predation on sea turtle nests in eight of fourteen studies, though results were mixed in others (3686). Similarly for tortoises and terrapins, nest covers reduced predation in two studies, but their effect on hatching success was mixed (3687). The evidence suggests both methods can reduce nest predation, but effectiveness can vary depending on the predator species, location, and specific methods used.",

In forests and woodlands, lighter grazing also led to higher lizard abundance in one study, but overall results were mixed (3492). Ceasing grazing entirely in grasslands and shrublands also produced mixed results for reptile richness and abundance in multiple studies, with some finding higher abundance in ungrazed areas and others finding no difference (3498). Similarly, ceasing grazing in forests and woodlands had mixed effects, though two of five studies found higher reptile or lizard abundance in ungrazed areas (3511).

In forests, open woodlands, and savannas, prescribed burning often resulted in similar reptile species richness compared to unburned areas, but effects on abundance were mixed, with some studies showing increases, some decreases, and some no change (3646). In grasslands and shrublands, results were also variable. Some studies found burning increased species richness while others found no effect or a decrease depending on time since the last burn (3651). Abundance was similarly mixed, though one study found small-scale patch burning increased sand goanna burrows (3651). In wetlands, only two studies were found, and both reported mixed effects on the abundance of different reptile species (3652).
