    "answer": "Studies on regularly and continuously providing supplementary food have shown mixed results, with some primate populations increasing and others declining (1526). Similarly, providing supplementary food only during resource-scarce periods has shown that a majority of chimpanzees and olive baboons survived post-reintroduction (1527). Providing supplementary food for a limited time only also has mixed results, with some populations increasing, some declining, and survival rates varying significantly across different reintroduction projects (1528). All these interventions have an effectiveness rating of 'Unknown effectiveness'.",

Providing better equipment (1476) and training (1477) to ranger patrols can improve their effectiveness, with studies showing positive outcomes like increased gorilla populations and no poaching incidents.

Reintroducing primates into habitats where the species is absent is rated 'Likely to be beneficial', with several studies showing population increases or high survival rates (1590). Allowing primates to adapt to local conditions before release shows mixed results, with some studies showing increased survival and others showing population declines or poor performance (1564). The rearing environment of captive-bred individuals is also a factor; primates born and reared in cages had poorer outcomes (e.g., higher mortality, different diet) compared to those with some free-ranging experience (1594, 1595). Fostering appropriate behaviours like foraging can help, though results are not always positive (1600). The success of reintroductions often depends on a combination of these and other interventions, such as health screening (1553) and post-release support.",

    "answer": "There is a notable difference in the available evidence. Installing rope or pole (canopy) bridges is rated as 'likely to be beneficial'. Studies found that black lion tamarins, capuchins, black howler monkeys, and multiple lemur species used these bridges to cross roads, and one howler monkey population increased after their construction (1457). In contrast, no evidence was found to assess the effects of installing green bridges (overpasses) on primate populations, so this action has an effectiveness rating of 'no evidence found' (1456).",

    "question": "What does the evidence say about the effectiveness of providing monetary versus non-monetary benefits to local communities for primate conservation?",
    "answer": "The effectiveness for both types of interventions is rated as 'unknown'. For providing monetary benefits (e.g., employment, REDD), studies show mixed results: black howler monkey numbers increased in one case, while mountain gorilla numbers declined in another, despite community development projects. In a third study, most reintroduced chimpanzees survived (1509). For providing non-monetary benefits (e.g., better education, infrastructure), the evidence is also mixed: hoolock gibbon numbers increased over five years in one study, and reintroduced chimpanzees showed high survival in another (1510).",

    "question": "Which non-lethal deterrents have been shown to be most effective at preventing crop-raiding by primates?",
    "answer": "Based on the available evidence, humans chasing primates using random loud noises is 'likely to be beneficial', as studies showed it reduced crop raiding by orangutans when used with other methods, and caused gorillas to retreat from plantations (1449). Using nets to keep primates out of fruit trees has 'unknown effectiveness' but was found in one study to reduce crop-raiding by orangutans (1442). There is no evidence to assess the effectiveness of many other non-lethal deterrents, including using bright lights, broadcasting threat sounds or alarm calls, using predator scents, or using dogs to chase primates (1450, 1446, 1447, 1448, 1444).",

    "question": "What factors are associated with successful anti-poaching efforts for primate protection?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests that a combination of factors contributes to successful anti-poaching. Conducting regular patrols is 'likely to be beneficial', with studies showing gorilla populations increased and illegal hunting decreased when patrols were implemented (1471). Patrol effectiveness is likely enhanced by providing better equipment ('likely to be beneficial'), which led to increased gorilla numbers and fewer snares in Rwanda (1476), and by providing training ('unknown effectiveness'), after which primate poaching incidents were reduced or eliminated in several studies (1477). Furthermore, implementing community control of patrols is 'likely to be beneficial', leading to reduced hunting and higher primate numbers (1482). Using monitoring surveillance strategies like SMART to guide patrols has 'unknown effectiveness' but has been associated with more gorilla and chimpanzee observations (1481).",

    "answer": "The effectiveness of relocating 'problem' animals is rated as 'likely to be beneficial'. Studies in Africa provide evidence of long-term survival. In Kenya, a controlled study found that after 16 years, most crop-raiding olive baboons that were translocated had survived, with survival rates similar to non-translocated populations (1422). In the Republic of Congo and Gabon, a study found that 84% of 'problem' western lowland gorillas that were relocated survived for at least four years (1422). There is no evidence regarding the effectiveness of relocating primates specifically to non-residential areas in general (1423).",

    "question": "What are the observed effects of establishing permanent tourism and research projects on wild great ape populations in Africa?",
    "answer": "The evidence suggests a trade-off. Running research projects and ensuring a permanent human presence is 'likely to be beneficial' for great apes, with several studies in Rwanda, Uganda, and Congo finding that mountain gorilla numbers increased over decades while being continuously monitored (1511). Reintroduced chimpanzees in the Republic of Congo also showed high survival rates with permanent researcher presence (1511). Similarly, running tourist projects shows a 'trade-off between benefits and harms'. Several studies link tourism projects to increases in mountain gorilla numbers in Rwanda, Uganda, and the Republic of Congo (1512). However, one study on Tibetan macaques in China (not Africa) found intensive tourism led to increased stress and 100% infant mortality in some years, highlighting potential harms (1512).",
