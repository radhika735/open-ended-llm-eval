    "question": "What is the evidence for the effectiveness of making fishing gear acoustically reflective versus attaching acoustically reflective objects to deter marine mammals?",
    "answer": "Using acoustically reflective fishing gear materials, such as those infused with iron-oxide or barium sulfate, is rated as 'likely to be beneficial' and has been found to reduce entanglements of harbour porpoises in two of three studies (2807). However, one study found it did not reduce dolphin entanglements (2807). In contrast, attaching acoustically reflective objects like metallic bead chains to nets did not reduce dolphin entanglements, and acrylic beads on hooks did not reduce predation by sperm whales, making this action 'unlikely to be beneficial' (2806).",

    "answer": "Evidence suggests that prohibiting the hunting of marine mammal species is beneficial, with multiple studies showing increased abundance of harbour seals and humpback whales after hunting bans were introduced (2780). Legally protecting habitats is also likely to be beneficial, with studies showing increased survival rates for Hector's dolphins and population increases for Mediterranean monk seals (2915). Setting and enforcing vessel speed limits is rated as likely to be beneficial for reducing collision deaths of manatees and North Atlantic right whales (2777). Ceasing activities that cause disturbance in sensitive areas is also likely to be beneficial, having increased harbour porpoise activity in one study (2917).",

    "answer": "Acoustic devices have demonstrated both benefits and harms, resulting in a trade-off. At aquaculture sites, some studies found they reduced predation by seals, while others found no effect (2775). On fishing gear, they have been shown to reduce entanglements of porpoises, dolphins, and whales in some studies, and also to reduce damage to catches by seals and dolphins (2808). On fishing vessels, they have been found to cause avoidance behaviour in dolphins and killer whales but were not effective at reducing predation by Risso's dolphins (2815). Deployed on moorings, they have reduced the presence of seals and porpoises and reduced predation, but effects on humpback whales were not significant (2816). However, the background information for these actions consistently notes that these high-intensity sounds can cause hearing damage, displace mammals (including non-target species) from important habitats, and contribute to noise pollution (2775, 2808, 2815, 2816, 2896). In specific applications, such as deterring mammals from noisy construction sites, they have been effective at reducing mammal presence but again carry the risk of habitat exclusion (2896).",
