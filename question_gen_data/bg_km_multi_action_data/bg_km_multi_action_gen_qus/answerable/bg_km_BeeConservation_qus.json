    "question": "What actions can be taken on farmland to provide nesting sites for bees?",
    "answer": "Several actions can provide nesting sites. Creating patches of bare soil has been shown to be colonized by ground-nesting solitary bees [13]. Increasing areas of rough grassland can attract nest-searching queen bumblebees [12]. Evidence is mixed on whether reducing tillage benefits ground-nesting bees, with one trial showing more squash bees on no-till farms and another showing no difference [11]. Artificial nest sites, such as drilled wooden blocks or hollow stems, are also readily occupied by many species of solitary bees [47], though artificial nest boxes for bumblebees have shown highly variable and often low uptake rates [48].",

    "question": "Which field margin management strategy in the UK appears most beneficial for foraging bumblebees?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests that sowing uncropped field margins with wild flowers is a highly beneficial strategy. Five replicated trials in the UK showed these margins support a higher abundance and often higher species richness of foraging bumblebees compared to cropped edges, grassy margins, or naturally regenerated margins [19]. Sowing margins with an agricultural nectar and pollen mix, typically including legumes, also attracts significantly more foraging bumblebees than grassy or cropped margins [18]. In contrast, uncropped margins left to naturally regenerate had inconsistent benefits and were sometimes reliant on weed species [20], while simple grass strips showed mixed results [14].",

    "question": "What are the observed effects of providing artificial nest sites for different types of bees?",
    "answer": "The effects vary significantly by bee type. Artificial nest sites for solitary bees, such as drilled wood blocks or hollow stems, are readily occupied by many species, with 29 of 30 trials showing occupancy [47]. In contrast, providing artificial nest boxes for bumblebees has had mixed results, with many recent trials in the UK showing very low uptake rates (0-2.5%), although older studies and those using underground boxes reported higher occupancy (10-58%) [48]. For stingless bees, one trial testing nest boxes in Brazil found no uptake at all [49].",

    "question": "What are the potential negative impacts or limitations associated with providing and managing bee populations in artificial nests?",
    "answer": "Providing artificial nest sites can have several drawbacks. For solitary bees, nest boxes can be attacked by parasites and predators, with mortality rates in some studies as high as 56% [47]. These boxes can also be colonized by introduced, non-native bee and earwig species, which sometimes occupy them more commonly than native bees [44, 47]. Similarly, bumblebee colonies introduced to the wild in nest boxes can suffer high rates of social parasitism by cuckoo bees [52]. Furthermore, efforts to manage commercial hives to be disease-free have had mixed success; for example, the antibiotic fumagillin was found to be ineffective against Nosema bombi infection in managed bumblebees [42].",

    "question": "How does sowing field margins with a native wild flower mix compare to an agricultural nectar mix for benefiting bumblebees?",
    "answer": "Both actions can benefit bumblebees, but native mixes may be preferred by certain species. Sowing with an agricultural mix, often including perennial legumes, attracts significantly more foraging bumblebees than grassy or cropped margins [18]. However, one trial showed that a mix of agricultural forage plants attracted more bumblebees than a perennial wildflower mix, at least in the first year [18]. Conversely, a different trial found that common long-tongued bumblebee species strongly preferred plots with a perennial wildflower seed mix over a mix of annual forage plants [19]. A limitation of agricultural legume mixes is that their value to bumblebees may degrade, requiring them to be re-sown every few years [18].",

    "question": "On farmland, what are alternatives to sowing flower patches for enhancing wild bee populations through agri-environment schemes?",
    "answer": "Besides sowing dedicated floral resources [17], several other agri-environment scheme options exist, with mixed evidence. Four trials have shown enhanced bee diversity or abundance on land under various European agri-environment schemes compared to conventionally-managed land [24]. Specific options include reducing the intensity of meadow management by delaying mowing and reducing agrochemical use, which two trials found enhanced bee numbers and diversity [22]. Another option, reducing summer cattle grazing intensity, was shown in one trial to increase the abundance of cavity-nesting bees and wasps [23]. Converting to organic farming has equivocal evidence, with some studies showing higher bee abundance and diversity, and others finding no significant difference [25].",

    "question": "What is the evidence for the effectiveness of habitat restoration on bee communities in the UK?",
    "answer": "The evidence for habitat restoration in the UK shows some positive outcomes, but is limited to certain habitats. For grasslands, restoring species-rich grassland was found to attract more nest-searching queen bumblebees than unmanaged grassland in one Scottish trial [8]. For heathlands, two trials in Dorset indicated that long-term restoration can restore a bee community similar to that on ancient heaths, though the associated parasite community remained impoverished even after 15 years [9]. There is currently no evidence captured on the impact of re-planting native forest on wild bee communities or populations [35].",

    "question": "What factors are associated with the success or failure of rearing bumblebees in captivity for conservation?",
    "answer": "Several factors influence the success of captive rearing. The pollen diet is critical; one trial showed that feeding buff-tailed bumblebee colonies freshly frozen pollen produced larger, healthier queens and colonies than dried pollen [50]. The protein content of pollen also affects the number of offspring produced [50]. Artificial light regimes can reduce the time taken for queens to lay eggs [50]. Hibernation conditions are also important, with one study suggesting that queens should be over a certain weight and hibernated for four months or less for a good chance of survival [50]. Once reared, the success of colonies introduced to the wild can be hampered by high rates of social parasitism [52].",

    "question": "How does the effectiveness of creating foraging habitat for bees on farmland vary by location or landscape context?",
    "answer": "The effectiveness of creating foraging habitat can vary. Ten trials in Europe and North America found that planting dedicated floral resources, such as phacelia, attracted substantial numbers of wild bees, but one trial in Greece found phacelia was not very attractive [17]. The surrounding landscape also plays a role; one UK trial showed that planted perennial leguminous herbs were more attractive to bumblebees in landscapes with a higher proportion of arable farming [17]. Another large trial showed that the abundance of long-tongued bumblebees on field margins was positively correlated with the number of pollen and nectar agri-environment agreements in the wider landscape (a 10 km grid square) [21].",

    "question": "What is the typical timeframe to see benefits for bees after creating new nesting or foraging habitats?",
    "answer": "The timeframe for results varies by intervention. Some actions yield results quickly; artificially exposed areas of bare soil can be successfully colonized by ground-nesting bees within the first or second year [13]. Other actions show benefits over a slightly longer period; the number of occupied solitary bee nests at a site can double over three years with repeated provision of nest boxes [47]. In contrast, some habitats take much longer to recover. For example, while bee communities on restored lowland heath can become similar to those on ancient heath, the community of associated bee parasites remained impoverished even 15 years after restoration began [9]. Additionally, the value of some interventions, like margins sown with agricultural legumes, may degrade and need refreshing every few years [18].",
