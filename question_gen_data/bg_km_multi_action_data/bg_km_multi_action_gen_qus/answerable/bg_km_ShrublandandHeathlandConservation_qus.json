    "answer": "The effectiveness for all methods of controlling bracken is rated as 'Unknown effectiveness'. Using herbicide alone was found in one study to increase heather biomass, but two other studies found it did not increase heather cover (1652). Cutting bracken also showed mixed results, with some studies finding an increase in heather cover or biomass, while others found no increase (1653). Combining cutting and herbicide application also had mixed results, with one study finding an increase in heather cover while another found no effect on heather biomass (1654). All three methods have been shown to reduce bracken biomass or cover in at least one study (1652, 1653, 1654).",
