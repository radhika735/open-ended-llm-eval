    "answer": "Adding topsoil from other shrublands is rated as 'likely to be beneficial' for increasing the cover of heathland plant species (1686). Sowing seeds of shrubland species is also rated as 'likely to be beneficial' for increasing shrub cover (1698). The effectiveness of other actions like stripping topsoil (1685), or adding peat to the soil (1705) is currently unknown based on the available evidence.",

    "question": "In UK heathlands, how do different methods for controlling bracken, such as cutting, using herbicide, or both, compare in their effectiveness?",
    "answer": "The effectiveness for all methods of controlling bracken is rated as 'Unknown effectiveness'. Using herbicide alone was found in one study to increase heather biomass, but two other studies found it did not increase heather cover (1652). Cutting bracken also showed mixed results, with some studies finding an increase in heather cover or biomass, while others found no increase (1653). Combining cutting and herbicide application also had mixed results, with one study finding an increase in heather cover while another found no effect on heather biomass (1654). All three methods have been shown to reduce bracken biomass or cover in at least one study (1652, 1653, 1654).",

    "question": "What are the effects of managing livestock grazing intensity on shrubland vegetation?",
    "answer": "Managing livestock grazing intensity has varied effects on shrubland. Fencing to exclude livestock is 'likely to be beneficial', with several studies finding it increased shrub cover or biomass, though some studies found no change or even a decrease (1545). Reducing livestock numbers is considered 'beneficial', as multiple studies showed this increased shrub abundance or cover, although a couple of studies found no effect (1607). Conversely, increasing livestock numbers has 'unknown effectiveness'; some studies reported a decline in shrub cover, while others noted increases in seedlings or had mixed results (1628).",

    "answer": "Several actions with 'unknown effectiveness' are available. These include applying herbicide to trees, which in some studies increased plant diversity and the abundance of heather seedlings (1629). Cutting trees can increase the density of heather seedlings and herbaceous plant cover, though one study found it did not increase cover of native woody plants (1630). Using grazing to control trees was found in one study to reduce tree basal area, but it also reduced the cover of common heather (1634). Finally, using prescribed burning may reduce the basal area of trees but can also negatively impact heather cover (1721).",

Alternative physical methods, all with 'unknown effectiveness', include cutting or mowing, which showed mixed results for heathland plants and did not always increase shrub seedling abundance (1638). Raking was found to reduce the cover of both invasive and native grasses (1640). Using grazing or altering livestock type had mixed effects on heather and grass cover in different studies (1646). Finally, stripping turf was found in one study to increase the number of heathland plants (1647).",
