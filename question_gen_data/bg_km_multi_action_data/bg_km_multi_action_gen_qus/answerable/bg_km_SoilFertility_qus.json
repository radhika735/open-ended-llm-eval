    "answer": "Evidence suggests multiple actions can boost soil life. Using crop rotations with legumes (857), adding mulch (887), converting to organic farming (895), and applying a mix of organic and inorganic fertilizers (902) have all been shown to increase the numbers or diversity of soil organisms.",

    "answer": "Both actions show benefits. Incorporating crop residues or straw was found to increase microbial biomass, soil organic carbon, and reduce erosion (907, 910). Adding manures also increased microbial biomass, soil organic carbon, and crop yields, however, one study noted that it could lead to higher nitrate leaching (911).",

Other options include retaining the crop residues in the field (907) or actively incorporating them into the soil (910), both of which can increase soil organic matter and microbial biomass.",

    "answer": "There is evidence for several practices on sandy loam soils. Five studies found adding mulch increased soil stability and reduced erosion (887). Planting grass or shrub hedgerows was also found to reduce soil erosion in three studies (744). Additionally, some studies on tillage found that reduced tillage systems lowered soil loss compared to conventional ploughing (906).",

    "answer": "The success of soil amendments depends on several factors. Success can be influenced by combining amendments with other treatments, such as adding fertilizer when retaining crop residues (907). The type of amendment (e.g., farmyard vs poultry manure) and the timing of application (winter vs autumn) can affect outcomes like nutrient loss (911). Furthermore, the application rate of composts (889) and the application method for chemical amendments (909) have also been shown to be important.",
