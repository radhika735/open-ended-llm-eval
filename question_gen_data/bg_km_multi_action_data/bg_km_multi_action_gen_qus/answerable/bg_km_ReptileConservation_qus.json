    "question": "What actions can be taken to protect reptile nests from predation?",
    "answer": "Actions to protect reptile nests from predation include controlling predators through lethal means (3671, 3672) or relocation (3676), and physically protecting nests using artificial covers (3686, 3687), camouflage (3691), or fencing (3677). Chemical deterrents (3694), visual deterrents (3692), and conditioned taste aversion (3695) have also been studied, though with limited success in some cases.",

    "question": "What are the observed outcomes of releasing captive-bred reptiles into the wild?",
    "answer": "The success of releasing captive-bred reptiles varies. Evidence shows successful reproduction following release for European pond turtles, some lizards, and Chinese alligators (3770, 3771, 3772). Survival rates also vary widely, from 0% for some snakes to 66-100% for some tortoises and turtles over monitoring periods of six months to two years (3770, 3771). Some released individuals, like Kemp's ridley sea turtles, have been documented surviving for over 19 years and returning to nest (3768). However, a global review found only 32% of reptile release projects resulted in an established population (3770, 3771, 3772, 3773).",

    "question": "For reptile conservation in forest habitats, how do prescribed burning and vegetation cutting compare as management tools?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests that managing vegetation with cutting in forest habitats resulted in similar reptile species richness and abundance compared to unmanaged areas (3713). Prescribed burning in forests also showed similar species richness to unburned areas in seven studies, though some studies found higher reptile abundance or mixed effects depending on the species (3646). A combination of burning and cutting was found in some studies to result in higher reptile abundance compared to areas that were only burned or left unmanaged (3655).",

    "question": "What is the evidence for the effectiveness of different physical interventions to reduce reptile road mortality?",
    "answer": "Several interventions to reduce reptile road mortality have been studied, but with mixed results. Installing barriers can reduce the number of dead turtles found on roads (3500), but combining barriers with crossing structures has shown mixed results, with four of seven studies finding no reduction in mortality (3507). Standalone tunnels and culverts also showed no effect on road mortality in three studies (3508). Using signage has shown mixed results for reducing snake and turtle deaths, though it was more effective when combined with other measures like fencing (3524). Manually removing turtles from a road, in combination with a fence and artificial mounds, was associated with fewer turtle deaths (3523). There was no evidence found for the effectiveness of reducing speed limits (3501).",

    "question": "How do the effects of modifying livestock grazing regimes on reptile populations vary across grasslands, forests, and wetlands?",
    "answer": "The effects of modifying grazing vary by habitat. In grasslands, one study found lighter grazing was associated with higher lizard abundance, while another found survival of Texas horned lizards was higher in moderately grazed sites (3490). In forests, one of seven studies found lighter grazing led to higher lizard abundance, but others found mixed or no effects on abundance and richness (3492). In wetlands, one study in France found that moderate density autumn\u2013winter grazing combined with autumn\u2013spring marsh flooding resulted in higher abundance of European pond turtles compared to other grazing and flooding combinations (3496).",

    "question": "To reduce sea turtle bycatch in fisheries, what are the most effective gear modifications?",
    "answer": "Several gear modifications show promise for reducing sea turtle bycatch. Using circle hooks instead of J-hooks reduced sea turtle bycatch in seven of ten studies, and using fish bait instead of squid bait reduced bycatch in four of five studies (3559, 3612). In contrast, a study found that dyed bait did not reduce the capture of olive ridley, green, or loggerhead turtles (3611). Adding LED or UV lights to gillnets (not longlines) was found to reduce bycatch of green and loggerhead turtles in four studies (3554). Deploying longline hooks at depths below 22 m reduced loggerhead turtle bycatch but not leatherback turtle bycatch (3547).",

    "question": "What are the conservation benefits of engaging local communities in reptile protection?",
    "answer": "Engaging local communities has shown several benefits for reptile conservation. Community-based management of fishing in Brazil led to higher river turtle abundance (3681). In the Philippines, engaging the community, combined with an education campaign, was followed by a decrease in crocodile killings and a population increase (3681, 3682). In Mozambique and Costa Rica, community involvement in monitoring nesting beaches was associated with decreased poaching of sea turtle eggs (3541, 3681). Introducing alternative income sources, such as turtle management projects, led fishers in St Kitts to report ceasing turtle fishing (3542). However, no studies were found that evaluated engaging landowners and volunteers to manage land for reptiles (3485).",
