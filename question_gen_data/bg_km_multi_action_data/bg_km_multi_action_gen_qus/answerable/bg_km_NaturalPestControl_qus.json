    "question": "What are the comparative effects on natural enemies of allowing natural regeneration of ground cover versus using grazing for pasture management?",
    "answer": "Allowing natural regeneration of ground cover was found to increase natural enemies in two of five studies, though three found mixed effects (720). In contrast, using grazing instead of cutting for pasture management had mixed effects on natural enemies in two studies and no effect in another (885).",

    "question": "Which actions are most beneficial for attracting natural enemies to crops?",
    "answer": "Push-pull systems (753) and growing non-crop plants that produce attractive chemicals (724) appear beneficial. Two studies found push-pull systems had more natural predators (753), and three of four studies found planting chemically-attractive non-crop plants increased natural enemies (724). Using manufactured attractive chemicals directly also showed positive effects, but they were more variable (754).",

    "answer": "The effects are varied. Adding hedges had no effect on crop spiders in one study (752). Alley cropping increased some natural enemies (wasps, spiders) but decreased others (ladybirds) and was found to increase pests in two studies (718). Beetle banks were found to increase predators in adjacent crops in a review, but other studies showed slow movement or no effect on predation, while pests were sometimes reduced (729).",

    "answer": "Several interventions show potential negative economic impacts. Organic farming was found to have a negative effect on yield in one study and decreased profit in another without a price premium (717). Alley cropping was found to lower both yield and profit in one study (718). Incorporating plant remains that produce weed-controlling chemicals can inhibit crop growth and negatively affect yield (728).",

    "question": "Besides converting to organic farming, what are alternative strategies for reducing insecticide applications while maintaining pest control?",
    "answer": "One alternative is to apply pesticides only when pests reach damaging threshold levels; this reduced the number of applications in nine studies (750). Another is to alter the timing of insecticide use, for example by spraying earlier in the season (723). For specific crops like potatoes, using crop rotation has been shown to reduce the need for insecticide treatments (719).",

    "question": "What is the evidence for managing ant populations in orchards to improve natural pest control?",
    "answer": "The evidence suggests two distinct strategies. Excluding pest-protecting ants from trees is 'likely to be beneficial', with studies finding fewer pests and greater parasitism, though effects on the wider natural enemy community were varied (886). Conversely, for beneficial predatory ants, a single study found that isolating their colonies in cashew trees led to lower pest damage and higher yields (773).",

    "answer": "Several interventions have shown time-limited effects. The benefits to natural enemies from allowing natural ground cover regeneration were found to be short-term in one study (720). The weed-suppressing effect of incorporating certain plant remains into the soil did not last beyond a few weeks in two studies (728). Similarly, the increase in natural enemies from using threshold-based spraying lasted as little as three weeks in one study (750).",
