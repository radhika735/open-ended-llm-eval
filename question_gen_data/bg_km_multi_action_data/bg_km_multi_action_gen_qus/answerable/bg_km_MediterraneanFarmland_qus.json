    "question": "What are the most beneficial actions for improving soil fertility on Mediterranean farmland?",
    "answer": "Several actions are rated as beneficial for soil fertility. Growing cover crops in arable fields can increase soil organic matter, nitrogen, and beneficial soil organisms (1345). Adding compost is found to increase organic matter, nutrients, and microbial biomass (1362). In orchards or vineyards, maintaining ground cover also increases organic matter and can reduce soil erosion (1367). Using reduced tillage instead of conventional tillage is beneficial, with studies showing increases in organic matter, nutrients, and microbial biomass (1371).",

    "question": "In arable fields, how do no-tillage and reduced tillage compare to conventional tillage for crop yields?",
    "answer": "The evidence for crop yield is mixed and shows trade-offs. For no-tillage, some studies found higher crop yields compared to conventional tillage, but others found lower or inconsistent yields, leading to an overall rating of 'Likely to be ineffective or harmful' for crop production (1355). Similarly, reduced tillage resulted in higher cereal, fruit, or vegetable yields in some studies, but lower or similar yields in others, leading to a 'Trade off between benefit and harms' rating (1359).",

    "answer": "Growing cover crops has multiple benefits but also significant drawbacks. On the positive side, it is beneficial for soil fertility, with studies showing more organic matter and nutrients (1345), and it is likely to be beneficial for pest regulation by reducing weeds (1394). However, it is rated as 'Likely to be ineffective or harmful' for crop production, as six studies found lower cash crop yields (1351). For water, there is a trade-off: cover crops can reduce water loss through runoff but can also use more soil water, leaving less for the cash crop (1357).",

    "question": "What actions can be taken on Mediterranean farmland to support pollinators?",
    "answer": "Based on the evidence, planting hedgerows and flowers are the most effective actions to support pollinators. Planting hedgerows is rated as 'Beneficial', as it was found to increase native bee visitation to crops, leading to higher seed-set, and also supported more bee and syrphid fly species (1407). Planting flowers is 'Likely to be beneficial', with studies showing it attracted more pollinators to crops and supported more wild bee species (1406). Other actions like using no-tillage or maintaining ground cover have unknown effectiveness for pollination (1405, 1404).",

Studies found benefits for some species, with higher abundance or diversity of birds and mammals in excluded areas. However, other species were negatively affected, including some reptiles and butterflies (1417). For plants, results were highly variable: thirty-two studies found higher biomass or cover in excluded areas, but fourteen found lower biomass or cover. Effects on plant species diversity were also inconsistent (1417). For pests, one study found more gopher activity in ungrazed sites (1403).",
