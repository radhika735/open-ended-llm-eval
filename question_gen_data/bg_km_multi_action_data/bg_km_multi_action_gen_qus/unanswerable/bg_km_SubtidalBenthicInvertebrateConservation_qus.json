    "question": "Is it more beneficial for subtidal benthic invertebrates to bury new pipelines or to leave existing ones in place after decommissioning?",
    "answer": "This question cannot be answered using the provided information. The database includes actions for both burying pipelines (Action 2056) and leaving them in place after decommissioning (Action 2059). However, both actions have an effectiveness rating of 'No evidence found'. Since no studies were found to evaluate the effects of either intervention on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations, it is impossible to compare their effectiveness.",

While the database provides effectiveness ratings for various actions to mitigate fishing impacts, such as ceasing bottom trawling (Action 2099) or prohibiting all towed gear (Action 2102), it contains no information regarding the economic costs, financial implications, or overall cost-effectiveness of implementing any of these conservation measures.",

    "answer": "It is not possible to answer this question with the provided information. The database outlines several potential management strategies for drill cuttings, including ceasing their deposit (Action 2062), disposing of them on land (Action 2063), removing them after decommissioning (Action 2064), and burying them in the seabed (Action 2066). However, every one of these actions is rated as 'No evidence found', meaning there is no scientific evidence in the document to support one practice over another.",
