    "answer": "Based on the available evidence, three actions are rated as 'Likely to be beneficial' for restoring shrublands. Allowing shrubland to regenerate without active management after events like fire has been found to increase shrub cover or biomass in five trials (1679). Adding topsoil from intact shrubland sites to restoration areas increased the cover or abundance of heathland plant species in multiple studies (1686). Finally, sowing seeds of shrubland species has been shown to increase shrub cover in five of six studies across the UK, South Africa, and the USA (1698).",

Using herbicide (1643) is rated 'Unlikely to be beneficial' as it did not affect shrub seedling numbers in two studies and had mixed effects in another.

Cutting trees (1630) was found in one study to increase the density of heather seedlings but not mature plants. Applying herbicide to trees (1629) was found to increase plant diversity and heather seedling abundance in two studies, but another found it did not increase shrub cover. Combining the two actions by cutting and then applying herbicide (1636) increased heather seedling abundance in one study, but another study found it did not alter heather cover when compared to cutting alone.

To control tree succession, one alternative is to cut the trees (1630), which one study found increased heather seedling density.
