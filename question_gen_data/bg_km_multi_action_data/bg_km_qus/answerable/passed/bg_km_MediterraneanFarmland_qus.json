Using organic fertilizer instead of inorganic may also help, with eight studies showing an increase [1366].",

Using fewer grazers also has mixed results on plant cover and diversity [1418]. Using grazers to manage vegetation (compared to no grazing) can increase cover of some plants and species diversity, but can also decrease cover of other plants and increase non-native species [1419]. Using seasonal grazing can also have differing effects on plant cover depending on the timing [1421].",

    "answer": "Several actions can influence nutrient loss. Growing cover crops in arable fields was found to reduce nitrate leaching (1357). Planting or maintaining ground cover in orchards and vineyards can reduce nitrogen and phosphorus in runoff (1382). Planting buffer strips may also reduce nitrate in runoff from pastures (1387). Conversely, some soil additions can increase nutrient loss. Adding compost, manure, sewage sludge, or slurry can lead to increased nitrogen, phosphorus, or potassium in runoff or leached water (1377, 1378, 1379, 1380). Using organic fertilizer instead of inorganic can reduce nitrate loss in some cases (1381).",
