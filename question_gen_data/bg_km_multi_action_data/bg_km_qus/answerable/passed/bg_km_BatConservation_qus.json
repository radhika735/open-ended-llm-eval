    "question": "How effective are different types of road crossing structures, like underpasses, overpasses, and gantries, for bats?",
    "answer": "The effectiveness of road crossing structures for bats varies by type. Underpasses and culverts are used by bats, though often a proportion of bats still cross over the road above them (976). Overpasses are also used, but studies found that up to three-quarters of bats crossed the road below at traffic height or at other locations (977). Bat gantries appear unlikely to be beneficial, with studies showing that fewer bats used them than crossed the road at a dangerous height (978). In contrast, a single UK study found that a green bridge was used by 97% of bats crossing a road (979).",

    "question": "What are the most effective operational modifications to wind turbines to reduce bat fatalities?",
    "answer": "Several operational modifications have been shown to be beneficial for reducing bat fatalities. Increasing the turbine 'cut-in' speed resulted in fewer bat fatalities in ten of twelve studies (1960). Similarly, preventing turbine blades from turning at low wind speeds, known as 'feathering', reduced fatalities in five of six studies (970), and slowing blade rotation at low wind speeds reduced fatalities in one study (2939). Automatically reducing blade rotation when bat activity is high also led to fewer fatalities in two studies (971). In contrast, using ultrasonic deterrents to keep bats away from turbines has shown mixed results and its effectiveness is unknown (968).",

Overall, agri-environment schemes were found to be unlikely to be beneficial, with two of three studies finding no significant difference in bat activity between scheme farms and conventional farms (962). For specific practices, managing hedges by trimming them less frequently resulted in more bat species and higher activity for some species in one study, but another found no difference in pipistrelle activity (1943). Retaining unmown field margins also showed no difference in pipistrelle activity compared to conventional farms (1940).

On the positive side, restricting public access at caves can lead to increased or stable bat numbers, with some colonies showing population increases (999). On the negative side, gates at caves can cause bats to lose more body mass during hibernation and alter their flight behaviour, causing them to circle more before entering (999). Similarly, for mines, gates led to fewer bats or fewer species being present, with bats again observed circling more and entering less frequently (1963). In one case, bats abandoned four mines fitted with a specific 'ladder' design gate (1963).",

One review found newly built roosts were four times less likely to be used by returning bats than retained roosts (949). Relocating access points also had mixed success, with one study finding fewer bats using the roost after relocation, and another finding success depended on the access point's design (946).
