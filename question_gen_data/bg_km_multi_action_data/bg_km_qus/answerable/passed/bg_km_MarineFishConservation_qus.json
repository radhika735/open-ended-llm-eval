    "question": "How do long-term and temporary fishery closures compare in their effects on marine fish abundance?",
    "answer": "Evidence for a direct comparison is limited and neither action consistently showed strong positive effects across all species. Studies on long-term closures found mixed results, with some showing a higher abundance for only one of seven species monitored and others showing increases only for young salmon (2655). For temporary closures, one study found no increase in the biomass of spawning cod compared to fished areas (2664).",

    "answer": "Prohibiting all fishing in 'no-take' Marine Protected Areas generally has positive effects. A majority of studies found higher fish species richness, diversity, and abundance compared to fished areas (2682). In contrast, MPAs where limited fishing exceptions are permitted showed less benefit, with studies finding lower species richness and similar or lower fish biomass and density compared to unprotected areas (2681). Ceasing just commercial fishing yielded mixed results on abundance and diversity (2667).",

    "question": "Besides changing hook type in longline fisheries, what other gear modifications can reduce unwanted catches of sharks and rays?",
    "answer": "Modifying the overall longline configuration is a potential alternative. Evidence suggests that using nylon instead of wire hook attachments or using weights to increase the gear's sinking rate can reduce unwanted catches of sharks and rays (2699). In contrast, systematic reviews found that using different types of bait did not affect the number of unwanted sharks and rays caught (2700).",

    "answer": "Evidence from the North Sea indicates several gear modifications can reduce unwanted catches. Using a topless trawl was found to reduce catches of unwanted Atlantic cod and larger haddock (2712). Separator trawls helped smaller cod to escape (2711). Modifying the position and size of a mesh escape panel in a trawl improved size-selectivity of haddock and whiting but had no effect for haddock when mesh size was increased (2717). Other studies found that different twine types (2710) or decreasing the codend circumference (2706) improved size-selectivity for haddock and cod, while reducing the main body size of a trawl net did not (2705).",

    "answer": "Mesh escape panels fitted to diamond mesh trawl nets improved size selectivity for species like Atlantic cod and haddock in several studies, though some found no effect (2716). Size-sorting escape grids also improved the size-selection of haddock in two of three studies, but not for saithe or cod (2720). There is no evidence reported on the effect of large supported escape openings (like Fisheyes or Bigeyes) on size-selectivity; studies on these devices focused on reducing the overall volume of unwanted catch (2723).",

    "answer": "The effectiveness appears to vary by region. In the Mediterranean Sea, prohibiting towed bottom gears led to higher biomass and recruitment of red mullet (2673). In the Indian Ocean, prohibiting seine nets resulted in higher overall fish catch rates (2673). In contrast, studies in the North Atlantic Ocean found that prohibiting bottom trawling did not increase haddock survival or recruitment (2673), and prohibiting both mobile and static bottom gears had no effect on fish densities (2654). Similarly, a study in the North Pacific found varied effects on fish densities among different species (2654).",
