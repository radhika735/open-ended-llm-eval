    "question": "To restore peatlands afforested for commercial forestry, how does simply cutting the trees compare to cutting trees and also rewetting the peat?",
    "answer": "Both actions are rated as likely to be beneficial. Cutting forest plantations alone was evaluated in four studies, which found it increased cover of some herbs like cottongrass and sedges, and increased overall plant species richness in fens (1731). Combining tree removal with rewetting has been evaluated in eleven studies and was found to change plant community composition, increase wetland-characteristic plants, and increase cover of Sphagnum moss and herbs like cottongrass. However, effects on overall plant richness were mixed in these studies (1732).",

    "question": "What does the evidence say about the effectiveness of creating or retaining habitat corridors for conserving peatland vegetation?",
    "answer": "The evidence base is very limited. No studies were found that evaluated the effects of creating habitat corridors in developed areas (1720), in areas of energy production or mining (1739), or across service corridors (1742). One study in a tropical peat swamp in a farmed area found that a forest corridor contained a high density of trees and 18-29 tree species, but the effectiveness is rated as unknown (1730).",

    "question": "What management options are available to mitigate damage from human recreational access on peatlands, and is there any evidence for them?",
    "answer": "Several options exist to manage human access, but evidence for their effectiveness is scarce. Actions include restricting vehicle use (1749), physically excluding vehicles (1750), restricting pedestrian access (1751), physically excluding pedestrians (1752), installing boardwalks (1753), and encouraging the use of snowshoes to prevent trampling (1754). Of these, only physically excluding vehicles has been evaluated, with one study in a fen finding that fencing off airboat trails allowed vegetation biomass and plant diversity to recover to levels of undisturbed fen (1750). No studies were found for the other actions.",

    "question": "What are the documented benefits and negative impacts of using prescribed fire as a peatland management tool?",
    "answer": "The evidence shows a trade-off between benefits and harms. Some studies suggest benefits, such as using fire to control problematic plants like heather (1774) or to reduce tree/shrub cover (1763, 1774). Two studies found burning increased plant species richness or diversity (1763). However, there are documented negative impacts. Two other replicated studies found that burning reduced or limited plant species richness (1774). The background information also cautions that uncontrolled burns can damage seed banks, Sphagnum mosses, and the peat itself (1763, 1774).",

    "question": "What are the typical effects of rewetting on the vegetation of drained peatlands?",
    "answer": "Rewetting is rated as a beneficial action based on thirty-six studies. It typically leads to changes in plant community composition, with drier grassland communities being replaced by wetland-characteristic communities (1756). The evidence shows that rewetting generally increases the cover of Sphagnum moss (twelve studies) and key herb groups such as sedges and cottongrasses (twenty-one studies). Conversely, it often reduces tree and shrub cover (ten studies). The effect on overall plant species richness is mixed, with some studies reporting increases while others found no effect or even a reduction (1756).",

    "question": "For degraded peatlands, how do the effects of completely excluding livestock compare to reducing grazing intensity?",
    "answer": "Excluding livestock from degraded peatlands is rated as 'likely to be beneficial' (1734). Studies indicate it can increase shrub cover and vegetation biomass, but often has no effect on key herb groups like cottongrasses or on Sphagnum moss cover. In comparison, reducing grazing intensity has 'unknown effectiveness' (1735). A single study found that lower intensity grazing resulted in greater total vegetation, shrub, and cottongrass cover, along with higher vegetation biomass.",
