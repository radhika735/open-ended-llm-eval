    "question": "When managing pastureland for natural pest control, is it better to delay mowing/grazing or to use grazing instead of cutting?",
    "answer": "The evidence suggests neither action is clearly beneficial for natural enemies. Delaying mowing or grazing has 'Unknown effectiveness'; one study found fewer predatory spiders, while others found no change or mixed effects on insect predators (727). Using grazing instead of cutting is rated 'Likely to be ineffective or harmful', with studies finding mixed or no effects on natural enemy populations (885).",

    "question": "What are the overall effects of altering pesticide application strategies to benefit natural enemies?",
    "answer": "Altering pesticide strategies can benefit natural enemies. Delaying herbicide use (774) and altering the timing of insecticide use (723) have both been shown to increase natural enemy numbers in some studies. Switching to a threshold-based spraying regime can also increase natural enemies, though effects may be temporary. This approach consistently leads to fewer pesticide applications and can lower production costs without necessarily reducing profit (750).",

    "answer": "The evidence suggests growing non-crop plants that produce attractive chemicals is 'likely to be beneficial', with studies finding higher numbers of natural enemies, decreased pests, and increased crop yield (724). In contrast, the effectiveness of planting new hedges is rated as 'unknown effectiveness'; one study found no effect on crop spiders, and effects on natural enemies in the hedge itself were variable (752).",

Using mixed pasture can reduce weeds compared to monocultures (721). Some studies found more weeds under organic farming (717). Incorporating plant remains with weed-controlling chemicals has shown mixed results and can harm crops (728). Alley cropping also had mixed effects on weeds (718), while push-pull systems were found to reduce witchweeds (753).",

    "answer": "Leaving part of a crop unharvested was found to increase the abundance of predatory insects or spiders in the uncut area itself (725). Beetle banks were also found to have more invertebrate predators than the surrounding crops (729). However, predator movement from beetle banks to crops was found to be small or slow, and one study found that greater beetle activity in fields did not improve pest predation (729).",

Push-pull cropping systems, which combine trap and repellent crops, were found in two studies to increase parasitism of stem borer larvae (753). Excluding pest-protecting ants from trees resulted in greater pest parasitism in one study and at one of two sites in another (886). Using chemicals to attract natural enemies was also found to increase parasitism in a review and two of five studies (754). Using mass-emergence devices for natural enemies increased parasitism at one of two sites in an urban study (775).",
