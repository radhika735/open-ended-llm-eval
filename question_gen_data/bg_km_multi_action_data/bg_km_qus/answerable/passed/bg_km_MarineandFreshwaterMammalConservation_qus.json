    "question": "How does the evidence for using acoustic devices to reduce human-wildlife conflict at aquaculture systems compare to their use on fishing gear?",
    "answer": "Both interventions are rated as a 'Trade off between benefit and harms'. At aquaculture systems, four of six studies found that acoustic devices reduced predation on caged salmon by seals and sea lions (2775). For wild fisheries, acoustic devices on fishing gear were found to reduce damage to fish catches and/or nets in five of six studies (2808). While effective for reducing conflict, both interventions carry the risk of causing hearing damage or excluding mammals from important habitats.",

    "answer": "Using fishing gear made from acoustically reflective materials is rated as 'Likely to be beneficial'. Two out of three controlled studies found that nets made from iron-oxide or barium sulfate resulted in fewer entanglements of harbour porpoises (2807). In contrast, attaching acoustically reflective objects like metallic bead chains to gear is rated 'Unlikely to be beneficial', as one controlled study found this method did not reduce dolphin entanglements (2806).",

    "answer": "The evidence suggests several direct management interventions can be beneficial. Rescuing and releasing stranded or trapped mammals is rated 'Beneficial', with multiple studies showing high survival rates post-release (2924). Rehabilitating and releasing injured animals is 'Likely to be beneficial', with many studies showing post-release survival of various species for up to five years (2925). Translocating mammals is also 'Likely to be beneficial' for boosting populations, with studies on Hawaiian monk seals showing good survival and reproduction rates (2930). Using drugs to treat parasites is 'Likely to be beneficial', with one study showing reduced mortality in seal pups (2861). Hand-rearing orphaned young has a 'Trade off between benefit and harms' rating due to mixed success in survival after release (2926).",

    "question": "What are the potential negative impacts associated with using acoustic deterrent devices for marine mammal conservation?",
    "answer": "Across multiple applications, the use of acoustic devices is consistently associated with potential harms. High-intensity sounds can cause hearing damage to both target and non-target mammal species (2775, 2748). These devices can also disrupt important behaviours or exclude mammals from critical habitats and migration routes (2808, 2815, 2816). The use of multiple devices within an area can lead to significant cumulative noise pollution (2775).",

Studies in the Bay of Fundy and the North Sea found these nets resulted in fewer entanglements of harbour porpoises compared to conventional nets (2807). Using acoustic devices (pingers) on fishing gear also reduced entanglements of harbour porpoises and other small cetaceans in multiple studies in the North Atlantic and North Sea (2808). However, this action is rated as a 'Trade off between benefit and harms' due to potential negative impacts of the noise on mammals.",

Using methods to dampen noise, such as bubble curtains during pile driving, resulted in a smaller decrease in harbour porpoise detections compared to sites without dampening (2901). Using ‘soft start’ procedures for seismic airguns led to a greater proportion of cetaceans moving away from vessels compared to when airguns were not firing (2897). No evidence was found for the effectiveness of reducing hammer energy (2900) or delaying operations when mammals are detected (2898).",

Three studies found that after educational tours or exhibitions, participants were more willing to change their behaviour, donate to conservation, or save entangled dolphins (2935). Training tourist guides led to fewer harbour seals being disturbed during excursions (2840). The presence of an official-looking volunteer at a viewing site resulted in fewer tourists harassing seals (2844), and engaging policymakers led to the designation of a protected area for manatees (2934). However, one study found that information signs alone did not reduce the number of tourists approaching or disturbing seals (2843).",
