    "question": "What actions can be taken to mitigate the impacts of roads on amphibian populations?",
    "answer": "Several actions have been studied. Installing culverts or tunnels, often with barrier fencing, can decrease road deaths (884, 756). Road closures during migration periods are also protective (842). Modifying gully pots can significantly reduce the number of newts that fall in (782). In contrast, using volunteers to assist amphibians across roads has been found to be unlikely to be beneficial, with populations still declining (784), and the effectiveness of warning signage is unknown (841).",

    "question": "How do different partial harvesting methods in USA forests compare to clearcutting in their impact on salamander populations?",
    "answer": "A meta-analysis found that partial harvesting, including shelterwood harvesting and thinning, resulted in smaller reductions in salamander populations than clearcutting (851, 852). Studies comparing specific methods found shelterwood harvesting resulted in similar or higher salamander abundance than clearcutting (851). However, other methods like leave-tree harvesting or harvesting in small groups did not result in higher salamander abundances compared to clearcutting (846, 844). Both partial harvesting and clearcutting typically decreased salamander abundance compared to unharvested forest (844, 846, 851, 852).",

    "question": "What are the potential benefits and harms of controlling fish populations to protect amphibians?",
    "answer": "Controlling fish can be beneficial for amphibians. Eliminating fish by drying out ponds or catching them has been shown to increase amphibian species numbers, abundance, and breeding success (826, 827). However, the methods used can have harmful side effects. Using rotenone to eliminate fish can cause mortality in frogs and negative effects in newts (828). Additionally, fish removal by catching is not always successful, with populations sometimes remaining or returning quickly (827).",

    "answer": "Studies from the UK, USA, and Europe show that public engagement can be beneficial. Engaging volunteers to manage land or collect data has been linked to increased natterjack toad and Taipei frog populations (777) and has involved thousands of volunteers who restored habitats and submitted numerous records (760, 777). Education programmes have been shown to increase students' knowledge and improve attitudes towards amphibians (776), and awareness campaigns have reached large audiences and helped create new ponds (831).",

    "question": "What are the overall success rates for establishing new amphibian populations through translocation or the release of captive-bred individuals?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests that these actions are often successful. A global review of translocations found that 65% resulted in established breeding populations (854). Success varies by species; for example, translocated wood frogs established breeding populations in 25-50% of ponds (856), while great crested newts established populations in 37-75% of cases (858). For captive-bred releases, one review found 41% of programmes showed evidence of breeding for multiple generations (871). However, success is not guaranteed, with some programmes, like those for the green and golden bell frog, failing to establish stable populations (872).",

    "question": "As an alternative to direct antifungal treatment of amphibians, what environmental management actions can reduce the threat of chytridiomycosis?",
    "answer": "There are several environmental interventions aimed at controlling the chytrid fungus. Adding salt to ponds has been shown to keep frog populations free of chytridiomycosis for a period (762). Other approaches include attempting to remove the fungus from ponds by drying them, though one study found this did not eradicate the disease (766). Adding certain antifungal bacteria to the soil has been found to reduce infection rates in salamanders (764). Sterilizing equipment between sites is also a key preventative measure to avoid spreading the fungus, although its direct effect on disease spread between populations has not been assessed (768).",
