    "question": "To mitigate the impacts of logging in forests, how does shelterwood harvesting compare to thinning trees or harvesting in small groups for amphibian conservation?",
    "answer": "Shelterwood harvesting appears to be a more beneficial alternative to clearcutting than other partial harvest methods. Compared to clearcutting, shelterwood harvesting resulted in higher or similar salamander abundance (851). In contrast, harvesting trees in small groups (844) or using leave-tree harvesting (846) did not result in higher amphibian abundance than clearcutting. Thinning trees had mixed results; some studies found it resulted in a less negative response than clearcutting, but others found it decreased abundance compared to unharvested forest (852).",

Temporarily closing roads during migration seasons is rated as likely to be beneficial and has been shown to protect large numbers of amphibians (842). Installing culverts or tunnels can significantly decrease road deaths, particularly when combined with barrier fencing to guide animals towards them (884, 756).

Many studies also confirm that a wide range of amphibian species will use the tunnels, especially when guided by barrier fencing (756, 884). However, there are negative impacts and limitations. Certain designs can be unsuitable; for instance, one-way tunnels with vertical chutes caused high mortality, and steel culverts were found to have high metal concentrations in condensation (884). Furthermore, not all amphibians will use the tunnels, and one study noted that thousands of amphibians were still killed on the road even with these structures in place (884).",

For amphibians generally, the scale of the translocation is a key factor, with projects moving over 1,000 animals being more successful (854).
