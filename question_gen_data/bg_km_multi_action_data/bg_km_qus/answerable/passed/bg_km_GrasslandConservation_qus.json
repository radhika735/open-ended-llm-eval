    "question": "When restoring grasslands, how do the outcomes of simply disturbing the soil before seeding compare to removing the topsoil entirely?",
    "answer": "Both methods of site preparation can benefit grassland restoration, but evidence suggests removing topsoil may have more comprehensive positive effects. Disturbing soil before sowing was found to increase plant and seedling species richness in one of two studies and increase forb cover in another study (3413). In contrast, removing topsoil before seeding was found to increase plant species richness, the species richness of sown plants, and the plant community's similarity to intact steppe. It also increased the survival of seedlings and plants in two studies (3415).",

    "question": "What are the documented effects of adding soil amendments like charcoal, sulphur, or carbon before or after seeding on grassland vegetation?",
    "answer": "Studies show varied effects from these soil amendments. One study found adding charcoal before sowing increased the cover of legumes but did not alter overall plant biomass or grass cover (3422). Adding sulphur before sowing reduced plant species richness and overall vegetation cover in one of two studies, although low amounts did increase the cover of some sown species (3428). Adding carbon to soil after sowing either reduced or did not alter the density of sown forb species, according to two studies in the USA (3433).",

One site comparison study found that sowing grass seeds at a higher density reduced the cover of native grassland shrubs (3405). More generally, studies on sowing grass seeds (not specifically at high density) found that this action could reduce native grass cover or the abundance of native forb species (3397).",

    "question": "In European grasslands, how does post-seeding management by mowing compare to livestock grazing for enhancing sown species?",
    "answer": "Based on evidence from Europe, mowing after seeding appears more consistently beneficial for sown species than grazing. Studies in the UK and Germany found that mowing after sowing increased the richness and/or abundance of sown species (3419). In contrast, one UK study found that grazing with cattle after sowing reduced the cover of sown species compared to grazing with sheep, while another found that grazing with livestock reduced overall plant species richness compared to cutting vegetation (3423).",

Two replicated studies in the USA found that removing topsoil before planting or sowing increased the survival of seedlings and plants (3415). For soil disturbance, one of two studies found it increased seedling survival, while the other found ploughing did not alter the survival of planted species (3413). One study found adding woody debris did not affect seedling survival (3421). There is currently no evidence available to assess the effect of burning vegetation before seeding on survival (3417).",

Across the UK, Switzerland, and Belgium, five of six studies found that sowing parasitic plants like yellow rattle or marsh lousewort increased plant species richness and/or diversity (3404). A study specifically in Switzerland found that sowing European yellow rattle led to a decrease in grass cover but did not alter forb cover. In Belgium, one controlled study found that sowing marsh lousewort increased the abundance of six target plant species (3404).",

One replicated study found that hydroseeding increased the abundance of half of the sown plant species compared to drill seeding (3412). Conversely, other studies found that in most cases, sowing seeds with a seed drill led to no change or a reduction in the abundance of sown plants compared to hydroseeding (3410). One study did find drill seeding increased the density of two sown grass species compared to sowing by hand (3410).",
