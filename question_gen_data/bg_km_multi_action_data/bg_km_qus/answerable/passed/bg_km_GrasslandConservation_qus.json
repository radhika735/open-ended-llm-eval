Disturbing the soil before sowing was found to increase plant emergence in four of five studies, but one study found no change in overall species richness or diversity (3413). Removing topsoil before seeding has been shown to have broader community-level benefits, with studies finding it increased plant community similarity to intact grasslands, increased overall plant species richness, and increased the survival of seedlings and plants (3415).
