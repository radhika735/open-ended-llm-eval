    "question": "Which is more effective for improving soil organic matter: retaining crop residues or incorporating fresh plant material from elsewhere?",

Six studies found this action increased carbon levels [910], whereas two trials found retaining in-situ crop residues increased soil organic carbon and nitrogen [907].",
