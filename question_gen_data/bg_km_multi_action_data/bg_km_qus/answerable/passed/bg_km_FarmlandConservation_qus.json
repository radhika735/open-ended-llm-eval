    "question": "What is the comparative effectiveness of planting grass buffer strips versus creating uncultivated margins for farmland wildlife?",
    "answer": "Both planting grass buffer strips and creating uncultivated margins are rated as 'Beneficial' for farmland wildlife, though they benefit different groups in slightly different ways. Planting grass buffer strips has been found to increase arthropod abundance and diversity, benefit birds by increasing their numbers and foraging time, and also benefit small mammals (246). Creating uncultivated margins through natural regeneration also supports higher invertebrate numbers (including bees) and greater plant diversity compared to conventionally managed margins. They have also been shown to support more small mammal species than meadows (63). However, some studies note that plant species richness in naturally regenerated margins can decline over time (63).",

    "question": "What does the evidence from UK studies show about the effects of reduced tillage on farmland wildlife?",
    "answer": "UK studies form part of a wider body of European evidence on reduced tillage which is rated as 'Likely to be beneficial' (126). This evidence indicates that reducing tillage has positive effects on earthworms, some other invertebrates, weeds, and farmland birds. Specifically, a small replicated trial in the UK found that fields with broadcast tillage had more birds from the 'Farmland Bird Index' than non-inversion tillage fields. UK studies have also found higher Eurasian skylark nest density and greater abundance of seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in winter on fields with reduced tillage (126).",

    "question": "What are the documented benefits and potential drawbacks of providing supplementary food for farmland birds?",
    "answer": "The provision of supplementary food is rated as 'Likely to be beneficial' and has several documented positive effects. Studies found it can increase farmland bird abundance, breeding population size, body mass, and overwinter survival (648). However, the evidence also highlights inconsistencies and potential drawbacks. Five replicated UK studies found no clear effect on breeding abundance, reproductive success, or survival of stable house sparrow populations. One study in Sweden even found lower fledging rates in nests that received supplementary food in one year. The effectiveness and use of supplementary food can also vary between bird species, region, and time of year (648).",

    "answer": "Creating new habitat features has shown significant, mostly positive, effects on invertebrates in European farmland. Planting nectar flower or wildflower strips is rated as 'Beneficial', with forty-one studies from eight European countries finding they had a positive influence, leading to increased invertebrate abundance and species richness (442). Creating beetle banks is 'Likely to be beneficial'; studies from the UK and Denmark found they can increase invertebrate densities, though effects can vary between seasons and invertebrate groups (651). Planting new hedges has also been shown to support higher abundance and diversity of beetles and spiders compared to crop fields (538).",

    "question": "What non-chemical methods are available for managing invasive or problematic plant species on European farmland?",
    "answer": "Several non-chemical methods for managing invasive and problematic plants have been documented. Mechanical controls such as cutting can be used for bracken (105) and giant hogweed, where removing flower heads at peak flowering has been shown to dramatically reduce seed production (104). For creeping thistle, effective methods include cutting and the use of biological controls like fungal pathogens and weevils (123). Grazing is another effective technique; lenient grazing can provide long-term control of creeping thistle (123), and specific livestock breeds like Hebridean sheep have been found to graze purple moor grass (123). For general scrub control, both cutting and grazing are options (127), and mowing or flail cutting combined with grazing has been used to control purple moor grass in moorland restoration projects (650).",

    "question": "How does restoring species-rich semi-natural grassland compare to restoring traditional water meadows in terms of benefits to plant communities?",
    "answer": "Both restoring species-rich semi-natural grassland and traditional water meadows can successfully restore plant communities using similar management techniques. For water meadows, successful techniques include topsoil removal, introducing target plant species, raising water levels, grazing, and mowing (119). Seventeen studies found one or more of these techniques to be successful in restoring wet meadow plant communities. Similarly, for species-rich semi-natural grasslands, effective restoration techniques include grazing, introducing plant species, hay spreading, and mowing (133). Forty studies found that ten different techniques, used alone or in combination, were effective. Both interventions show that a combination of management practices can lead to the restoration of desired plant communities.",

    "answer": "The timeframe for seeing positive changes in plant communities during grassland restoration varies. For species-rich semi-natural grassland, evidence suggests a range of outcomes: six studies saw positive signs of restoration in less than five years, eleven studies reported positive signs within ten years, and two studies found restoration took more than ten years (133). However, other studies found that changes can be slow or limited, with differences in vegetation still present between restored and existing species-rich grasslands 60 years after restoration (133). Similarly, for traditional water meadows, while some positive effects on plant communities were found within five years, other studies noted that restoration was not complete after five, nine, or even 20 years (119).",

    "question": "How does delaying mowing on grasslands compare with leaving uncut strips of rye grass in silage fields for benefiting UK farmland wildlife?",
    "answer": "Both actions show benefits, particularly for birds. Studies in the UK found that delaying mowing dates resulted in benefits for plants, invertebrates, and birds, including increased Eurasian skylark productivity (131). Similarly, UK studies found that leaving uncut strips of rye grass on silage fields benefited birds by increasing their numbers, although effects on insect-eaters were more variable (132). Delaying mowing had no clear effect on ground beetle communities in some studies (131), while uncut rye grass plots showed higher ground beetle species diversity in the third year of one experiment (132).",

    "answer": "Both interventions are beneficial. All studies on skylark plots found positive effects, including increases in Eurasian skylark population size, breeding density, and success (540). Some studies also found benefits for plants and invertebrates within these plots (540). Larger uncropped, cultivated plots (lapwing plots) also provide benefits, including increased hatching success for northern lapwings and nesting success for skylarks, along with benefits for rare arable plants and some invertebrates (562). Both interventions appear effective for their target species and can offer wider biodiversity gains. However, one study found fewer seed-eating birds on fallow plots for ground-nesting birds in some regions (562), while another found no significant difference in some invertebrates or seed-eating songbirds between skylark plots and conventional crops (540).",

Trapping appears effective for reducing American mink populations, leading to localized water vole expansions (107). Evidence for controlling bracken shows that the herbicide asulam can be effective but may harm moss species (105). In contrast, for several other species, 'no evidence' has been captured for their control benefiting farmland wildlife, including grey squirrels (106) and wild deer (111). Similarly, limited evidence exists for scrub control, with one study finding a negative relationship between scrub control (and other interventions) and young grey partridge numbers (127).",
