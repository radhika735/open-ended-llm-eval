    "answer": "Applying herbicides like glyphosate and diquat has been found to reduce or eradicate Crassula helmsii [1279]. Similarly, physical methods have shown success; covering the plant with black sheeting or carpet strips can eradicate or severely reduce its cover, and using seawater has also been shown to eradicate it in several trials [1294, 1288]. However, one study noted that after initial eradication with black sheeting, Crassula helmsii progressively recolonized the site [1294].",

    "question": "What are the most beneficial actions for controlling American bullfrog populations in small ponds?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests several beneficial actions. Introducing native predators like the northern pike can lead to a strong decline in bullfrog tadpole numbers [1039]. Direct removal of juveniles using methods like double fyke nets in small, shallow ponds can be effective, especially as part of a combined treatment [1046]. Direct removal of adults through methods like shooting can also significantly reduce their numbers, although populations may rebound rapidly following intensive removal [1045]. Finally, certain chemicals like caffeine or chloroxylenol have been found to kill American bullfrogs in controlled studies [1048].",

    "answer": "The outcomes of using herbivores for biological control are mixed. For floating pennywort, a South American weevil caused feeding lesions but did not reduce the plant's biomass in field trials, making it unlikely to be beneficial [1123]. In contrast, for water primrose, a flea beetle was found to cause heavy feeding destruction and significantly reduce its abundance, suggesting this approach is likely to be beneficial [1135]. For parrot's feather, the introduction of grass carp reduced its abundance in some studies, but not in others, while a leaf-feeding beetle reduced its growth, indicating a trade-off between benefits and harms [1599].",

Mechanical removal and regular cleaning of industrial pipes can permanently remove or reduce clam numbers, as can the addition of a sand filter [1119]. Altering water conditions is another option: exposing clams to high temperatures (36°C or higher), which may be feasible in industrial facilities, leads to high mortality [1116]. Other methods shown to be effective in wider settings include mechanical suction dredging, which can reduce clam densities by 96% [1120], and placing gas-impermeable barriers on the bed of a waterbody [1117].",

    "question": "What factors influence the success of physical removal for invasive plants like skunk cabbage and water primrose, which can regenerate from fragments?",
    "answer": "The success of physical removal often depends on the scale of the infestation and the thoroughness of the removal process. For skunk cabbage, annual removal of recently established plants over five years was successful, but a twice-yearly program on a large infestation was less effective [1101]. For water primrose, hand-pulling failed to reduce a large population but did eradicate a smaller one at the margins of a pond [1138]. Similarly, for floating pennywort, removal was ineffective in one study because the growth rate exceeded the rate of removal, while another study greatly reduced its cover with mechanical removal followed by monthly hand-picking, but did not achieve eradication [1126]. The key factor is the ability to remove all fragments, as incomplete removal can lead to regeneration and continued spread.",

    "question": "What are the documented benefits of using combined control measures, such as trapping with predator encouragement for crayfish or herbicide with physical removal for invasive plants, in ponds and streams?",
    "answer": "Combined control measures have been shown to be beneficial and more effective than single methods. For red swamp crayfish, combining trapping with the introduction of predators significantly reduced populations in a pond and was more effective than predation alone (1031). For water primrose, a combination of glyphosate application and mechanical removal achieved a 75% kill rate, while another study found that combining herbicide, physical removal, and other actions reduced coverage by 85-90% (1140). Similarly, for Crassula helmsii, covering the plant with carpet before treating it with glyphosate killed 80% of the plant (1313).",

For Procambarus crayfish, replicated studies in Italy found that eels reduced population size, and a French study found pike also predated them (1030). For American bullfrogs, the introduction of northern pike in a Belgian study led to a strong decline in tadpole numbers (1039).

Similarly, five studies found that covering the plant with lightproof barriers like black sheeting or carpet strips also eradicated or severely reduced its cover. However, it was noted that C. helmsii progressively recolonized two of the sites after initial eradication using lightproof barriers (1294).",

    "question": "What factors, such as the specific chemical used or application method, influence the success of herbicide treatments for invasive aquatic plants like skunk cabbage, water primrose, and parrot's feather?",
    "answer": "The choice of chemical and the use of adjuvants are critical factors. For skunk cabbage, studies showed conflicting results for glyphosate, while 2,4-D amine was found to be effective (1102). For water primrose, effectiveness was enhanced by using an adjuvant like TopFilm with glyphosate, which increased mortality from 97% to 100% in one study (1139). For parrot's feather, the specific herbicide is important; one study found 2,4-D more effective than diquat or glyphosate (1606), another found triclopyr more effective than glyphosate (1689), and other studies confirmed that while many herbicides are effective, some like fluridone and clopyralid are not (1699).",

A Polish study found that dewatering habitat by lowering water levels in sand killed three species of invasive shrimp (1094). Increasing salinity was also found to kill the majority of invasive shrimp within five hours in one study (1091). The least effective technique appears to be altering pH; a UK lab study found that lowering the pH did not kill invasive killer shrimp and this method is rated 'Unlikely to be beneficial' (1093).",
