Two replicated trials showed that organic management led to higher soil carbon levels [895].

Applying cotton gin compost and poultry manure improved soil structure in one trial (891). Growing cover crops was found to improve soil structure by increasing porosity and interconnectivity (898). Additionally, incorporating straw (910) or applying manure and compost (911) can lead to better soil structure and larger soil aggregations. The effects of tillage are mixed; while some studies show reduced tillage can improve soil organic matter, others found it increased compaction (906).",

One UK before-and-after trial found that incorporating straw using discing (a reduced tillage method) did not improve anaerobic conditions in compacted soils (910). A broader review of tillage practices shows that reduced tillage often maintains or increases soil organic matter, though results can be inconsistent (906). Another UK study found that delaying manure application until winter reduced nitrate loss, which is related to soil organic processes (893).",
