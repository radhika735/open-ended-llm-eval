    "question": "What actions are available to improve butterfly and moth habitats in urban areas?",
    "answer": "Several actions have been studied. Altering mowing regimes on greenspaces to be less frequent has been found to increase butterfly species richness and abundance (3841). Planting parks and gardens with appropriate native species can also increase the richness of butterflies and moths (3842). Protecting existing greenfield sites like native forests and grasslands in urban areas has been shown to support higher butterfly species richness than urban parks or non-native plantations (3836). In contrast, establishing 'green infrastructure' like green roofs was found to support lower butterfly richness and abundance compared to urban parks (3837). Wildlife-friendly gardening practices have shown mixed results, with some studies finding no increase in butterfly abundance from actions like reduced weeding (3834).",

    "question": "How do different methods of opening up forest canopies, such as coppicing, thinning, and patch clearing, compare in their effects on butterfly and moth communities?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests these methods can benefit different parts of the lepidopteran community. Clearing patches in forests was found to increase butterfly species richness but could decrease moth species richness compared to closed-canopy forest (3938). Coppiced woodlands were found to have greater butterfly species richness than unmanaged woodland but lower macro-moth richness than mature forest (3939). Thinning trees, often along with prescribed burning, was found to increase the species richness and abundance of butterflies compared to unmanaged woodland (3940). Different communities of butterflies and moths were supported by coppiced woodland of different ages (3939), and wider woodland rides created by clearing contained more unique macro-moth species than standard rides or mature forest (3938).",

    "answer": "The effectiveness of agri-environment scheme options varies. Overall, farms managed under such schemes often have higher abundance of butterflies and moths than conventional farms (3915). Sown wildflower strips are particularly effective, showing higher abundance of butterflies compared to conventional field margins or cropped fields (3932). Similarly, grass margins managed with restrictions on fertilizer and pesticide use showed greater moth abundance than conventional margins (3894). Unsprayed headlands also had a greater abundance of butterflies than sprayed headlands (3898). In contrast, options like beetle banks (3927) and uncropped cultivated margins (3923) have shown mixed or limited benefits for butterfly and moth abundance.",

    "question": "Which fire management strategies appear most beneficial for butterfly populations in open habitats?",
    "answer": "Strategies that create a mosaic of burned and unburned areas seem most beneficial. Leaving unburned patches during prescribed burning was found to increase the abundance of Karner blue butterflies and was associated with higher abundance for six out of nine specialist butterfly species in another study (3879). Rotational burning, for example every 2-5 years, can also be beneficial, with studies finding higher butterfly abundance in prairies burned more than 1-4 years ago compared to recently burned areas (3883). The timing of burns is also important; one study found that early season burning increased caterpillar abundance, whereas late season burning did not (3878). A single prescribed burn can increase the abundance of some species like the heath fritillary, but decrease it for others like the regal fritillary (3882).",

    "question": "How does the effectiveness of converting to organic farming for butterflies vary depending on the surrounding landscape?",
    "answer": "The surrounding landscape context appears to be a key factor in the effectiveness of organic farming. Evidence from Sweden and the UK shows that organic farms had greater butterfly and burnet moth species richness and abundance than conventional farms, but this was only observed in intensively managed landscapes, not in more diverse landscapes (3907). Furthermore, both organic and conventional farms located within a landscape with a high proportion of organic farms had higher butterfly and burnet moth species richness than either farm type in a landscape dominated by conventional farms (3907). This suggests that the benefits of on-farm organic practices are greatest in otherwise simple agricultural landscapes.",

After logging, naturally regenerating forests were found to have the highest butterfly abundance and species richness 12–25 years after felling (3876). When restoring arable land to permanent grassland, butterfly communities showed increasing similarity to high-quality grasslands over the first 10 years (3929). However, another study on grassland restoration found that species richness was higher on grasslands created less than 10 years ago compared to those over 20 years old (3929). For restored forests, one study found a 54-year-old restored forest had a similar butterfly community to remnant forest, while 11–22-year-old restored forests did not (3936).",

    "answer": "Reducing or ceasing management on grasslands has mixed effects that vary by species and the specific action. Ceasing grazing or mowing can benefit some species but harm others; one review found that ceasing grazing benefitted 6 out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern (3956). In some cases, abandoned grasslands had a higher abundance of certain butterfly and moth species than grazed or mown grasslands (3956, 3957). Conversely, reducing grazing intensity by lowering stocking density was found to increase the abundance of butterflies and moths in several studies (3959). Similarly, reducing cutting frequency from multiple times a year to once a year was found to increase the abundance of some pollinators, including butterflies (3961). Overall, less intensively managed grasslands (e.g., lower grazing/mowing, no fertilizer) tend to have higher species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths than conventionally managed ones (3958).",

For orchards, managed and abandoned traditional orchards had similar butterfly and burnet moth species richness, but abundance was lower in managed orchards (3917). For vineyards, encouraging native plants and reducing insecticide use increased butterfly abundance but not richness in one study, while another found reduced chemical use increased richness (3919). For bioenergy crops, planting a diverse mix of species led to greater butterfly species richness and abundance than planting fewer species (3918). In shaded coffee plantations, a greater diversity of caterpillars and butterflies was found compared to sun-grown monocultures (3931).",

Similarly, managing land under power lines, typically by mechanical cutting, was found to increase butterfly richness and abundance, with effectiveness depending on the time since management (3855). Stopping herbicide use on road verges also showed positive or neutral effects on richness and abundance (3899).

Using selective or reduced impact logging had mixed results on species richness but could increase butterfly abundance compared to primary forest (3867). Methods like group selection harvesting and shelterwood harvesting also had mixed effects on moth species richness compared to unharvested forest, but recovery of richness was faster after shelterwood harvesting than clearcutting (3868, 3871). Following logging, encouraging natural regeneration can lead to greater moth richness and abundance compared to plantations, and butterfly communities can become established over time (3876).",

Some translocated populations have persisted for over a decade and increased in abundance, particularly when the reintroduction is combined with habitat management such as coppicing, planting of host plants, or invasive species removal (3909, 3911). However, a significant proportion of projects fail, with populations dying out within a few years (3909). For specialist parasitic species like the large blues, the success is highly dependent on the presence and condition of specific host ant colonies at the release site; for example, caterpillar survival was found to be higher in host ant nests that did not contain a queen (3909).",

Following a single prescribed fire in open habitats, abundance of some species was higher one or more years after burning, though initial reductions can occur (3882). In prairies under a rotational burning regime, the abundance of specialist butterflies was higher on sites burned more than one, two, or four years ago, with generalist species peaking in the third year after a burn (3883).

Several studies found that maintaining semi-natural grassland with either light grazing or annual mowing resulted in similar butterfly species richness (3908). However, another study found staggered mowing was best for butterfly richness, while annual mowing was better than grazing for moth richness (3908). Long-term abandonment (ceasing grazing or mowing) often leads to a decline in species richness (3956, 3957). Prescribed fire had mixed results; one study found patch-burning led to lower butterfly richness than rotational grazing (3882).
