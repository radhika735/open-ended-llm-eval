    "question": "What actions can be taken on farmland to specifically support declining bird populations?",
    "answer": "Several actions show benefits for farmland birds. Creating skylark plots (small undrilled patches in cereal fields) has been found to increase skylark population size, breeding density, and success (540). Sowing wild bird seed or cover mixtures provides food and cover, with studies showing higher abundance, density, and species richness of birds (594). Leaving overwinter stubbles provides winter food, which is associated with higher densities of farmland birds and can increase population sizes of some species (695). Additionally, using mowing techniques such as mowing from the centre of the field outwards can significantly reduce mortality of birds like corncrakes and their chicks during harvesting (698).",

    "question": "To enhance biodiversity within agricultural grassland habitats, which actions are most beneficial?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests several actions are highly beneficial for grassland biodiversity. Restoring or creating species-rich, semi-natural grassland is rated as 'Beneficial', with numerous studies showing it results in higher plant species richness, and greater abundance and diversity of invertebrates and farmland birds compared to other grassland types (133). Another 'Likely to be beneficial' action is reducing the management intensity on permanent grasslands, which involves a combination of reducing chemical inputs and delaying mowing, with studies finding benefits for plants, invertebrates, and birds (69). Delaying the mowing or first grazing date is also 'Likely to be beneficial', leading to higher plant species richness, more insects, and increased breeding success for birds like the Eurasian skylark (131).",

Planting grass buffer strips has been found to increase arthropod abundance and diversity, benefit birds by increasing their numbers and foraging time, and also benefit small mammals (246). Creating uncultivated margins through natural regeneration also supports higher invertebrate numbers (including bees) and greater plant diversity compared to conventionally managed margins. They have also been shown to support more small mammal species than meadows (63). However, some studies note that plant species richness in naturally regenerated margins can decline over time (63).",

This evidence indicates that reducing tillage has positive effects on earthworms, some other invertebrates, weeds, and farmland birds. Specifically, a small replicated trial in the UK found that fields with broadcast tillage had more birds from the 'Farmland Bird Index' than non-inversion tillage fields.

However, the evidence also highlights inconsistencies and potential drawbacks. Five replicated UK studies found no clear effect on breeding abundance, reproductive success, or survival of stable house sparrow populations. One study in Sweden even found lower fledging rates in nests that received supplementary food in one year.

Studies from Sweden found this offered some benefits, such as higher daily survival rates for common redshank and northern lapwing nests, but also noted a risk of higher predation on adult redshanks on protected nests. Another approach is 'mosaic management', a Dutch agri-environment scheme which includes nest protection alongside other measures like delayed mowing, and was found to increase northern lapwing population trends (130). Erecting predator-proof fencing around important breeding sites is another potential intervention, but there is currently no evidence to assess its effectiveness (109).",

For creeping thistle, effective methods include cutting and the use of biological controls like fungal pathogens and weevils (123). Grazing is another effective technique; lenient grazing can provide long-term control of creeping thistle (123), and specific livestock breeds like Hebridean sheep have been found to graze purple moor grass (123). For general scrub control, both cutting and grazing are options (127), and mowing or flail cutting combined with grazing has been used to control purple moor grass in moorland restoration projects (650).",

For water meadows, successful techniques include topsoil removal, introducing target plant species, raising water levels, grazing, and mowing (119). Seventeen studies found one or more of these techniques to be successful in restoring wet meadow plant communities. Similarly, for species-rich semi-natural grasslands, effective restoration techniques include grazing, introducing plant species, hay spreading, and mowing (133). Forty studies found that ten different techniques, used alone or in combination, were effective.

However, other studies found that changes can be slow or limited, with differences in vegetation still present between restored and existing species-rich grasslands 60 years after restoration (133). Similarly, for traditional water meadows, while some positive effects on plant communities were found within five years, other studies noted that restoration was not complete after five, nine, or even 20 years (119).",

Reducing grazing intensity has been found to increase plant abundance and diversity, as well as invertebrate diversity (704). However, there are also mixed or negative effects. Reducing management intensity has, in some cases, led to the loss of certain plant species or an increase in invertebrates in more intensively managed grasslands (69). Several studies found that delaying mowing or grazing had no clear effect on plant species richness or the abundance of some insects and spiders (131).

Planting grass buffer strips (246) and wildflower strips (442) has been found to benefit small mammals by increasing activity and numbers.

    "answer": "Reducing management intensity on permanent grasslands, which often involves reducing inputs and delaying mowing, has shown numerous positive effects, including benefits for plants, invertebrates, and birds in over twenty studies (69). Specifically, stopping fertilizer inputs can increase plant species richness and invertebrate abundance (694), and delaying mowing can benefit wading bird densities and skylark productivity (131). However, there are also negative or neutral findings. Twenty-one studies found no clear effects on some wildlife groups, and some studies found that certain plant species were lost, invertebrate numbers were higher in intensively managed grasslands, and wading birds were fewer on grasslands with reduced management intensity (69).",

    "question": "To best support wading bird populations on farmland in the Netherlands, what management actions show evidence of success?",
    "answer": "Several actions show potential. The 'mosaic management' agri-environment scheme, which coordinates delayed and staggered mowing across farms, was found to change northern lapwing population trends from decrease to increase and improve black-tailed godwit productivity (130). Raising water levels in ditches or grassland is associated with increased breeding bird numbers (121). Paying farmers directly per clutch showed limited evidence for increased wading bird populations, but did result in higher hatching success for northern lapwing and black-tailed godwit in one study (146). Maintaining traditional water meadows has also been found to increase population sizes of northern lapwing and black-tailed godwit (696).",

    "question": "What are the observed outcomes of providing artificial nest boxes for different wildlife groups on farmland?",
    "answer": "Studies show mixed but generally positive outcomes. For owls, providing nest boxes in farm buildings has maintained nesting activity and increased population density (154). For other birds like kestrels and tree sparrows, nest box provision led to an increase in clutches or breeding numbers (155). For solitary bees, nest boxes are readily used and can increase local population sizes (80), but uptake by bumblebees is very low (80). However, success can be variable; one study found barn owl populations were unaffected by the number of boxes (154), and another found juvenile owls fledged from boxes were less likely to be recovered alive than those from natural sites (154).",

    "question": "In European arable fields, how does the effectiveness of creating small 'skylark plots' compare to larger uncropped 'lapwing plots' for benefiting wildlife?",
    "answer": "Both interventions are beneficial. All studies on skylark plots found positive effects, including increases in Eurasian skylark population size, breeding density, and success (540). Some studies also found benefits for plants and invertebrates within these plots (540). Larger uncropped, cultivated plots (lapwing plots) also provide benefits, including increased hatching success for northern lapwings and nesting success for skylarks, along with benefits for rare arable plants and some invertebrates (562). Both interventions appear effective for their target species and can offer wider biodiversity gains. However, one study found fewer seed-eating birds on fallow plots for ground-nesting birds in some regions (562), while another found no significant difference in some invertebrates or seed-eating songbirds between skylark plots and conventional crops (540).",

    "answer": "The evidence is mixed and often limited. For invasive non-native plants, there is evidence that removing flower heads of giant hogweed reduces seed production (104). Trapping appears effective for reducing American mink populations, leading to localized water vole expansions (107). Evidence for controlling bracken shows that the herbicide asulam can be effective but may harm moss species (105). In contrast, for several other species, 'no evidence' has been captured for their control benefiting farmland wildlife, including grey squirrels (106) and wild deer (111). Similarly, limited evidence exists for scrub control, with one study finding a negative relationship between scrub control (and other interventions) and young grey partridge numbers (127).",

    "question": "When restoring grassland plant communities on European farmland, what is the typical timeframe for observing positive changes?",
    "answer": "The timeframe for restoration varies. For species-rich semi-natural grasslands, some positive signs can be seen in less than five years, with more significant changes often occurring within ten years (133). However, some studies note that restoration can take more than ten years, and even after decades, restored sites may differ from existing species-rich grasslands (133). Similarly, when restoring traditional water meadows, positive effects on plant communities have been observed within five years, but other studies found restoration was not complete after five, nine, or even twenty years (119).",

    "answer": "Sowing flower-rich mixtures appears to be highly effective. Numerous studies found that planting nectar flower or wildflower strips had a positive influence on invertebrates, increasing abundance and species richness (442). Planting grass buffer strips, some floristically-enhanced, also increased arthropod abundance and diversity in multiple studies (246). Creating naturally regenerated uncultivated margins can also support more invertebrates than conventionally managed margins (63). Finally, unsprayed conservation headlands consistently contained higher species richness of invertebrates than conventionally sprayed areas (652). A combination of these approaches would likely provide the greatest benefit.",

    "answer": "Altering mowing regimes is generally beneficial but can have mixed outcomes. Delaying mowing often benefits plants, invertebrates, and birds like the Eurasian skylark, and was associated with the recovery of the UK corncrake population (131). Similarly, leaving uncut strips of rye grass benefits seed-eating birds and can increase ground beetle diversity over time (132). Using mowing techniques like centre-out mowing or specific machinery (e.g., bar mowers) can significantly reduce mortality for birds, mammals, and invertebrates (698). Raising the mowing height can increase skylark productivity (138). However, some drawbacks and neutral effects have been recorded. Delaying mowing has shown no clear effect on some plant and invertebrate groups in certain studies (131), raising mowing height had no effect on foraging birds in one trial (138), and providing uncut refuges did not appear to be used by skylarks in UK studies (147).",
