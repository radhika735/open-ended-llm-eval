    "question": "What are the most effective ways to manage uncropped field margins on European farmland to support bumblebees?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests that sowing uncropped field margins is more effective than leaving them to naturally regenerate. Sowing margins with a native wild flower seed mix was shown in five UK trials to support a higher abundance and often species richness of foraging bumblebees compared to cropped or grassy margins (19). Similarly, four trials showed that margins sown with agricultural nectar and pollen mixes (e.g., perennial legumes) attract significantly more foraging bumblebees than grassy or cropped margins (18). In contrast, evidence for uncropped grassy margins is mixed (14), and the value of naturally regenerated margins can be inconsistent and reliant on weed species (20).",

Twenty-nine of thirty trials showed successful occupation of nest boxes by solitary bees, with some studies showing local populations can double over three years with their provision (47). In contrast, bumblebee nest boxes show highly variable success. While some older studies showed occupancy rates of 10-48%, three recent UK trials of common surface nest box designs found very low uptake rates of 0-2.5% (48).",

However, the value of these sown margins can degrade and may require re-sowing every few years (18). Sowing with native wild flowers has also been shown to support a higher abundance and richness of foraging bumblebees compared to naturally regenerated margins, with perennial leguminous herbs being particularly important for long-tongued species (19). In contrast, while naturally regenerated margins can support more bumblebees than cropped areas, their value for bees can be inconsistent from year to year and may depend on the presence of weed species like thistles (20).",

Challenges in captivity include the importance of pollen diet, as fresh pollen led to better queen survival and larger colonies than dried pollen (50). When reintroduced to the wild, the success of laboratory-reared colonies is variable. Of four trials that monitored colonies until new queens were produced, two found very low or zero queen production, while two had good numbers (52). A significant challenge upon release is parasitism by cuckoo bees, with rates reported as high as 79% in one UK trial (52).

Increasing the use of clover leys is another possibility, though no evidence was found that this enhances wild bee populations, and one trial showed it did not attract solitary bees for nesting (16).

For bumblebees, one trial in Scotland found that grassy field margins attracted higher densities of nest-searching queen bumblebees than other habitats like cropped margins or hedgerows [12]. Evidence on the effect of reduced tillage is mixed, with one US trial finding three times more squash bees on no-till farms, while another found no difference [11].",

    "question": "What actions have been studied to mitigate the direct impacts of pesticides on wild bees?",
    "answer": "A few interventions have been studied. One study in Italy showed that avoiding repeated applications of the insecticide fenitrothion prevented a reduction in the number of solitary bee species [26]. Conversely, a trial in the USA found that the responsible use of pesticides on squash farms did not affect the numbers of foraging bees [27]. In England, creating conservation headlands (unsprayed margins within the crop) did not attract more foraging bumblebees than conventionally sprayed crop fields [29].",

    "question": "In the USA, what factors have been shown to affect the success of artificial nesting sites for solitary bees?",
    "answer": "Studies in the USA highlight several factors. The presence of competitors or predators is one: in California, introduced European earwigs were found to occupy nest boxes, but their numbers could be reduced using a sticky barrier, which increased the use of boxes by native bees [44]. In the same state, another trial found that introduced bee species sometimes occupied nest boxes more commonly than native bees [47]. On a positive note, a trial on blueberry fields found that providing nest boxes increased the estimated number of foraging Osmia bees over three years compared to fields without boxes [47].",

    "question": "What are the documented outcomes of practicing wildlife-friendly or low-intensity gardening for bees in urban areas?",
    "answer": "Studies in urban gardens show benefits for bees. In the UK, one study found more species of bumblebee in city gardens with lower management intensity, a measure reflecting less tidiness and reduced pesticide use [2]. In the USA and Canada, two trials found more wild bees (either more species or more individuals) in gardens specifically planted with bee forage or native plants compared to conventionally managed gardens [1]. Another US trial also found more bee species after bee forage plants were added to a community garden [1].",

    "question": "Beyond on-farm habitat creation, what alternative actions in other landscapes have been tested to benefit bees?",
    "answer": "Evidence shows that managing non-agricultural land can benefit bees. One trial in the USA showed that road verges planted with native prairie vegetation supported a greater number and diversity of bees than frequently mown grass verges [30]. Another US trial found more bee species under power lines managed as scrub compared to annually mown grassland [31]. In urban environments, planting gardens with bee forage or native plants has been found to increase wild bee numbers and diversity [1].",

    "question": "What is the evidence regarding the timeframe for bee colonization of newly created nesting habitats?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests that colonization of new nesting habitats can be relatively rapid. Small-scale trials showed that artificially exposed areas of bare soil were successfully colonized by ground-nesting solitary bees and wasps in the first or second year [13]. For artificial nest boxes, twenty-nine out of thirty replicated trials showed they were occupied by solitary bees [47]. Furthermore, one study demonstrated that the number of occupied solitary bee nests could double over three years at a site where nest boxes were repeatedly provided [47].",
