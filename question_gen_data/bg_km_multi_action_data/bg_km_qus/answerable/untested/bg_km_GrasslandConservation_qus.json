    "question": "What actions can be taken to increase plant species richness when restoring grassland habitats?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests several actions can increase plant species richness. Sowing seeds of parasitic plants like yellow rattle has been found to increase plant species richness and/or diversity in five of six studies (3404). Site preparation is also key; one study found that removing topsoil before sowing seeds increased plant species richness (3415). Additionally, the simple act of sowing native grass and forb seeds was found to increase overall plant species richness in sixteen of twenty-eight studies (3432).",

    "answer": "Both methods of site preparation can benefit grassland restoration, but evidence suggests removing topsoil may have more comprehensive positive effects. Disturbing soil before sowing was found to increase plant and seedling species richness in one of two studies and increase forb cover in another study (3413). In contrast, removing topsoil before seeding was found to increase plant species richness, the species richness of sown plants, and the plant community's similarity to intact steppe. It also increased the survival of seedlings and plants in two studies (3415).",
