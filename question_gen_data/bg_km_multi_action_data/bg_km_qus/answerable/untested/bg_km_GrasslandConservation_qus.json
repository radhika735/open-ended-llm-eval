    "answer": "Several site preparation techniques have been studied. Disturbing the soil before seeding has been found to increase plant emergence in most cases (3413). Removing topsoil before seeding can increase plant community similarity to target grasslands, increase species richness, and improve plant survival (3415). Applying herbicide before seeding has been shown to increase sown species richness and the cover of sown grass species (3418). Simply removing vegetation has also been found to increase the germination rate of sown species in one study (3416).",

    "question": "In North American grassland restoration, which soil preparation or amendment actions show the most promise for increasing overall vegetation abundance?",
    "answer": "Evidence from North America suggests several actions can increase vegetation abundance. Adding fertilizer alongside seeding or planting was effective, increasing vegetation cover in six of nine studies (3427). Adding topsoil from intact grasslands before seeding was also found to increase the biomass of sown species in a US study (3420). Other effective site preparation methods include applying herbicide before sowing, which increased sown grass cover (3418), and disturbing the soil, which increased forb cover (3413). In contrast, inoculating soil with mycorrhiza only showed a temporary increase in vegetation cover (3429).",

    "question": "In European grasslands, what are the effects of management interventions like mowing or grazing when applied after seeding?",
    "answer": "In Europe, post-seeding management shows generally positive but sometimes variable results. Mowing after seeding has been found to increase plant community similarity to natural grasslands, increase overall and sown species richness, and increase the abundance of sown forbs (3419). The effects of grazing with livestock are more varied; one study in Italy found it increased plant species richness compared to no grazing, while a UK study found it reduced richness compared to cutting (3423). Grazing had mixed effects on the abundance of sown species, though a UK study found winter grazing increased seedling survival (3423).",

    "question": "How does the evidence for increasing the number of species in a seed mix differ between the USA and Europe?",
    "answer": "The available evidence, though limited, suggests similar positive outcomes in both regions. In the USA, two replicated, controlled studies found that increasing the number of species in a seed mix increased the species richness of sown plants (3406). Similarly, a study in Germany found that increasing the number of species in a seed mix, when combined with using seeds from a local source, increased the species richness and cover of target plants (3406).",

    "question": "To reduce competition from dominant plants without using herbicides, what site preparation methods can be used before seeding?",
    "answer": "Several non-herbicidal methods have been tested. Removing topsoil before seeding can be effective, with studies showing it increased the species richness of sown plants (3415). Disturbing the soil by tilling or ploughing also aided establishment by increasing seedling emergence in four of five studies (3413). Mechanically removing existing vegetation increased the germination rate of sown species in one study (3416). Removing leaf litter has also been tried, but studies found it had mixed or no effects on seedling numbers (3414). Burning is another potential method, but no studies evaluating its effects before seeding were found (3417).",

    "question": "In arid areas, what are the documented benefits of using hydroseeding or irrigation alongside seeding for grassland restoration?",
    "answer": "Evidence from Spain and the USA suggests these actions can be beneficial in arid environments. Hydroseeding, which uses a slurry containing mulch, increased overall plant cover in most cases in one of two studies (3412). Direct irrigation after sowing also showed positive effects in a Spanish study, increasing vegetation cover in six of ten cases and plant diversity in four of ten cases (3430). However, a study in the USA found that irrigating after sowing native seeds did not alter plant species richness or the cover of native plants (3430).",
