    "answer": "Evidence was found for three interventions. Replacing anti-predator nets more frequently was found in one study to result in fewer salmon losses to harbour seal predation (2774). The use of acoustic deterrent devices was found to reduce predation in four of six studies, but this action has a trade-off due to potential harms to both target and non-target species (2775). Translocating fur seals away from salmon farms was found to be likely ineffective as the majority of seals returned to the farms (2776).",

Increasing the visual detectability of fishing gear (2805) and using acoustically reflective gear materials (2807) are both rated as 'Likely to be beneficial' for reducing mammal interactions or entanglements. In contrast, attaching acoustically reflective objects like bead chains to gear was found to be 'Unlikely to be beneficial' as it did not reduce dolphin entanglements in one study (2806). Using acoustic devices on gear has a 'Trade off between benefit and harms' as they can reduce entanglements but may also deter mammals from important habitats (2808).",

    "answer": "The evidence indicates a trade-off between benefits and harms. For benefits, multiple studies found that acoustic devices on fishing nets reduced entanglements of harbour porpoises (2808). For harms, the background information notes that these devices can deter mammals from important habitats, and multiple studies documented behavioural changes, with harbour porpoises approaching nets less closely or having reduced activity in the surrounding area when devices were active (2808).",

    "question": "Besides acoustic deterrents, what alternative physical modifications can be made to fishing gear to reduce porpoise and dolphin entanglement?",
    "answer": "Several physical modifications have been tested. Using fishing nets made from acoustically reflective materials (barium sulfate or iron-oxide) reduced harbour porpoise entanglements in two of three studies (2807). Installing exclusion and escape devices on trawl nets reduced the number of trapped or entangled dolphins (2823). Deploying fishing nets deeper below the water surface also resulted in fewer dolphin entanglements in one study (2793). Conversely, a study on using stiffened fishing nets found no reduction in Franciscana dolphin entanglements (2801).",
