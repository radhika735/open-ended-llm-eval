    "answer": "Several actions have been studied. Installing culverts or tunnels, often with barrier fencing, can decrease road deaths (884, 756). Road closures during migration periods are also protective (842). Modifying gully pots can significantly reduce the number of newts that fall in (782). In contrast, using volunteers to assist amphibians across roads has been found to be unlikely to be beneficial, with populations still declining (784), and the effectiveness of warning signage is unknown (841).",

    "answer": "A meta-analysis found that partial harvesting, including shelterwood harvesting and thinning, resulted in smaller reductions in salamander populations than clearcutting (851, 852). Studies comparing specific methods found shelterwood harvesting resulted in similar or higher salamander abundance than clearcutting (851). However, other methods like leave-tree harvesting or harvesting in small groups did not result in higher salamander abundances compared to clearcutting (846, 844). Both partial harvesting and clearcutting typically decreased salamander abundance compared to unharvested forest (844, 846, 851, 852).",

    "question": "What key factors are associated with the success or failure of amphibian colonization and breeding in newly created ponds?",
    "answer": "Evidence from multiple studies indicates several key factors influence the success of newly created ponds for amphibians. Successful colonization and breeding are affected by a pond's physical characteristics, including its age, whether it is permanent or ephemeral, and the extent of its vegetation cover (869). The presence of predatory fish is a major negative factor (869). Success is also strongly linked to the surrounding landscape, particularly the distance to existing ponds that can act as source populations for colonization (869). Additionally, biotic factors within the new pond can play a role; one study on natterjack toads found that while created ponds reduced mortality from desiccation compared to natural ponds, they had higher tadpole mortality from invertebrate predation (866).",

    "answer": "Evidence suggests temperature treatment is likely to be beneficial, with several studies finding that increasing temperatures to 30–37°C cured frogs and toads of chytridiomycosis (770). Antifungal treatments like itraconazole also frequently cured amphibians, but some fungicides caused negative side effects (882). Antibacterial treatments are considered unlikely to be beneficial, curing some frogs but not others (763). Similarly, using antifungal skin bacteria is rated as unlikely to be beneficial, as most studies found it did not reduce infection or death rates (764).",

    "answer": "Hormone treatments have been found to stimulate sperm or egg production in Australian frogs, but success and viability can be affected by the type and dosage of hormone used (883). Similarly, the success of artificial fertilization depends on the hormones used to stimulate egg production. One Australian study found that while 55% of eggs were successfully fertilized artificially, they died soon after (834).",

    "answer": "Retaining riparian buffer strips is likely to be beneficial, but studies show mixed effects on amphibian abundance depending on species and buffer width (747). Leaving coarse woody debris has trade-offs; migrating amphibians used clearcuts with debris more than those without, but the overall response of amphibians was more negative where debris was retained (843). Leaving standing deadwood or snags was found to be unlikely to be beneficial, as it did not result in higher salamander abundances compared to total clearcutting (845).",

    "answer": "Several actions are available to address agricultural pollution. Directly reducing or halting pesticide use, along with habitat management, was found to increase a Taipei frog population (832). Planting riparian buffer strips is an option, though one US study found this did not increase amphibian abundance (819). Agri-environment schemes that pay farmers for conservation measures are likely to be beneficial; for example, ditches managed under such schemes had higher amphibian numbers than conventionally managed ones (749, 818). Creating barriers to exclude pollutants is another potential action (771).",

    "answer": "Instead of creating new habitat, populations can be augmented directly. Translocating wild amphibians is a common technique, with global reviews finding that a majority of assessed translocations resulted in established breeding populations (854). Another method is head-starting, where wild-collected eggs or larvae are raised in captivity before release; this has been shown to successfully establish or increase frog and toad populations (881). Releasing individuals from established captive breeding programs is also an option, with a review finding that 41% of such programs showed evidence of breeding in the wild for multiple generations (871).",

Translocations have been shown to establish or maintain breeding populations, but systematic reviews suggest there is no conclusive evidence for the establishment of self-sustaining populations (858). Similarly, creating new ponds has resulted in colonization and breeding, but a review found no conclusive evidence that mitigation involving pond creation leads to self-sustaining populations (863). On-site habitat management, such as providing artificial hibernacula, was found in one study to help maintain populations (759).",

For wetland restoration, studies found that amphibian communities could be similar to those in natural wetlands, and that wetland age was not necessarily a key factor in success (879). However, the benefits of restoration may not always be long-lasting; one study found that vegetation clearance maintained a great crested newt population for the first six years, but not in the longer term (761).",
