    "answer": "Several actions are beneficial for re-establishing amphibian populations. Creating new ponds is rated as beneficial, as studies found amphibians colonized and established stable populations in them (869). Restoring existing ponds is also likely to be beneficial, with studies showing increased populations and species numbers (878). Translocating amphibians from other sites is likely beneficial, with one review showing that 65% of translocations resulted in established breeding populations (854). Similarly, releasing captive-bred amphibians is rated as likely to be beneficial (871).",

    "answer": "Shelterwood harvesting appears to be a more beneficial alternative to clearcutting than other partial harvest methods. Compared to clearcutting, shelterwood harvesting resulted in higher or similar salamander abundance (851). In contrast, harvesting trees in small groups (844) or using leave-tree harvesting (846) did not result in higher amphibian abundance than clearcutting.

    "question": "What factors influence whether newly created ponds are successfully colonized and used by amphibians for breeding?",
    "answer": "Several factors have been found to affect the successful colonization and use of created ponds by amphibians. Evidence suggests that key factors include pond age, permanence of water, vegetation cover, and the presence or absence of fish (869). The surrounding landscape context is also important, particularly the distance to existing ponds that can act as a source for colonizers (869).",

    "question": "What are the benefits and potential negative impacts of installing culverts or tunnels to help amphibians cross roads?",
    "answer": "The primary benefit of installing culverts or tunnels is a reduction in amphibian road mortality, with multiple studies finding that they significantly decreased road deaths (884). Many studies also confirm that a wide range of amphibian species will use the tunnels, especially when guided by barrier fencing (756, 884). However, there are negative impacts and limitations. Certain designs can be unsuitable; for instance, one-way tunnels with vertical chutes caused high mortality, and steel culverts were found to have high metal concentrations in condensation (884). Furthermore, not all amphibians will use the tunnels, and one study noted that thousands of amphibians were still killed on the road even with these structures in place (884).",

    "question": "Besides removing fish, what alternative management actions can be taken at ponds to benefit amphibian populations?",
    "answer": "As an alternative to direct fish removal, several other pond management actions can benefit amphibians. Pond restoration through deepening, de-silting or re-profiling can establish breeding populations or increase existing ones (817). Where ponds are heavily shaded, removing some of the tree canopy may help, although evidence is limited (758). For acidified water bodies, adding lime has been shown to increase egg and larval survival in some cases, but can also cause tadpole mortality (748). Additionally, controlling invasive aquatic plants like swamp stonecrop can help restore habitat and has been associated with increases in toad populations (823).",
