    "question": "What are the general outcomes and challenges associated with captive breeding programs for different amphibian groups like frogs, toads, and salamanders?",
    "answer": "Captive breeding outcomes vary across amphibian groups. For frogs, breeding is often successful, with many studies reporting egg production and successful rearing, though some species are difficult to maintain (835). Toads also generally breed successfully in captivity, with success influenced by environmental factors like humidity, though high mortality can occur after hatching (848, 836). Salamanders have been bred successfully, with outcomes dependent on tank habitat (838). While species like the Mallorcan midwife toad have been bred with high survival rates, long-term captive breeding can lead to negative genetic and developmental effects (837).",

    "answer": "The evidence for the effectiveness of legal and regulatory frameworks is mixed. Three reviews found that general legal protection for species was not effective at protecting populations during development (779). However, specific legislative regulation targeting the amphibian trade was found to allow the recovery of over-exploited frog populations (785). Financial incentive schemes, such as paying farmers to undertake conservation measures, appear beneficial, with studies showing they can increase amphibian populations and lead to higher species abundance in managed habitats like ditches (818).",

    "answer": "Livestock grazing on agricultural land has both documented benefits and harms for amphibians. Negative impacts include habitat disturbance, trampling, erosion, and reduced water quality (746). However, grazing can also be beneficial. For example, one study found that excluding livestock caused temporary pools to dry out much earlier, and other studies found certain frog and toad species were more abundant with grazing (746). While one study found lower toad abundance in grazed plots, five other studies found that management regimes incorporating grazing increased or maintained populations of natterjack and green toads (780).",

General pond restoration projects, which combine multiple interventions, have been shown to increase species numbers and populations, though success can be variable (878). Specific actions such as deepening, de-silting, or re-profiling ponds have led to increases in frog, newt, and toad populations (817). Reducing pond shading by removing tree canopy has shown mixed results (758). Additionally, managing existing agricultural ditches can significantly increase amphibian numbers and diversity (749).",

In contrast, antibacterial treatments (763) and the use of antifungal skin bacteria or peptides (764) are considered unlikely to be beneficial. Immunizing amphibians was found to be ineffective in one study (765), and while treating wild individuals with fungicide reduced infection levels, it did not eradicate the disease (767).

Ten site comparison studies in Canada and the USA found that restored wetlands often had similar amphibian abundance, species numbers, and composition to natural wetlands (879). Similarly, five site comparison studies in the USA found that created wetlands had similar numbers of amphibian species and abundance as natural wetlands (880). A global review that combined both interventions found that in 89% of cases, restored and created wetlands had similar or higher amphibian abundance or species numbers compared to natural wetlands (879). However, some studies for both interventions noted that species composition could still differ from natural sites (879, 880).",

In grasslands, the practice appears likely to be ineffective or harmful; studies found that annual fires decreased amphibian species numbers and abundance, with one study noting that spring burns were particularly detrimental to salamander abundance (862). In contrast, the effects in forests are more varied. Eight of 14 studies in North America found no effect of prescribed forest fires on amphibian abundance or species numbers, while others reported mixed effects, increases, or decreases depending on the species and context (877). One study found a prescribed forest fire actually increased hatching success for spotted salamanders (877).",

Removing American bullfrogs significantly increased populations of California red-legged frogs (825) and removing invasive Cuban tree frogs increased native tree frog abundance (822). In Mallorca, the removal of viperine snakes led to an increase in midwife toad larvae (830). Various methods of fish removal, including catching (827), pond drying (826), and using rotenone (828), have been shown to increase amphibian abundance, recruitment, or breeding success, though rotenone can also cause amphibian mortality. The evidence for mammal control is less clear; one study on controlling rats found no significant effect on a frog population, although a predator-proof enclosure did increase survival for another frog species (839).",

For the Mallorcan midwife toad, releases in Mallorca have been successful, with studies finding that captive-bred individuals established breeding populations at 38% to 100% of release sites (873). In stark contrast, programs for the green and golden bell frog in Australia are rated as likely to be ineffective or harmful. Studies there found that released tadpoles generally failed to establish breeding populations, with only one of four major release programs resulting in a stable population (872).

Successful colonization and breeding are affected by a pond's physical characteristics, including its age, whether it is permanent or ephemeral, and the extent of its vegetation cover (869). The presence of predatory fish is a major negative factor (869). Success is also strongly linked to the surrounding landscape, particularly the distance to existing ponds that can act as source populations for colonization (869). Additionally, biotic factors within the new pond can play a role; one study on natterjack toads found that while created ponds reduced mortality from desiccation compared to natural ponds, they had higher tadpole mortality from invertebrate predation (866).",
