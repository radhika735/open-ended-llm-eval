    "question": "What physical modifications can be made to a peatland surface to encourage natural vegetation recovery, without direct planting?",
    "answer": "Several physical modifications to the peat surface can encourage vegetation to recolonize naturally. Filling or blocking ditches (1805) and removing the upper layer of peat or soil (1809) are both rated as 'likely to be beneficial'. Studies show these actions can lead to colonization by herbs and bryophytes and increase the cover of wetland-characteristic plants. Other techniques have 'unknown effectiveness' but show some promise. These include excavating pools (1806), which were colonized but by different communities than natural pools; reprofiling or relandscaping the peatland (1807), though one study found this resulted in lower cover than natural fens; and disturbing the peat surface (1811), which encouraged colonization by wetland-characteristic species.",

    "question": "Besides mowing, what are some alternative disturbance-based management interventions for maintaining fen and fen meadow habitats?",
    "answer": "Several alternatives to regular mowing (1759) exist for maintaining disturbance in fens. Cutting large trees and shrubs (1761) is considered 'likely to be beneficial' for increasing herb cover and fen species. Using grazing (1762) has a 'trade off between benefit and harms'; it can increase some herbs but may reduce Sphagnum cover and species richness compared to mowing. Other options with 'unknown effectiveness' include using prescribed fire (1763), which has shown mixed results for reducing shrub cover and affecting species richness, and removing plant litter (1760), which had inconsistent effects on species richness in two studies.",

    "answer": "The evidence suggests amending peat soils with these substances has mixed outcomes. Adding lime to planted areas (1825) is rated as 'likely to be ineffective or harmful'. While it increased survival of planted fen mosses in one study, other studies found it reduced the survival of fen herbs and decreased the growth of Sphagnum moss and peat swamp tree seedlings. Adding inorganic fertilizer to planted areas (1826) shows a 'trade off between benefit and harms'. It can increase the growth and cover of some target species, but it can also reduce the survival of others and risks causing undesirable long-term nutrient enrichment in the peatland.",

Awareness-raising and campaigning also have 'Unknown effectiveness'.
