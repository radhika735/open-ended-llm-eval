    "answer": "Studies have found that fencing to exclude grazing is likely to be beneficial, with four of five studies showing increased survival, size, and cover of planted trees (1254). In contrast, the effectiveness of tree guards or shelters is unknown. One study found that light-coloured plastic shelters increased survival, while another found that guards increased tree height at 37 months but not 44 months (1268).",

Excluding livestock with wire fences was generally beneficial, increasing understory biomass and tree regeneration in studies from Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Israel, Mexico, Kenya, and the USA (1205). Completely preventing livestock grazing increased understory plant diversity in Brazil, the UK, and Costa Rica, and increased oak seedling density in Israel (1206). Shortening the grazing period had mixed results: it increased regenerating oak abundance in Spain, but had no effect on native plant richness in Australia. A UK study found summer grazing was better for tree seedling numbers than winter grazing (1208).",
