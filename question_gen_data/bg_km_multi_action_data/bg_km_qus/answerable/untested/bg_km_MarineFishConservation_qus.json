    "question": "What management actions are available to reduce the unwanted catch of non-target fish species in commercial trawling operations?",
    "answer": "Several actions involve modifying trawl gear to reduce unwanted catch. These include using a square mesh instead of a diamond mesh codend (2714), fitting mesh escape panels (2716), or installing size-sorting escape grids in trawls for both fish (2720) and prawns/shrimp (2721). Another approach is fitting a mesh funnel or sieve net to prawn/shrimp trawls (2722). Alternative trawl designs such as separator trawls (2711) or topless trawls (2712) can also be used to separate and release unwanted species.",

    "answer": "Several gear modifications have been studied in the North Sea. Three studies found that using an electric or pulse trawl reduced catches of non-target or undersized fish compared to standard trawls (2713). Similarly, three studies concluded that shrimp trawls fitted with a sieve net reduced unwanted fish catches (2722). Other methods have also demonstrated positive results, such as using a separator trawl to allow smaller unwanted cod to escape (2711) and using a topless trawl, which reduced discards of commercial fish species (2712).",

Three site-comparison studies and one review found that prohibiting spearfishing, sometimes along with line fishing, increased the abundance and size of various reef fish, seabass, and seabream.

Prohibiting midwater drift netting was found to increase the weights of young returning salmon (2669). Closing areas to non-towed static gears showed greater shark length for two of five species/groups (2670).
