    "question": "What actions are available to increase natural foraging behaviours in captive carnivores?",
    "answer": "Several feeding enrichment actions have been shown to increase foraging and related active behaviours in captive carnivores. Hiding food around the enclosure increased exploring and foraging in species like leopard cats, bush dogs, and sun bears [1915]. Similarly, presenting food inside objects increased these behaviours in bears [1924]. Scattering food increased locomotion in maned wolves [1921], and providing live invertebrate prey increased explorative behaviours in fennec foxes [1926]. Providing bones, hides, or partial carcasses increased activity and manipulation time in felids and foxes [1902].",

Other methods rated as 'likely to be beneficial' include hiding food in containers, which increased activity levels and foraging in lemurs and gibbons [1316], presenting food frozen in ice, which increased feeding time and decreased inactivity [1321], and presenting food items whole instead of processed, which increased time spent feeding [1323].",

    "answer": "Evidence from Australian studies suggests that several simulated changes, often in combination, can improve breeding outcomes. One study found that providing a pre-breeding cooling period, along with other interventions like separating sexes and playing mating calls, increased breeding success [1864]. Another study found that frogs only bred after being moved to an indoor enclosure with various substrates that allowed for temporary flooding, along with manipulating sex ratios and playing mating calls [1873, 1874, 1879, 1881]. Increasing caloric intake for females before breeding, separating sexes during non-breeding periods, playing recorded mating calls, and allowing female mate choice have all been associated with increased clutch sizes in Australian frogs, though typically as part of a suite of interventions [1880, 1881, 1882, 1888].",

    "answer": "The use of complex feeding devices shows a trade-off between benefits and harms. For primates, puzzle feeders were found to increase foraging behaviour and tool use, but also led to increased aggression [1318]. For carnivores, presenting food inside objects like Boomer balls decreased stereotypic behaviours in bears [1924]. However, devices simulating live prey, such as a carcass on a bungee, increased walking in cougars but also initially increased pacing in tigers [1927].",

Implementing an unpredictable feeding schedule reduced pacing in tigers and cheetahs [1904]. Altering the location of food also decreased pacing in cheetahs [1918]. Presenting food frozen in ice decreased stereotypic behaviours in felids generally [1923].

It also resulted in lower blood protein urea, zinc, and vitamin A levels in cheetahs compared to supplemented beef (1901). In contrast, commercial diets decreased crude protein digestibility in African wildcats and led to similar likelihood of gastritis in cheetahs as horse meat (1900). For ocelots and African wildcats, whole prey (chickens) resulted in lower digestible energy and organic matter digestibility compared to other diets (1901).",
