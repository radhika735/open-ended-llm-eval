    "answer": "Several techniques have been studied, with mixed results. Using herbicides has been found to reduce grass cover in some studies, but not others (1643). Cutting or mowing can reduce grass cover, but this may be temporary, and the practice has shown no effect on shrub or forb cover in several studies (1638). Other methods with unknown effectiveness include altering livestock grazing (1646), stripping turf which increased heathland plants (1647), and using prescribed fire, which one study found did not reduce the target grass but did reduce heather (1723).",

    "question": "How do the effects of using cutting or mowing to mimic grazing vary between studies in Italy and Spain?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests geographical variation in the effects of this action. A site comparison in Italy found that mowing increased both heather cover and grass cover (1627). In contrast, two before-and-after trials in Spain found that cutting to mimic grazing actually reduced heather cover. One of these Spanish studies did find that cutting increased the number of plant species (1627).",
