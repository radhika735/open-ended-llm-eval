    "question": "How effective are different types of road crossing structures, like underpasses, overpasses, and gantries, for bats?",
    "answer": "The effectiveness of road crossing structures for bats varies by type. Underpasses and culverts are used by bats, though often a proportion of bats still cross over the road above them (976). Overpasses are also used, but studies found that up to three-quarters of bats crossed the road below at traffic height or at other locations (977). Bat gantries appear unlikely to be beneficial, with studies showing that fewer bats used them than crossed the road at a dangerous height (978). In contrast, a single UK study found that a green bridge was used by 97% of bats crossing a road (979).",

    "answer": "Several operational modifications have been shown to be beneficial for reducing bat fatalities. Increasing the turbine 'cut-in' speed resulted in fewer bat fatalities in ten of twelve studies (1960). Similarly, preventing turbine blades from turning at low wind speeds, known as 'feathering', reduced fatalities in five of six studies (970), and slowing blade rotation at low wind speeds reduced fatalities in one study (2939). Automatically reducing blade rotation when bat activity is high also led to fewer fatalities in two studies (971). In contrast, using ultrasonic deterrents to keep bats away from turbines has shown mixed results and its effectiveness is unknown (968).",

Overall, agri-environment schemes were found to be unlikely to be beneficial, with two of three studies finding no significant difference in bat activity between scheme farms and conventional farms (962). For specific practices, managing hedges by trimming them less frequently resulted in more bat species and higher activity for some species in one study, but another found no difference in pipistrelle activity (1943). Retaining unmown field margins also showed no difference in pipistrelle activity compared to conventional farms (1940).

The most widely studied action is providing bat boxes, which are used by bats in various habitats, although occupancy rates differ significantly (1024). Larger structures like artificial caves or hibernacula can also be created and have been shown to be used by multiple bat species (2049). In built environments, new roosting spaces can be incorporated into road or railway bridges and culverts (1967), or alternative roosts like bat lofts and barns can be created within building developments to replace lost roosts (949).

    "question": "What are the known benefits and harms of installing gates at cave and mine entrances to protect bats?",
    "answer": "Installing gates at cave and mine entrances presents a trade-off between benefits and harms. On the positive side, restricting public access at caves can lead to increased or stable bat numbers, with some colonies showing population increases (999). On the negative side, gates at caves can cause bats to lose more body mass during hibernation and alter their flight behaviour, causing them to circle more before entering (999). Similarly, for mines, gates led to fewer bats or fewer species being present, with bats again observed circling more and entering less frequently (1963). In one case, bats abandoned four mines fitted with a specific 'ladder' design gate (1963).",

Avoiding illumination completely on commuting routes resulted in greater activity for lesser horseshoe and myotis bats (2017), and avoiding it at drinking sites led to greater activity for multiple species (2018). Where light is necessary, modifications can reduce negative impacts. Using red lighting instead of white or green light resulted in higher activity for one bat species group in one study, and more bats emerged from a roost lit with red light than with white light in another (2021). Additionally, using ultraviolet filters on lights led to higher activity for soprano pipistrelles in one study (1020).",

    "answer": "Several forestry management practices can mitigate the impacts of logging on bats. Using selective or reduced impact logging instead of conventional methods had a smaller effect on bat abundance and resulted in different bat species compositions (989). Thinning trees to reduce forest density is likely to be beneficial, with multiple studies finding higher overall bat activity in thinned forests compared to unthinned ones (991). During logging operations, retaining forested corridors can provide important roosting sites for some species and areas of high bat activity (996). Similarly, retaining residual tree patches within clearcut areas can provide habitat, with studies finding bat activity to be higher along the edges of these patches than in the open clearcut (995).",

In contrast, newly created alternative roosts (such as bat boxes, lofts, or barns) were often not used, or were used by fewer bats than the original roosts (949). One review found newly built roosts were four times less likely to be used by returning bats than retained roosts (949). Relocating access points also had mixed success, with one study finding fewer bats using the roost after relocation, and another finding success depended on the access point's design (946). Timing building work outside of the bat maternity season, along with retaining access points, was found to result in continued roost use (950).",

For the general public, studies in the US and UK found that education led to more positive perceptions and beliefs about bats, but did not measure changes in behaviour towards them (1000).
