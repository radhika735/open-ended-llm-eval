    "answer": "There is limited but emerging evidence for treating bats directly, but no evidence for the effectiveness of most other preventative strategies. Two studies found that treating infected little brown bats with a probiotic bacterium increased survival in lab or field settings, although results on disease severity were mixed (2008). In contrast, no studies were found that evaluated the effects of vaccinating bats (1011), culling infected bats (1012), restricting human access to caves to reduce spread (1010), decontaminating equipment (2006), treating hibernacula environments (2007), or using captive breeding to supplement affected populations (2009).",

    "answer": "A variety of crossing structures can be installed, with varying effectiveness. Underpasses and culverts are used by bats, though often a proportion of bats still cross over the road at traffic height (976). Overpasses are also used, but again, studies found many bats crossed elsewhere or below traffic height (977). One study found a green bridge was used by 97% of bats crossing a road (979). In contrast, bat gantries were found to be unlikely to be beneficial, with most bats crossing below them at a dangerous height (978). Additionally, maintaining existing roosts within road bridges (1966) or creating new roosting spaces (1967) can support bat populations affected by such infrastructure.",

    "answer": "There is a trade-off between benefits and harms for restricting access. Installing gates at cave (999) or mine (1963) entrances can lead to fewer bats, fewer species, and altered flight behaviour. However, some studies found bat populations increased or stabilized after gates were installed (999). Regarding fences, one study in Spain found no difference in population growth or occupancy rates for bats in caves with or without fencing or gates (1991). In contrast, a study in the USA found that significantly more bats emerged from a cave after a gate was replaced with a fence, suggesting fences may be less disruptive in some contexts (1991).",

Similarly, agroforestry systems with shade trees are 'likely to be beneficial', supporting more bats and higher diversity than unshaded monocultures (963). In contrast, agri-environment schemes in the UK were found to be 'unlikely to be beneficial', with studies showing no difference or even lower bat activity compared to conventional farms (962).

Increasing the wind speed at which turbines become operational ('cut-in speed') was found to be 'beneficial', with ten of twelve studies showing it resulted in fewer bat fatalities (1960). Similarly, preventing turbine blades from turning at low wind speeds ('feathering') is also 'beneficial', with five of six studies finding it reduced fatalities (970). Slowing the rotation of blades at low wind speeds was also found to be 'likely to be beneficial' in one study (2939).

This includes bat boxes, with 41 of 43 studies finding they were used (1024), and artificial caves or hibernacula, which were used in all four studies found (2049). However, there are significant drawbacks. Occupancy rates can be low; 22 studies found bats occupying less than half of bat boxes provided (1024). When used to replace destroyed roosts during developments, bats may not use the new structures at all, or may use them in lower numbers, with new roosts being four times less likely to be used than retained ones (949). Furthermore, certain designs or features, such as heated bat boxes, may not be used by target species like maternity colonies (2052).",

To prevent fruit bats from damaging orchards, non-lethal measures such as organic deterrent sprays, hanging plastic flags, and netting tree branches were found to be 'likely to be beneficial' in reducing fruit damage (1953). For managing rabies risk from vampire bats, alternatives like vaccinating livestock or humans have been suggested, but no studies were found that evaluated the effects of replacing culling with these methods on vampire bat populations (1950, 1979). Broader strategies include public education campaigns to dispel myths and improve perceptions of bats, which studies have found can result in more positive attitudes (1000).",

    "answer": "Changing effluent treatments for domestic and urban wastewater showed that filter bed sewage treatment works had higher foraging bat activity than active sludge systems (1014). Managing livestock water troughs by removing modifications to allow easier access for bats was found to be likely beneficial, increasing the frequency of bats drinking (1951). In contrast, retaining riparian buffers on agricultural land under agri-environment schemes showed no difference in pipistrelle activity compared to conventional farms (2284). No studies were found that evaluated the effects of changing effluent treatments used specifically in agriculture and forestry (1016), or preventing pollution from agricultural land from entering watercourses (2015).",

    "answer": "Maintaining existing bat roosts within road bridges during repair work is likely to be beneficial, with studies showing that colonies continued to use the roosts in similar numbers post-maintenance (1966). Similarly, creating new spaces for roosting bats in road bridges to replace those lost during works is also likely beneficial, with bats recolonizing the majority of new roosts, sometimes in greater numbers (1967). However, a limitation is that providing alternative roosts, such as bat houses, during bridge maintenance work has been found to be of unknown effectiveness; one review showed they were used by fewer bats than the original roosts, or not at all (2942).",

There is currently no evidence available to assess the effectiveness of imposing noise limits near roosts (1021), installing sound-proofing insulation within developments (1929), or using mammal-safe timber treatments in roof spaces (1022). The only action with any evidence is restricting the timing of timber treatment application, which was found to be likely ineffective or harmful; while it increased survival compared to immediate exposure, it did not prevent the death of bats from toxic treatments (1023).",

A potential benefit is increased protection from human disturbance, with several studies finding that bat populations increased or stabilized in caves after gates were installed (999). However, negative impacts are also documented. Both cave and mine gating can lead to roost abandonment, reduced bat populations, and fewer species (999, 1963). Gates can alter bat behaviour, causing them to circle more and enter less, and sometimes collide with the gate (999, 1963). One study also found that bats hibernating in a gated cave lost more body mass than those in an unmodified cave (999).",

Two studies also found more bat species on organic farms (961). However, the evidence is not uniform, as five of seven studies found no difference in species richness, and five of nine studies found no difference in overall activity between the two farming systems (961). A related action, reducing the use of pesticides, herbicides, or fertilisers, is also rated 'Likely to be beneficial', with studies showing higher bat diversity, activity, and better body condition on farms with low chemical inputs (2013).",

Retaining existing roosts and their access points is rated 'Likely to be beneficial', with studies showing continued use by bats, sometimes in similar or greater numbers post-development (947). Changing the timing of building work to avoid the maternity season also led to a roost being used by similar numbers of bats in one study (950). Creating new alternative roosts has 'Unknown effectiveness'; studies show variable use, and newly built roosts were found to be four times less likely to be used by returning bats than retained roosts (949).

    "question": "What factors are associated with the successful use of artificial bat roosts by bats?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests that success is influenced by roost design, position, and microclimate. For bat boxes, higher occupancy has been associated with specific designs (e.g., rocket boxes, concrete boxes), larger sizes, and black colouring (1024). Positional factors linked to success include orientation relative to sunlight, height, and location (e.g., on buildings vs. trees), with higher occupancy rates in areas with known pre-existing roosts and where more boxes are installed (1024). Managing the microclimate can also be crucial; modifying artificial roosts to reduce internal temperatures increased the number of bats using them (2052). In contrast, heated bat boxes were found to be largely unsuccessful (2052). Additionally, in development contexts, newly created roosts are less likely to be used than retained ones (949).",
