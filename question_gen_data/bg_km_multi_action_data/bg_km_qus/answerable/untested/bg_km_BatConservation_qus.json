    "question": "How effective are different types of road crossing structures, like underpasses, overpasses, and gantries, for bats?",
    "answer": "The effectiveness of road crossing structures for bats varies by type. Underpasses and culverts are used by bats, though often a proportion of bats still cross over the road above them (976). Overpasses are also used, but studies found that up to three-quarters of bats crossed the road below at traffic height or at other locations (977). Bat gantries appear unlikely to be beneficial, with studies showing that fewer bats used them than crossed the road at a dangerous height (978). In contrast, a single UK study found that a green bridge was used by 97% of bats crossing a road (979).",

Increasing the turbine 'cut-in' speed resulted in fewer bat fatalities in ten of twelve studies (1960). Similarly, preventing turbine blades from turning at low wind speeds, known as 'feathering', reduced fatalities in five of six studies (970), and slowing blade rotation at low wind speeds reduced fatalities in one study (2939). Automatically reducing blade rotation when bat activity is high also led to fewer fatalities in two studies (971). In contrast, using ultrasonic deterrents to keep bats away from turbines has shown mixed results and its effectiveness is unknown (968).",

    "answer": "Installing gates at cave and mine entrances presents a trade-off between benefits and harms. On the positive side, restricting public access at caves can lead to increased or stable bat numbers, with some colonies showing population increases (999). On the negative side, gates at caves can cause bats to lose more body mass during hibernation and alter their flight behaviour, causing them to circle more before entering (999). Similarly, for mines, gates led to fewer bats or fewer species being present, with bats again observed circling more and entering less frequently (1963). In one case, bats abandoned four mines fitted with a specific 'ladder' design gate (1963).",

Avoiding illumination completely on commuting routes resulted in greater activity for lesser horseshoe and myotis bats (2017), and avoiding it at drinking sites led to greater activity for multiple species (2018). Where light is necessary, modifications can reduce negative impacts. Using red lighting instead of white or green light resulted in higher activity for one bat species group in one study, and more bats emerged from a roost lit with red light than with white light in another (2021).

Thinning trees to reduce forest density is likely to be beneficial, with multiple studies finding higher overall bat activity in thinned forests compared to unthinned ones (991). During logging operations, retaining forested corridors can provide important roosting sites for some species and areas of high bat activity (996).

One review found newly built roosts were four times less likely to be used by returning bats than retained roosts (949). Relocating access points also had mixed success, with one study finding fewer bats using the roost after relocation, and another finding success depended on the access point's design (946).

    "question": "What are the most beneficial actions for providing tree-based roosting sites for bats?",
    "answer": "Providing bat boxes is considered likely to be beneficial. Forty-one of 43 studies found that bats used boxes installed in various habitats including forests, and nine studies found that the number of bats using them increased over time (1024). The effectiveness of creating artificial hollows and cracks in trees is unknown, but one Australian study found that long-eared bats used eight of 16 artificial hollows that were created (2047). Similarly, the effectiveness of reinstating bat roosts in felled tree trunks is unknown, but one UK study found that a reinstated maternity roost of common noctule bats continued to be used after the felled trunk was attached to a nearby tree (2048).",

    "question": "To mitigate agricultural pollution, what alternatives exist to changing effluent treatments?",
    "answer": "Several alternatives to changing effluent treatments exist to reduce pollution impacts on bats. Reducing pesticide, herbicide, or fertiliser use is rated as likely to be beneficial. Studies have shown that farms or grasslands with few or no chemical inputs had higher bat species diversity, higher overall bat activity, and bats in better body condition (2013). Adopting organic farming practices, which exclude synthetic chemicals, is also likely to be beneficial, with several studies finding more bat species or higher bat activity on organic farms compared to conventional ones (961). Additionally, introducing legislation to control the use of hazardous substances could be an effective measure, although no studies were found that evaluated its impact on bat populations (1015).",

    "question": "What design and placement factors influence whether bats use artificial roosts like bat boxes or purpose-built structures in buildings?",
    "answer": "Several factors appear to influence the use of artificial roosts. For bat boxes, design elements such as colour (black boxes were used more), size (larger boxes had higher occupancy), material (concrete was preferred over wood in one study), and the number of compartments have been shown to affect use (1024). Microclimate is also critical; box orientation and sun exposure affected occupancy, and managing the microclimate of artificial roosts, such as by reducing internal temperatures, was found to increase bat numbers (1024, 2052). For roosts in buildings, access point design is important; one study found that a 'straight' design for a relocated access point was used by lesser horseshoe bats, whereas a 'bend' design was not (946). Furthermore, retaining existing roosts during development is more successful than creating new ones, as new structures are four times less likely to be used by returning bats (949).",

Creating new spaces in bridges was also found to be effective, with recolonization at similar or greater numbers in four of eight sites (1967). Conserving roosts in old structures was also beneficial; one study found increased numbers of hibernating bats in a modified railway tunnel, and another found a disused cellar was used after being cleared (2046).

It is also possible to install sound-proofing insulation between roosts and human-occupied areas, though no studies evaluated this (1929).
