Studies on long-term closures found mixed results, with some showing a higher abundance for only one of seven species monitored and others showing increases only for young salmon (2655).

Using different hook types reduced injuries associated with mortality in several studies but did not directly improve survival in others (2698). In one study, survival of mackerel was reduced after passing through an escape grid on a purse seine net (2703).

    "question": "Besides closing areas to fishing, what alternative management strategies can reduce overall fishing mortality?",
    "answer": "Alternative strategies to area closures include introducing overall catch limits or quotas, which has been shown to increase the abundance of some commercial stocks and reduce fishing mortality (3811). Implementing catch share systems is another approach, with reviews finding these fisheries have lower rates of over-exploitation (3812). Fishing effort can also be controlled by limiting vessel size and/or engine power; one study found this led to higher abundance of commercially targeted fish (3809). Limiting the number of fishing permits is a further option, although we found no studies evaluating its effect on fish populations (3817).",

    "answer": "Separator trawls have been shown in one study to separate unwanted cod from target species, allowing more small cod to escape, while another study found a separator trawl reduced the catch of one of two unwanted species in a crustacean fishery (2711).

Another method is to use a zonation system, creating 'partially-protected zones' where fishing with specified gears or for certain species is permitted, alongside no-take zones (2674). A broader approach is to implement unspecified restrictions on fishing activity to reduce overall pressure (2680).

However, evidence that this translates to an increase in the spawning population is not consistent [2938, 2664].
