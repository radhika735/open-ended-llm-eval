    "answer": "Several techniques have been studied, with mixed results. Using herbicides has been found to reduce grass cover in some studies, but not others (1643). Cutting or mowing can reduce grass cover, but this may be temporary, and the practice has shown no effect on shrub or forb cover in several studies (1638). Other methods with unknown effectiveness include altering livestock grazing (1646), stripping turf which increased heathland plants (1647), and using prescribed fire, which one study found did not reduce the target grass but did reduce heather (1723).",

    "question": "Which interventions aimed at restoring degraded shrublands by manipulating soil and reintroducing plants have shown the most beneficial outcomes?",
    "answer": "Based on the evidence, the most beneficial interventions are sowing seeds (1698) and adding topsoil from other shrublands (1686), both of which are rated 'Likely to be beneficial'. Multiple studies found that sowing seeds increased shrub cover, and adding topsoil increased the cover and abundance of heathland plants. Other techniques like planting turf (1703) or stripping topsoil before adding seeds/clippings (1711) have also shown positive results in studies by increasing heathland plant cover, but their overall effectiveness is rated as unknown.",

    "question": "What are the observed effects of interventions designed to manage public access and reduce human disturbance in shrublands?",
    "answer": "The evidence for managing public access in shrublands is very limited. One trial that involved closing and re-routing paths found that it did not alter shrub cover, but did increase the number of plant species (1619). For other interventions, such as using signs and access restrictions to reduce disturbance (1620) or planting spiny shrubs to act as barriers (1621), no studies were found that evaluated their effects on shrublands. Therefore, their effectiveness is unknown.",
