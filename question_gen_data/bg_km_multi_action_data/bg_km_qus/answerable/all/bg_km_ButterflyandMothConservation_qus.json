    "answer": "Several practices on farmland have been shown to increase butterfly and moth abundance. Converting to organic farming generally resulted in greater abundance of butterflies and moths compared to conventional farms (3907). On a landscape scale, farms with a greater proportion of semi-natural habitat (3910) or with smaller fields (3974) had higher butterfly abundance. At the field level, planting nectar flower mixtures or wildflower strips (3932) and creating floristically enhanced grass margins (3982) were found to increase butterfly abundance more than unenhanced grass margins or cropped areas.",

    "answer": "Opening up forest canopies has shown varied effects. Clearing patches in forests was found to increase butterfly species richness and abundance, but could lower moth species richness (3938). Similarly, thinning trees (often combined with other management like prescribed burning) increased both species richness and abundance of butterflies in coniferous woodland (3940). Coppicing woodland also increased the species richness and abundance of some butterflies, like the heath fritillary, but studies found it could lower the richness and abundance of macro-moths when compared to mature forest (3939).",

Leaving unburned areas was found to increase the abundance of Karner blue butterflies and was beneficial for six out of nine specialist butterfly species (3879). In contrast, rotational burning had mixed effects; while some species like the regal fritillary could have higher abundance, the abundance of prairie specialists was often higher in areas that had not been burned for several years, and some grass-skipper populations showed stronger declines in rotationally burned sites compared to unmanaged areas (3883).",

Reducing light intensity also proved effective, with low-intensity lights attracting fewer moths than high-intensity ones (3902).

While some re-establishment projects have been successful, with populations persisting for over 28 years after translocation outside the native range (3911) or release of captive-bred individuals (3914), failure is also common. Reviews across the UK and Ireland found that only 8% of translocated and captive-bred butterfly populations were known to have survived for more than 10 years, with 38% dying out within three years (3909, 3914). Some translocated populations died out within a year (3911), while others required repeated supplementation to survive (3909, 3914).",

Mowing regimes can be altered; for example, one study found mowing in November did not reduce moth caterpillar abundance, unlike August mowing (3945). Grazing is another key alternative. Employing rough grazing on semi-natural habitats like fens and dunes was found to increase the abundance of some butterfly species, such as the large copper (3944). However, completely ceasing management is also an option; abandoning grazing can benefit some species but may lead to a decline in grassland specialists as succession progresses (3956). Similarly, ceasing mowing can lead to higher abundance of some butterflies, but lower abundance of others (3957).",

Restoring connectivity between habitat patches has been found to increase the abundance of multiple species, including Karner blue, marsh fritillary, and regal fritillary (3934). It also encourages movement, with studies showing common buckeye and variegated fritillary butterflies were more likely to move between connected patches (3934). Retaining existing connectivity is also important, as it helped Alcon large blue populations persist in low-quality habitat patches and encouraged common buckeye butterflies to colonize more distant patches (3832).",

Altering mowing regimes in greenspaces, such as mowing less frequently, can increase the species richness, diversity, and abundance of butterflies and moths (3841). Additionally, planting parks and gardens with appropriate native species has been shown in several studies to increase the species richness and abundance of both adult butterflies and caterpillars compared to areas with non-native plants (3842).

Even without full conversion, generally reducing the use of pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers leads to greater species richness and abundance (3897). More targeted actions are also effective; leaving field headlands unsprayed with herbicides and insecticides resulted in greater butterfly richness and abundance in four of five studies (3898), and restricting specific herbicides like glyphosate also led to higher butterfly richness and abundance in field margins (3896).",

Forests managed by shelterwood harvesting or thinning had higher or similar moth species richness to clearcut areas, and in one study moth richness recovered faster after shelterwood harvesting than clearcutting (3871, 3868).

Thinning trees, which reduces canopy density, was found to increase butterfly species richness and abundance compared to unmanaged woodland, especially when combined with other actions like mulching (3940).

Raising the water table and removing trees in mires increased specialist butterfly species richness and abundance to levels similar to pristine mires (3948). However, another study noted that rising water levels from restoration reduced the winter survival of large heath butterfly caterpillars (3948). For other wetlands, one study on restoring a floodplain prairie found it increased use by adult great copper butterflies but decreased the survival of their eggs and caterpillars (3949).",

    "question": "In European grasslands, which grazing management strategies appear most beneficial for butterfly species richness?",
    "answer": "The evidence suggests that reducing grazing intensity is generally beneficial. Several studies found that grasslands with lower stocking densities of livestock had greater butterfly and moth species richness than more intensely grazed grasslands (3959). Two studies found that rotational grazing resulted in greater species richness than continuous grazing (3965), and changing livestock from sheep to cattle or horses also increased species richness in two studies (3963). In contrast, completely ceasing grazing for long periods often resulted in similar or lower species richness compared to managed grasslands (3956).",

On the positive side, three studies in the USA found that burned coniferous forest had higher butterfly species richness and abundance compared to unburned forest (3877). However, a negative impact was recorded in an Australian study where there were fewer Eltham copper caterpillars after a fire (3877). Some evidence suggests negative impacts can be mitigated; leaving unburned patches during fires increased the abundance of specialist butterfly species (3879), and one study found early season burning increased caterpillar abundance while late season burning did not (3878).",

Thinning trees within forests, which reduces tree density, has been found in several US and Finnish studies to increase the species richness and abundance of butterflies compared to unmanaged woodland (3940).
