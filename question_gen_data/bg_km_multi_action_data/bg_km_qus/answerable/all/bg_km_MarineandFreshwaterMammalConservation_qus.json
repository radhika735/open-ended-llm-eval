    "question": "What are the most effective non-lethal methods to reduce mammal predation at aquaculture farms?",
    "answer": "Translocating fur seals away from salmon farms is likely to be ineffective or harmful, as studies found that most seals returned (2776). Using acoustic devices showed mixed results; some studies found they reduced predation by seals and sea lions, while others found no effect on dolphins or seals (2775). Replacing anti-predator nets more frequently was found to reduce salmon losses to harbour seals in one study (2774). No evidence was found to assess the effectiveness of modifying aquaculture gear (2742), modifying anti-predator nets (2743), or minimizing food waste (2744).",

    "answer": "Evidence exists for both interventions, and both are rated as a 'Trade off between benefit and harms'. Studies on acoustic devices attached to fishing gear found they could reduce entanglements of porpoises, dolphins, and whales, and also reduce damage to catches (2808). Studies on acoustic devices deployed from vessels found they caused avoidance behaviour in dolphins and killer whales, but one study found they did not reduce predation of squid catches by Risso's dolphins (2815). Both methods carry risks of causing hearing damage or excluding animals from important habitats.",

Using acoustically reflective materials in nets is also 'Likely to be beneficial' based on studies that found fewer porpoise entanglements (2807). Installing exclusion and escape devices on trawl nets is rated 'Likely to be beneficial' for reducing entrapment of seals and dolphins (2823).
