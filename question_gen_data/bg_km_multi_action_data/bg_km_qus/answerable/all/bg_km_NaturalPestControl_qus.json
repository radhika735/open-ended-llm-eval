    "answer": "The evidence suggests two 'likely to be beneficial' actions. Growing non-crop plants that produce attractive chemicals was found to increase the numbers of natural enemies in three out of four studies (724). Similarly, using manufactured attractive chemicals, such as pheromones and volatiles, was found to attract more natural enemies in multiple studies, although effects sometimes varied between enemy groups or the chemicals used (754).",

Where ants are beneficial predators, their colonies can be isolated by pruning trees, which was found in one study to increase the number of trees they occupied, reduce pest damage, and increase yields (773). Conversely, where ants protect pests, they can be excluded by applying adhesive barriers to tree trunks.

Excluding pest-protecting ants increased parasitism in one of two studies (886), while converting to organic farming showed an increase in only one of five studies (717).

Using mixed pasture instead of monoculture is also promising, with two studies both finding a reduction in weeds (721). In contrast, converting to organic farming appears less reliable, as three studies found it led to more weeds (717).

Some interventions have shown clear financial benefits: 'push-pull' systems were found to provide greater economic benefits in multiple studies (753), and crop rotation in potato systems was found to increase profit in one study (719). Other strategies can reduce costs; using pesticides only when thresholds are met was found in nine studies to require fewer applications and in three studies to lower production costs, while generally maintaining similar profits to conventional spraying (750). Beetle banks could also provide economic savings if they prevent the need for spraying (729). However, not all strategies are profitable.

For altering insecticide use, success is linked to timing applications to periods of crop susceptibility (723). The choice of insecticide is also a factor, as effects can vary between chemical types (723). For delaying mowing or grazing, the outcome for natural enemies is inconsistent and depends heavily on the specific predator group being considered; studies found negative, neutral, or mixed effects for different groups (727). Similarly, delaying herbicide use has variable success depending on the pest group and crop variety, with one study finding different outcomes for pests and crop damage under different conditions (774).",
