    "answer": "The evidence is limited. One study examined creating pit habitats (3455), two examined creating groove habitats (3448), and one examined creating small protrusions (3453). Three studies looked at creating grooves and small protrusions/ridges/ledges together (3452). These studies generally report mixed effects on community composition and organism abundance, often in conjunction with other interventions like using environmentally-sensitive materials.",

    "answer": "Two studies examined creating small protrusions (3462) and two examined large ones (3463). Creating small protrusions, sometimes with other features, was found to increase species richness in both studies. Creating large protrusions, sometimes with large ridges, did not increase species richness in two studies, though one found it increased limpet abundance. Overall, with limited evidence for both, small protrusions appear to have shown more consistent benefits for species richness.",

Creating long flexible habitats on subtidal structures (3451) also showed mixed effects on fish richness and abundance depending on various factors, but they were reported to be used by seahorses.",

Creating pit habitats (3455), groove habitats (3448), and grooves with small protrusions/ledges (3452) also showed increased diversity in single studies, but again, this was in conjunction with other interventions. Creating small adjoining cavities/swimthroughs (≤100 mm) had mixed effects (3436). There is currently insufficient evidence to definitively state which is 'best'.",

    "answer": "Survival rates are highly variable and depend on context. For subtidal transplants (3471), canopy algae survival depended on factors like wave-exposure and caging, with two studies reporting no survival at all. Subtidally transplanted coral survival varied by species. For intertidal transplants (3472), macroalgae survived better at mid- and high-shore levels. The survival of transplanted intertidal invertebrates (like oysters, limpets, corals) varied depending on the species, site, and the presence of microhabitats on the structure surface.",

    "answer": "Evidence suggests several factors can limit long-term effectiveness. Habitats can get filled up with sediment; for example, wave-sheltered intertidal rock pools were observed to fill with sediment within two years (3476). Maintenance activities can also reverse benefits, as created or naturally formed holes and pits are often filled or repaired (3434, 3475). The size of the feature is also a factor, as small habitats like pits, grooves, and holes can get filled up rapidly (3475, 3473, 3434).",
