    "question": "What site preparation techniques can be used before seeding to improve the establishment of grassland plants?",
    "answer": "Several site preparation techniques have been studied. Disturbing the soil before seeding has been found to increase plant emergence in most cases (3413). Removing topsoil before seeding can increase plant community similarity to target grasslands, increase species richness, and improve plant survival (3415). Applying herbicide before seeding has been shown to increase sown species richness and the cover of sown grass species (3418). Simply removing vegetation has also been found to increase the germination rate of sown species in one study (3416).",

    "answer": "Evidence suggests sowing seeds of parasitic species like yellow rattle is highly effective; five of six studies in Europe found this increased plant species richness or diversity (3404). Sowing native grass and forb seeds has also been effective, with sixteen of twenty-eight studies (many in Europe) finding it increased overall plant species richness (3432). Using seeds from a local source was also found to increase plant species richness compared to a commercial mix in one Italian study (3400). In contrast, sowing only grass seeds has been found to either not change or reduce overall plant species richness in three of four studies (3397).",

It may also reduce the abundance of desirable native species, with evidence showing reductions in the abundance of characteristic grassland species, native grass cover, native forb abundance, and shrub abundance (3397).

Disturbing the soil before sowing was found to increase plant emergence in four of five studies, but one study found no change in overall species richness or diversity (3413). Removing topsoil before seeding has been shown to have broader community-level benefits, with studies finding it increased plant community similarity to intact grasslands, increased overall plant species richness, and increased the survival of seedlings and plants (3415).

For vegetation cover, one study found that sowing grass seeds led to higher cover after two years, but this difference was gone after seven years (3397).
