    "answer": "Two community-based strategies are rated as 'Likely to be beneficial'. Implementing local no-hunting policies or traditional hunting bans has been associated with increased populations of lowland gorillas and black howler monkeys (1478). Similarly, implementing community control of patrolling, banning hunting, and removing snares has been shown to be more effective at reducing illegal hunting than nearby national parks and has led to increases in gorilla and chimpanzee numbers in some areas (1482). Other community-based actions, such as providing monetary or non-monetary benefits, have 'Unknown effectiveness' with mixed results (1509, 1510).",

    "question": "What are the observed effects of providing artificial resources like nesting sites and water sources for primate populations?",
    "answer": "The effectiveness of providing artificial resources is unknown, with studies showing mixed outcomes. In two studies, providing artificial nest boxes (1530) to reintroduced lion tamarins was associated with population decline or high mortality. Conversely, a majority of juvenile western lowland gorillas survived when provided with nesting platforms. Providing artificial water sources (1531) was associated with low survival rates for reintroduced tamarins, lemurs, and vervet monkeys, although a majority of reintroduced gorillas survived while being provided with supplementary water.",

    "question": "What are the documented benefits of conservation strategies that involve local community education and management participation?",
    "answer": "Engaging local communities appears to be beneficial. Community-led actions are rated as 'Likely to be beneficial'. For instance, community control of patrolling was found to be more effective at reducing illegal hunting than in a nearby national park (1482). Local hunting bans (1478) were associated with increased gorilla and monkey populations. Involving communities in management (1565) was linked to an increase in black howler monkeys and a stop to gorilla poaching in another area. Education programmes (1563) were associated with an increase in drill numbers.",

    "question": "What is the evidence on the effectiveness of non-lethal deterrents to prevent primates from entering agricultural areas?",
    "answer": "The evidence for non-lethal deterrents is mixed. Humans chasing primates using random loud noise (1449) is rated 'Likely to be beneficial', with studies showing it reduced crop raiding by orangutans and caused gorillas to return to protected forests. Using nets to keep primates out of fruit trees (1442) has 'Unknown effectiveness' but was found to reduce crop-raiding by orangutans. In contrast, no evidence was found for the effectiveness of installing mechanical barriers like fences (1436), using natural hedges (1437), using unpalatable buffer crops (1438), or using predator scents (1448).",
