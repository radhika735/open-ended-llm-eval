    "question": "What actions can be taken to protect planted tree seedlings and enhance their survival?",
    "answer": "Several actions show potential for protecting seedlings. Applying insecticide was found in one US study to increase seedling emergence and survival (1149). Fencing to exclude grazing animals is rated as 'Likely to be beneficial', with four of five studies finding it increased the survival, size, and cover of planted trees (1254). Watering seedlings increased survival during a dry summer in one study in Spain (1154). Using plastic tree shelters also increased survival rates in a US study (1268). Conversely, no evidence was found for the effectiveness of applying fungicides to protect seedlings (1156).",

    "question": "How do the effects of selective logging compare to tree thinning on understory plants and young trees?",
    "answer": "Both selective logging and thinning can be beneficial for understory plants. Five of ten studies found logging increased the density and cover of understory plants (1273), while seventeen of 25 studies found that thinning did the same (1211). For young trees, the evidence differs. Thinning was found to increase the density of young trees in six of twelve studies (1210). In contrast, the evidence for logging is more limited and mixed, with one study finding it increased young tree density and another finding mixed effects (1272).",

For rodents, the effectiveness is unknown, with one study finding that rodent control actually decreased native plant species richness (1232). In contrast, excluding herbivores with fencing appears more promising. Using wire fences to exclude large native herbivores is rated 'Likely to be beneficial', with studies showing increased understory plant cover and tree density (1230).

For mature trees, it is 'Likely to be ineffective or harmful', with studies finding it decreased tree cover and density and increased tree mortality (1217).

Using shelterwood harvesting instead of clearcutting was found in three studies to result in higher plant diversity and tree species density (1214). More broadly, shelterwood harvesting was found to increase the abundance, richness, and diversity of understory plants, as well as the growth and survival of young trees in six of seven studies (1223). Group-selection harvesting also showed positive results, with four of eight studies finding it increased the cover and diversity of understory plants and the density of young trees (1224).
