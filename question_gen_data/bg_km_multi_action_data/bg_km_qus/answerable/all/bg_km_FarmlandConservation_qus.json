Modifying agricultural practices is another key alternative. Delaying mowing is 'Likely to be beneficial' for wading birds and skylarks (131), and using wildlife-friendly mowing techniques (e.g., mowing from the centre outwards) is 'Beneficial' for reducing corncrake chick mortality (698).

Similarly, for wet meadow restoration, positive effects have been seen within five years, but other studies found restoration was incomplete after 9 or even 20 years (119).

The surrounding habitat also plays a role, with the same study finding that nest success was related to the amount of available pasture (155).
