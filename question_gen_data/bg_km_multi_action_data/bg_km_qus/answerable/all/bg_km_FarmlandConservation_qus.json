    "question": "What actions can be taken on farmland to specifically support declining bird populations?",
    "answer": "Several actions show benefits for farmland birds. Creating skylark plots (small undrilled patches in cereal fields) has been found to increase skylark population size, breeding density, and success (540). Sowing wild bird seed or cover mixtures provides food and cover, with studies showing higher abundance, density, and species richness of birds (594). Leaving overwinter stubbles provides winter food, which is associated with higher densities of farmland birds and can increase population sizes of some species (695). Additionally, using mowing techniques such as mowing from the centre of the field outwards can significantly reduce mortality of birds like corncrakes and their chicks during harvesting (698).",

    "question": "To enhance biodiversity within agricultural grassland habitats, which actions are most beneficial?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests several actions are highly beneficial for grassland biodiversity. Restoring or creating species-rich, semi-natural grassland is rated as 'Beneficial', with numerous studies showing it results in higher plant species richness, and greater abundance and diversity of invertebrates and farmland birds compared to other grassland types (133). Another 'Likely to be beneficial' action is reducing the management intensity on permanent grasslands, which involves a combination of reducing chemical inputs and delaying mowing, with studies finding benefits for plants, invertebrates, and birds (69). Delaying the mowing or first grazing date is also 'Likely to be beneficial', leading to higher plant species richness, more insects, and increased breeding success for birds like the Eurasian skylark (131).",

    "answer": "Both planting grass buffer strips and creating uncultivated margins are rated as 'Beneficial' for farmland wildlife, though they benefit different groups in slightly different ways. Planting grass buffer strips has been found to increase arthropod abundance and diversity, benefit birds by increasing their numbers and foraging time, and also benefit small mammals (246). Creating uncultivated margins through natural regeneration also supports higher invertebrate numbers (including bees) and greater plant diversity compared to conventionally managed margins. They have also been shown to support more small mammal species than meadows (63). However, some studies note that plant species richness in naturally regenerated margins can decline over time (63).",

This evidence indicates that reducing tillage has positive effects on earthworms, some other invertebrates, weeds, and farmland birds. Specifically, a small replicated trial in the UK found that fields with broadcast tillage had more birds from the 'Farmland Bird Index' than non-inversion tillage fields. UK studies have also found higher Eurasian skylark nest density and greater abundance of seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in winter on fields with reduced tillage (126).",

Studies found it can increase farmland bird abundance, breeding population size, body mass, and overwinter survival (648). However, the evidence also highlights inconsistencies and potential drawbacks. Five replicated UK studies found no clear effect on breeding abundance, reproductive success, or survival of stable house sparrow populations. One study in Sweden even found lower fledging rates in nests that received supplementary food in one year. The effectiveness and use of supplementary food can also vary between bird species, region, and time of year (648).",

    "question": "Besides direct predator control, what other conservation actions can protect the nests of ground-nesting birds?",
    "answer": "Several alternatives to direct predator control exist for protecting ground-nesting birds. One option is to protect individual nests with exclosures or cages (108). Studies from Sweden found this offered some benefits, such as higher daily survival rates for common redshank and northern lapwing nests, but also noted a risk of higher predation on adult redshanks on protected nests. Another approach is 'mosaic management', a Dutch agri-environment scheme which includes nest protection alongside other measures like delayed mowing, and was found to increase northern lapwing population trends (130). Erecting predator-proof fencing around important breeding sites is another potential intervention, but there is currently no evidence to assess its effectiveness (109).",

Planting nectar flower or wildflower strips is rated as 'Beneficial', with forty-one studies from eight European countries finding they had a positive influence, leading to increased invertebrate abundance and species richness (442). Creating beetle banks is 'Likely to be beneficial'; studies from the UK and Denmark found they can increase invertebrate densities, though effects can vary between seasons and invertebrate groups (651).

Mechanical controls such as cutting can be used for bracken (105) and giant hogweed, where removing flower heads at peak flowering has been shown to dramatically reduce seed production (104). For creeping thistle, effective methods include cutting and the use of biological controls like fungal pathogens and weevils (123). Grazing is another effective technique; lenient grazing can provide long-term control of creeping thistle (123), and specific livestock breeds like Hebridean sheep have been found to graze purple moor grass (123). For general scrub control, both cutting and grazing are options (127), and mowing or flail cutting combined with grazing has been used to control purple moor grass in moorland restoration projects (650).",

    "answer": "Both restoring species-rich semi-natural grassland and traditional water meadows can successfully restore plant communities using similar management techniques. For water meadows, successful techniques include topsoil removal, introducing target plant species, raising water levels, grazing, and mowing (119). Seventeen studies found one or more of these techniques to be successful in restoring wet meadow plant communities. Similarly, for species-rich semi-natural grasslands, effective restoration techniques include grazing, introducing plant species, hay spreading, and mowing (133). Forty studies found that ten different techniques, used alone or in combination, were effective. Both interventions show that a combination of management practices can lead to the restoration of desired plant communities.",

For species-rich semi-natural grassland, evidence suggests a range of outcomes: six studies saw positive signs of restoration in less than five years, eleven studies reported positive signs within ten years, and two studies found restoration took more than ten years (133). However, other studies found that changes can be slow or limited, with differences in vegetation still present between restored and existing species-rich grasslands 60 years after restoration (133). Similarly, for traditional water meadows, while some positive effects on plant communities were found within five years, other studies noted that restoration was not complete after five, nine, or even 20 years (119).",

Specifically, delaying mowing or grazing dates can result in higher plant species richness, more insect species, and increased breeding wading bird densities (131). Reducing grazing intensity has been found to increase plant abundance and diversity, as well as invertebrate diversity (704). However, there are also mixed or negative effects. Reducing management intensity has, in some cases, led to the loss of certain plant species or an increase in invertebrates in more intensively managed grasslands (69). Several studies found that delaying mowing or grazing had no clear effect on plant species richness or the abundance of some insects and spiders (131). Similarly, reducing grazing intensity has shown mixed results, benefiting some species but not others, or having no clear benefit at all in some studies (704).",

For controlling invasive species, studies suggest that trapping appears to be an effective method for reducing American mink populations, though firm conclusions are limited by experimental design (107). In contrast, no evidence was captured for the effects of controlling grey squirrels on farmland wildlife (106). Creating new habitat features generally shows positive results. Planting grass buffer strips (246) and wildflower strips (442) has been found to benefit small mammals by increasing activity and numbers. Beetle banks can also provide nesting sites for harvest mice (651). Creating habitat corridors has also been shown to be colonized by small mammal species, with higher numbers found in bio-corridors than adjacent forest or arable fields (579).",

Raising water levels in ditches or grasslands was also found in Dutch studies to be associated with increased bird numbers (121). A scheme offering direct payments per clutch to farmers showed limited evidence for increasing overall wading bird populations, but did result in higher hatching success for northern lapwing and black-tailed godwit (146). Maintaining traditional water meadows under 'meadow bird agreements' was found to increase population sizes of northern lapwing, common redshank, and black-tailed godwit, although differences may have existed before management began (696).",

Intercropping cabbage with beans or clover has been found to increase ground beetle abundance, and following maize with a rye grass crop increased earthworm abundance (124). Leaving cultivated, uncropped margins or plots provides benefits to rare arable plants, invertebrates such as bumblebees and spiders, and birds like the northern lapwing and Eurasian skylark (562). Creating smaller 'skylark plots' also has positive effects on skylark populations and has shown benefits to plants and some invertebrates (540).
