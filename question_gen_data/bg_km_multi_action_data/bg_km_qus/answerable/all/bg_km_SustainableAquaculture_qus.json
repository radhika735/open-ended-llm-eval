    "question": "What methods are available to control disease and sea lice in Atlantic salmon farms?",
    "answer": "Several non-chemical methods to control disease and parasites have been studied. Fallowing farm sites was associated with lower sea lice numbers in a Scottish study (1026). Biological controls, such as using cleaner wrasse, were found to be as effective as chemical treatments for lice in one study, though another found them ineffective (738). Altering environmental conditions, such as using low-intensity lighting, also resulted in lower numbers of lice in a Norwegian study (741). Additionally, dietary changes, such as feeding salmon a probiotic, increased survival when exposed to disease-causing bacteria (732).",

Six studies found that including plant-based proteins in feed led to decreased salmon growth rates (924).

A trial in Tasmania found that fallowing allowed sediment community structure under salmon cages to become more similar to non-impacted sites (1027). Integrated aquaculture systems, where other species are farmed alongside salmon, have shown that blue mussels can absorb farm waste in Canada and algae growth is enhanced when placed near fish farms in Scotland (932).

Vaccinations resulted in higher survival in salmon exposed to various bacteria in studies across Iceland, Norway, Australia, and Canada (733). Selectively breeding salmon for high resistance to infectious pancreatic necrosis led to increased survival levels compared to a low-resistance family in a Norwegian study (735). In another study, salmon that underwent aerobic training also showed higher survival rates when exposed to the same disease (740). Furthermore, feeding salmon a probiotic before exposure to four different bacteria also increased survival (732).",

Several studies found negative impacts on growth, with decreased growth rates and reduced final body weights compared to fish meal diets (924). However, other studies found similar growth rates between the two diet types (924). Conversely, a study in Norway found a positive side effect where a diet with 28% plant-based protein reduced the number of salmon infected with lice (732).
