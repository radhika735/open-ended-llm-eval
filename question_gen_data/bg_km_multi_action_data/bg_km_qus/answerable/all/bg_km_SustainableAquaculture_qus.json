    "question": "What non-chemical methods are available to control sea lice on Atlantic salmon farms?",
    "answer": "Based on the evidence, non-chemical methods to control sea lice include using certain species of cleaner wrasse, though studies in Ireland show their effectiveness is mixed (738). The number of lice can also be reduced by feeding salmon a diet with plant-based protein and beta-glucans, which reduced lice infection by 28% and a further 28% respectively in a Norwegian study (732). Another study in Norway found that keeping salmon in low intensity artificial light or natural lighting resulted in lower numbers of lice (741).",

    "question": "For farmed salmon in Norway, which interventions have been shown to be effective for improving survival rates or reducing parasite loads?",
    "answer": "In Norway, several interventions have proven effective. A study found that feeding salmon a diet with fish meal and 28% plant-based protein reduced lice numbers by 28%, with a further 28% reduction when beta-glucans were added (732). Breeding for high resistance to infectious pancreatic necrosis increased survival levels when exposed to the disease (735). Salmon that had undergone aerobic training also had higher survival rates when exposed to the same disease (740). Finally, keeping salmon in low intensity artificial light led to lower numbers of lice (741).",

    "answer": "The evidence shows geographical variation in effectiveness. A study in Scotland recorded lower lice numbers on salmon in cages using a fallowing system, but a study in Australia found fallowing made no difference to mortality from Amoebic Gill Disease (1026). Similarly, studies on cleaner wrasse in Ireland had mixed effects; one found them as effective as chemical treatments for controlling lice, while another found them ineffective at preventing lice outbreaks (738).",

    "answer": "Two replicated studies in Norway found similar final weight gain and feed conversion ratios between salmon fed diets containing fish meal only or a krill meal substitute (916). In contrast, the effects of plant-based proteins are mixed. Six studies found that including plant-based proteins led to decreased growth rates, while three studies found similar growth rates compared to fish meal diets (924). For feeding efficiency, some studies found it was lowered, one found it increased, and others found it was similar to fish meal diets (924).",

Two studies in Australia provide conflicting results for freshwater bathing; one found a reduction in amoebae numbers on gills for up to 10 days, while another found similar levels in treated and untreated salmon (739). For cage size, a replicated study in Australia provides positive evidence, recording lower levels of AGD in salmon kept within larger cages compared to smaller ones (742).",

    "answer": "A potential benefit is parasite control; a Norwegian study found that including 28% plant-based protein in the diet reduced lice infection by 28% (732). However, there are several potential drawbacks related to fish performance. Multiple studies in Norway, Scotland, and the USA found that plant-based protein diets led to decreased growth rates, reduced final body weights, and lower feed digestibility. Some studies also noted that the morphology of the salmon's distal intestine was altered by these diets (924). It is worth noting that other studies found similar growth rates and feeding efficiencies compared to fish meal diets (924).",

In Australia, supplementing diets with phytase led to greater final weights in one study, though another found no difference with phytase and phosphate supplementation (930).

In Norway, diets containing up to 25% bacterial protein produced similar growth rates to fishmeal, but a 50% bacterial protein diet led to lower growth (918). Another Norwegian study found higher growth with 18-36% bacterial protein (918). A study in Norway found no weight difference in salmon fed diets with yeast compared to fishmeal (920).

In Scotland, algal growth was enhanced adjacent to fish farms (932). Artificial reefs near fish farms in the Red Sea were colonized by species with the potential to remove organic compounds from farm effluents (934).

For freshwater farms, sludge drying beds were found in Canadian trials to effectively remove phosphorus from sludge (943).
