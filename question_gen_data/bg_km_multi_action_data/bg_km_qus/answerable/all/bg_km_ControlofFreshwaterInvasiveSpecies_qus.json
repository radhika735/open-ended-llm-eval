    "answer": "Applying herbicides like glyphosate and diquat has been found to reduce or eradicate Crassula helmsii [1279]. Similarly, physical methods have shown success; covering the plant with black sheeting or carpet strips can eradicate or severely reduce its cover, and using seawater has also been shown to eradicate it in several trials [1294, 1288]. However, one study noted that after initial eradication with black sheeting, Crassula helmsii progressively recolonized the site [1294].",

    "answer": "Evidence suggests several beneficial actions. Introducing native predators like the northern pike can lead to a strong decline in bullfrog tadpole numbers [1039]. Direct removal of juveniles using methods like double fyke nets in small, shallow ponds can be effective, especially as part of a combined treatment [1046]. Direct removal of adults through methods like shooting can also significantly reduce their numbers, although populations may rebound rapidly following intensive removal [1045]. Finally, certain chemicals like caffeine or chloroxylenol have been found to kill American bullfrogs in controlled studies [1048].",

For floating pennywort, a South American weevil caused feeding lesions but did not reduce the plant's biomass in field trials, making it unlikely to be beneficial [1123]. In contrast, for water primrose, a flea beetle was found to cause heavy feeding destruction and significantly reduce its abundance, suggesting this approach is likely to be beneficial [1135]. For parrot's feather, the introduction of grass carp reduced its abundance in some studies, but not in others, while a leaf-feeding beetle reduced its growth, indicating a trade-off between benefits and harms [1599].",

Altering water conditions is another option: exposing clams to high temperatures (36°C or higher), which may be feasible in industrial facilities, leads to high mortality [1116]. Other methods shown to be effective in wider settings include mechanical suction dredging, which can reduce clam densities by 96% [1120], and placing gas-impermeable barriers on the bed of a waterbody [1117].",

For skunk cabbage, annual removal of recently established plants over five years was successful, but a twice-yearly program on a large infestation was less effective [1101]. For water primrose, hand-pulling failed to reduce a large population but did eradicate a smaller one at the margins of a pond [1138]. Similarly, for floating pennywort, removal was ineffective in one study because the growth rate exceeded the rate of removal, while another study greatly reduced its cover with mechanical removal followed by monthly hand-picking, but did not achieve eradication [1126]. The key factor is the ability to remove all fragments, as incomplete removal can lead to regeneration and continued spread.",

Two container trials and two field trials found that seawater eradicated the plant (1288). Conversely, methods rated as unlikely to be beneficial include hydrogen peroxide, which did not control the plant in tank trials (1281), hot foam, which had no effect in one controlled study (1286), and aquatic dyes, which also did not reduce coverage (1293).",

    "question": "What factors appear to influence the success of trapping as a control method for invasive crayfish?",
    "answer": "The success of trapping for crayfish control appears to depend on the species and whether it is combined with other methods. For red swamp crayfish, baiting traps with food (tinned meat) was found to be most effective, capturing over half of all crayfish in one study (1029). However, trapping alone was found to be ineffective for managing spiny-cheeked crayfish (1029). Success is likely enhanced when combined with other methods; a study found that combining trapping with the introduction of predators significantly reduced red swamp crayfish populations and was more effective than predation alone (1031).",

For the American bullfrog (1049), red-eared terrapin (1060), and parrot's feather (1603), the synopsis explicitly states that no evidence was found that tested the impact of public education.

For red swamp crayfish, combining trapping with the introduction of predators significantly reduced populations in a pond and was more effective than predation alone (1031).

For skunk cabbage, studies showed conflicting results for glyphosate, while 2,4-D amine was found to be effective (1102). For water primrose, effectiveness was enhanced by using an adjuvant like TopFilm with glyphosate, which increased mortality from 97% to 100% in one study (1139). For parrot's feather, the specific herbicide is important; one study found 2,4-D more effective than diquat or glyphosate (1606), another found triclopyr more effective than glyphosate (1689), and other studies confirmed that while many herbicides are effective, some like fluridone and clopyralid are not (1699).",
