    "question": "For supporting bumblebees on UK farmland, what is the difference in effectiveness between sowing field margins with agricultural nectar mixes versus native wildflower mixes?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests a trade-off depending on the goal. Three replicated trials showed that a mix of agricultural forage plants attracts a greater number of bumblebees than a perennial wildflower mix, at least in the first year (18). However, a separate small trial showed that long-tongued bumblebee species strongly preferred plots of perennial wildflower seed mix over a mix of annual forage plants (19). It is also noted that margins sown with agricultural legume plants can degrade in value for bumblebees and may need to be re-sown every few years (18).",

    "question": "What are the most effective methods for providing nesting sites for different types of wild bees?",
    "answer": "Different methods are effective for different bee groups. For bumblebees, one trial showed that grassy field margins attract nest-searching queens (12), and for artificial sites, multiple trials indicate that buried underground nest boxes are generally the most effective, showing higher occupancy rates than surface-level wooden boxes (48). For ground-nesting solitary bees, several small trials have shown that artificially created patches of bare soil can be successfully colonized (13). Many other solitary bee species readily occupy artificial nest boxes, such as bundles of hollow stems or blocks of wood drilled with holes (47).",

    "question": "What are the documented effects of managing uncropped field margins on wild bee populations in the UK?",
    "answer": "Various management techniques for uncropped field margins in the UK show different outcomes for bees. Sowing margins with native wildflowers was shown in five trials to support higher abundance and richness of foraging bumblebees compared to cropped, grassy, or naturally regenerated margins (19). In contrast, evidence for simple grassy margins is mixed, with three separate trials showing either enhanced bee abundance, enhanced bumblebee abundance and diversity, or no effect (14). Leaving margins to regenerate naturally resulted in more bumblebees than cropped margins in four trials, but their value can be inconsistent between years and may depend on weed species (20). Finally, two trials showed that leaving crop edges unsprayed (conservation headlands) did not attract more foraging bumblebees than conventional crop fields (29).",

This means no studies that directly and quantitatively tested these interventions were found for: connecting patches of natural or semi-natural habitat (10), protecting existing habitat from conversion to agriculture (5), increasing the proportion of natural or semi-natural habitat in farmed landscapes (6), re-planting native forest (35), or retaining dead wood during forest management (36).",

    "question": "Given the mixed evidence for reduced tillage on farmland, what are some alternative on-farm actions to benefit wild bees?",
    "answer": "While the evidence for reduced tillage benefiting ground-nesting bees is mixed (11), several alternative on-farm actions are supported by evidence. Fourteen trials have shown that planting dedicated floral resources, such as phacelia or perennial herbs, attracts substantial numbers of foraging wild bees, with one trial showing it enhanced reproductive success for a solitary bee species (17). Sowing uncropped field margins with agricultural nectar and pollen mixes has been shown in four replicated trials to attract significantly more foraging bumblebees than grassy or cropped margins (18). Furthermore, four trials in Europe have demonstrated enhanced diversity and/or abundance of foraging wild bees on land managed under various agri-environment schemes compared to conventionally managed land (24).",

    "question": "What factors are associated with the success or failure of providing artificial nest sites for solitary bees?",
    "answer": "Multiple factors affect the success of artificial nest sites. Location is critical; nest boxes must be within the foraging range of bees, which for some species is just 150-600 m from resources (47). Design also matters; a trial found reed stem and wooden grooved-board boxes were more productive than those with plastic components, which had higher parasitism and mould (47). Predation and parasitism are major causes of failure, with mortality rates ranging from 13% to 56% across different studies (47). Competition from non-target species can also be an issue. For instance, two trials found introduced European earwigs occupied nest boxes (47), but another showed that excluding them with a sticky barrier increased usage by native bees (44). Similarly, excluding ants was found to increase offspring production in one trial (46).",

    "question": "What actions can be taken in domestic gardens to support wild bee populations?",
    "answer": "Evidence supports two main actions in domestic gardens. The first is planting appropriate flowers. Two trials in North America found more wild bees (either more species or more individuals) in gardens planted with bee forage or native plants compared to conventionally managed gardens (1). A UK trial also noted that some popular non-native or horticulturally modified flowers are not frequently visited by insects (1). The second action is to practice lower-intensity management. A UK study found more species of bumblebee in gardens with less intensive management, which reflected the garden's tidiness and the use of pesticides (2).",

For reintroducing entire colonies, seven trials showed variable success, with some producing good numbers of new queens and others producing very few or none (52). Translocating existing bumblebee colonies has shown negative impacts, including queen death and lower productivity in two out of three small trials (53). For solitary bees, one trial showed that translocating immature carpenter bees can establish a new population, but translocating adults was unsuccessful (55).",

One large trial showed that the abundance of long-tongued bumblebees was positively correlated with the number of pollen and nectar agri-environment agreements in a 10 km grid square, demonstrating a landscape-scale benefit (21). Conversely, a trial in the Netherlands found that bee numbers were not higher in farmland 50-1,500 m away from planted flower patches, suggesting the local benefit did not scale up in that instance (17). Furthermore, two landscape-scale trials in the UK found bumblebee populations were not enhanced on farmland managed under agri-environment schemes (24).",

Similarly, set-aside areas left for two years or more showed higher species richness of bees (7). Many species of solitary bee readily nest in artificial nest boxes, often in the first year of provision, and populations can double over three years with repeated provision (47).",
