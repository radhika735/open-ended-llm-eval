    "question": "What are the most effective interventions for restoring peatland vegetation in agricultural landscapes?",
    "answer": "Based on the evidence, excluding livestock from degraded peatlands is likely to be beneficial (1734). While seven of nine studies found no effect on key herb groups, three studies found shrub cover increased after excluding livestock. Rewetting drained peatlands is considered beneficial, with numerous studies showing increases in peatland-characteristic plants, mosses, and herbs (1756). Restoring vegetation with multiple interventions at once is also likely to be beneficial (1803). The effectiveness of other actions in agricultural settings, such as reducing grazing intensity or creating habitat corridors, is unknown (1735, 1730).",

    "answer": "Both actions are rated as likely to be beneficial. Cutting forest plantations alone was evaluated in four studies, which found it increased cover of some herbs like cottongrass and sedges, and increased overall plant species richness in fens (1731). Combining tree removal with rewetting has been evaluated in eleven studies and was found to change plant community composition, increase wetland-characteristic plants, and increase cover of Sphagnum moss and herbs like cottongrass. However, effects on overall plant richness were mixed in these studies (1732).",

Some studies suggest benefits, such as using fire to control problematic plants like heather (1774) or to reduce tree/shrub cover (1763, 1774). Two studies found burning increased plant species richness or diversity (1763). However, there are documented negative impacts. Two other replicated studies found that burning reduced or limited plant species richness (1774). The background information also cautions that uncontrolled burns can damage seed banks, Sphagnum mosses, and the peat itself (1763, 1774).",

Cutting/mowing problematic herbaceous plants had no significant effect on plant community composition in two of three studies (1770).

It typically leads to changes in plant community composition, with drier grassland communities being replaced by wetland-characteristic communities (1756). The evidence shows that rewetting generally increases the cover of Sphagnum moss (twelve studies) and key herb groups such as sedges and cottongrasses (twenty-one studies). Conversely, it often reduces tree and shrub cover (ten studies).

    "question": "Beyond direct physical management, what policy, financial, and awareness-raising approaches can be used to protect peatland habitats?",
    "answer": "Several non-physical approaches can be used. Legal protection is 'Likely to be beneficial'; studies found it reduced peat swamp forest loss relative to unprotected areas and led to increased peatland area in China (1796). Financial incentives, such as paying landowners, have 'Unknown effectiveness', with one review finding UK agri-environment schemes had mixed success in protecting bog habitat (1799). Awareness-raising and campaigning also have 'Unknown effectiveness'. A public awareness campaign was followed by an increase in people buying peat-free compost (1844), and a targeted lobbying campaign in the UK led to increased protection and changes in retailer behaviour (1849). No evidence was found for the effect of adopting voluntary agreements (1798).",

    "question": "What are the typical outcomes when introducing seeds to restore peatland vegetation?",
    "answer": "Introducing seeds is 'Likely to be beneficial' for both herbs and shrubs/trees, though outcomes vary. For herbs, studies report germination and establishment of sown species (1823). For trees and shrubs, studies also report germination, seedling survival, and development of greater shrub cover in sown plots compared to unsown plots (1824). However, for both herbs and shrubs, the effect on overall plant species richness is inconsistent, with different studies finding increases, decreases, or no effect (1823, 1824).",
