    "question": "What is the most effective way to connect peatland patches across human-altered landscapes: creating corridors in developed areas or in farmed areas?",
    "answer": "The evidence suggests that creating habitat corridors in farmed areas has 'Unknown effectiveness' based on one study in a tropical peat swamp which found a corridor contained numerous trees and species (1730). In contrast, for creating corridors in developed areas, 'No evidence was found' to evaluate the effects on peatland vegetation (1720). Therefore, while the evidence is limited, there is at least some data supporting the structure of corridors in farmed areas, whereas there is none for developed areas.",

    "answer": "Several physical interventions can be used to create conditions suitable for natural peatland plant colonization without active planting. These include filling or blocking ditches, which has been shown to be colonized by herbs and bryophytes within 2-3 years in some studies and is rated 'Likely to be beneficial' (1805). Removing the upper layer of peat or soil is also 'Likely to be beneficial', with studies in fens showing it can increase cover of characteristic plants and overall species richness (1809). Other options with 'Unknown effectiveness' include excavating pools (1806), reprofiling the landscape (1807), and disturbing the peat surface to encourage desirable plants (1811).",

Simply cutting or removing forest plantations was found in four studies to increase herb cover and overall plant richness (1731). When removal is combined with rewetting, eleven studies found this increased the abundance of wetland-characteristic plants, Sphagnum moss cover in some cases, and herb cover. This combination also changed plant community composition to be less like forested sites (1732).",

Directly planting mosses is rated as 'Likely to be beneficial', with seven studies showing that planted mosses survive, grow, and increase in cover (1818). Adding moss fragments to the peatland surface is rated as 'Beneficial', with twelve studies showing that added Sphagnum established and cover was higher in sown plots than in unsown plots (1821).

Cutting or mowing herbaceous plants is 'Likely to be beneficial,' with studies showing it alters plant community composition, increases cover of characteristic plants and mosses, and boosts species richness (1759). Similarly, cutting large trees/shrubs is 'Likely to be beneficial,' increasing herb cover and the abundance of fen meadow species (1761). Using grazing to restore disturbance has a 'Trade off between benefit and harms,' as it can increase some herb groups but reduce Sphagnum cover and species richness compared to mowing (1762).

While one study in Sweden found liming increased survival and growth of planted fen mosses, another study in the Netherlands reported that it typically reduced survival of planted fen herbs (1825). When added without planting, one study in a fen meadow found liming increased overall vegetation biomass, mostly grass (1790). Adding inorganic fertilizer to planted areas has a 'Trade off between benefit and harms' because while it can increase growth, there is a risk of undesirable long-term nutrient increases (1826). One study of adding fertilizer without planting in a fen meadow found it increased vegetation biomass (1812).",
