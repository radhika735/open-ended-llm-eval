    "question": "What are the most effective interventions for restoring peatland vegetation in agricultural landscapes?",
    "answer": "Based on the evidence, excluding livestock from degraded peatlands is likely to be beneficial (1734). While seven of nine studies found no effect on key herb groups, three studies found shrub cover increased after excluding livestock. Rewetting drained peatlands is considered beneficial, with numerous studies showing increases in peatland-characteristic plants, mosses, and herbs (1756). Restoring vegetation with multiple interventions at once is also likely to be beneficial (1803). The effectiveness of other actions in agricultural settings, such as reducing grazing intensity or creating habitat corridors, is unknown (1735, 1730).",

    "answer": "Both actions are rated as likely to be beneficial. Cutting forest plantations alone was evaluated in four studies, which found it increased cover of some herbs like cottongrass and sedges, and increased overall plant species richness in fens (1731). Combining tree removal with rewetting has been evaluated in eleven studies and was found to change plant community composition, increase wetland-characteristic plants, and increase cover of Sphagnum moss and herbs like cottongrass. However, effects on overall plant richness were mixed in these studies (1732).",

Some studies suggest benefits, such as using fire to control problematic plants like heather (1774) or to reduce tree/shrub cover (1763, 1774). Two studies found burning increased plant species richness or diversity (1763). However, there are documented negative impacts. Two other replicated studies found that burning reduced or limited plant species richness (1774). The background information also cautions that uncontrolled burns can damage seed banks, Sphagnum mosses, and the peat itself (1763, 1774).",

Cutting/mowing problematic herbaceous plants had no significant effect on plant community composition in two of three studies (1770).

It typically leads to changes in plant community composition, with drier grassland communities being replaced by wetland-characteristic communities (1756). The evidence shows that rewetting generally increases the cover of Sphagnum moss (twelve studies) and key herb groups such as sedges and cottongrasses (twenty-one studies). Conversely, it often reduces tree and shrub cover (ten studies).

    "answer": "Several non-physical approaches can be used. Legal protection is 'Likely to be beneficial'; studies found it reduced peat swamp forest loss relative to unprotected areas and led to increased peatland area in China (1796). Financial incentives, such as paying landowners, have 'Unknown effectiveness', with one review finding UK agri-environment schemes had mixed success in protecting bog habitat (1799). Awareness-raising and campaigning also have 'Unknown effectiveness'. A public awareness campaign was followed by an increase in people buying peat-free compost (1844), and a targeted lobbying campaign in the UK led to increased protection and changes in retailer behaviour (1849). No evidence was found for the effect of adopting voluntary agreements (1798).",

    "question": "As an alternative to prescribed burning for managing vegetation on fens, what are the effects of mowing or introducing grazing?",
    "answer": "Mowing and grazing are two alternatives to prescribed burning for managing fen vegetation. Using prescribed fire in fens was found to reduce tree/shrub cover and, in one study, increase plant species richness (1763). Cutting or mowing is likely to be beneficial, with studies showing it can increase plant species richness and the cover of fen-characteristic plants and mosses, while reducing the cover of dominant herbs like reeds (1759). The evidence for using grazing is more mixed, showing a trade-off between benefits and harms. Studies reported that grazing could increase cover of some herbs like cottongrasses but also reduce Sphagnum moss cover, with inconsistent effects on species richness (1762).",

    "question": "To restore a bog after peat extraction, which vegetation introduction techniques are most effective at establishing Sphagnum moss cover?",
    "answer": "Several vegetation introduction techniques are likely to be beneficial or beneficial for establishing Sphagnum moss on bogs after peat extraction. Directly planting mosses, such as Sphagnum-dominated sods, has been shown to result in high survival and increased moss cover (1818). Adding loose Sphagnum moss fragments to the surface is also beneficial, with studies reporting established Sphagnum cover ranging from negligible to over 90% (1821). Similarly, adding mixed vegetation fragments containing Sphagnum is beneficial, resulting in cover ranging from less than 1% to 73% (1822). The moss layer transfer technique, which combines spreading vegetation fragments with rewetting, reprofiling, mulching and fertilizing, is also likely to be beneficial, with one study showing it resulted in greater moss cover than an unrestored area (1804). The available evidence does not allow for a direct comparison of which method is most effective.",

    "question": "What are the effects of different interventions designed to manipulate water levels on drained peatlands without planting?",
    "answer": "Multiple interventions can manipulate water levels on drained peatlands. Rewetting by raising the water table is considered beneficial; thirty-six studies found it typically increased Sphagnum moss and herb cover (especially sedges and cottongrasses), reduced tree and shrub cover, and had mixed effects on overall plant diversity (1756). Filling or blocking ditches is likely to be beneficial for vegetation growth within the ditches themselves, with two of three studies showing ditches were colonized by herbs and bryophytes within 2-3 years (1805). Irrigating the peatland surface has unknown effectiveness; one study found it temporarily increased Sphagnum shoots, while another reported colonization by wetland herbs (1859).",
