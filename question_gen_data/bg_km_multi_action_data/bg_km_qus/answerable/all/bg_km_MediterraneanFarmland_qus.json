    "question": "What are the overall effects of growing cover crops on Mediterranean farmland?",
    "answer": "Growing cover crops has varied effects. For soil, it is beneficial, increasing organic matter, nitrogen, soil organisms, and reducing erosion [1345]. For water, it's a trade-off, as it can reduce soil water content but also decrease water loss from runoff and nitrate leaching [1357]. For crop production, it is likely to be ineffective or harmful, with multiple studies finding lower cash crop yields [1351]. For pest regulation, it is likely beneficial, reducing weeds and some pest insects [1394].",

    "question": "What are the effects of planting flowers on Mediterranean farmland for both pest regulation and pollination?",
    "answer": "Planting flowers presents a trade-off between benefits for pollination and mixed outcomes for pest control. For pollination, the action is likely beneficial, with studies showing more pollinators visiting adjacent crops and more wild bee species and individuals within the flower strips [1406]. For pest regulation, while three studies found greater pest reduction from natural enemies, two other studies found more pests or crop damage next to flower strips [1400].",
