    "question": "What management actions are available to control problematic tree species in shrubland habitats?",
    "answer": "Several actions to control problematic tree species have been studied, though their effectiveness is often uncertain. Methods include applying herbicide to trees (1629), cutting trees (1630), and using grazing by livestock (1634). More intensive approaches involve cutting trees and then removing leaf litter (1631), removing seedlings (1632), applying herbicide (1636), or using prescribed burning (1637). Prescribed burning can be used on its own (1721) or in combination with increased livestock numbers (1722). Most of these interventions are rated as having 'Unknown effectiveness', with studies showing mixed results on shrub cover and plant diversity.",

Applying herbicide increased heather seedlings in one trial but failed to increase heather cover in two other studies (1652). Cutting bracken increased heather cover in two studies but had no effect in two others (1653). A combination of cutting and applying herbicide also yielded mixed results, increasing heather cover in one study but having no effect in another (1654). In contrast, using a 'bracken bruiser' was found to increase bracken cover in one UK study, although bracken also increased in the control plots (1726).",

Reducing or stopping grazing is often beneficial, with studies showing that excluding livestock with fences (1545) or reducing livestock numbers (1607) can increase shrub cover, biomass, and height. Conversely, increasing livestock numbers can have negative effects on shrubs, with studies finding it can decrease dwarf shrub cover (1628). However, increasing livestock can also have benefits, such as increasing the number of plant species (1628). Using grazing specifically to control trees (1634) or grass (1646) has shown mixed or uncertain results on shrubland vegetation.",

    "answer": "The evidence suggests that cutting or mowing may be an alternative to burning, but results for both are mixed. In European heathlands, using prescribed burning to control purple moor grass was found to reduce the cover of common heather without affecting the grass itself (1723). Reinstating traditional burning showed an initial decrease in plant cover, which later increased (1625). As an alternative, cutting or mowing to mimic grazing had mixed effects on heather cover in studies from Spain and Italy, but it tended to increase grass cover (1627). Specifically cutting to control grass in the UK did not alter cover of common heather in several studies (1638).",

The addition of peat alongside seeding increased heather cover and density in the UK, though seedling survival was sometimes low (1705). Adding sulphur had mixed or no effects on heather cover (1691, 1710).
