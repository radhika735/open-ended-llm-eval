    "question": "What actions are available to improve butterfly and moth habitats in urban areas?",
    "answer": "Several actions have been studied. Altering mowing regimes on greenspaces to be less frequent has been found to increase butterfly species richness and abundance (3841). Planting parks and gardens with appropriate native species can also increase the richness of butterflies and moths (3842). Protecting existing greenfield sites like native forests and grasslands in urban areas has been shown to support higher butterfly species richness than urban parks or non-native plantations (3836). In contrast, establishing 'green infrastructure' like green roofs was found to support lower butterfly richness and abundance compared to urban parks (3837). Wildlife-friendly gardening practices have shown mixed results, with some studies finding no increase in butterfly abundance from actions like reduced weeding (3834).",

    "answer": "Evidence suggests these methods can benefit different parts of the lepidopteran community. Clearing patches in forests was found to increase butterfly species richness but could decrease moth species richness compared to closed-canopy forest (3938). Coppiced woodlands were found to have greater butterfly species richness than unmanaged woodland but lower macro-moth richness than mature forest (3939). Thinning trees, often along with prescribed burning, was found to increase the species richness and abundance of butterflies compared to unmanaged woodland (3940). Different communities of butterflies and moths were supported by coppiced woodland of different ages (3939), and wider woodland rides created by clearing contained more unique macro-moth species than standard rides or mature forest (3938).",

Overall, farms managed under such schemes often have higher abundance of butterflies and moths than conventional farms (3915). Sown wildflower strips are particularly effective, showing higher abundance of butterflies compared to conventional field margins or cropped fields (3932). Similarly, grass margins managed with restrictions on fertilizer and pesticide use showed greater moth abundance than conventional margins (3894).

    "answer": "Recovery timeframes vary depending on the original habitat and restoration method. After logging, naturally regenerating forests were found to have the highest butterfly abundance and species richness 12–25 years after felling (3876). When restoring arable land to permanent grassland, butterfly communities showed increasing similarity to high-quality grasslands over the first 10 years (3929). However, another study on grassland restoration found that species richness was higher on grasslands created less than 10 years ago compared to those over 20 years old (3929). For restored forests, one study found a 54-year-old restored forest had a similar butterfly community to remnant forest, while 11–22-year-old restored forests did not (3936).",

Similarly, managing land under power lines, typically by mechanical cutting, was found to increase butterfly richness and abundance, with effectiveness depending on the time since management (3855). Stopping herbicide use on road verges also showed positive or neutral effects on richness and abundance (3899).

    "answer": "Several alternatives to clearcutting are available to mitigate timber harvesting impacts. Using selective or reduced impact logging had mixed results on species richness but could increase butterfly abundance compared to primary forest (3867). Methods like group selection harvesting and shelterwood harvesting also had mixed effects on moth species richness compared to unharvested forest, but recovery of richness was faster after shelterwood harvesting than clearcutting (3868, 3871). Following logging, encouraging natural regeneration can lead to greater moth richness and abundance compared to plantations, and butterfly communities can become established over time (3876).",

Some translocated populations have persisted for over a decade and increased in abundance, particularly when the reintroduction is combined with habitat management such as coppicing, planting of host plants, or invasive species removal (3909, 3911). However, a significant proportion of projects fail, with populations dying out within a few years (3909). For specialist parasitic species like the large blues, the success is highly dependent on the presence and condition of specific host ant colonies at the release site; for example, caterpillar survival was found to be higher in host ant nests that did not contain a queen (3909).",

Following a single prescribed fire in open habitats, abundance of some species was higher one or more years after burning, though initial reductions can occur (3882). In prairies under a rotational burning regime, the abundance of specialist butterflies was higher on sites burned more than one, two, or four years ago, with generalist species peaking in the third year after a burn (3883).

Simple uncultivated margins (3981) and grass buffer strips (3982) are generally better than the cropped field itself but less effective than floristically enhanced versions.

Peatland restoration has shown positive results, with restored mires having higher species richness and abundance of specialist butterflies than unrestored mires, reaching levels similar to pristine sites (3948).

    "question": "What evidence has been found for actions to mitigate the impacts of urban development and wind turbines on butterflies and moths?",
    "answer": "The evidence base for several potential mitigation actions is currently empty. No studies were found that evaluated the effects on butterflies or moths of retaining buffer zones around habitat (3833), protecting or restoring brownfield sites (3835), planting trees to reduce city temperatures (3838), or requiring Environmental Impact Assessments from developers (3840). Likewise, no studies were found assessing the effects of changing turbine lighting (3843) or colour (3844) to reduce attraction to butterflies and moths.",

    "question": "How can surrounding landscape or local habitat condition influence the effectiveness of conservation actions for butterflies and moths?",
    "answer": "The effectiveness of conservation actions can be strongly influenced by context. For instance, the benefits of organic farming for butterfly and moth richness and abundance were found to be greater in intensively managed agricultural landscapes than in already diverse landscapes (3907). In another example, legal protection of habitat does not guarantee positive outcomes; one study found that protected grasslands in 'Favourable' condition had worse population trends for several butterfly species than those in 'Unfavourable' condition, highlighting that the specific management within the protected area is critical (3831).",
