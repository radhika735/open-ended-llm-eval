    "question": "For agricultural landscapes, what are the most effective interventions for creating and managing aquatic habitats for amphibians?",
    "answer": "The evidence suggests creating new ponds is a beneficial action, with numerous studies showing amphibians readily colonize and establish breeding populations in them (869). Managing existing ditches can also be likely to be beneficial, as one study found that ditches under agri-environment schemes had significantly higher amphibian abundance and species numbers (749). Paying farmers to implement conservation measures, which can include creating breeding habitat, has also proven likely to be beneficial for increasing frog and toad populations (818). In contrast, excluding livestock with fencing is rated as likely to be ineffective or harmful, as some studies found higher amphibian abundance with grazing (746).",

    "question": "What interventions are available for creating or providing shelter habitats for amphibians, such as refuges or hibernation sites?",
    "answer": "Several interventions exist to provide shelter for amphibians. Artificial hibernacula can be created, and have been found to maintain populations of great crested newts and be used by other newts and frogs (759). Refuges can also be created by adding coarse woody debris to forest floors, which had mixed effects on individual species abundance, or by creating other artificial refugia which were used by translocated frogs and hellbenders (772). In harvested forests, leaving piles of coarse woody debris provided shelter where juvenile amphibian survival was significantly higher than in open areas (843).",

    "question": "What factors and interventions have influenced the success of natterjack toad conservation projects in the UK?",
    "answer": "Several factors influence natterjack toad conservation success in the UK. Habitat management, including pond creation and vegetation clearance, has been shown to increase, stabilize or maintain populations (866, 761). Translocation success is higher on dune and saltmarsh habitats than on heathland (859). Adding lime to ponds has produced mixed results, in some cases helping establish populations but in others causing high tadpole mortality (748). Similarly, the effect of grazing is unclear, with one study showing no benefit while others found management that included grazing was beneficial (780).",
