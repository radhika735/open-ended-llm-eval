    "answer": "Several trawl gear modifications show evidence for reducing unwanted catch. Fitting size-sorting escape grids to both prawn/shrimp (2721) and fish (2720) trawls effectively reduced unwanted fish catch in the majority of studies. Using larger mesh sizes (2697), fitting mesh escape panels (2716), and using square mesh instead of diamond mesh codends (2714) also reduced unwanted catch in a majority of studies, although with some variability depending on the specific fishery and species.",

Additionally, establishing move-on rules that trigger temporary closures when catch thresholds are met can reduce fishing effort and mortality (3815).

One study found the majority of some discarded species survived, but survival was reduced by hooking/capture injuries and longer tow durations (2691). Shorter trawl deployments increased survival for some flatfish but not others (2686). Using larger mesh sizes improved survival for skates and rays in one of three studies (2697). Using different hook types reduced injuries associated with mortality in several studies but did not directly improve survival in others (2698). In one study, survival of mackerel was reduced after passing through an escape grid on a purse seine net (2703). Reducing air exposure did not increase survival of small-spotted catshark caught during trawling in one study (2690).",

In the Tasman Sea, one study found that most fish species had lower abundance two years after closure in a marine reserve estuary (2667).

A review found that using technology to communicate near real-time catch information to fishers resulted in reductions of unwanted catch in two of three cases (3826).
