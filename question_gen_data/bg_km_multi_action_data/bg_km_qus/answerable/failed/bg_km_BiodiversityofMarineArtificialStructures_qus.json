    "question": "Which interventions can increase invertebrate abundance on subtidal artificial structures?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests that creating hole habitats (>50 mm) can increase the abundance of some mobile invertebrates like brown crabs (3434). Additionally, using certain environmentally-sensitive materials, such as shell-concrete, has been found to increase bivalve abundance (3470). However, other interventions, such as creating grooves or pits, have shown mixed effects on invertebrate abundance (3448, 3455).",

    "question": "What are the benefits of creating rock pools on intertidal artificial structures for overall species richness?",
    "answer": "Creating rock pools is generally beneficial for species richness. Nine out of twelve studies in locations including Australia, the UK, Spain, and Malaysia found that rock pools supported higher combined species richness of macroalgae, invertebrates, and/or fish compared to structure surfaces without them (3476). This effect was sometimes observed in conjunction with creating hole habitats (3476).",

    "answer": "Creating linear features like grooves, ridges, and ledges has shown mixed results. Creating grooves (1–50 mm) can increase species richness and abundance, but several studies found no effect (3473). Small ridges or ledges (1–50 mm) also had mixed outcomes, with some studies showing increased richness but others finding no increase in abundance or community composition change (3464). Combining grooves with small protrusions/ridges/ledges generally increased species richness/diversity, but effects on abundance were mixed (3474). Creating large ridges or ledges (>50 mm) was found in some studies to increase the abundance of specific invertebrates like mussels or limpets and increase overall species diversity (3465).",

    "question": "Which interventions are most consistently effective at altering the overall community composition on subtidal artificial structures?",
    "answer": "Several interventions have been shown to alter community composition. Creating hole habitats (>50 mm) altered macroalgae, invertebrate, and fish communities in three studies (3434). Similarly, creating pits (3455), grooves (3448), or a combination of grooves and small ledges (3452), often along with environmentally-sensitive material, also altered community composition. Using environmentally-sensitive materials alone, such as specific types of concrete or quarried rock, altered communities in six of eleven studies (3470). Creating textured surfaces also altered community composition in two of three studies (3449). These actions have all been found to change the species makeup on subtidal structures.",

Creating short flexible habitats did not increase fish abundance in one study (3459). Creating grooves and small ridges or ledges did not increase fish abundance in two studies, while another found mixed effects depending on the site (3474). Transplanting oysters and/or coralline algae also did not increase fish abundance in two studies, with a third finding mixed effects (3472). Similarly, creating rock pools had mixed effects depending on the species group and site (3476).",

Managing or restricting harvesting was associated with higher fish species richness, a different community composition, and higher seabream abundances in studies in Italy (3457). Creating small swimthroughs (≤100 mm) had mixed effects on juvenile fish but did support species that were otherwise absent (3436). Creating hole habitats (>50 mm) and long flexible habitats (>50 mm) had mixed or no effects on fish abundance and richness in the studies found (3434, 3451).",

    "question": "What conservation actions for artificial structures have been studied in estuaries in Australia, and what were the outcomes?",
    "answer": "In Australian estuaries, studies have evaluated several actions. On intertidal structures, creating rock pools and/or holes increased species diversity and supported species absent from other surfaces (3476, 3467). Creating grooves and small ledges had mixed results, with grooves supporting higher richness than ledges (3464, 3473). Reducing a structure's slope showed conflicting results between studies (3461). Transplanting oysters had mixed effects on richness but could increase mobile invertebrate abundance (3472). On subtidal structures, creating short (3450) or long (3451) flexible habitats had mixed effects on invertebrate and seahorse abundance, while reducing the cleaned area of a structure increased seahorse abundance (3447).",
