    "answer": "Studies have found that fencing to exclude grazing is likely to be beneficial, with four of five studies showing increased survival, size, and cover of planted trees (1254). In contrast, the effectiveness of tree guards or shelters is unknown. One study found that light-coloured plastic shelters increased survival, while another found that guards increased tree height at 37 months but not 44 months (1268).",

Mechanically removing understory vegetation after planting had no effect on seedling emergence, survival, or growth in five studies, although one study found it increased seedling biomass (1256).

Excluding livestock with wire fences was generally beneficial, increasing understory biomass and tree regeneration in studies from Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Israel, Mexico, Kenya, and the USA (1205). Completely preventing livestock grazing increased understory plant diversity in Brazil, the UK, and Costa Rica, and increased oak seedling density in Israel (1206). Shortening the grazing period had mixed results: it increased regenerating oak abundance in Spain, but had no effect on native plant richness in Australia. A UK study found summer grazing was better for tree seedling numbers than winter grazing (1208).",

Thinning trees was found to increase tree size in one study (1209). In contrast, one controlled study found removing bell-miners did not improve tree health (1151). Another study on soil enhancers found they had mixed effects on tree seedling survival and height, but no effect on health (1153).",

    "question": "How do mechanical removal and herbicide application compare in their effectiveness for controlling understory vegetation after tree planting?",
    "answer": "Both methods have mixed or limited evidence of benefit. For mechanical removal, five studies found no effect on seedling emergence, survival, or growth, though one study found it increased seedling biomass (1256). For herbicide application, two of three studies found it increased the size of planted trees, while one found no effect on size and another found no effect on frost damage (1262).",

    "question": "What are the observed effects of adding soil amendments or ground coverings, such as organic matter, lime, or straw, after tree planting?",
    "answer": "The effects of these interventions are varied. Adding organic matter like leaf litter or wood-chips was found to increase seedling biomass but decrease emergence and survival (1258). Adding lime decreased the survival of pine seedlings in one study, while another found no effect on oak seedling growth (1259). A study covering the ground with straw found it increased the growth rate of planted trees and shrubs (1266). Using general soil enhancers, including fertilizer, showed mixed effects on seedling survival and height (1153, 1260).",

    "question": "What is the evidence on the long-term effectiveness of using tree guards to protect planted trees?",
    "answer": "There is limited evidence, and it suggests effectiveness may diminish over time. One study in Hong Kong found that tree guards increased tree height after 37 months, but this effect was no longer present at 44 months (1268). A separate study in the USA found that light-coloured plastic tree shelters did increase the survival rate of planted seedlings (1268).",
