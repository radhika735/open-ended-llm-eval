    "answer": "Several actions are rated as beneficial. These include creating uncultivated margins that regenerate naturally (63), planting grass buffer strips (246), planting nectar flower or wildflower strips (442), leaving cultivated but uncropped margins (562), and leaving crop headlands unsprayed (conservation headlands) (652). These actions have been shown to increase the abundance and diversity of plants, invertebrates, and birds.",

    "question": "What does the evidence say about the effectiveness of providing supplementary food versus cover for farmland birds during winter?",
    "answer": "Both providing supplementary food and creating cover are effective. Providing supplementary food is 'Likely to be beneficial', with studies showing it increased bird abundance and overwinter survival (648). Creating cover by planting wild bird seed mixes is 'Beneficial', as it provides both food and cover, leading to higher abundance and diversity of birds (594). Similarly, leaving overwinter stubbles is 'Likely to be beneficial', as these areas are used by seed-eating birds and their presence is positively linked to breeding population trends (695).",

    "question": "What actions can be taken on farmland to support invertebrate populations like bees and beetles?",
    "answer": "Several actions can benefit invertebrates. Beetle banks can increase the density and diversity of ground beetles, though effects may be seasonal (651). Planting nectar flower mixture strips has been shown to increase the abundance and diversity of invertebrates (442). Sowing grass buffer strips or creating uncultivated margins also increases arthropod abundance and richness (246, 63). Using organic rather than mineral fertilizers can increase the abundance and species richness of some invertebrates (134). For bees specifically, providing nest boxes for solitary bees is effective and they are readily used, though uptake of bumblebee boxes is very low (80).",

    "question": "To benefit native farmland wildlife, what are the most effective methods for controlling invasive or problematic species?",
    "answer": "Evidence for effectiveness varies by species. Trapping appears to be an effective method for reducing American mink populations (107). For invasive plants, studies found that removing all flower heads of giant hogweed plants can dramatically reduce seed production (104). For native predators, controlling mammals and birds like foxes and crows has been shown in some studies to increase the reproductive success and abundance of some bird species (699). The herbicide asulam can reduce bracken abundance if applied repeatedly (105). In contrast, no evidence was found for the effects of controlling grey squirrels on farmland wildlife (106).",

    "question": "What are the benefits and drawbacks of managing water levels and features like ditches and ponds on farmland to enhance biodiversity?",
    "answer": "Managing water features on farmland generally shows benefits, but there are some drawbacks. Raising water levels in ditches or grassland has been associated with increased numbers of birds, wetland plants, and invertebrates (121). Similarly, specific management of ditches can increase plant species richness and benefit amphibians and birds (135). Creating scrapes and pools also provides good habitat for a range of species (153). However, the evidence is not universally positive; two replicated studies found that raising water levels resulted in a net loss of plant species or did not affect lapwing foraging rates (121), and some studies found ditch management had negative or no clear effects on certain bird species or plants (135).",

Sowing wild bird cover has also been shown to increase small mammal activity, particularly in winter (594). Creating beetle banks can provide nesting sites for harvest mice (651). Finally, creating habitat corridors between existing semi-natural patches can facilitate colonization by small mammal species (579).",
