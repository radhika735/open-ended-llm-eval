    "question": "What actions can be taken on farmland to specifically support declining bird populations?",
    "answer": "Several actions show benefits for farmland birds. Creating skylark plots (small undrilled patches in cereal fields) has been found to increase skylark population size, breeding density, and success (540). Sowing wild bird seed or cover mixtures provides food and cover, with studies showing higher abundance, density, and species richness of birds (594). Leaving overwinter stubbles provides winter food, which is associated with higher densities of farmland birds and can increase population sizes of some species (695). Additionally, using mowing techniques such as mowing from the centre of the field outwards can significantly reduce mortality of birds like corncrakes and their chicks during harvesting (698).",

    "question": "To enhance biodiversity within agricultural grassland habitats, which actions are most beneficial?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests several actions are highly beneficial for grassland biodiversity. Restoring or creating species-rich, semi-natural grassland is rated as 'Beneficial', with numerous studies showing it results in higher plant species richness, and greater abundance and diversity of invertebrates and farmland birds compared to other grassland types (133). Another 'Likely to be beneficial' action is reducing the management intensity on permanent grasslands, which involves a combination of reducing chemical inputs and delaying mowing, with studies finding benefits for plants, invertebrates, and birds (69). Delaying the mowing or first grazing date is also 'Likely to be beneficial', leading to higher plant species richness, more insects, and increased breeding success for birds like the Eurasian skylark (131).",

    "question": "Besides direct predator control, what other conservation actions can protect the nests of ground-nesting birds?",
    "answer": "Several alternatives to direct predator control exist for protecting ground-nesting birds. One option is to protect individual nests with exclosures or cages (108). Studies from Sweden found this offered some benefits, such as higher daily survival rates for common redshank and northern lapwing nests, but also noted a risk of higher predation on adult redshanks on protected nests. Another approach is 'mosaic management', a Dutch agri-environment scheme which includes nest protection alongside other measures like delayed mowing, and was found to increase northern lapwing population trends (130). Erecting predator-proof fencing around important breeding sites is another potential intervention, but there is currently no evidence to assess its effectiveness (109).",

Specifically, delaying mowing or grazing dates can result in higher plant species richness, more insect species, and increased breeding wading bird densities (131). Reducing grazing intensity has been found to increase plant abundance and diversity, as well as invertebrate diversity (704). However, there are also mixed or negative effects. Reducing management intensity has, in some cases, led to the loss of certain plant species or an increase in invertebrates in more intensively managed grasslands (69). Several studies found that delaying mowing or grazing had no clear effect on plant species richness or the abundance of some insects and spiders (131). Similarly, reducing grazing intensity has shown mixed results, benefiting some species but not others, or having no clear benefit at all in some studies (704).",

For controlling invasive species, studies suggest that trapping appears to be an effective method for reducing American mink populations, though firm conclusions are limited by experimental design (107). In contrast, no evidence was captured for the effects of controlling grey squirrels on farmland wildlife (106). Creating new habitat features generally shows positive results. Planting grass buffer strips (246) and wildflower strips (442) has been found to benefit small mammals by increasing activity and numbers. Beetle banks can also provide nesting sites for harvest mice (651). Creating habitat corridors has also been shown to be colonized by small mammal species, with higher numbers found in bio-corridors than adjacent forest or arable fields (579).",

Raising water levels in ditches or grasslands was also found in Dutch studies to be associated with increased bird numbers (121). A scheme offering direct payments per clutch to farmers showed limited evidence for increasing overall wading bird populations, but did result in higher hatching success for northern lapwing and black-tailed godwit (146). Maintaining traditional water meadows under 'meadow bird agreements' was found to increase population sizes of northern lapwing, common redshank, and black-tailed godwit, although differences may have existed before management began (696).",

Leaving cultivated, uncropped margins or plots provides benefits to rare arable plants, invertebrates such as bumblebees and spiders, and birds like the northern lapwing and Eurasian skylark (562). Creating smaller 'skylark plots' also has positive effects on skylark populations and has shown benefits to plants and some invertebrates (540).

    "question": "What are the observed outcomes of providing artificial nest boxes for different wildlife groups on farmland?",
    "answer": "Studies show mixed but generally positive outcomes. For owls, providing nest boxes in farm buildings has maintained nesting activity and increased population density (154). For other birds like kestrels and tree sparrows, nest box provision led to an increase in clutches or breeding numbers (155). For solitary bees, nest boxes are readily used and can increase local population sizes (80), but uptake by bumblebees is very low (80). However, success can be variable; one study found barn owl populations were unaffected by the number of boxes (154), and another found juvenile owls fledged from boxes were less likely to be recovered alive than those from natural sites (154).",

    "question": "What management actions have been shown to benefit wading bird populations on Dutch farmland?",
    "answer": "Several actions show evidence of benefiting waders in the Netherlands. 'Mosaic management', which coordinates delayed and staggered mowing with other measures, led to population trend changes from decreases to increases for northern lapwing and higher productivity for black-tailed godwit (130). Raising water levels in ditches or grasslands has been associated with increased bird numbers (121). Agri-environment schemes that maintain traditional water meadows can also support species like northern lapwing and black-tailed godwit (696). Schemes involving direct payments per clutch have shown limited evidence of increasing wading bird populations, but did result in higher hatching success for northern lapwing and black-tailed godwit (146).",

    "question": "What are the most effective field margin management options for increasing invertebrate abundance and diversity in European arable systems?",
    "answer": "Sowing flower-rich mixtures appears to be highly effective. Numerous studies found that planting nectar flower or wildflower strips had a positive influence on invertebrates, increasing abundance and species richness (442). Planting grass buffer strips, some floristically-enhanced, also increased arthropod abundance and diversity in multiple studies (246). Creating naturally regenerated uncultivated margins can also support more invertebrates than conventionally managed margins (63). Finally, unsprayed conservation headlands consistently contained higher species richness of invertebrates than conventionally sprayed areas (652). A combination of these approaches would likely provide the greatest benefit.",

    "question": "What are the documented benefits and potential drawbacks of altering mowing regimes on grasslands to help wildlife?",
    "answer": "Altering mowing regimes is generally beneficial but can have mixed outcomes. Delaying mowing often benefits plants, invertebrates, and birds like the Eurasian skylark, and was associated with the recovery of the UK corncrake population (131). Similarly, leaving uncut strips of rye grass benefits seed-eating birds and can increase ground beetle diversity over time (132). Using mowing techniques like centre-out mowing or specific machinery (e.g., bar mowers) can significantly reduce mortality for birds, mammals, and invertebrates (698). Raising the mowing height can increase skylark productivity (138). However, some drawbacks and neutral effects have been recorded. Delaying mowing has shown no clear effect on some plant and invertebrate groups in certain studies (131), raising mowing height had no effect on foraging birds in one trial (138), and providing uncut refuges did not appear to be used by skylarks in UK studies (147).",
