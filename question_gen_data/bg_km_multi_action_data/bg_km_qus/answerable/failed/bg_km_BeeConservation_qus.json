    "question": "How does the success of providing artificial nest sites for solitary bees compare to providing them for bumblebees?",
    "answer": "The evidence suggests artificial nests are more readily accepted by solitary bees than bumblebees. Twenty-nine of thirty trials showed successful occupation of nest boxes by solitary bees, with some studies showing local populations can double over three years with their provision (47). In contrast, bumblebee nest boxes show highly variable success. While some older studies showed occupancy rates of 10-48%, three recent UK trials of common surface nest box designs found very low uptake rates of 0-2.5% (48).",

Two trials in Europe found that reducing the intensity of farmland meadow management, such as delaying mowing and limiting agrochemical use, enhanced the numbers and diversity of wild bees (22). The evidence on reducing tillage is mixed, with one study finding three times more squash bees on no-till farms, while another found no difference (11).",

For ground-nesting species, multiple trials have shown that creating artificially exposed areas of bare soil can be successfully colonized by solitary bees and wasps (13). Additionally, providing artificial nest sites, such as blocks of wood drilled with holes or bundles of hollow stems, is a well-documented method to support many species of solitary bee (47).",

For pests, using sticky barriers was shown to reduce the number of introduced European earwigs in solitary bee nest boxes, increasing their use by native bees (44). Excluding ants from solitary bee nests has also been shown to increase the production of offspring (46).

One option is to plant dedicated floral resources elsewhere on the farm; fourteen trials have shown that sown flowering plants, particularly phacelia, attract substantial numbers of wild bees (17). Another alternative is to sow uncropped margins with a native wild flower seed mix, which five trials showed supported a higher abundance of foraging bumblebees than cropped or grassy margins (19). Increasing the use of clover leys is another possibility, though no evidence was found that this enhances wild bee populations, and one trial showed it did not attract solitary bees for nesting (16). Finally, simply allowing field margins to regenerate naturally can provide more foraging bumblebees than cropped margins, though the value of these margins can be inconsistent and reliant on weed species like thistles (20).",
