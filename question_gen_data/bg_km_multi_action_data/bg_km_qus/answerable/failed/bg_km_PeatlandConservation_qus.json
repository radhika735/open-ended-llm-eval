    "question": "What are the most effective interventions for restoring peatland vegetation in agricultural landscapes?",
    "answer": "Based on the evidence, excluding livestock from degraded peatlands is likely to be beneficial (1734). While seven of nine studies found no effect on key herb groups, three studies found shrub cover increased after excluding livestock. Rewetting drained peatlands is considered beneficial, with numerous studies showing increases in peatland-characteristic plants, mosses, and herbs (1756). Restoring vegetation with multiple interventions at once is also likely to be beneficial (1803). The effectiveness of other actions in agricultural settings, such as reducing grazing intensity or creating habitat corridors, is unknown (1735, 1730).",

    "answer": "Alternatives to physical removal include cutting/mowing, using prescribed fire, herbicides, and introducing biological control organisms. Evidence for their effectiveness is limited. Cutting/mowing problematic herbaceous plants had no significant effect on plant community composition in two of three studies (1770). Using prescribed fire shows a trade-off, as it can reduce shrub cover but also limit overall plant species richness (1774). Using herbicide was found in one study to change community composition but could not prevent long-term increases in shrub cover (1776). Introducing a parasitic plant was found in one study to reduce a dominant sedge and increase species richness (1777).",

    "question": "What actions can prepare the physical surface of a degraded peatland for planting, and what are their known effects?",
    "answer": "Several actions can be taken to prepare a peatland surface for planting. Reprofiling or relandscaping into basins and ridges is likely to be beneficial, with studies in bogs showing higher survival and cover of sown Sphagnum in basins compared to raised plots (1833). Creating smaller mounds or hollows has an unknown effectiveness; it did not affect planted Sphagnum cover in bogs but did increase the growth of trees planted in mounds in a peat swamp (1834). Adding fresh peat before planting also has unknown effectiveness, but one study found it increased the cover of two sown species (1837). No evidence was found for the effects of removing the upper layer of peat (1835) or burying it (1836) before planting.",

    "question": "What are the benefits of using physical barriers to protect peatlands from different large animal threats?",
    "answer": "There is very limited evidence regarding the use of physical barriers to protect peatlands from large animals. Physically excluding vehicles, which can damage vegetation through trampling, was found to be effective in one study in a fen, allowing vegetation biomass and plant diversity to increase to levels seen in undisturbed areas (1750). In contrast, a study on excluding wild boar and deer from a fen meadow reported that the effects on vegetation cover, biomass, and species richness were dependent on other management treatments applied to the plots (1860). No studies were found that evaluated the effects of using barriers to keep livestock off previously ungrazed peatlands (1733).",

    "question": "As an alternative to prescribed burning for managing vegetation on fens, what are the effects of mowing or introducing grazing?",
    "answer": "Mowing and grazing are two alternatives to prescribed burning for managing fen vegetation. Using prescribed fire in fens was found to reduce tree/shrub cover and, in one study, increase plant species richness (1763). Cutting or mowing is likely to be beneficial, with studies showing it can increase plant species richness and the cover of fen-characteristic plants and mosses, while reducing the cover of dominant herbs like reeds (1759). The evidence for using grazing is more mixed, showing a trade-off between benefits and harms. Studies reported that grazing could increase cover of some herbs like cottongrasses but also reduce Sphagnum moss cover, with inconsistent effects on species richness (1762).",

    "question": "What are the effects of different interventions designed to manipulate water levels on drained peatlands without planting?",
    "answer": "Multiple interventions can manipulate water levels on drained peatlands. Rewetting by raising the water table is considered beneficial; thirty-six studies found it typically increased Sphagnum moss and herb cover (especially sedges and cottongrasses), reduced tree and shrub cover, and had mixed effects on overall plant diversity (1756). Filling or blocking ditches is likely to be beneficial for vegetation growth within the ditches themselves, with two of three studies showing ditches were colonized by herbs and bryophytes within 2-3 years (1805). Irrigating the peatland surface has unknown effectiveness; one study found it temporarily increased Sphagnum shoots, while another reported colonization by wetland herbs (1859).",
