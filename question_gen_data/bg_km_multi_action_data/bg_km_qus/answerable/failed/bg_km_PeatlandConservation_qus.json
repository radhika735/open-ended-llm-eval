    "question": "What are the most effective interventions for restoring peatland vegetation in agricultural landscapes?",
    "answer": "Based on the evidence, excluding livestock from degraded peatlands is likely to be beneficial (1734). While seven of nine studies found no effect on key herb groups, three studies found shrub cover increased after excluding livestock. Rewetting drained peatlands is considered beneficial, with numerous studies showing increases in peatland-characteristic plants, mosses, and herbs (1756). Restoring vegetation with multiple interventions at once is also likely to be beneficial (1803). The effectiveness of other actions in agricultural settings, such as reducing grazing intensity or creating habitat corridors, is unknown (1735, 1730).",

    "question": "Besides direct physical removal, what alternative methods can be used to control problematic plants on peatlands?",
    "answer": "Alternatives to physical removal include cutting/mowing, using prescribed fire, herbicides, and introducing biological control organisms. Evidence for their effectiveness is limited. Cutting/mowing problematic herbaceous plants had no significant effect on plant community composition in two of three studies (1770). Using prescribed fire shows a trade-off, as it can reduce shrub cover but also limit overall plant species richness (1774). Using herbicide was found in one study to change community composition but could not prevent long-term increases in shrub cover (1776). Introducing a parasitic plant was found in one study to reduce a dominant sedge and increase species richness (1777).",

    "question": "What are the observed effects of introducing peatland vegetation to bare surfaces, either by planting whole plants or spreading fragments?",
    "answer": "Directly planting mosses (1818), herbs (1819), and trees or shrubs (1820) is generally considered 'likely to be beneficial'. Studies report high survival and growth for planted mosses, trees, and shrubs. Planted herbs also survived, though sometimes at low rates. Spreading moss fragments (1821) or mixed vegetation fragments (1822) on the peat surface is rated as 'beneficial'. This approach has been shown to successfully establish cover of Sphagnum, other mosses, and vascular plants, with sown plots achieving higher cover than unsown ones.",

    "question": "What is the state of the evidence for interventions aimed at restoring peatland vegetation after mining or peat extraction?",
    "answer": "There is some evidence for a few key restoration techniques following mining. Replacing large blocks of vegetation has 'unknown effectiveness' (1738), though two studies found the transplanted blocks successfully retained their peatland plant community. The comprehensive 'moss layer transfer technique' is rated 'likely to be beneficial' (1804), with studies from Canadian bogs showing it restored characteristic plant communities and increased vegetation cover compared to unrestored areas. Using other combinations of multiple interventions is also 'likely to be beneficial' (1803), with various studies documenting increased cover of moss and herbs.",
