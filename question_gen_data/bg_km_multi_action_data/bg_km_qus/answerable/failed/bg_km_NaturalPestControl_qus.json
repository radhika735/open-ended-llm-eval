    "question": "What are the most effective actions for increasing natural enemy populations on farmland?",
    "answer": "Combining trap and repellent crops in a push-pull system is rated as 'Beneficial', with studies finding more natural predators (753). Growing non-crop plants that produce chemicals to attract natural enemies is 'Likely to be beneficial', with three out of four studies finding higher numbers of natural enemies (724). Using chemicals to attract natural enemies has also been shown to increase their numbers in multiple studies (754), as has converting to organic farming (717).",

    "answer": "Several actions tested in North America show potential negative economic impacts. One study on organic farming found that profit decreased unless the produce received a premium price (717). Similarly, a US study on alley cropping found that while costs were lower, profit was also lower in alley cropped plots (718). A study on incorporating plant remains found profit did not increase compared to weeded controls (728).",

Managing ant populations is another strategy. In cashew, isolating colonies of beneficial predatory ants led to lower pest damage (773). Conversely, for ants that protect pests, excluding them from trees has been found to reduce pest numbers in multiple studies (886).",

Alley cropping also increased some natural enemy groups like wasps and spiders, but reduced others like ladybirds (718). Creating beetle banks was found in one review to increase predators in adjacent crops, but other studies found this effect varied or that predators moved slowly into the crop (729).",

Using crop rotation which can include maize (tested in potato systems) also showed pest reduction in some studies (719). Creating beetle banks can also reduce pests in adjacent maize crops (729).

For beetle banks, predator movement from banks to crops can be small or slow, and some effects on predator numbers are seasonal (729). Allowing natural ground cover regeneration under perennial crops can increase ground-dwelling natural enemies, but effects were only short-term for most groups in one study (720). Similarly, threshold-based insecticide spraying regimes increased natural enemies in some years, but the effects could last for as little as three weeks (750). The weed-suppressing effect of incorporating certain plant remains into the soil did not last beyond a few days or weeks in two studies (728).",
