    "question": "What non-chemical methods are available to control sea lice on Atlantic salmon farms?",
    "answer": "Based on the evidence, non-chemical methods to control sea lice include using certain species of cleaner wrasse, though studies in Ireland show their effectiveness is mixed (738). The number of lice can also be reduced by feeding salmon a diet with plant-based protein and beta-glucans, which reduced lice infection by 28% and a further 28% respectively in a Norwegian study (732). Another study in Norway found that keeping salmon in low intensity artificial light or natural lighting resulted in lower numbers of lice (741).",

    "question": "For farmed salmon in Norway, which interventions have been shown to be effective for improving survival rates or reducing parasite loads?",
    "answer": "In Norway, several interventions have proven effective. A study found that feeding salmon a diet with fish meal and 28% plant-based protein reduced lice numbers by 28%, with a further 28% reduction when beta-glucans were added (732). Breeding for high resistance to infectious pancreatic necrosis increased survival levels when exposed to the disease (735). Salmon that had undergone aerobic training also had higher survival rates when exposed to the same disease (740). Finally, keeping salmon in low intensity artificial light led to lower numbers of lice (741).",

In Ireland, a study found that triploid (sterile) salmon had reduced stock return but similar weight, length, and condition compared to diploid salmon (939).",

    "question": "What are some alternative methods for managing or remediating waste and pollution from salmon farms in temperate regions like Canada and Tasmania?",
    "answer": "Several methods for managing farm waste have been trialed in temperate regions. Fallowing can help remediate the benthos; a trial in Tasmania found sediment community structure under cages became more similar to non-impacted sites over two fallowing cycles (1027). For freshwater farms, sludge drying beds were found in Canadian trials to effectively remove phosphorus from sludge (943). In Canada and Scotland, integrated systems using mussels and algae to absorb waste have also been studied (932).",

Integrated aquaculture systems, such as growing blue mussels or algae near salmon farms, can absorb waste or benefit from the nutrients (932). Artificial reefs can be colonized by species that may remove organic compounds (934), and sludge drying beds have been found to remove phosphorus from freshwater fish farm sludge (943).",

    "answer": "The effects vary depending on the alternative source. Using plant-based protein has been found to decrease growth rates and alter the intestine's morphology in some studies (924). Replacing fish meal with yeast or GM soybeans showed no difference in weight or growth rates (920, 928). Using plant-based oils resulted in similar growth rates but altered the fatty acid profile of the flesh and could lower contaminant concentrations (926). Bacterial protein had mixed effects on growth rates (918).",
