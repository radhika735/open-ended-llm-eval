    "question": "What actions can be taken to increase plant species richness when restoring grassland habitats?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests several actions can increase plant species richness. Sowing seeds of parasitic plants like yellow rattle has been found to increase plant species richness and/or diversity in five of six studies (3404). Site preparation is also key; one study found that removing topsoil before sowing seeds increased plant species richness (3415). Additionally, the simple act of sowing native grass and forb seeds was found to increase overall plant species richness in sixteen of twenty-eight studies (3432).",

Three replicated studies in the USA and Canada found that sowing grass seeds either reduced native grass cover or native forb abundance (3397).

In arid areas, specific techniques can be useful; hydroseeding (spraying a slurry of seed, mulch, and water) increased overall plant cover in one of two controlled studies in Spain (3412), and irrigating after sowing non-native seeds increased vegetation cover in a majority of cases in another Spanish study (3430). Inoculating soil with mycorrhizal fungi also initially increased vegetation cover in one US study, though the effect did not last (3429).",

In some studies, plant communities in areas sown with grass seeds (3397) or native grass and forbs (3432) became more similar to intact grasslands over time. However, initial gains in vegetation cover can diminish. For example, a higher grass cover in sown areas was no longer apparent after seven years in one study (3397), and an initial increase in cover from mycorrhizal inoculation disappeared after three years (3429). In contrast, another study found that vegetation cover increased over time after sowing seeds from a local source (3400).",

Sowing seeds of parasitic species like yellow rattle can restrict the growth of dominant grasses, potentially allowing other species to increase; five of six studies found this increased overall plant species richness (3404). Another approach is sowing seeds of nurse plants, which are thought to aid other species by creating benign conditions under their canopy (3401, 3402), although evidence for community-level benefits is mixed. In savanna habitats, sowing tree seeds can be used to increase tree abundance within the grassland matrix (3403).",
