Using acoustic devices showed mixed results; some studies found they reduced predation by seals and sea lions, while others found no effect on dolphins or seals (2775). Replacing anti-predator nets more frequently was found to reduce salmon losses to harbour seals in one study (2774).

Another strategy is to deploy fishing gear at different depths; one study found that nets deployed 4.5m below the surface had fewer dolphin entanglements than surface nets (2793). Other potential management actions for which no direct evidence on mammal populations was found include deploying gear when mammals are less active (2792), limiting the number of fishing vessels or fishing days in an area (2794), limiting the length of fishing gear (2795), and reducing the time gear is in the water (2796).",
