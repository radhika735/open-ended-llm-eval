    "question": "What actions can be taken to reduce predation by marine mammals at aquaculture systems?",
    "answer": "Evidence was found for three interventions. Replacing anti-predator nets more frequently was found in one study to result in fewer salmon losses to harbour seal predation (2774). The use of acoustic deterrent devices was found to reduce predation in four of six studies, but this action has a trade-off due to potential harms to both target and non-target species (2775). Translocating fur seals away from salmon farms was found to be likely ineffective as the majority of seals returned to the farms (2776).",

    "question": "Which modifications to fishing gear are most effective at reducing marine mammal entanglement?",
    "answer": "Based on the evidence, some gear modifications are more effective than others. Increasing the visual detectability of fishing gear (2805) and using acoustically reflective gear materials (2807) are both rated as 'Likely to be beneficial' for reducing mammal interactions or entanglements. In contrast, attaching acoustically reflective objects like bead chains to gear was found to be 'Unlikely to be beneficial' as it did not reduce dolphin entanglements in one study (2806). Using acoustic devices on gear has a 'Trade off between benefit and harms' as they can reduce entanglements but may also deter mammals from important habitats (2808).",

Multi-faceted conservation programmes that included reuniting pups with mothers (2927) and removing derelict fishing gear (2892) reported that over a quarter of the seals involved survived and reproduced.
