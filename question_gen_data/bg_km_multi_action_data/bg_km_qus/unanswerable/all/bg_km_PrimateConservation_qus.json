    "answer": "This question cannot be answered because the provided document evaluates the effectiveness of conservation actions (e.g., 'Likely to be beneficial', 'Unknown effectiveness') but does not contain any information on the financial costs or cost-effectiveness of these interventions. Therefore, it is impossible to compare actions like 'Use nets to keep primates out of fruit trees' (1442) and 'Humans chase primates using random loud noise' (1449) on the basis of cost.",
