While the document evaluates the effectiveness of various interventions to reduce mammal bycatch, such as using acoustic devices (2808), modifying fishing gear (2801, 2805, 2807, 2822, 2823), or establishing 'move-on rules' (2790), it does not contain any information regarding the financial costs associated with implementing these actions. Therefore, a comparison of their cost-effectiveness is not possible.",
