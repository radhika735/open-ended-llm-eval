    "answer": "The provided document mentions biochar in the context of action 892, 'Amend the soil with non-chemical minerals and mineral wastes'. However, the studies mentioned only cover Sandy clay and silt loam soil types. There is no information about the effects of biochar on clay-loam soils, making the question unanswerable.",
