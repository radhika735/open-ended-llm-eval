While several actions describe methods to reduce stereotypical behaviors in carnivores, including bears (e.g., hiding food, presenting food in ice), the studies cited are primarily 'before-and-after' studies. The provided text does not specify the duration of these studies or provide data on the long-term efficacy of these interventions, making it impossible to determine which has the most significant long-term impact.",
