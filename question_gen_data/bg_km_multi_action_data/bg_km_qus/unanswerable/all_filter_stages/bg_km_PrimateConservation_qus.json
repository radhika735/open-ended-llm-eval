    "question": "What is the most cost-effective method for reducing human-primate conflict in agricultural areas?",
    "answer": "This question cannot be answered from the provided text. While several actions to reduce conflict are assessed for their effectiveness, such as removing 'problem' animals (1422) or chasing primates with noise (1449), the database contains no information on the financial costs or overall cost-effectiveness of these interventions. Therefore, a comparison on this basis is not possible.",

    "answer": "This question cannot be answered using the provided information. The database contains details on numerous reintroduction and translocation actions for specific primate species in various countries (e.g., Brazil, Indonesia, Gabon). However, the information is not structured or aggregated in a way that allows for a comparative analysis of success rates between different continents like Africa, Asia, and South America.",

The text discusses methods like planting unpalatable buffer crops (1438) or changing to a less palatable crop (1439), but there are no actions or studies that evaluate the use of genetic modification technologies for this purpose.",
