The synopses evaluate the effectiveness of different feeding strategies based on behavioral and welfare outcomes (e.g., increased foraging time, reduced aggression), but they do not contain any data on the financial costs associated with implementing these actions. Therefore, a comparison of cost-effectiveness is not possible.",
