    "answer": "The provided information evaluates the effectiveness of several methods for controlling bracken, such as using herbicides (1652), cutting (1653), and using a 'bracken bruiser' (1726). However, the text does not contain any data on the financial costs of these interventions, making it impossible to determine which is the most cost-effective.",
