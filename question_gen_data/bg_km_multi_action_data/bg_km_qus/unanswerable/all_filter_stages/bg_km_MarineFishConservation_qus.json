For the action 'Limit dredge width or number of dredges per vessel' (3806), the text explicitly states, 'We found no studies that evaluated the effects of limiting dredge width or number of dredges per vessel on marine fish populations.' Therefore, no evidence is available in the text to determine its impact.",

    "answer": "This question cannot be answered because the provided text contains no evidence for one of the key actions. While there is some evidence regarding the action 'Set a minimum landing size for commercially fished species' (2735), the document states for the action 'Set a maximum landing size for commercially fished species' (2736), 'We found no studies that evaluated the effects of setting a maximum landing size for commercially fished species on marine fish populations.' Without evidence for both interventions, a comparison of their effects on reproductive success is not possible.",
