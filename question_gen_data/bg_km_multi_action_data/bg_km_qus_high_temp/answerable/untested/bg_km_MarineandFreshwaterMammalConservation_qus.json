    "question": "What is the evidence for the effectiveness of making fishing gear acoustically reflective versus attaching acoustically reflective objects to deter marine mammals?",
    "answer": "Using acoustically reflective fishing gear materials, such as those infused with iron-oxide or barium sulfate, is rated as 'likely to be beneficial' and has been found to reduce entanglements of harbour porpoises in two of three studies (2807). However, one study found it did not reduce dolphin entanglements (2807). In contrast, attaching acoustically reflective objects like metallic bead chains to nets did not reduce dolphin entanglements, and acrylic beads on hooks did not reduce predation by sperm whales, making this action 'unlikely to be beneficial' (2806).",

    "answer": "Evidence suggests that prohibiting the hunting of marine mammal species is beneficial, with multiple studies showing increased abundance of harbour seals and humpback whales after hunting bans were introduced (2780). Legally protecting habitats is also likely to be beneficial, with studies showing increased survival rates for Hector's dolphins and population increases for Mediterranean monk seals (2915). Setting and enforcing vessel speed limits is rated as likely to be beneficial for reducing collision deaths of manatees and North Atlantic right whales (2777). Ceasing activities that cause disturbance in sensitive areas is also likely to be beneficial, having increased harbour porpoise activity in one study (2917).",

    "answer": "Actions with evidence include using acoustic devices, which four studies found reduced predation by seals at salmon farms, though this has a trade-off with potential harms to other species (2775). Replacing anti-predator nets more frequently has 'unknown effectiveness' but one study found it resulted in fewer salmon losses to harbour seal predation (2774). Translocating seals away from farms is 'likely to be ineffective or harmful', as studies found that most returned (2776). Other potential actions, such as modifying aquaculture gear (2742), modifying the anti-predator nets themselves (2743), or minimizing food waste (2744), currently have no evidence of their effectiveness.",

    "answer": "There is a significant body of evidence for using acoustic devices on fishing gear, with 33 studies showing it can reduce entanglements and change mammal behaviour, but also deter them from important habitats (2808). Evidence also exists for their use at aquaculture systems (6 studies) (2775), on moorings (8 studies) (2816), on fishing vessels (5 studies) (2815), and to reduce noise exposure from construction (4 studies) (2896), with all these applications rated as a 'trade-off between benefit and harms'. In contrast, 'no evidence was found' for the effectiveness of using acoustic devices at renewable energy sites (2748), cooling water intakes (2751), or on moving vessels to prevent collisions (2761).",

Regularly replacing anti-predator nets was found in one study to reduce salmon losses to seals (2774). Translocating mammals away from farms is likely to be ineffective as studies show most return (2776). Other non-lethal actions like modifying the design of anti-predator nets (2743) or minimizing food waste (2744) have no evaluated evidence. No studies have evaluated the effect of legislation to prevent intentional killing (2745).",

    "answer": "Rescuing and releasing stranded or trapped mammals is 'beneficial'. Multiple studies report survival of released dolphins, whales, and seals, with some animals reproducing post-release (2924). Rehabilitating and releasing injured, sick, or weak mammals is 'likely to be beneficial', with many studies showing post-release survival for a range of species, and one study documenting reproduction in rehabilitated seals (2925). Removing derelict fishing gear from entangled seals and dolphins is 'beneficial' and has led to their long-term survival and, in the case of Hawaiian monk seals, reproduction (2892). Reuniting abandoned Hawaiian monk seal pups with their mothers also led to their survival and later reproduction as part of a wider suite of interventions (2927).",

Increasing the visual detectability of gear (e.g., with coloured ropes) is 'likely to be beneficial', as studies show whales detect and react to more visible ropes (2805).

Educational whale-watching tours were found to increase participants' willingness to change behaviour and support conservation (2935). The presence of an official-looking volunteer at a wildlife-viewing site successfully reduced tourist harassment of seals (2844). Training tour guides also resulted in fewer seals being disturbed during kayak excursions (2840).
