    "question": "What are the most effective ways to support butterfly species richness within urban areas?",
    "answer": "Protecting undeveloped land such as native forest and grassland within urban areas has been shown to support a higher species richness of butterflies compared to urban parks or non-native plantations [3836]. In contrast, establishing \"green infrastructure\" such as green roofs was found to support a lower species richness of butterflies than urban parks [3837].",

    "answer": "In Canada, one study found that road verges and land under power lines managed by mowing had a similar butterfly species richness and abundance to remnant prairies [3854, 3855]. However, unmown power lines and road verges had a higher abundance of pearl crescent and northern pearl crescent butterflies than mown ones, while abundance of other butterfly species was similar [3855]. In the USA, restoring roadside prairies to be species-rich increased butterfly abundance and species richness compared to verges dominated by non-native vegetation [3854]. For land under power lines in the USA, management by mowing was better for frosted elfin abundance than cutting, but abundances were similar for other species including the Karner blue [3855].",

    "question": "What alternatives to clearcutting are available to reduce the impact of timber harvesting on forest butterfly and moth communities?",
    "answer": "Several alternatives to clearcutting have been studied. Reduced impact or selective logging was found in Brazil to support similar butterfly species richness to primary forest, though abundance results were mixed [3867]. In the USA, harvesting forests using single tree selection, group selection, or thinning resulted in lower moth species richness than unharvested forest [3867, 3868]. However, one US study found that thinning and shelterwood harvesting resulted in higher macro-moth species richness than clearcutting [3868, 3871]. Another study found moth species richness recovered faster after shelterwood harvesting than after group selection or clearcutting [3871].",

    "question": "How long does it take for butterfly and moth communities to respond following habitat restoration or management?",
    "answer": "The timeframe for a response varies by action and habitat. After restoring arable land to permanent grassland, butterfly communities can become similar to existing high-quality grasslands within 10 years [3929]. Forest restoration can take longer; one study in Brazil found a 54-year-old restored forest had a butterfly community similar to remnant forest, while forests restored for 11\u201322 years did not [3936]. For ongoing management like rotational burning in prairies, the response can be quicker, with grassland butterfly abundance highest in the third year after a burn [3883]. Similarly, clearing land under power lines showed the highest butterfly species richness 2\u20134 years after the clearance [3855].",

    "question": "Besides prescribed fire, what other management actions can create open, disturbed habitats beneficial to butterflies and moths?",
    "answer": "Several non-fire methods can create open habitats. Mechanically clearing patches in forests has been shown to increase butterfly species richness and the abundance of certain species like the high brown fritillary, though richness and abundance may decline in the years following clearance [3938]. Coppicing woodland is another effective technique, with studies showing higher butterfly abundance and species richness compared to unmanaged woodland, often peaking a few years after the coppicing event [3939]. Similarly, thinning trees within coniferous woodlands, sometimes combined with mulching, increased the species richness and abundance of butterflies [3940]. In cork oak woodlands, mechanically clearing the understorey to create firebreaks also led to greater butterfly abundance and richness [3881].",

    "question": "What is the evidence for the long-term success of reintroduction projects for butterflies?",

Several studies report that translocated populations have persisted for many years (e.g., 2\u201349 years) and sometimes increased in abundance, both within [3909] and outside [3911] their former range. Similarly, some populations established from released captive-bred individuals have persisted for over 25 years [3914]. However, failures are also common. One review across the UK and Ireland found that while 25% of reintroductions survived for at least three years, 38% died out in that time, and only 8% were known to have survived for more than 10 years [3909, 3914]. Many successful projects were associated with habitat management before or after release and some required repeated releases to supplement the population [3909, 3914].",

    "question": "What are the documented effects on butterfly communities of ceasing management on agricultural grasslands?",
    "answer": "The effects are highly variable. Ceasing grazing has led to mixed outcomes; some studies report higher abundance of certain butterfly and moth species, while others report lower abundance, or a shift towards generalist species [3956]. Species richness in abandoned pastures can be higher than in commercially grazed land but lower than in lightly grazed areas, and may decline after more than 10 years of abandonment [3956]. Similarly, ceasing mowing can benefit some butterfly species while harming others, with some studies showing lower abundance of butterflies in long-abandoned meadows compared to mown ones, and a shift away from grassland specialists [3957]. In short-term set-aside, butterfly and moth richness and abundance has been found to be higher than in cereal crops in some studies, but similar to arable or pasture fields in others [3980].",

    "question": "Does the effectiveness of organic farming for conserving butterflies depend on the characteristics of the wider agricultural landscape?",
    "answer": "Yes, evidence from Sweden suggests the benefits of organic farming are context-dependent. Studies found that organic farms had greater species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths than conventional farms, but this effect was only observed in intensively managed landscapes, not in landscapes that were already structurally diverse [3907]. Furthermore, both organic and conventional farms located within a landscape with a high proportion of organic farming had higher butterfly and burnet moth species richness than farms in conventionally dominated landscapes [3907]. Other landscape features, such as smaller field sizes, are also associated with higher butterfly species richness and abundance [3974].",

    "answer": "The benefits are documented across multiple land uses. In agriculture, converting to organic farming or implementing unsprayed headlands increases butterfly and moth abundance and richness [3907, 3898]. Restricting specific herbicides on field margins has similar positive effects [3896]. General reductions in chemical inputs on farms, in vineyards, and in coffee plantations also lead to higher butterfly and moth populations [3897]. In urban settings, stopping pesticide and herbicide use in gardens can increase butterfly abundance [3900], and restricting herbicide use on restored roadside prairies increases butterfly abundance and richness [3899].",

    "question": "What factors are associated with the success or failure of agri-environment schemes for conserving butterfly populations?",
    "answer": "The success of agri-environment schemes (AES) is variable and depends on several factors. While many studies show that land under AES has higher butterfly and moth richness and abundance than conventional farmland [3915], the type of intervention is crucial. For example, floristically enhanced grass margins or sown wildflower strips consistently provide greater benefits for butterfly richness and abundance than standard grass margins or naturally regenerated margins [3982, 3932, 3981]. The location and context of the scheme also matter. Uncultivated margins were more effective when located close to existing grassland [3981], and landscapes with a higher proportion of land under AES supported higher butterfly abundance overall [3915]. However, some AES options, such as those involving simple grass margins or uncropped cultivated margins, have shown similar butterfly and moth richness to conventional farmland in some studies [3915, 3923].",
