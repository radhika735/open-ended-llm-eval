    "question": "What are some available actions to increase the diversity of understory plants in forests?",
    "answer": "Several actions have been shown to increase the diversity of understory plants. Thinning trees can increase species richness and diversity (1211). Similarly, shelterwood harvesting (1223), group-selection harvesting (1224), and logging/tree removal (1273) have also shown positive effects on understory plant diversity. Excluding livestock from forests using wire fences (1205) or by preventing grazing altogether (1206) can increase species richness. Both clearcutting (1222) and thinning after a wildfire (1234) have also been found to increase plant species richness.",

    "answer": "Evidence suggests that several actions are beneficial for establishing planted trees. Preparing the ground before planting was found in six of seven studies to increase the survival and growth rate of planted trees (1263). Mechanically thinning other trees before or after planting also increased survival and size in five of six studies (1261). Additionally, fencing to prevent grazing after planting is rated as 'Likely to be beneficial', with four of five studies finding it increased the survival, size, and cover of planted trees (1254).",

    "question": "What are the overall effects of thinning on the various components of a forest ecosystem?",
    "answer": "Thinning trees has varied effects across the forest ecosystem. For mature trees, it generally decreases density and cover but increases their size, though it may decrease species richness (1209). For young trees, studies show it can increase their density and growth rate (1210). Thinning is 'Likely to be beneficial' for understory plants, with many studies finding it increased their density, cover, species richness, and diversity (1211). Conversely, it is 'Likely to be ineffective or harmful' for non-vascular plants, with studies showing decreases in epiphytic plant abundance and richness (1212).",

    "answer": "Using prescribed fire involves significant trade-offs. It is rated 'Likely to be ineffective or harmful' for mature trees, as studies found it can decrease tree cover and density and increase mortality (1217). For young trees, the effects are mixed, with some studies finding it increased density while others found it decreased density or had no effect (1220). In contrast, for understory plants, prescribed fire often has positive outcomes, with multiple studies reporting increases in cover, density, species richness, and diversity (1221).",

    "answer": "Both adding fertilizer and organic matter have trade-offs. Applying chemical fertilizers was found in several studies to increase total plant cover and biomass, but other studies found no effect on plant biomass or seedling diversity (1248). Adding organic matter such as leaf litter was found in one study to increase the species richness of young trees but in another to decrease their density (1250). Another study found adding plant material increased total plant cover, while one found mixed effects (1250).",

Studies found it resulted in higher plant diversity and tree species density compared with clearcutting (1214). Partial retention harvesting is another alternative, though its effectiveness is unknown. Studies in Canada found that it decreased the density of young trees compared to clearcutting (1215). Continuous cover forestry is another alternative approach, but no evidence was found to assess its effects (1179).",

    "question": "In forests with livestock, what management factors influence the success of tree regeneration?",
    "answer": "Several management approaches affect tree regeneration. Completely preventing grazing was found to increase oak seedling and sapling density in one study (1206), while using wire fences for exclusion increased the size and density of regenerating trees in three of four studies (1205). Reducing grazing intensity, rather than complete removal, was found to increase the number of tree saplings in one study (1207). The timing of grazing is also a factor; shortening the grazing period increased the abundance and size of regenerating oaks in one study, and another found more seedlings after summer grazing compared to winter grazing (1208).",

However, during a wet summer, it only increased the survival of some species, depending on the habitat. The study also noted that watering's effect on seedling emergence depended on both habitat and water availability (1154).",
