    "question": "What actions are available to encourage natural foraging behaviours in captive primates?",
    "answer": "Several actions have been shown to be beneficial for encouraging foraging. These include scattering food throughout the enclosure (1315), hiding food in containers like boxes (1316), providing cut branches or 'browse' (1332), presenting food items whole instead of processed (1323), providing live invertebrates (1333), and maximizing both horizontal and vertical food presentation locations (1328). Using puzzle feeders can also increase foraging but may lead to a trade-off with increased aggression (1318).",

    "question": "For large felids in a zoo, what are the most effective actions to reduce stereotypic pacing?",
    "answer": "Several interventions have been found to reduce stereotypic behaviours like pacing in large felids. Providing bones is considered likely to be beneficial, with studies showing it decreased stereotypic behaviours in lions and tigers (1902). An unpredictable feeding schedule was also found to reduce pacing in tigers (1904). However, some actions have mixed results; feeding whole carcasses reduced pacing in lions and leopards but increased it in tigers (1901). Allocating fast days was found to increase pacing on non-feeding days (1906).",

    "answer": "Altering feeding schedules has shown varied effects. For primates, increasing the number of daily feeds increased feeding time in chimpanzees but also increased hair eating in baboons (1337). Using an unpredictable feeding time for chimpanzees decreased inactivity (1338). For carnivores, an unpredictable feeding schedule reduced stereotypic pacing in tigers and cheetahs but increased territorial behaviour in coyotes (1904). In contrast, fasting large felids led to more pacing on non-feeding days (1906).",

Scattering food is rated as 'Beneficial' and was found to increase feeding and exploratory behaviours in rhesus macaques, reduce abnormal behaviours in chimpanzees, decrease aggression in lemurs, and increase foraging in gorillas (1315). Hiding food in containers is rated 'Likely to be beneficial' and studies found it increased activity levels and foraging behaviours in lemurs and gibbons (1316). Both methods effectively increase activity and foraging.",

Providing bones, hides, or partial carcasses is 'Likely to be beneficial', as studies found this decreased stereotypic behaviours in lions and tigers and increased activity (1902). Presenting food frozen in ice can also increase activity and decrease abnormal behaviours (1923). Using devices to simulate live prey, such as a carcass on a bungee, was found to reduce pacing in cougars and increase activity levels in other felids (1927).",

In a study on lemurs, feeding a fruit-free diet resulted in lower aggression and self-directed behaviour (1329). For rhesus macaques, offering fresh produce instead of pellet feed led to more time spent feeding and less time inactive (1335). Scattering food also had different reported primary outcomes: it reduced aggression in lemurs, while increasing exploratory behaviours in macaques (1315).",
