    "question": "What methods can be used to reduce seabird bycatch from longline fishing operations?",
    "answer": "Several methods have been trialled to reduce seabird bycatch from longlines. These include setting lines at night (283), although this can increase bycatch of some night-hunting species. Using streamer lines has strong evidence for reducing bycatch (285). Other techniques with some evidence of effectiveness include weighting lines to make them sink faster (296), using bait throwers (291), dyeing bait blue (293), thawing bait before use (298), and strategically releasing offal away from the lines during setting (299). Conversely, using a line shooter was found to be ineffective or harmful (290).",

    "question": "What are the most beneficial habitat management actions for increasing songbird populations on European farmland?",
    "answer": "Based on the evidence, several actions are rated as beneficial for birds on farmland, which would include songbirds. Providing or retaining set-aside areas is beneficial, with multiple studies finding higher bird densities (175). Planting wild bird seed or cover mixtures is also rated as beneficial, with 32 out of 33 studies finding higher bird densities or abundances (187). Planting nectar flower or wildflower strips (189), creating uncultivated margins (190), and planting grass buffer strips (191) are all considered likely to be beneficial for increasing bird numbers.",

    "question": "What are the effects of using prescribed burning on bird communities in different forest and grassland habitats?",
    "answer": "The effects of prescribed burning vary significantly across habitats, often involving trade-offs. In US pine forests, burning benefits open habitat species but can negatively affect closed-forest and ground-nesting species (318). In US deciduous forests, one study found no change in community composition, while another found a reduction in hummingbird nests (317). For grasslands, some species increase in density while others decrease, and the effects can depend on the time since the fire (322). In Australian sclerophyll forests, burning resulted in changes in species assemblages, with some species lost and others gained (319).",

For seabirds, 18 studies described positive responses to the control or removal of predators like rats and cats, including large population increases, recolonisations, and increased reproductive success (375). For rails, two studies found increases in survival or population density on islands following the removal of feral pigs (377), which is particularly important for this vulnerable group.",

    "answer": "Electric fencing is rated as likely to be beneficial; studies found it increased tern numbers, nesting success for waders and seabirds, and reduced predation by mammals (188). Non-electric fencing is also likely to be beneficial, with studies showing fewer predated nests, though some found no difference in nesting success (183). Individual exclosures or barriers are also likely to be beneficial, with studies showing higher productivity and hatching rates for waders and songbirds (398, 400). However, individual exclosures can sometimes increase nest abandonment or predation on adult birds (401, 403). A systematic review found that excluding predators generally increased hatching success (396).",

For collisions, burying or isolating power lines showed a dramatic increase in eagle survival (262), and removing earth wires also significantly reduced mortalities (263). For electrocution, insulating power pylons significantly reduced hawk deaths (268), and using perch-deterrents on pylons lowered raptor activity near the lines (269).

Using 'anti-predator training' before release increased survival for pheasants and bustards (637). Using holding pens at release sites to acclimatise birds improved survival for bustards (632), but wing-clipping birds to keep them in pens longer had mixed results, with lower survival for bustards and geese but higher success for one goose programme (633). For cranes, releases into existing flocks tend to be more successful, and survival is higher for non-migratory populations (621).",

    "answer": "For songbirds, the evidence is mixed but generally positive. Twelve studies from across the world found that feeding increased breeding productivity (537). However, a US study noted these increases were only found in dry years. For gulls in Europe, the evidence is also positive but context-dependent. A study in the UK found that supplementary food increased fledging success, but only on an island with abnormally low breeding success to begin with; a second island was not affected (525). Therefore, the effectiveness for both groups appears to depend on baseline environmental conditions.",

    "answer": "The timeframe for benefits differs between these habitats. For forest restoration, benefits may not be evident for decades or longer due to the slow growth of trees (360). Some studies found that bird communities in restored forests were similar to original forests, but others found some species did not return. For grassland restoration, effects can be seen more quickly. One study found that older restored fields (under the Conservation Reserve Program) held more nests but fewer species than younger fields (361), suggesting that community composition continues to change over time.",
