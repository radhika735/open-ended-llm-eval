    "question": "In UK cereal fields, what is the comparative evidence for the effectiveness of skylark plots versus lapwing plots for improving bird breeding success?",
    "answer": "Skylark plots, which are small, undrilled patches within cereal fields, have been shown in UK and Swiss studies to increase skylark population size, breeding density, and success [540]. Lapwing plots, which are larger cultivated but uncropped areas, have been found in the UK to increase northern lapwing hatching success and Eurasian skylark nesting success [562].",

    "question": "What management actions can be taken on farmland to provide habitat for beneficial invertebrates like spiders and beetles?",
    "answer": "Several actions can provide habitat for beneficial invertebrates. Creating beetle banks provides overwintering habitat for predatory insects [651]. Planting nectar flower or wildflower strips can increase the abundance and diversity of various invertebrates, including ground beetles [442]. Allowing field margins to regenerate naturally without cultivation can also support more invertebrates than conventionally managed margins [63]. Finally, planting nettle strips may enhance the number of aphid predator species [118].",

    "question": "When restoring grassland habitats on European farmland, how long does it typically take to see positive changes in plant communities?",
    "answer": "The timeframe for restoration varies depending on the habitat type. For species-rich grasslands, some studies show positive signs of restoration in less than five years, while others report it taking more than ten years, and some restored grasslands still differed from existing species-rich ones after 60 years [133]. For traditional water meadows, some positive effects on plant communities were found within five years of restoration efforts, but other studies noted that restoration was not complete after five, nine, or even 20 years [119].",

    "question": "What are the most beneficial actions for providing winter food for seed-eating birds on farmland?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests several beneficial actions. Planting wild bird seed or cover mixtures is effective, with UK studies showing higher abundance and diversity of birds in these areas [594]. Leaving overwinter stubbles is another key action that provides an important food source and attracts farmland birds [695]. Additionally, leaving uncut strips of rye grass on silage fields can provide valuable overwinter food in the UK [132], as can the direct provision of supplementary food through feeding stations, which has been shown to increase overwinter survival [648].",

Controlling generalist predators like foxes and crows has been found to increase the reproductive success and abundance of some birds in the UK and France [699]. A systematic review found that trapping appears to be an effective method of reducing American mink populations, which may benefit prey species like water voles [107]. However, for other species like the grey squirrel, no evidence has been captured for the effects of their control on farmland wildlife [106].",

    "question": "As an alternative to burning on upland moorland, what other management techniques can be used to control vegetation and maintain habitat structure?",
    "answer": "Alternatives to burning include mechanical methods and grazing. Swiping or flailing heather can simulate the effects of burning; one study found this increased plant species compared to unflailed plots [151]. In the UK, repeated cutting and grazing by goats have also been found to be effective in controlling dominant grass species to help maintain upland heath [647]. General scrub control, which can be part of moorland management, can also be achieved through cutting or grazing [127].",

    "answer": "Some conservation actions have unintended negative consequences. For instance, while protecting individual nests of ground-nesting birds with exclosures can increase egg survival, one study from Sweden reported higher predation of adult redshank on protected nests [108]. Reducing grazing intensity can benefit some species, but a review found that it could negatively affect others, and one study found fewer wading birds on grasslands with reduced management intensity [704]. Similarly, a UK study showed that reverting arable land to permanent grassland caused grey partridge numbers to fall significantly [561].",

    "question": "What are the overall effects of reducing tillage intensity compared to conventional ploughing on European farmland wildlife?",
    "answer": "Reducing tillage has shown a wide range of effects across Europe. A large body of evidence indicates positive impacts, including increased biomass and species richness of earthworms, greater abundance of some other invertebrates, increased numbers of some weed species, and benefits for birds like the Eurasian skylark through higher nest density and better foraging conditions [126]. Conversely, a significant number of studies found that reducing tillage had negative, no, or inconsistent effects on various invertebrate groups, earthworms, weeds, mammals, and some bird species. The crop type can also affect the outcome for weeds under different tillage regimes [126].",

    "question": "When creating or managing wetlands on farmland, what physical and management factors influence their success for biodiversity?",
    "answer": "Success depends on multiple factors. For newly created scrapes and pools, a combination of large surface area, high shoreline complexity, and shallow depth has been found to increase bird, invertebrate, and aquatic plant diversity [153]. For ditches, management under agri-environment schemes can increase plant and amphibian diversity, and having unsprayed banks supports higher plant diversity [135]. Raising water levels is a key intervention that can increase bird and invertebrate numbers, with one study finding this method established wet grassland species more rapidly than vegetation management alone [121].",

Broadly, European schemes have been associated with population increases for some birds, but other studies found negative or no effects [700]. For plants and invertebrates, results are also mixed, with some studies showing benefits while others report little or no effect [700]. The design of the scheme matters: the Swiss Ecological Compensation Areas scheme showed mixed results for birds at a landscape scale [145], while a specific Dutch 'mosaic management' scheme benefited northern lapwing but not other waders and was detrimental to Eurasian oystercatchers [130].",
