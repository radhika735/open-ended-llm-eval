    "answer": "Several actions have been shown to be beneficial for encouraging foraging. These include scattering food throughout the enclosure (1315), hiding food in containers like boxes (1316), providing cut branches or 'browse' (1332), presenting food items whole instead of processed (1323), providing live invertebrates (1333), and maximizing both horizontal and vertical food presentation locations (1328). Using puzzle feeders can also increase foraging but may lead to a trade-off with increased aggression (1318).",
