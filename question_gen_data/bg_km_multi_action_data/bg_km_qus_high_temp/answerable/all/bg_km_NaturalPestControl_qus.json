    "question": "How does the effectiveness of managing ant populations for pest control vary between beneficial and pest-protecting species in orchards?",
    "answer": "The effectiveness of ant management is highly context-dependent on the ant's role. For beneficial, predatory ants, physically isolating their colonies to prevent them from fighting each other was found in one study to result in ants occupying more cashew trees, which led to lower pest damage and higher yields [773]. Conversely, where ants protect pests like aphids, excluding them is beneficial. Using physical or chemical barriers on tree trunks reduced ant numbers in tree canopies, which in turn led to fewer pests in three of seven studies and greater parasitism rates in another study [886].",

    "answer": "Several pasture management strategies have been assessed, with mixed to negative results for pest control. Using grazing instead of cutting is considered 'Likely to be ineffective or harmful', with studies showing mixed effects on natural enemies and, in some cases, more pests [885]. Planting mixed-species pastures is also rated 'Likely to be ineffective or harmful'; while it can reduce weeds, the effect on insect pests was inconsistent, with one study finding more pests [721]. Delaying the date of mowing or grazing has 'Unknown effectiveness' and produced varied results, with one study finding more pest insects in late-cut plots [727].",

Growing non-crop plants that produce chemicals to attract natural enemies also decreased pests and increased yield in one study (724).

Some studies found more natural enemies on the ground, but others found varied effects or no difference (720). In contrast, actively planting species to compete with weeds was found in all nine studies to reduce weed plant weight or ground cover, and in five studies to reduce weed reproduction or survival (722). This suggests actively planting competitive species is a more reliable weed control strategy.",

Altering spray timing can also help, with some studies finding fewer pests when insecticides were applied early (723). Non-chemical approaches include 'push-pull' systems using repellent and trap crops, which have been shown to reduce pests and increase yields (753).

Evidence for altering the timing of insecticide use is also mixed; while some studies found fewer pests when spraying early, others found no effect or varied results, with similar ambiguity for yield (723).

Leaving parts of a crop or pasture unharvested can provide a refuge, increasing predator abundance in the unharvested strips and potentially in the wider field, but can also increase pest numbers (725). Allowing natural ground cover to regenerate under perennial crops has shown mixed results, with some studies finding more natural enemies on the ground but others showing no effect or variable outcomes (720). Similarly, planting new hedges has unknown effectiveness, with studies showing variable effects on natural enemy abundance depending on hedge and crop type (752).
