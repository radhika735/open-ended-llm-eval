    "question": "In UK cereal fields, what is the comparative evidence for the effectiveness of skylark plots versus lapwing plots for improving bird breeding success?",
    "answer": "Skylark plots, which are small, undrilled patches within cereal fields, have been shown in UK and Swiss studies to increase skylark population size, breeding density, and success [540]. Lapwing plots, which are larger cultivated but uncropped areas, have been found in the UK to increase northern lapwing hatching success and Eurasian skylark nesting success [562].",

    "question": "What management actions can be taken on farmland to provide habitat for beneficial invertebrates like spiders and beetles?",
    "answer": "Several actions can provide habitat for beneficial invertebrates. Creating beetle banks provides overwintering habitat for predatory insects [651]. Planting nectar flower or wildflower strips can increase the abundance and diversity of various invertebrates, including ground beetles [442]. Allowing field margins to regenerate naturally without cultivation can also support more invertebrates than conventionally managed margins [63]. Finally, planting nettle strips may enhance the number of aphid predator species [118].",

    "answer": "The timeframe for restoration varies depending on the habitat type. For species-rich grasslands, some studies show positive signs of restoration in less than five years, while others report it taking more than ten years, and some restored grasslands still differed from existing species-rich ones after 60 years [133]. For traditional water meadows, some positive effects on plant communities were found within five years of restoration efforts, but other studies noted that restoration was not complete after five, nine, or even 20 years [119].",

Planting wild bird seed or cover mixtures is effective, with UK studies showing higher abundance and diversity of birds in these areas [594]. Leaving overwinter stubbles is another key action that provides an important food source and attracts farmland birds [695].

Reducing grazing intensity can benefit some species, but a review found that it could negatively affect others, and one study found fewer wading birds on grasslands with reduced management intensity [704]. Similarly, a UK study showed that reverting arable land to permanent grassland caused grey partridge numbers to fall significantly [561].",

A large body of evidence indicates positive impacts, including increased biomass and species richness of earthworms, greater abundance of some other invertebrates, increased numbers of some weed species, and benefits for birds like the Eurasian skylark through higher nest density and better foraging conditions [126]. Conversely, a significant number of studies found that reducing tillage had negative, no, or inconsistent effects on various invertebrate groups, earthworms, weeds, mammals, and some bird species.

    "answer": "Success depends on multiple factors. For newly created scrapes and pools, a combination of large surface area, high shoreline complexity, and shallow depth has been found to increase bird, invertebrate, and aquatic plant diversity [153]. For ditches, management under agri-environment schemes can increase plant and amphibian diversity, and having unsprayed banks supports higher plant diversity [135]. Raising water levels is a key intervention that can increase bird and invertebrate numbers, with one study finding this method established wet grassland species more rapidly than vegetation management alone [121].",

For plants and invertebrates, results are also mixed, with some studies showing benefits while others report little or no effect [700].
