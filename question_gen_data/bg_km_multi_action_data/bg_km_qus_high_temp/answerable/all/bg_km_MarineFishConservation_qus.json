    "question": "What actions are available to reduce unwanted fish catch using trawl nets?",
    "answer": "Several modifications to trawl nets can reduce unwanted catch. These include using a square mesh codend instead of a diamond mesh one (2714), fitting mesh escape panels or windows into the net (2716), and using a separator trawl which has a horizontal panel to split the catch into upper and lower codends, which can have different mesh sizes to allow unwanted species to escape (2711).",

    "question": "In the North Sea, what are the most effective methods for reducing unwanted cod catches in trawl fisheries?",
    "answer": "Evidence from the North Sea shows several methods can reduce unwanted cod catches, with varying effectiveness. Establishing 'move-on' rules, where temporary fishing closures are triggered by a catch threshold, led to lower overall cod discards (3815). Using a separator trawl allowed more unwanted smaller cod to escape capture into a lower codend with a larger mesh size (2711). Topless trawls reduced catches of larger Atlantic cod in one of two cases (2712).",

    "answer": "Based on five studies, long-term fishery closures have shown mixed effects. Four studies on population response found that they can lead to higher abundance of some fish species, such as in one of seven species after six to eight years, but lower abundance of others like monkfish. Another study found more young salmon but similar numbers of older salmon after a five-year closure (2655). For fish condition, one study found higher weights for young salmon, while another found smaller monkfish inside a closed area (2655). One study also noted a behavioural change, where fish in a closed area had a lower flight response, making them more vulnerable to spearfishing (2655).",

Out of thirty studies, seven found that various grid configurations reduced unwanted fish catches, including sharks (2721). Two before-and-after studies also found reduced capture of non-target fish after grids were introduced (2721). Among twenty other replicated studies, eleven found that trawls with grids had lower catches of unwanted fish, including sharks and rays, compared to nets without grids, although three studies found a variable effect and three found no effect on unwanted fish reduction (2721).",

For square mesh codends, six of fourteen replicated studies found improved size selectivity for species like silver hake and European hake, but five studies found no difference, and three found the effect varied with fish body shape (round or flat) (2714). For rotated diamond mesh (T90), one review and four of five replicated studies found it resulted in better size selection for cod and other round-bodied fish, but not for flatfish species like plaice (2715).",

Modifying the longline configuration, such as increasing the lead weight to increase sinking rate or using nylon instead of wire hook attachments, reduced catches of unwanted sharks and/or rays in two of four studies (2699). Attaching electropositive deterrents to longlines caught fewer unwanted sharks and rays in two of four studies (2696).

For plaice caught in beam trawls, survival was higher after shorter duration deployments, but for plaice caught in otter trawls, the opposite was true (2686).

In the Mediterranean Sea, prohibiting spearfishing increased abundances of European seabass and gilthead seabream (2672). In the Indian Ocean, a ban resulted in larger coral reef fish species after two to seven years (2672). A review of marine reserves in the northwestern Atlantic reported that reserves banning spearfishing had more snappers and grunts and larger reef fish after 2 to 20 years of protection (2672).",

Thirty of 54 studies found that protected areas had higher fish abundances after being closed for up to 25 years or more (2682). Conversely, eight studies found similar abundances between protected and fished areas after one to 20 years of implementation. One review found that fish abundance in no-take reserves between one and 25 years old varied between species. Another study found a long-term decline in some shark and ray species inside a reserve established for over 15 years, where enforcement was poor (2682).",
