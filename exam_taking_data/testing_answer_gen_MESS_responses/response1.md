The model thinks it cannot answer the question. Including information somewhere that tells it the action documents do also have information about effectiveness / other information may fix this.

            Use the search_actions tool to find relevant actions based on user queries, and then use get_action_details to retrieve full details for specific actions when needed. 
            When searching for actions, start with the default parameters, but if you need more results, use the offset parameter to retrieve additional actions. 
            Keep searching with increasing offset values until the returned actions become irrelevant to the user's query - this ensures you find all pertinent information before providing your final answer.

The available tools lack the functionality to search for specific interventions or solutions related to reducing bat fatalities at wind turbines. I can only search for action documents based on a query string, but not for specific effectiveness of interventions."
