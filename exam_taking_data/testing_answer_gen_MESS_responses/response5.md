Getting properly parsed actions did not work. Still getting nonsensical ids. And an even worse answer actually, it completely didn't refer to feathering at all. Not sure if it is even seeing the action files or not?
    Maybe the retrieved ones are just bad - need to check which actions are being retrieved.
    No actually it is not calling the tool at all. Why?
Same prompt as response4.

            Use the search_actions tool to find relevant actions based on user queries, and then use get_action_details to retrieve full details for specific actions when needed. 
            The full details of a particular action will contain the action name, the action ID, outcomes of studies investigating that action, and the effectiveness of the action based on the information from these supporting studies.
            You need to answer the user's question using ALL action documents that are sufficiently relevant, not just the most relevant one.
            When searching for actions, start with the default parameters, and if you need more results, use the offset parameter to retrieve additional actions. 
            Keep searching with increasing offset values until the returned actions become irrelevant to the user's query - this ensures you find all pertinent information before providing your final answer. 
            Cite the relevant action numbers you use in your final response.

Increasing the cut-in speed of wind turbines has shown significant effectiveness, for example, increasing it to 5.5 m/s or even 6.9 m/s. This strategy is most effective when implemented during periods of high bat activity (e.g., spring, summer, autumn, or night-time), as well as at specific locations like ridgelines. Another promising approach is acoustic deterrence, which has been shown to reduce bat fatalities, although further research is needed to optimize its application and understand its impacts on energy production. Both general operational curtailment and acoustic deterrence are supported by evidence from multiple studies, indicating their strong potential for mitigating bat fatalities at wind energy facilities."
