Provider = multiple - not pinned and it did not stick to one. including together, baseten, moonshot, groq.
It formatted the output correctly by itself, but did not actually call the get_formatted_result tool.

2025-07-30 16:45:35,083 - INFO - Final response: {"answer": "Based on reviewed evidence, the most effective interventions for reducing bat fatalities at wind turbines are:\n\n**Highly Effective (Beneficial rating):**\n1. **Prevent turbine blades from turning at low wind speeds (feathering)** - Six studies found this significantly reduces bat fatalities, including five replicated controlled studies across the USA and Canada.\n\n2. **Increase the wind speed at which turbines become operational (cut-in speed)** - Twelve studies (10 in USA, 2 in Canada) confirmed this intervention effectively reduces bat fatalities, with 10 of 12 studies showing significant reductions.\n\n**Likely Effective (Likely to be beneficial):**\n3. **Slow rotation of turbine blades at low wind speeds** - One replicated, randomized controlled study in Canada showed this reduces bat fatalities.\n\n4. **Automatically reduce turbine blade rotation when bat activity is high** - Two studies (Germany and USA) found this intelligent curtailment approach reduced fatalities by automatically adjusting turbine operation during predicted high bat activity periods.\n\n**Less Effective or Uncertain:**\n- Ultrasound deterrents showed mixed results across four studies in the USA\n- Radar deterrents had no evidence of effectiveness\n- Other interventions lack sufficient evidence\n\nThe combination of increasing cut-in speed and preventing blade rotation at low wind speeds appears most effective, with substantial scientific evidence supporting these operational adjustments as the primary mitigation strategies.", "action_ids": ["970", "2939", "1960", "971", "968", "962"]}

Use the search_actions tool to find relevant actions based on user queries, and then use get_action_details to retrieve full details for specific actions when needed. When searching for actions, start with the default parameters, but if you need more results, use the offset parameter to retrieve additional actions. Keep searching with increasing offset values until the returned actions become irrelevant to the user's query - this ensures you find all pertinent information before providing your final answer. Finally, convert your generated answer and the list of the action IDs used to generate this answer into a valid JSON format by using the get_formatted_result tool. You should copy the exact outputted json string of the get_formatted_result tool as your final message."
