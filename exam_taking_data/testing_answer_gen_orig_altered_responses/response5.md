Provider: multiple - not pinned and it did not stick to one.
Altered the prompt to be more forceful about it using the last tool and it worked, this time it called the get_formatted_result tool.

        Use the search_actions tool to find relevant actions based on user queries, and then use get_action_details to retrieve full details for specific actions when needed. 
        When searching for actions, start with the default parameters, but if you need more results, use the offset parameter to retrieve additional actions. 
        Keep searching with increasing offset values until the returned actions become irrelevant to the user's query - this ensures you find all pertinent information before providing your final answer. 
        Finally, you MUST use the get_formatted_result tool. This will convert your generated answer and the list of the action IDs used to generate your answer into a valid JSON format. 
        You MUST copy the exact outputted json string of the get_formatted_result tool as your final message."
