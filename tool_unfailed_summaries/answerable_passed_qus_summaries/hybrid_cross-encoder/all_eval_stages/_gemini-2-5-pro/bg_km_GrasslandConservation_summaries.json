Mowing after sowing seeds was also found to increase the richness of sown species in one replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the UK, and the abundance of sown forb species in a separate UK study (3419). Additionally, a replicated study in the UK determined that cutting sown plots each year and removing the cut vegetation resulted in an increase in the richness of sown grass and forb species compared to cutting without removing the vegetation (3419). However, this practice of cutting and removing vegetation also led to a reduction in the cover of sown grass and forb species (3419).",
