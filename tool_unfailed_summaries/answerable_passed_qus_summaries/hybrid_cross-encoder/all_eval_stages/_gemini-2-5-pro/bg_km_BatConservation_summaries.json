One study indicated that larger bat boxes had higher occupancy rates (1024). The material of the box also matters, with one study finding that resin boxes were occupied more quickly than wooden ones, and another showing higher occupancy in concrete boxes compared to wood (1024).

The orientation of the box and its exposure to sunlight can affect occupancy (1024). While the effect of height is debated, with some studies showing it matters and others finding no effect, boxes on buildings were found to have higher occupancy than those on trees (1024). The surrounding habitat is a factor, with higher occupancy observed in farm forestry over native forest and in pine stands over mixed deciduous stands (1024). Additionally, higher success rates are seen when boxes are installed in areas where bats were already known to roost, and installing a greater number of boxes across a site increases the likelihood of occupation (1024).\n\nHowever, when creating alternative roosts as part of a development, bat boxes or bat lofts that were built to replace destroyed roosts were four times less likely to be used by returning bats than roosts that were retained during development (949).

In one instance, a bat gantry was not used at all, and in another case, a temporary gantry was used by three bat species or species groups, but almost half of the bats crossed the road at other locations (978).\n\nThe effectiveness of overpasses has been found to vary. In Australia, one study recorded the same number of bat species at an overpass as in the surrounding forest and bushland (977). However, studies in Ireland and France indicated that up to 75% of bats crossed the road at traffic level or other locations, despite the presence of overpasses (977). The design of the overpass appears to be a key factor, as a UK study found that an overpass with planters was used by two-thirds of crossing bats, whereas an unvegetated overpass was completely unused (977).\n\nUnderpasses and culverts are also used by bats for crossing roads, although the proportion of use varies, with some bats still choosing to fly over the road (976). The use of these structures is influenced by their type and height, the width of the road, and the composition of the surrounding landscape, such as the presence of forests and hedgerows (976). Furthermore, bat species adapted to cluttered habitats were observed to use smaller underpasses and culverts more frequently than species adapted to open or edge habitats (976).",
