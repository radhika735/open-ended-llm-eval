    "relevant_summary": "Grazing to maintain or restore disturbance in fens and fen meadows has been found to have varying effects on biodiversity (1762). In Germany, one study found that grazed fen meadows had fewer plant species and characteristic fen plant species than mown meadows, and the overall plant community differed between the two management types (1762). However, studies in the UK showed that grazing could increase plant species richness and the cover of some herb groups, while reducing the cover of purple moor grass and shrubs (1762). Conversely, some UK studies also reported that grazing had no effect on species richness, shrub cover, or the cover of fen-characteristic mosses, and that it could reduce Sphagnum moss cover (1762). Mowing has been shown to alter the plant community composition in fens and fen meadows (1759). Multiple studies found that mowing increased plant species richness and the cover of fen- or wet meadow-characteristic plants and mosses (1759). Mowing also generally reduced the cover of herbs like reeds and purple moor grass, though one study found it had no effect on overall herb cover (1759). The effect of mowing on vegetation structure and biomass has shown mixed results (1759). A single mow was found, in some cases, to have no effect on plant richness or the cover of characteristic plants and mosses (1759). The removal of plant litter, another management practice, was reported in one study to increase plant species richness and diversity in a fen meadow, while other studies found it had no effect on plant community composition, bryophyte cover, or vascular plant diversity (1760).",

Studies on completely excluding or removing livestock from degraded peatlands have shown varied effects. For instance, excluding sheep had no effect on plant community development in one study, while another found that it favored dry moorland plants in drier areas (1734). While seven studies found that excluding or removing livestock had no effect on the cover of key herb groups, one study reported an increase in rush cover after cattle were excluded (1734). Five studies found no effect on Sphagnum moss cover from excluding livestock, but one study noted that Sphagnum moss appeared after cattle were excluded and the area was rewetted (1734). The effect on shrub cover is also varied, with four studies finding no effect, while three others reported an increase in shrub cover (1734). In one study, excluding sheep led to an increase in total vegetation, shrub, and bryophyte biomass but had no effect on the biomass of grass-like herbs (1734).",

For sown Sphagnum to survive, mulching may be necessary, as indicated by one study where survival was only observed in mulched plots (1821). Another study found that mulching after planting increased Sphagnum moss cover (1828). \\n\\nCovering sown plots with plastic mesh has been shown to increase the number of Sphagnum moss shoots (1829). In a greenhouse setting, the growth of planted Sphagnum mosses was increased by covering them with either transparent plastic sheets or shading mesh (1829). Furthermore, shading plots with plastic mesh was found to increase the cover of planted mosses (1829). One study reported that shading with plastic mesh enhanced the survival of planted mosses (1829). In contrast, another study in a Canadian bog found that shading sown plots with plastic mesh did not affect the cover of Sphagnum moss (1829). Similarly, three studies in degraded Canadian bogs reported that mulching after planting had no impact on Sphagnum moss cover (1828).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"1821\",\n    \"1828\",\n    \"1829\"\n  ]\n}"
