Providing natural substrates (e.g., varied substrates) and enclosure furniture such as rotting logs and hollow bamboo pipes promoted egg laying; in one Australian study these were combined with temporary enclosure flooding, sex\u2011ratio manipulation, and playing recorded mating calls when breeding occurred [1874, 1876]. Allowing female mate choice was associated with breeding only after introducing egg\u2011bearing females, manipulating sex ratios, playing recorded calls, moving frogs to indoor enclosures permitting temporary flooding with organic substrates, and, in another Australian before\u2011and\u2011after study, increased clutch size when female choice was provided alongside recorded calls, separating sexes outside the breeding period, and allowing females to gain weight before breeding [1882]. Across captive frog programs, reproductive success depended on temperature or simulating wet and dry seasons; breeding began after adding more calling, perching, and laying sites together with simulated wet/dry seasons, and development was affected by parental care, density, and temperature [835, 1876].",
