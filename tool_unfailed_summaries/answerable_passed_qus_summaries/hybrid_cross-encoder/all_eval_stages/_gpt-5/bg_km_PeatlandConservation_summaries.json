After reinstating grazing, plant species richness increased in one study but showed no typical effect in another; grazing increased some herb groups (e.g., sedges, cottongrasses) and reduced purple moor grass in one case, but effects on shrubs were mixed (reduced in one study, no effect in another) and Sphagnum cover decreased in one study (1762).\n- Maintaining traditional water meadows increased plant species richness in one study, but reviews noted mowing had variable effects on plant richness; cutting in June maintained relatively stable vegetation (696). For birds, management to maintain traditional water meadows increased numbers or territories of some waders (northern lapwing, common redshank, black\u2011tailed godwit), but common snipe declined on managed sites, and productivity of northern lapwings on grazed meadows was too low to sustain populations in most sites studied (696).\n- For butterflies, species richness and abundance were similar between wet meadows managed by annual autumn mowing and by light cattle/horse grazing; starting cattle grazing reduced bog fritillary emergence and use in one case, while intermediate\u2011intensity cattle grazing had higher marsh fritillary caterpillar web abundance than low or high intensity, and occupancy by marsh fritillary caterpillars was similar across grazed, burned, and unmanaged fen meadows (3971).",

    "relevant_summary": "Across multiple studies, removing the upper layer of peat/soil led to plant communities that differed from unstripped sites, with outcomes influenced by stripping depth [1809]. Following removal, cover of wetland- or peatland\u2011characteristic plants often increased over 4\u201313 years, and fen\u2011characteristic plant richness increased in one replicated comparison [1809]. Rush, reed, or sedge cover commonly increased within 2\u20136 years, while purple moor grass cover decreased for 2\u20135 years in two controlled studies; one study found no effect on sedge or bentgrass cover after five years [1809]. Vegetation biomass was reduced for up to 18 years in two studies, though another study reported no effect after four years [1809]. Total plant species richness frequently increased over 2\u201318 years, though results were mixed across sites and studies, and richness increased over time after stripping in one study [1809]. Disturbing the peat surface (without planting) altered plant community development over 2\u20133 years; in one study, disturbance promoted greater cover of weedy seed\u2011bank species, and in another, disturbed and undisturbed communities diverged over time [1811]. Disturbed plots saw colonization by wetland/fen\u2011characteristic species in both studies, but peat\u2011forming species did not colonize in one fen [1811]. Reprofiling degraded bogs (without planting) produced plant communities different from nearby natural fens and resulted in lower Sphagnum, other moss, and vascular plant cover after five years [1807].",

Changing the season of mowing in a fen meadow produced similar community shifts across spring, summer, and autumn in one study, but another study in a mixed peatland found different community types after summer vs. winter mowing; in the fen meadow, species richness increased more with summer mowing over two years (1771). Removing plant litter in a fen and a fen meadow did not change overall community composition; one fen study reported no effect on bryophyte or tall moor grass cover, while a fen meadow study reported increased species richness and diversity but another fen study found no change in vascular plant diversity (1760). Cutting/removing shrubs or trees in fens was associated with plant communities becoming more like target fen meadows and increases in fen meadow species abundance in a Polish fen; in a forested fen in the USA, cutting and removing trees increased herb cover but did not change shrub cover, and increased herb biomass and height in a peat swamp (1761). Where tree removal was combined with rewetting, studies in fens reported mixed or small changes in overall plant community composition, increases in wetland-characteristic plants, mixed effects on Sphagnum and other mosses, frequent increases in herb cover (including sedges and cottongrasses), increased ground vegetation height in one study, and mixed results for overall richness/diversity (1732).",
