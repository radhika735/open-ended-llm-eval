    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, studies from both Europe and the USA show positive effects of cover crops on soil organic matter, but with some regional differences in findings and consistency.\n\n**European Studies:**\nFrom action 1367, studies from France found more organic matter in soils with ground cover compared to soils without ground cover, with permanent ground cover showing more organic matter than temporary ground cover in some comparisons. Studies from Spain consistently found more organic matter in soils with seeded cover crops compared to bare soils, particularly when cover crops were incorporated into the soil. Italian studies from action 1345 found more organic matter in soils with winter cover crops compared to soils without them, though one study from Italy found inconsistent differences (sometimes more, sometimes less). From action 898, European studies (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no marked effect on soil organic matter levels, while one replicated study from Denmark found increased soil carbon levels under cover crops.\n\n**USA Studies:**\nFrom action 1367, USA studies found more organic matter in soils with ground cover compared to soils without ground cover in some or all comparisons, with similar amounts of organic matter in soils with resident vegetation or seeded cover crops. From action 1345, USA studies consistently found more organic matter (mostly measured as carbon) in soils with winter cover crops compared to soils without them in some or all comparisons. Action 898 reports that USA studies found increased nitrogen levels, increased carbon, and increased nitrates under cover crops. From action 897, one controlled trial from the USA (alongside studies from India and South Africa) found that soil organic matter increased under cover crops, while one trial from Germany found no effect.\n\n**Key Differences:**\nEuropean studies show more mixed results, with some finding no marked effects on soil organic matter levels, while USA studies more consistently show positive effects. Italian studies specifically show inconsistent differences in some cases, whereas USA studies typically find increases in soil organic matter. Both regions show benefits when cover crops are incorporated into soil, with European studies particularly emphasizing the advantage of permanent over temporary ground cover.",

A meta-analysis from Mediterranean countries found more organic matter in soils without tillage compared to soils with tillage, and fourteen additional replicated studies found more organic matter in no-tillage systems in some or all comparisons (action 1369). Similarly, reduced tillage showed consistent benefits with a meta-analysis and eleven replicated studies finding more organic matter compared to conventional tillage (action 1371).\n\nAddition of organic amendments consistently increases soil organic carbon across multiple studies. Four studies from India, Japan and the UK found higher carbon levels when manures were applied (action 911). Six studies from China, Denmark and India found higher carbon levels when fresh plant material was added to soil (action 910). Two randomized, replicated trials from Australia and China found higher soil organic carbon when crop residues were retained (action 907).\n\nCover crops when fields are empty show positive effects, with one replicated study from Denmark and one review based mainly in Japan finding increased soil carbon levels under cover crops, with further increases when legumes were included (action 898). Multiple studies found more organic matter in soils with winter cover crops compared to soils without them (action 1345).\n\nCrop rotation, particularly including legumes, increases soil organic carbon, with four studies from Australia, Canada, and Denmark finding increased soil organic carbon under crop rotation, particularly when legumes were included (action 857).\n\nOrganic farming systems demonstrate higher soil carbon, with two replicated trials in Italy and the USA showing organically managed orchards had higher soil carbon levels compared to conventionally managed orchards (action 895).",

Canadian studies also found that including forage crops in crop rotations reduced rainwater runoff and soil loss, and four studies from Australia, Canada, and Denmark found increased soil organic carbon under crop rotation, particularly when legumes were included (Action ID: 857). Change tillage practices has substantial Canadian evidence, with eleven studies from Canada, Europe, Mexico, or the USA showing that reduced tillage resulted in more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity (Action ID: 906). All twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA found higher soil organic carbon in soils under no-tillage or reduced tillage systems compared to conventionally tilled soil, and eight studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA found maintained or increased soil organic matter under reduced tillage (Action ID: 906). Convert to organic farming showed mixed results in Canadian studies, with four studies in Asia, Europe, and the USA finding higher numbers, diversity, or activity of soil organisms under organic management, but one replicated trial in Canada found that soil nutrients were lower in organically managed soils and yields were also lower (Action ID: 895).

Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil.

For hedgerows specifically, one of two studies found that retaining and enhancing hedgerows along with other field boundary features was associated with higher brown hare density in arable sites but not in grassland sites, while another study found that Irish hare numbers did not increase (Action 2383). Establishing hedgerows alongside arable land increased small mammal abundance (Action 2383). For tree planting on farmland, farm woodland supported higher small mammal abundance than arable land or similar abundance compared to uncultivated field margins and set-aside (Action 2386). Tree stands were used more by European hares compared to the wider farmed landscape, and trees planted on farmland were used by koalas (Action 2386). Tree plantations on agricultural land showed mixed effects on bats, with two of three studies finding no difference in bat activity in agricultural areas with and without plantations of native trees, though one study found higher bat activity in plantations next to remnant native vegetation than in isolated plantations or over grazing land (Action 958). However, in all three studies, bat activity was lower in plantations compared to original forest and woodland remnants (Action 958). Agricultural landscapes with smaller fields had higher activity of six of seven bat species than landscapes with larger fields (Action 1939). Related field margin practices also showed benefits, with grass buffer strips around fields supporting higher species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths compared to cropped field edges, with wider margins generally providing greater benefits (Action 3982).",

    "relevant_summary": "Reducing physical disturbance from machinery on agricultural soils, primarily through reduced tillage and no-tillage practices, has multiple beneficial effects on soil health. Soil organic matter consistently increases under reduced tillage systems, with twelve studies finding higher soil organic carbon in no-tillage compared to conventionally tilled soils (action 906). A meta-analysis from Mediterranean countries found more organic matter in soils with reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage, with eleven replicated studies supporting this finding (action 1371). Fourteen replicated studies found more organic matter in soils without tillage compared to soils with tillage (action 1369).\n\nSoil biological activity is enhanced when machinery disturbance is reduced. Eleven studies found more microbial biomass in soils with reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage (action 1371). Two replicated studies found more earthworms in soils without tillage compared to soils with tillage (action 1369). Additionally, four studies found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage (action 906).\n\nSoil structure improvements occur through reduced machinery traffic. Eight studies found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage (action 906). Seven replicated studies found that soils without tillage were more stable than tilled soils (action 1369). Three replicated studies found that soil aggregates had higher water-stability in plots with reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage (action 1371).\n\nControlled traffic systems provide additional benefits by minimizing compaction. Five trials found higher number of pores in soil, less compaction, reduced runoff and increased water filtration into soil under controlled traffic (action 899). Two replicated trials found that crop yields increased under controlled traffic systems (action 899).\n\nNutrient retention is generally improved under reduced disturbance systems. Four trials found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage (action 906). Seven replicated studies found more nitrogen in soils with reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage, while five replicated studies found more phosphorus in soils with reduced tillage (action 1371).",

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done.

    "relevant_summary": "Several actions can increase the biodiversity of soil organisms besides crop rotation. Reducing fertilizer, pesticide or herbicide use generally can result in higher diversity of soil invertebrates and microorganisms (action 904). Converting to organic farming has been shown to increase numbers, diversity, functional diversity or activity of soil organisms (action 895). Changing tillage practices, particularly adopting reduced tillage or no-tillage systems, can increase microbes, earthworm species, and microbe activity, with some studies finding more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage (action 906). No-tillage as a main cultivation method specifically increases microbial biomass in some studies and earthworm populations (action 2306). Adding mulch to crops using materials like shredded paper, municipal compost or straw increases soil animal and fungal numbers, diversity and activity (action 887). Amending soil with organic and inorganic amendments increases microbial biomass, activity and diversity (action 902). Adding manures and agricultural composts results in higher microbial biomass and microbial respiration (action 911). Amending soil with crops grown as green manures can increase soil organic carbon which supports soil organisms (action 908). Controlling traffic and traffic timing can result in higher numbers and bacterial activity in soil (action 899).",

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done.
