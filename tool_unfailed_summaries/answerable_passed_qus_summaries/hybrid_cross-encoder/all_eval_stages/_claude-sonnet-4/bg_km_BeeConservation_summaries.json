Mortality rates range from 13% for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany to 56% mortality overall for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India (Action 47). Competition from introduced species is another problem, as two replicated trials in California showed that introduced European earwigs and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes, with these introduced species more commonly occupying the boxes than native bees in one trial (Action 47). Nest box design significantly affects success, with plastic-lined holes or plastic/paper tubes being much less productive due to parasitism or mould compared to other materials (Action 47). Very low uptake rates are documented for bumblebee nest boxes, with three trials since 1989 in the UK showing 0-2.5% uptake rates for various designs not including underground boxes (Action 48). For certain bee species, complete failure to use nest boxes occurs, as one trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes, and a small trial with soil-filled nest boxes for mining bee Andrena flavipes in the UK found they were not occupied (Action 47).",

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes.

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years.

Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies.

Seven studies (including three replicated paired site comparisons and one European review) found agri-environment schemes maintained or had little or no effect on plants, plant diversity or species richness. Three studies found increases in plant species richness in areas with agri-environment schemes, two found decreases. A replicated site comparison study from Estonia found higher flower abundance on farms with agri-environment schemes in two out of four areas. A review found Environmentally Sensitive Areas in England had contributed to halting the loss of semi-natural grassland habitats but were less effective at enhancing or restoring grassland biodiversity.\\nTen studies from three European countries (including two replicated paired site comparisons and a review) looked at the effects of agri-environment schemes on invertebrates. Six studies (including two replicated site comparisons) showed agri-environment schemes maintained or had little or no effect on some invertebrates in terms of diversity, abundance, species richness or bee colony growth. Five studies found increases in abundance or species richness of some invertebrates. A UK study found agri-environment scheme prescriptions had a local but not a landscape-scale effect on bee numbers.\\nFour studies (including two replicated site comparisons and a review) from the UK looked at the effects of agri-environment schemes on mammals. One study found positive effects, three studies found mixed effects in different regions or for different species.\\nThree of the studies above found higher numbers of wildlife on land before agri-environment schemes were introduced. However two studies collecting baseline data found no difference in the overall number of birds or earthworms and soil microorganisms between areas with and without agri-environment schemes.\\nA review found two out of three agri-environment schemes in Europe benefited wildlife.\"\n}"

Perennial leguminous herbs in the wildflower seed mixtures are important forage sources for bumblebees, particularly for long-tongued species (Action 19).

    "relevant_summary": "Several factors have been shown to affect the success of captive-rearing and reintroducing bumblebee colonies based on experimental evidence. Diet composition significantly influences reproductive success in captive-reared bumblebees, with three replicated trials demonstrating that pollen diet affects reproductive outcomes (Action 50). Buff-tailed bumblebee colonies fed on freshly frozen pollen produced larger queens that survived better and produced larger colonies themselves compared to colonies fed on dried, frozen pollen, and workers can produce more offspring when fed pollen with higher protein content (Action 50). Social parasitism by cuckoo bees represents a major challenge, with variable rates of parasitism observed in reintroduced colonies ranging from zero to 79% across different trials (Action 52). Parasitism rates were reduced by placing colonies in landscapes with intermediate rather than very high nectar and pollen availability and releasing them late rather than early in the season (Action 52). Supplementary feeding showed mixed results, with one Canadian trial finding it improved reproductive success of captive-reared colonies but did not reduce parasite load, while a USA trial found no increase in colony productivity (Action 52). Artificial hibernation regimes affect colony establishment, with hibernation at 4-5\u00b0C for 45 days enhancing egg-laying and colony formation rates, though hibernated queens produced smaller colonies than non-hibernated queens (Action 50). Queens should weigh more than 0.6 g and be hibernated for four months or less for good survival chances (Action 50). Light regimes also influence development, with eight hours light and 16 hours darkness reducing the time for artificially reared queens to lay eggs compared to constant darkness (Action 50). Additionally, translocation can negatively impact colonies, with evidence showing queen death and lower colony productivity following movement (Action 53).",
