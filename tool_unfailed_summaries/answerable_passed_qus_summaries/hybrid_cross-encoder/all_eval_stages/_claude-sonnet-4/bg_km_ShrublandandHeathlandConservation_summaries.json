Mowing reduced grass cover but in some cases grass cover recovered over time, and did not increase cover of native forb species (action 1638). For specific grass species, mowing reduced vegetation height and had mixed effects on purple moor grass cover and the number of plant species, but did not alter cover of common heather (action 1638). Stripping turf showed different results: cutting and removing turf increased the number of heathland plants, increased presence of a small number of heathland plants, and decreased presence of a small number of non-heathland plants (action 1647). However, when comparing methods directly, presence of heather was similar in areas where turf was cut and areas that were mown or rotovated, and presence of wavy hair grass was similar in areas where turf was cut and those that were mown or rotovated (action 1647). Topsoil stripping as a related technique showed that removal of turf reduced cover of wavy hair grass (action 1685).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, several alternative interventions to herbicides have been trialled to control bracken in shrublands. Cutting bracken has been extensively studied, with one randomized, controlled, before-and-after trial in Norway and one randomized, controlled study in the UK finding that cutting bracken increased the cover or biomass of heather, though two randomized, replicated, controlled studies in the UK found that cutting bracken did not increase heather cover or abundance of heather seedlings (Action 1653). Cutting also showed mixed effects on plant diversity, with one study finding increased species richness of heathland plant species and another finding no change in species richness but increased species diversity (Action 1653). One systematic review found that cutting may be equally effective as herbicides (Action 105). Cut and burn methods have been identified as a potential intervention, though no studies have yet been found that evaluated this approach (Action 1655). Cutting followed by rotovating has been tested, with one controlled study in the UK finding that this combination did not increase total plant biomass or biomass of heather (Action 1656). The use of a 'bracken bruiser' mechanical device has been trialled, with one randomized, replicated, controlled, before-and-after, paired study in the UK finding that bracken bruising actually increased bracken cover and had no effect on the number of plant species or plant diversity (Action 1726). Increasing livestock numbers to control bracken has been identified as a potential method, though no studies have been found that evaluated this approach on shrublands (Action 1659).",

The only available evidence comes from studies on other habitat types: one study in Canada found significantly higher abundances of some birds, but not forest specialists, in forest patches connected to continuous forest compared to isolated patches, and evidence that corridors were used by some bird species more than clearcuts between patches (Action 160). Studies on reptiles found that forest fragments connected by corridors and isolated forest fragments had similar species composition, richness, and abundance in Brazil, while in Madagascar an area with hedges connecting different habitat types had more unique reptile species and reptile communities were more similar across habitat types compared to areas without hedges (Action 3663).

One replicated, controlled study in the UK found that cutting silver birch trees and applying herbicide did not alter cover of common heather when compared to cutting alone (Action 1636). However, one controlled study in the UK found that cutting trees and applying herbicide increased the abundance of heather seedlings (Action 1636). Additionally, one replicated, controlled study in the UK found that cutting and applying herbicide reduced cover of silver birch trees (Action 1636). For cutting trees alone, one randomized, replicated, controlled study in the UK found that cutting birch trees increased density of heather seedlings but not that of mature common heather plants (Action 1630). The evidence suggests that while both methods can increase heather seedlings, the addition of herbicide to cutting may be more effective at reducing tree cover but does not necessarily provide additional benefits for heather cover compared to cutting alone.",

Two replicated, before-and-after studies and one controlled study in Spain and the UK found that changing the type of livestock led to mixed effects on shrub cover, with two of these studies showing reduced cover of herbaceous species (Action 1608). One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the UK found that grazing with both cattle and sheep, as opposed to grazing with sheep only, reduced cover of purple moor grass but had no effect on four other plant species (Action 1608).\n\nRegarding shortening grazing periods, one replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the UK found that shortening the period in which livestock can graze had mixed effects on heather, bilberry, crowberry, and grass cover (Action 1609). One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK found that grazing in only winter or summer did not affect heather or grass height compared to year-round grazing (Action 1609).\n\nFor context on grazing effects more broadly, studies show that increased livestock numbers generally result in decreased shrub cover. Two site comparison studies in the UK found that cover of common heather declined in sites with a high density of livestock, and one site comparison in the Netherlands found that dwarf shrub cover was lower in grazed areas than in ungrazed areas (Action 1628). A systematic review of four studies in North Western Europe found that increased grazing intensity increased the cover of grass species, relative to heather species (Action 1628).",

    "relevant_summary": "The effects of reducing or stopping livestock grazing on shrub cover vary considerably across different countries and ecosystems. In the UK, studies show mixed effects: reducing grazing increased shrub cover or abundance in some studies (action 1607, 1545), with specific findings that total vegetation and shrub cover were greater where grazing intensity was lower in bogs (action 1735), and fencing to exclude livestock increased shrub cover (action 1545). However, one UK study found that reducing grazing had mixed effects on shrub cover (action 1607), and another found that reducing grazing led to a reduction in heather plant height (action 1607). In South Africa, a before-and-after trial found that reducing grazing increased shrub abundance (action 1607). In Spain, reducing grazing increased the cover of western gorse (action 1607). In the Netherlands, dwarf shrub cover was higher in ungrazed sites (action 1607). In France, ungrazed sites had higher cover of ericaceous shrubs but lower cover of non-ericaceous shrubs than grazed sites (action 1607). In contrast, studies in the USA found that stopping grazing did not increase shrub abundance (action 1607), and fencing led to decreased cover of woody plants in one study (action 1545). In peatland environments across multiple countries including the UK, Australia, USA, Spain, and Chile, excluding livestock had variable effects: some studies found no effect on shrub cover while others found increased shrub cover (action 1734). In Germany, fencing increased shrub biomass (action 1545).",

Allowing shrubland to regenerate without active management has demonstrated consistent benefits, with five before-and-after trials in the USA, UK, and Norway finding increased shrub cover or biomass after fire recovery without intervention (Action ID: 1679). One replicated, paired study in the USA found that sites allowed to recover without active restoration had similar shrub cover to unburned areas (Action ID: 1679).\n\nActive restoration approaches include introducing seeds of trees and shrubs. Studies show that sowing shrub seeds can increase establishment, with studies in Germany and the USA reporting germination and survival of heather and willow seeds respectively, though success varies by species (Action ID: 1824). Direct planting of trees and shrubs has shown promise, with eight studies in various locations reporting that the majority of planted trees and shrubs survived over periods between 10 weeks and 13 years (Action ID: 1820).\n\nSoil preparation techniques can enhance restoration success. Studies in the UK found that removal of topsoil combined with adding seed or clippings increased cover of heathland plants and heather and gorse (Action ID: 1711). Additionally, cutting or mowing grass combined with sowing shrubland seeds showed mixed results, with one study in the USA finding increased shrub seedling abundance and reduced grass cover (Action ID: 1639).\n\nThinning trees after wildfire in burnt forest areas can support recovery, with studies in Spain and Canada finding increased plant species richness and aspen sapling cover respectively (Action ID: 1234).",

For cutting alone, no studies were found that evaluated the effects of cutting/mowing to control trees on shrublands (Action 1633). Prescribed burning to control trees showed mixed results - one study in the USA found that burning did not change cover of two of three grass species, while a study in Italy found that prescribed burning reduced cover of common heather, increased cover of purple moor grass, and had mixed effects on the basal area of trees (Action 1721). Grazing alone to control trees was found in one Italian study to reduce cover of common heather and the basal area of trees, but did not alter cover of purple moor grass (Action 1634). Herbicide application to trees increased plant diversity but did not increase shrub cover in one South African study, and increased the abundance of common heather seedlings in a UK study (Action 1629). Combined methods showed different outcomes: cutting trees and applying herbicide increased heather seedling abundance in one UK study but did not alter common heather cover compared to cutting alone in another UK study, increased total plant species and diversity in South African studies, and reduced cover of silver birch trees (Action 1636). The combination of increased livestock numbers and prescribed burning reduced cover of common heather and tree basal area but did not alter purple moor grass cover (Action 1722). No studies were found for the combination of cutting trees and increasing livestock numbers (Action 1635).",

Adding topsoil showed positive results in UK studies, with increased cover or abundance of heathland plant species, increased abundance of woody plants, and increased number of seedlings for a majority of heathland plants (Action 1686). In Namibia, topsoil addition increased plant cover and number of plant species, though these remained lower than at undisturbed sites (Action 1686). When topsoil was added alongside seeding in the USA, it increased grass biomass but reduced forb biomass compared to topsoil alone (Action 1857). Organic matter addition showed mixed results: leaf litter addition in Brazil increased tree species richness, while in Costa Rica it decreased young tree density in forest gaps, with no effects under intact forest canopy (Action 1250). In Portugal, adding plant material to soil surface increased total plant cover (Action 1250). Various soil amendment approaches using composts and wastes were studied: Municipal waste composts in Spain greatly reduced soil loss and water runoff in semi-arid soils (Action 890). Organic processing waste composts applied at high rates improved soil structure and reduced soil loss but increased nutrient loss (Action 891). Manures and agricultural composts showed consistent benefits including higher microbial biomass, reduced soil loss and water runoff when combined with other treatments, higher soil carbon levels, and increased crop yields (Action 911). Mixed organic and inorganic amendments resulted in higher microbial biomass and activity, increased soil organic carbon, and improved crop yields (Action 902). Fresh plant material incorporation increased microbial biomass, reduced soil loss, increased soil nitrogen levels and carbon content, and improved yields (Action 910). Fertilizer application showed generally positive outcomes, increasing total plant cover, understory plant biomass, young tree size, and cover of artificially seeded species (Action 1248).",

Adding mulch and fertilizer together showed no significant effects on seedling abundance or grass cover in most cases (Actions 1694, 1707).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"1704\",\n    \"1696\",\n    \"1711\",\n    \"1685\",\n    \"1705\",\n    \"1700\",\n    \"1706\",\n    \"1694\",\n    \"1707\"\n  ]\n}"
