    "relevant_summary": "Semi-natural habitat management with rough grazing shows primarily positive effects on butterfly and moth populations. Light sheep grazing on saltmarsh for 15-18 years increased species richness of micro-moths compared to moderately or heavily grazed marsh, while also increasing total abundance of micro-moths compared to ungrazed marsh (action 3944). Cattle or pony grazing on calcareous coastal dunes for 4-13 years maintained similar species richness of butterflies compared to unmanaged land or areas managed by cutting, while also increasing abundance of four out of 13 butterfly species and improving site occupancy by brown argus and Alcon large blue butterflies (action 3944). Upland rough grassland managed by livestock grazing had greater species richness and higher abundance of butterflies than improved grassland (action 3944).\n\nPrescribed fire management shows more variable effects on butterfly and moth populations. Four out of nine studies found that burning increased abundance of certain species including heath fritillary adults, marsh fritillary caterpillar webs, and Fender's blue caterpillars and eggs on heathland, fen meadows and prairies, while three studies found decreased abundance of other species including Brenton blue butterfly, rosy marsh moth caterpillars and regal fritillary adults (action 3882). Burning typically had neutral effects on species richness, with prairies and grasslands showing similar richness compared to unburned areas (action 3882). A European review found occasional burning benefitted 10 out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern (action 3882).\n\nRotational burning provided more consistent benefits than single burns, with prairies burned more than one to four years ago showing higher species richness and abundance of butterflies than recently burned areas (action 3883). Similarly, rotational grazing showed advantages over continuous grazing, with rotationally grazed grasslands having greater species richness and higher abundance of butterflies and burnet moths than continuously grazed areas (action 3965). Leaving unburned patches during prescribed burning increased abundance of six out of nine specialist butterfly species compared to sites without unburned areas (action 3879).",

Leaving unburned patches during prescribed burning increased abundance of six out of nine specialist butterfly species compared to sites without unburned areas (action 3879).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"3944\",\n    \"3882\",\n    \"3883\",\n    \"3965\",\n    \"3879\"\n  ]\n}"

Action 3955 showed that semi-natural grasslands restored by scrub clearance and grazing had similar species richness of butterflies and burnet moths to both unrestored and continuously managed grassland in some cases, though one study found lower species richness compared to continuously managed grasslands. Action 3929 demonstrated that grasslands established by sowing grasses, legumes and other broadleaved plants had higher species richness and abundance of butterflies than grasslands established with grass-only mixes.\n\nFor set-aside areas: Action 3980 found that sown or naturally regenerating set-aside had greater species richness of butterflies and day-flying moths than cereal fields or pasture, especially when sown with less competitive grasses. The same action showed that butterfly abundance in sown set-aside was higher than in cereal fields, particularly when sown with less competitive grasses. Additionally, butterfly communities in older set-aside fields included species which were less migratory, spent longer as caterpillars, and had fewer generations per year than species found in newer set-aside fields.\n\nBoth habitat types showed benefits over conventional farmland, with set-aside particularly effective when managed with appropriate plant species composition and grasslands showing enhanced benefits when established with diverse plant communities including forbs and legumes rather than grass-only mixes.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on European farmland studies, wildflower strips consistently outperform both uncultivated and grass margins for butterfly conservation. Action 3932 shows that field margins sown with wildflowers had greater species richness and abundance of butterflies than grass-only field margins in studies from the UK and Sweden. Similarly, wildflower strips had higher butterfly abundance than uncultivated margins, cropped fields and conventional grassland in studies from the UK, Switzerland and Finland.\n\nWhen comparing uncultivated margins to grass margins, studies show mixed results but generally favor sown options. Action 3981 reports that uncultivated margins had lower species richness and abundance of butterflies than margins sown with grasses and non-woody broadleaved plants (forbs) or wildflowers in studies from Sweden, the UK and Finland. However, action 3982 indicates that floristically enhanced grass buffers or wildflower strips had greater species richness and higher abundance of butterflies than standard grass margins in studies from the UK and Sweden.\n\nThe effectiveness of grass margins varies by their enhancement level - action 3982 shows that grass margins sown with legumes or clover and grass ley had higher species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths than uncultivated margins in Swedish studies. However, action 3981 demonstrates that uncultivated margins which were not cut or only cut in spring/autumn had higher species richness and abundance of butterflies than margins cut in summer in UK and German studies.\n\nOverall, the European evidence indicates a clear hierarchy for butterfly conservation: wildflower/nectar flower strips perform best, followed by enhanced grass margins with legumes or wildflowers, then standard grass margins, with uncultivated margins generally performing least well, though management timing can improve uncultivated margin effectiveness.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from action documents, removing or excluding problematic plant and animal species has several positive effects on butterfly and moth populations:\n\nRemoving or controlling non-native or problematic plants generally increases butterfly and moth populations. Two studies found that sites where invasive plants were removed by weeding or cutting and applying herbicide had greater species richness of butterflies than untreated sites (Action 3890). Four of six studies found that sites where trees and shrubs were removed or invasive plants were cut had greater abundance of Apollo butterflies, higher density of Fender's blue eggs, or higher total abundance of butterflies compared to untreated sites (Action 3890). Two studies found that sites where invasive plants were removed were used more by Fender's blue and frosted elfin butterflies than untreated sites (Action 3890). Additionally, removal of invasive plants allowed adults from two previously separated populations of Apollo butterflies to mix (Action 3890).\n\nExcluding vertebrate herbivores also benefits butterfly and moth populations. Two of four studies found that forest plots fenced to exclude non-native pigs and deer had greater species richness of butterflies and macro-moths than unfenced plots (Action 3891). Five of eight studies found that plots fenced to exclude deer, sheep, pigs and large herbivores had higher abundance of butterflies, moths, caterpillars, rare macro-moths and New Forest burnet moths than unfenced plots (Action 3891). A global systematic review found that reducing or removing grazing or browsing by wild or domestic herbivores in temperate and boreal forests increased the abundance of butterflies and moths (Action 3891). One study found that all Glanville fritillary caterpillar nests survived in grassland fenced to exclude sheep, compared to 88% in a grazed area (Action 3891).\n\nExcluding invertebrate herbivores shows similar benefits, with one study finding higher density of pearl-bordered fritillary butterflies at sites fenced to exclude grazing animals than at unfenced sites (Action 3885).\n\nExcluding native predators has mixed results for butterfly and moth survival. Three of five studies found that using mesh cages, net sleeves and sticky resin to exclude predators including birds, mammals, spiders and ants increased survival of large copper caterpillars, Boisduval silkworm eggs and caterpillars, and Appalachian brown eggs and juveniles, while two studies found no increase in monarch caterpillar survival (Action 3889).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, multiple factors influence the success of captive breeding and release programs for butterflies and moths:\n\n**Environmental and Physical Conditions**: Temperature affects survival rates, with caterpillars having higher survival when reared at 20\u00b0C than 25\u00b0C (Action 3916). Density is critical - caterpillars have higher survival rates when reared at lower rather than higher density (Action 3916). The physical environment for overwintering also matters, as caterpillars kept in refrigerators had lower survival than those kept in environmental chambers or outside (Action 3916). \n\n**Host Plants and Food Sources**: The type and quality of host plants significantly impact success. Caterpillars fed different species of milkweed showed varying survival rates (Action 3916). Some species require specific plant combinations - Brenton blue butterfly caterpillars given only one plant species died, while those provided with multiple plant types survived (Action 3916).\n\n**Genetic and Population Factors**: Genetic diversity is crucial for long-term success. Populations kept in captivity for longer periods showed different characteristics - large white butterflies from populations kept in captivity for >25 years were heavier and had smaller wings than those from newer captive populations (Action 3916). Captive breeding can lead to potentially deleterious physiological or genetic changes, with evidence of reduced brain volume in captive birds and lower genetic diversity in captive populations compared to wild ones (Action 599).\n\n**Species-Specific Requirements**: Some species have complex ecological needs involving other organisms. Large blue and mountain Alcon blue caterpillars require specific ant species, with survival differing when reared in nests of different ant species (Action 3916). The presence or absence of ant queens affects caterpillar survival rates (Action 3916).\n\n**Release and Establishment Success**: Long-term persistence varies significantly - only 25% of captive-bred and translocated butterfly populations survived for >3 years, 38% died out within that time, and only 8% survived for >10 years (Action 3914). Success rates differ by life stage released, with releases as eggs, caterpillars, pupae and adults all showing different outcomes (Action 3914). Released populations sometimes require continued support through habitat management or supplementary releases to persist (Action 3914).",

The sixth study\\u00a0found that mountain Alcon blue caterpillars had a similar survival rate in ant nests with or without queens present. Two of these studies, and one replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the USA, found that the survival of large blue, mountain Alcon blue\\u00a0and monarch\\u00a0caterpillars differed when reared in ant nests of different species\\u00a0or on different species of milkweed.

One of these studies also found that Puget blue caterpillars kept in refrigerators while overwintering had a lower survival than caterpillars kept in environmental chambers or outside.

The other study reported that wild-collected Brenton blue butterfly eggs hatched in captivity and those caterpillars reared with only Pyllanthus incurvatus leaves died whereas all caterpillars also given Indigofera erecta leaves survived to the fourth instar of development. One study in South Africa\\u00a0reported that wild-caught final instar Cape Peninsula butterfly caterpillars reared in an artificial pugnacious ant nest successfully pupated and became adults, but captive-hatched first instar Cape Peninsula and Riley\\u2019s skolly butterfly caterpillars placed next to a nest did not survive to pupation.\\nCondition (5 studies): Two studies (including one controlled study) in the UK\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0found that adult large white from a population kept in captivity for &gt;25 years were heavier, and had smaller wings, than individuals from a population in its third generation in captivity, and captive-reared Puget blue adults were smaller than wild-caught butterflies. One of these studies also found that Puget blue caterpillars raised in environmental chambers or outdoor enclosures reached a similar size as adults. One replicated, controlled study in Spain\\u00a0found that mountain Alcon blue caterpillars reared in ant colonies with winged females were lighter than caterpillars reared in colonies without winged females. One replicated, controlled study in Israel\\u00a0found that spring webworm caterpillars fed vegetation from cattle-grazed pasture had a similar growth rate to caterpillars fed vegetation from an ungrazed paddock. One study in South Africa\\u00a0reported that Brenton blue butterfly caterpillars reared on Indigofera erecta leaves with no ants became dwarf adults, but those reared on whole Indigofera plants with an ant colony became full-sized adults.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\"\n}"

Eight studies found that grasslands grazed with lower stocking densities had greater abundance of all butterflies, butterflies with grass host plants, moths, burnet moths, their caterpillars, or specific species than grasslands grazed at higher stocking densities (Action 3959). A European review reported that reducing grazing intensity benefitted 41 out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern (Action 3959).\n\nSeasonal livestock removal shows mixed results. Two of three studies found that grasslands where cattle were removed had similar species richness of butterflies to grasslands grazed throughout the growing season, while one study found greater species richness with summer cattle removal (Action 3960). Three studies found that grasslands where livestock were removed seasonally had higher abundance of butterflies and caterpillars than grasslands grazed continuously, but three other studies found similar abundance between seasonal removal and continuous grazing (Action 3960).\n\nReducing mowing frequency demonstrates positive but variable effects.

For new hedge planting, established hedgerows had higher species richness of butterflies and macro-moths than in-field beetle banks, crops or pasture (Action 3976). The abundance of butterflies, moths, macro-moths and gatekeepers was higher along hedgerows than on beetle banks, grass margins without hedgerows, in field interiors, or 5-10 metres away from hedgerows (Action 3976). Additionally, gorse, oak and blackthorn planted within hedgerows had more species of arthropods, including caterpillars, than more commonly planted hawthorn (Action 3976). Moths recorded close to hedgerows were more likely to be flying parallel to hedgerows than moths recorded further away (Action 3976). For hedgerow management, hedgerows with trees or more complex structure had higher species richness or diversity of butterflies and macro-moths than simpler hedgerows without trees (Action 3975). Hedgerows cut once every 2-3 years, cut in autumn, or cut to allow incremental growth had higher abundance of adult butterflies and moths, moth caterpillars and pupae, and brown hairstreak eggs than hedgerows cut to the same size every winter (Action 3975). Hedgerows kept between 1-2 m tall had higher species richness of butterflies than hedgerows kept below 1 m tall (Action 3975). Hedgerows managed with scalloped edges or maintained at below 1 m tall had more brown hairstreak eggs and higher abundance of adult butterflies than hedgerows with straight edges or allowed to grow over 2 m tall (Action 3975). Laid or coppiced hedgerows had higher abundance of butterflies than unmanaged hedgerows (Action 3975). Field margins next to hedgerow trees had higher abundance of most shrub- and tree-feeding moth species than margins away from hedgerow trees (Action 3975).",

Grasslands abandoned for 4-5 years had higher species richness of butterflies and day-flying moths than extensively grazed or commercially grazed grasslands (Action 3956). Grasslands abandoned for 1-25 years showed higher abundance of Scotch argus, butterflies and day-flying moths, nocturnal moths, and caterpillars compared to grazed grasslands (Action 3956). Abandonment increased abundance of woodland and hedgerow butterflies and burnet moths compared to managed grasslands (Actions 3956, 3957). Some grasslands abandoned for 2-9 years had higher butterfly density than those currently grazed (Action 3956). Temporarily abandoned grasslands or those uncut all summer showed higher abundance of all butterflies, 11 species of butterfly, Scotch argus adults and meadow neb moth caterpillars than annually mown grasslands (Action 3957).\n\n**Negative consequences of abandoning grassland management:**\nExtended abandonment periods showed negative effects. Grasslands abandoned for more than 10 years had lower butterfly species richness than those abandoned for 2-9 years or currently grazed (Action 3956). Grasslands abandoned for more than 20 years or many years had lower species richness of butterflies than grazed grasslands (Action 3956). Over 6 years of abandonment, butterfly communities became dominated by generalist species and species with fewer generations per year (Actions 3956, 3957). Abandonment led to lower abundance of grassland or farmland butterfly species compared to managed grasslands (Actions 3956, 3957). Some specialist species went extinct in abandoned meadows, including large blue, silver-studded blue, and grizzled skipper and painted lady occurred less frequently in abandoned meadows (Actions 3956, 3957). Grasslands abandoned for more than 25 years had lower abundance of heath fritillary adults and no caterpillars compared to annually mown grasslands (Action 3957).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from 14 studies on clearing patches and 10 studies on coppicing in European forests and other regions:\n\nButterfly Communities: Both management practices generally benefit butterflies compared to unmanaged forests, but with different patterns. Cleared patches in forests had greater species richness of butterflies than coppiced woodland or closed canopy forest (Action 3938). However, coppiced woodland showed variable effects - one study found greater butterfly species richness in coppiced woodland than unmanaged woodland, while another found coppiced woodland had greater species richness than woodland coppiced over 15 years ago (Action 3939). For abundance, cleared patches managed with coppicing and grazing showed higher butterfly abundance than before management or unmanaged areas, with specific benefits for chequered blue, woodland brown, high brown fritillary and small pearl-bordered fritillary (Action 3938). Coppiced woodland also showed higher butterfly abundance than unmanaged woodland, with particular benefits for heath fritillary, and better persistence rates for pearl-bordered and small pearl-bordered fritillaries compared to mature conifer woodland (Action 3939).\n\nMoth Communities: The effects differ markedly between the two practices. Cleared patches in forests had lower species richness of moths than unmanaged patches or coppiced woodland (Action 3938). Additionally, wider rides in cleared areas had lower macro-moth abundance than standard width rides or mature forest (Action 3938). In contrast, coppiced woodland contained more unique macro-moth species than mature forest, though it had lower overall species richness and abundance than mature forest, with no change in abundance related to coppice age (Action 3939). Coppiced woodland of different ages supported different communities of moths and butterflies (Action 3939).\n\nTemporal Effects: Both practices show time-dependent effects. For cleared patches, butterfly species richness and abundance declined over the first three years after clearing, with patches cleared 2-4 years ago having greater heath fritillary abundance than patches cleared 7-11 years ago (Action 3938). For coppicing, the optimal timing appears to be 2-7 years post-coppicing for maximum butterfly abundance, with effectiveness declining after 15 years (Action 3939).",

For translocation within former range areas, 16 studies found that eight studies reported translocated populations of adult butterflies and Fisher's estuarine moth eggs persisted for 2-12 years and increased in abundance. However, one review across the UK and Ireland found that only 25% of translocated and released captive-bred butterfly populations survived for at least three years, 38% died out in that time, and only 8% were known to have survived for more than 10 years. The review also reported that translocated populations of large copper adults and/or caterpillars survived for up to 38 years but ultimately died out or had to be supplemented by further releases. For translocation outside known range, two of three studies reported that populations of Gillette's checkerspot, small skipper and marbled white persisted and increased in abundance over eight and 28 years respectively. For captive-breeding programs, six studies reported that captive-bred butterfly populations released as eggs, caterpillars, pupae and adults persisted for 2-28 years and increased in abundance. However, two studies reported that captive-bred large copper and belted beauty moth populations died out one, two or 12 years after release, or required further releases to survive. One replicated study found that three of 10 captive-bred barberry carpet moth populations established, and at least one persisted for five years. The same UK and Ireland review found identical survival rates for captive-bred populations as for translocated ones (25% survived >3 years, 8% survived >10 years). Studies also showed that large copper, large white and monarch butterflies were successfully reared in captivity for 12 generations or >25 years, and that survival rates in captivity varied significantly based on rearing conditions including temperature, ant species presence, and host plant species.",

    "relevant_summary": "The most effective field margin management strategies for increasing butterfly abundance in arable landscapes include several key approaches. Planting grass buffer strips around arable fields consistently increases butterfly abundance, with wider margins (up to 6 m wide) supporting higher abundance of habitat-sensitive butterflies than narrower margins (action 3982). Floristically enhanced grass buffers or wildflower strips have higher abundance of butterflies than standard grass margins (action 3982). Creating uncultivated margins around intensive arable fields also increases butterfly abundance compared to cropped field edges, with wider uncultivated margins supporting higher butterfly abundance than conventional margins (action 3981). Margins that are not cut, or only cut in spring and autumn, have higher butterfly abundance than margins cut in summer (action 3981). Sowing uncropped field margins with native wildflower seed mixes supports higher butterfly abundance than cropped field edges, grassy margins, or naturally regenerated margins, with perennial leguminous herbs being particularly important (action 19). Planting nectar flower mixture and wildflower strips consistently increases butterfly abundance compared to conventional field margins, unsown margins, cropped fields, and conventional grassland (action 3932). Field margins sown with wildflowers support higher butterfly abundance than grass-only margins (action 3932). Leaving headlands in fields unsprayed increases butterfly abundance compared to headlands sprayed with herbicide and insecticide (action 3898). Agricultural nectar and pollen mixes, particularly those containing perennial leguminous flowering plants, attract significantly more butterflies than naturally regenerated, grassy, or cropped field margins, though their value may degrade over time requiring re-sowing every few years (action 18). Natural regeneration of uncropped field margins also increases butterfly abundance compared to cropped margins, though effectiveness varies year to year (action 20).",

One site comparison study in Sweden\\u00a0found that grass margins sown with legumes or a clover and grass ley had a higher species richness of butterflies and moths than uncultivated margins, but less than a species-rich pasture. One replicated study in the Netherlands\\u00a0found that the species richness of butterflies increased over time after the establishment of grass margins.

Two replicated, randomized, controlled studies in the UK\\u00a0found that farms with floristically enhanced margins (along with other enhanced agri-environment scheme (AES) options) had a higher abundance of some butterflies\\u00a0and micro-moths, a similar abundance of macro-moths, but a lower abundance of other butterflies, than farms with standard grass margins (along with basic AES options)\\u00a0and farms with no grass margins or other AES options. One site comparison study in Sweden\\u00a0found that grass margins sown with legumes or a clover and grass ley had a higher abundance of butterflies and moths than uncultivated margins or a species-rich pasture. Two replicated, before-and-after studies (including one randomized, controlled study) in the Netherlands\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0found that mowing, disking\\u00a0or burning\\u00a0grass margins did not affect the abundance of butterflies\\u00a0and moths\\u00a0generally, or diamondback moths specifically, but that disking increased the abundance of disturbance-tolerant butterflies.\\u00a0One replicated, paired, site comparison study in the UK\\u00a0found that field margins had a similar abundance of butterfly and moth caterpillars to beetle banks established in the middle of fields.\\nSurvival (1 study): One site comparison study in China\\u00a0found that the survival of marsh fritillary caterpillars in grass margins around lightly cultivated fields was lower, but survival of egg clusters similar, to in uncultivated, grazed meadows.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)\\n\\nUse (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in China\\u00a0found that grass margins around lightly cultivated fields were more likely to be occupied by marsh fritillary eggs and caterpillars than uncultivated, grazed meadows.
