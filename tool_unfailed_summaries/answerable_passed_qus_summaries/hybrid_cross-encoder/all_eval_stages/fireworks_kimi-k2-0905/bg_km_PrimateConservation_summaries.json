Rope or pole (canopy) bridges have documented success, with one study in Brazil showing black lion tamarins and capuchins used a pole bridge to cross a road, a before-and-after study in Belize finding that a black howler monkey population increased after pole bridge construction over man-made gaps, and a before-and-after study in Madagascar finding that all six monitored lemur species used bridges to cross roads and pipelines. Rope bridges between canopies were used by 3-25 species across nine studies in Australia, Brazil and Peru, with arboreal marsupials not suffering high predation rates when using them. For general road mortality reduction, barrier fencing along roads reduced mammal vehicle collisions in three controlled studies in the USA, Germany and Brazil, with two before-and-after studies in the USA finding that roadside fencing with one-way gates reduced deer-vehicle collisions. A review across the USA, Canada and Sweden found that longer roadside fencing led to greater reduction of collisions between large mammals and cars. However, road mitigation effectiveness varies by species and design, with some studies showing no significant effects. No evidence was found for primate-specific measures like speed limits in high primate density areas, speed bumps, or primate road signage.",

Two studies found that areas with fencing and crossing structures had fewer road mortalities of turtles and overall reptiles. One study found that reptile road mortalities still occurred in in areas with roadside barrier walls and culverts. One replicated, before-and-after study in Canada found that following installation of tunnels and guide fencing, along with signs for motorists, there were fewer road mortalities of eastern massasauga rattlesnakes.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (12 STUDIES)\\n\\nUse (12 studies): Six studies (including two replicated studies and one review) in Spain, France, the USA and Australia found that crossing structures with fencing that were not specifically designed for wildlife were used by lizards, snakes, tortoises, turtles and alligators and ophidians. One study also found that the addition of fencing around crossing structures did not affect the number of reptile crossings. Three studies (including one replicated and one before-and-after study and one review) in the USA and Spain found that wildlife crossing structures with fencing were used by gopher tortoises and 12 snake species, American alligators and lacertid lizards. One study also found that an American alligator did not use the wildlife crossing structure. Two before-and-after studies (including one controlled study) in Canada found mixed effects of installing roadside fencing and culverts on road use by turtles and snakes. One replicated study in Spain found that use of different crossing structures depended on species group. One replicated study in Australia found that reptiles used wildlife underpasses or culverts for only 1% of road crossings. One replicated, before-and-after study in Canada found that following installation of tunnels and guide fencing, along with signs for motorists, fewer eastern massasauga rattlesnakes were found crossing the road.\"\n}"
