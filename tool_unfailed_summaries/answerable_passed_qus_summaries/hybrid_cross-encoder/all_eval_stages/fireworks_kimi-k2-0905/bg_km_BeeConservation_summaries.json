One large replicated controlled trial (action 21, 362) found that the average abundance of long-tongued bumblebees on field margins was positively correlated with the number of pollen and nectar agri-environment agreements in a 10 km grid square, suggesting landscape-scale benefits from multiple interventions. However, for interventions targeting natural habitat restoration and connectivity, no evidence was found demonstrating effects on bee diversity or abundance in neighboring farms (action 6) or effects on wild bee communities from connecting habitat patches (action 10). While butterfly and moth studies show increased species richness and abundance with greater proportions of semi-natural habitat in landscapes (action 3910), specific evidence for bees is lacking. One study found more wild bee species and individuals in planted flower strips compared to unplanted strips (action 1406), but this represents immediate site effects rather than landscape-scale spillover.",

High rates of parasitism and mortality have been documented, with mortality rates ranging from 2-56% across different studies. Parasitism rates reached 36% for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India, and overall mortality reached 56% for the same species. Nest boxes can facilitate the spread and establishment of introduced species, with European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species using boxes more commonly than native bees in California, USA. This led to the development of exclusion methods specifically targeting introduced earwigs. Certain nest box designs have proven problematic - plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive due to parasitism or mould. Some nest box types, particularly surface wooden boxes commonly marketed for wildlife gardening, show very low uptake rates (0-2.5% in recent UK trials), questioning their effectiveness. For bumblebees, wooden surface or above ground boxes are not the most effective design and show consistently low occupancy rates. Additionally, soil-filled nest boxes for mining bee Andrena flavipes in the UK were not occupied at all in a small trial, suggesting this approach is ineffective.",

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes.
