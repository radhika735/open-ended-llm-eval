Nine studies also found that using acoustic devices on fishing nets or traps resulted in fewer entanglements or collisions of various marine mammals, including whales, porpoises, and dolphins. However, three other studies found that the devices led to fewer entanglements for some species but not others, and one study found a reduction in one fishing area but not another (2808). In terms of behavior, twelve of sixteen studies found that acoustic devices on nets caused porpoises, dolphins, and seals to avoid the gear, while four studies found no significant effect (2808).\n\nRegarding vessels, one controlled study found that common bottlenose dolphins avoided a boat more frequently when acoustic devices were deployed. Another found that killer whales were recorded further from a fishing vessel using an acoustic device, but this effect diminished over time. However, a randomized, controlled study in the North Atlantic found that using two types of acoustic devices did not reduce predation of squid catches by Risso\u2019s dolphins (2815).\n\nFor moorings, one randomized controlled study in the Puntledge River found that deploying an acoustic device on a mooring reduced the number of harbour seals feeding on migrating juvenile salmon (2816). Other studies found mixed results on behavior, with some showing reduced activity of seals, porpoises and dolphins, while others found no effect on humpback whales. One study also noted that porpoises' probability of approaching a device increased over a period of 10-11 days (2816).",
