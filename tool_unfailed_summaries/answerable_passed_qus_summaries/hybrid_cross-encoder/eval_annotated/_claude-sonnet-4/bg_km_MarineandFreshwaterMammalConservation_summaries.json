    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence, acoustic devices show different levels of effectiveness depending on their deployment method for reducing human-wildlife conflict at wild fisheries. Acoustic devices on fishing gear appear most effective, with five of six controlled studies showing reduced damage to fish catches and/or fishing nets caused by marine mammals (action 2808). These devices also reduced entanglements, with nine studies finding fewer collisions or entanglements of various whale and dolphin species when acoustic devices were used on fishing nets and cod traps (action 2808). Acoustic devices on moorings showed limited evidence for reducing human-wildlife conflict, with only one randomized controlled study finding that deployment on moorings reduced harbour seals feeding on migrating juvenile salmon (action 2816). However, moorings-based devices effectively modified marine mammal behavior, with studies showing reduced numbers of seals and reduced activity of various dolphin and porpoise species (action 2816). Acoustic devices on fishing vessels showed the least effectiveness for human-wildlife conflict reduction, with one randomized controlled study finding no reduction in predation of squid catches by dolphins when acoustic devices were used on vessels (action 2815). However, vessel-based devices did modify dolphin behavior, causing avoidance and reduced foraging activity (action 2815). Acoustically reflective objects attached to fishing gear showed no effectiveness, with studies finding no reduction in dolphin entanglements or whale predation (action 2806). The evidence suggests that direct attachment to fishing gear provides the most consistent results for reducing human-wildlife conflict compared to vessel or mooring deployment methods.",

For noise dampening methods, one study in the North Sea found that using bubble curtains or screens during pile driving resulted in harbour porpoise detections within 15 km decreasing less compared to before pile driving than at sites without bubble curtains or screens (Action ID 2901). For acoustic deterrent devices, four studies from the North Sea, Great Belt, and Iceland found that using acoustic devices to deter mammals from an area at wind farm construction sites or pelagic sites reduced the activity and sightings of harbour porpoises at distances of 1-18 km from the devices, and caused minke whales to swim away from devices, increase swimming speed, and swim more directly (Action ID 2896). For soft start procedures during seismic surveys, three studies from the South Atlantic, South Pacific, and UK waters found that a greater proportion of cetaceans avoided or moved away from vessels during soft start procedures with seismic airguns compared to when airguns were not firing, though responses varied by species with some whales remaining within 900m and humpback whales only slowing their speed without significantly altering course (Action ID 2897). No studies were found evaluating the effectiveness of delaying or ceasing operations when mammals are detected within specified zones (Action ID 2898), reducing hammer energy during pile driving (Action ID 2900), using alternative methods instead of airguns for seismic surveys (Action ID 2899), or modifying vessels to reduce noise disturbance (Action ID 2904).",

Setting and enforcing vessel speed limits has demonstrated effectiveness, with studies showing that setting vessel speed limits during specific periods in key habitats resulted in fewer North Atlantic right whale deaths caused by collisions (Action 2777). Speed limit enforcement in all areas also showed fewer manatee deaths compared to partial enforcement in zones only (Action 2777).\\n\\nOther available actions include diverting shipping routes to avoid whale habitats (Action 2754), using observers on board vessels to detect mammals and allow vessel course or speed to be altered (Action 2755), and training vessel operators on appropriate avoidance techniques to reduce collisions (Action 3534). Technology-based solutions are also available, such as using real-time automated tools on board vessels to detect mammals and allow vessel course or speed to be altered (Action 2756), using remote tools to detect mammals in an area and allow vessel course or speed to be altered (Action 2757), and using technology and reporting systems to avoid collisions (Action 3535).\\n\\nAdditional vessel modifications include modifying vessels to reduce risk of physical injury to mammals (Action 2762) and reducing shipping along inland waterways (Action 2763). However, for most of these actions except speed limits, no studies have yet been found that directly evaluated their effectiveness on marine mammal populations.\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"2754\",\n    \"2777\",\n    \"2755\",\n    \"3534\",\n    \"2756\",\n    \"2762\",\n    \"2757\",\n    \"2763\",\n    \"3535\"\n  ]\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the documented evidence, captive rearing and rehabilitation of marine mammals shows several benefits and some negative outcomes:\n\n**Benefits:**\nRehabilitation programs have achieved survival rates of 10-100% for dolphins, porpoises, whales, seals, sea lions and manatees during post-release monitoring periods ranging from three days to five years (Action 2925). Approximately three-quarters of captive-reared Antillean manatees and two-thirds of Florida manatees survived for at least one year after release, with some surviving for more than seven years (Action 2926). More than a quarter of rehabilitated Hawaiian monk seals reproduced after release (Action 2925). Most captive-reared Antillean manatees released into the wild reproduced (Action 2926). Captive-reared and released Pacific harbour seal pups had similar survival estimates to wild pups, with similar diving behavior to wild pups (Action 2926). Two of three Antillean manatees and two of 14 Florida manatees born in captivity and released into the wild survived for at least one year without further intervention (Action 2933). In captive breeding programs, 80% of common bottlenose dolphins born in captivity over two decades survived, with survival increasing with improved husbandry techniques (Action 2932).\n\n**Negative Outcomes:**\nSome rehabilitated animals died before or after release, had to be returned to captivity after release, or survived only with supplemental feeding, including three West Indian manatee calves, seven Hawaiian monk seal pups and one Antillean manatee calf (Action 2926). At least a quarter of California sea lions treated for toxic algae poisoning and released died or had to be euthanized (Action 2925). California sea lions treated for toxic algae poisoning showed altered behavior after release, traveling further from shore, spending less time diving or hauled out, and making shorter, shallower dives than wild sea lions (Action 2925). Most captive-born Amazon river dolphins, narrow-ridged finless porpoises and Irrawaddy dolphins did not survive in captivity (Action 2932). A population of Yangtze finless porpoises breeding in semi-captive conditions had low genetic diversity (Action 2932). Some captive-reared animals like a grey whale calf and five pygmy and dwarf sperm whale calves either were not released or died in captivity (Action 2926).",
