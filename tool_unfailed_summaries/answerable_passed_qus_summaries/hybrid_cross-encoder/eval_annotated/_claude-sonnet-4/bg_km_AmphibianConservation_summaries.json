In the USA, the precise effect depended on the time since exclusion. Two replicated, randomized, paired, controlled studies in marshes in Australia\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0found that fencing to exclude cattle typically had no significant effect on the overall plant community composition after 1\\u201314 years.

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, several design and placement factors are associated with successful use of road tunnels by migrating amphibians. Diameter affects tunnel use, with wider culverts used more according to three of six studies (Action 884). Length is important, with long culverts avoided according to one of two studies (Action 884). Lighting affects tunnel use in all three studies that examined it, though with mixed effects (Action 884). Substrate choice is crucial, with natural substrates used more than artificial ones according to three of six studies (Action 884). The presence of water in tunnels shows mixed effects, with two of three studies finding varied results (Action 884). Entrance location affects use according to one study, and tunnel climate affects use according to one study (Action 884). The majority of successful culverts/tunnels had barrier fencing to guide amphibians to entrances, and this fencing needs to be at least 0.6 m high to prevent frogs from climbing over, though some species like treefrogs and 10% of common toads can still climb over barrier fencing during breeding migrations (Actions 884, 756). Certain designs should be avoided - one-way tunnels with vertical entry chutes resulted in high mortality of common toads, and condensation deposits from steel culverts had very high metal concentrations (Action 884). Culverts with flowing water can be used by amphibians, though results vary by species, with some salamanders rarely using them while others use them the same amount as dry culverts (Action 884). Installing ledges in culverts can increase use - under-road culverts with ledges were used more than culverts without ledges by mammal species, and ledges with access ramps were used more often than those without (Action 2523).",

Temperature treatment shows high success rates, with four of five studies finding that increasing enclosure or water temperature to 30-37\u00b0C for over 16 hours cured frogs and toads of chytridiomycosis (Action 770). Antifungal treatment is also highly effective, with twelve of 16 studies finding that antifungal treatment cured or increased survival of amphibians with chytridiomycosis, and six of eight studies testing itraconazole specifically found it effective at curing amphibians (Action 882). Antibacterial treatment shows mixed results, with chloramphenicol antibiotic treatments curing some species but trimethoprim-sulfadiazine only increasing survival time without curing blue-and-yellow poison dart frogs (Action 763). The least beneficial strategies include immunization, which showed no significant reduction in infection rate or mortality in mountain yellow-legged frogs when vaccinated with formalin-killed chytrid fungus (Action 765), and antifungal skin bacteria or peptides, where three of four studies found no reduction in infection rate or death when adding antifungal bacteria to amphibian skin (Action 764).

    "relevant_summary": "Studies on releasing captive-bred toads show varied but generally positive outcomes for establishing breeding populations. For Mallorcan midwife toads specifically, three studies found that captive-bred individuals released as tadpoles, toadlets or adults established breeding populations at 38%, 80% or 100% of sites respectively (Action 873). However, one study found that while predator defences were maintained, genetic diversity was reduced in captive-bred reintroduced populations, and toads bred in captivity for nine or more generations showed slower tadpole development, reduction in predator defence traits and decreased genetic diversity (Actions 873, 837).\n\nFor other toad species, two of three studies found that captive-bred toads released as tadpoles, juveniles or metamorphs established populations, with success rates of 70% at some sites (Action 875). However, outcomes varied significantly by species - studies of Puerto Rican crested toads found low survival rates with 25% predated within two days of release (Action 875). Head-starting programs showed more positive results, with six of 10 studies finding that released head-started tadpoles, metamorphs or juveniles established breeding populations or increased existing populations (Action 881).\n\nCaptive breeding success rates also varied by species and conditions. Ten studies found that various toad species produced eggs successfully in captivity, with eight successfully raising captive-bred toads to tadpoles, toadlets or adults, though two found that most toads died after hatching or metamorphosis (Action 848). For harlequin toads, breeding success was more challenging, with only three of five studies achieving reproduction in captivity (Action 836). Environmental factors significantly affected outcomes, with reproductive success influenced by tank humidity and outdoor enclosures showing higher success rates than indoor tanks (Action 848).",

Diameter significantly affects usage, with wider culverts used more in three of six studies (Action 884). Length impacts effectiveness, with long culverts avoided in one of two studies (Action 884). Lighting shows mixed effects across all three studies examining this factor (Action 884). Substrate type influences usage, with natural substrates used more than artificial ones in three of six studies (Action 884). The presence of water has mixed effects in two of three studies (Action 884). Entrance location affects usage patterns in one study, and tunnel climate influences usage in one study (Action 884). \n\nBarrier fencing is crucial for guiding amphibians to entrances, as the majority of effective culverts/tunnels had barrier fencing, and one study found decreased road deaths only when barrier fencing was also installed (Action 884). Barriers must be at least 0.6 m high to prevent green frogs and leopard frogs from climbing over (Action 756). However, some amphibians like treefrogs and 10% of common toads can still climb over barrier fencing during breeding migrations (Action 756).\n\nCertain design features result in failure: one-way tunnels with vertical entry chutes resulted in high mortality of common toads, and condensation deposits from steel culverts had very high metal concentrations (Action 884). Studies of culverts with flowing water show mixed results, with some being used by amphibians and others rarely used or not used at all (Action 884). Despite mitigation efforts, one study found that thousands of amphibians were still killed on roads even with culverts installed (Action 884).",
