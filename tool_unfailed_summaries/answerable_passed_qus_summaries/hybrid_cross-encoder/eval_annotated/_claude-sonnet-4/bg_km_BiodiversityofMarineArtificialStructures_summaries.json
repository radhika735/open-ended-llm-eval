For community composition, both small pits and larger holes altered macroalgae and invertebrate community composition and supported species absent from unmodified surfaces (Action 3475, Action 3467). Small pits supported fish species absent from surfaces without pits and altered fish community composition (Action 3475), while no fish community data was reported for larger holes (Action 3467). For species richness and diversity, eight of 12 studies found small pits increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness and/or diversity (Action 3475), while all three studies found larger holes increased species diversity and/or richness (Action 3467). Small pits increased macroalgal species richness, limpet and periwinkle species richness (in some cases), and fish species richness (Action 3475), while larger holes had no specific data on individual taxonomic groups (Action 3467). For abundance outcomes, small pits showed mixed results with two of five studies finding increased combined abundance, while effects varied by species and site (Action 3475). For larger holes, one study found no increase in macroalgal abundance and mixed results for invertebrate abundance depending on shore level and site (Action 3467). Small pits showed varied occupancy by limpets and periwinkles depending on pit characteristics and were used by various species including fish that increased biting behavior (Action 3475). Larger holes were used by sea slugs, urchins and octopuses (Action 3467).",

    "relevant_summary": "Several interventions have been shown to alter the overall community composition of organisms on subtidal artificial structures. Use of environmentally-sensitive materials: Six of 11 studies found that using shell-concrete or quarried rock instead of standard-concrete, or using ECOncrete\u2122 instead of standard-concrete or fibreglass, along with creating texture, grooves, holes, pits and/or small ledges, altered the combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition on structure surfaces (3470). Three studies also reported that ECOncrete\u2122 surfaces with added habitats supported mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate and/or fish species that were absent from standard-concrete or fibreglass structure surfaces (3470). Creating habitat features: Creating textured surfaces (\u22641 mm) altered community composition in two of three studies (3449). Creating hole habitats (>50 mm) along with grooves, environmentally-sensitive material and pits or small ledges altered combined macroalgae and invertebrate or mobile invertebrate and fish community composition in three studies, and these features supported species that were absent from structure surfaces without added habitat features (3434). Creating pit habitats (1\u201350 mm) along with holes, grooves and environmentally-sensitive material altered combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition and supported mobile and non-mobile invertebrate and fish species absent from structures without these features (3455). Creating groove habitats (1\u201350 mm) along with holes, pits and environmentally-sensitive material altered combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition and supported species absent from structures without added habitat features (3448). Creating grooves and small protrusions, ridges or ledges (1\u201350 mm) altered community composition in one of two studies (3452). Creating long flexible habitats (>50 mm) resulted in these features supporting macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate or fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without flexible habitats in two studies (3451). Creating short flexible habitats (1\u201350 mm) had mixed effects on mobile and/or non-mobile invertebrate community composition in two studies (3450). Structural modifications: Different artificial reef structure and material types showed that scrap tyres developed similar sessile invertebrate community composition as concrete modules, while pyramids made of \"sea-friendly\" concrete developed different invertebrate community compositions compared to traditional concrete structures (2259). Management practices: Managing or restricting harvesting resulted in different fish community composition around structures with restrictions compared to unrestricted structures, with restricted structures supporting species absent from unrestricted ones (3457). However, reducing the frequency of cleaning on subtidal artificial structures did not alter combined invertebrate and fish community composition (3447).",

Three replicated, randomized, controlled studies in Hong Kong and Australia found that transplanting oysters had mixed effects on mobile invertebrate abundance depending on the presence of grooves and small ridges or ledges on surfaces and/or the site, with one study finding increased oyster and mobile invertebrate abundance and another finding increased non-mobile invertebrate and oyster recruit abundance while decreasing barnacle abundance (Action 3472).\n\nCreating small adjoining cavities or 'swimthrough' habitats (\u2264100 mm) showed promise, with one replicated, controlled study in South Africa finding that small swimthrough habitats increased mobile invertebrate abundance on structure surfaces (Action 3468).\n\nCreating groove habitats (1-50 mm) produced variable results. Six studies examining groove habitats found that three of four replicated, controlled studies in Australia, the Netherlands and the UK did not increase invertebrate, limpet or chiton abundances, though one study found that grooves supported higher mobile invertebrate and oyster abundances than small ledges created in between them (Action 3473).\n\nCreating rock pools showed mixed results across multiple studies. Two replicated, controlled studies in Australia found that rock pools had mixed effects on limpet or combined invertebrate abundances, depending on the shore level, pool depth, species group and/or site (Action 3476).\n\nThe combination of grooves and small protrusions, ridges or ledges (1-50 mm) produced variable outcomes. Seven replicated, randomized, controlled studies found that this combination had mixed effects on mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate, limpet, mussel, juvenile oyster and/or barnacle abundances, depending on various design factors and site conditions, though two studies found that this combination increased oyster but not mobile invertebrate abundance on structure surfaces (Action 3474).\n\nOther interventions showed less consistent results: creating small ridges or ledges (1-50 mm) found that small ledges supported lower mobile invertebrate and oyster abundances than grooves (Action 3464), while creating hole habitats (>50 mm) showed mixed effects or no increase in invertebrate abundance (Action 3467).",

Seven replicated, randomized, controlled studies found that this combination had mixed effects on mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate, limpet, mussel, juvenile oyster and/or barnacle abundances, depending on various design factors and site conditions, though two studies found that this combination increased oyster but not mobile invertebrate abundance on structure surfaces (Action 3474).\\n\\nOther interventions showed less consistent results: creating small ridges or ledges (1-50 mm) found that small ledges supported lower mobile invertebrate and oyster abundances than grooves (Action 3464), while creating hole habitats (>50 mm) showed mixed effects or no increase in invertebrate abundance (Action 3467).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"3465\",\n    \"3472\",\n    \"3468\",\n    \"3473\",\n    \"3476\",\n    \"3474\",\n    \"3464\",\n    \"3467\",\n    \"3459\",\n    \"3466\",\n    \"3469\",\n    \"3462\"\n  ]\n}"

The absence of studies means there is no evidence to indicate whether these interventions have any desirable or harmful effects on biodiversity.

    "relevant_summary": "Based on studies examining both small (1-50 mm) and large (>50 mm) features on intertidal artificial structures, there are distinct differences in biodiversity outcomes. For large ridges or ledges (>50 mm), one of two studies found that these features, along with grooves and small protrusions, increased combined macroalgae, microalgae and invertebrate species diversity, while one study found that large ridges with large protrusions did not increase species richness (Action 3465). Large ridges/ledges increased abundance of mussels or limpets but not barnacles, and one study reported increased rockweed abundance and juvenile salmon feeding activity (Action 3465). In contrast, small ridges or ledges (1-50 mm) showed more mixed results, with one of two studies finding no increase in species richness, while another found that small ridges along with other features did increase species richness (Action 3464). Small ridges supported lower species richness than grooves created between them, and had mixed effects on abundance depending on shore level, site, and arrangement (Action 3464). For protrusions specifically, large protrusions (>50 mm) did not increase combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness in two studies, but did support species absent from surfaces without protrusions and increased limpet abundance (Action 3463). Small protrusions (1-50 mm) increased species richness in two Singapore studies, particularly when combined with other habitat features, but had mixed effects on abundance (Action 3462). When grooves are combined with small protrusions, ridges or ledges, six of 11 studies found increased species diversity and/or richness, with effects varying by depth/height of features, shore level, and site (Action 3474).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from action documents, several interventions have been consistently effective at altering the overall community composition of algae and invertebrates on artificial structures:\n\n**Transplanting or seeding organisms** is among the most effective interventions. For subtidal structures (3471), transplanting oysters altered the combined invertebrate and fish community composition on and around structure surfaces. For intertidal structures (3472), three studies found that oysters transplanted onto structures supported macroalgae, mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate and fish species that were absent from surfaces without transplanted oysters.\n\n**Creating textured surfaces** shows consistent effectiveness for community alteration. For subtidal structures (3449), two of three studies found that creating textured surfaces altered the combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition on structure surfaces, with one study reporting that textured surfaces with environmentally-sensitive material supported mobile and non-mobile invertebrate species that were absent from untextured surfaces.\n\n**Using environmentally-sensitive materials** demonstrates strong evidence for community composition changes. For intertidal structures (3469), two of four studies found that using hemp-concrete or ECOncrete\u2122 with added habitats altered the combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition, with studies reporting that these surfaces supported macroalgae, mobile invertebrate and/or non-mobile invertebrate species that were absent from standard-concrete surfaces. For subtidal structures (3470), six of 11 studies found that using materials like shell-concrete, quarried rock, or ECOncrete\u2122 with added habitat features altered the combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition, with three studies reporting that these surfaces supported mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate and/or fish species that were absent from standard surfaces.\n\n**Creating short flexible habitats** also shows effectiveness. For intertidal structures (3459), one study found that creating short flexible habitats altered the combined macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate community composition on structure surfaces. For subtidal structures (3450), two studies found that creating short flexible habitats had mixed effects on mobile and/or non-mobile invertebrate community composition, with one study finding that it altered the non-mobile invertebrate community composition.",

    "relevant_summary": "Several interventions have been studied in Singaporean waters to enhance intertidal artificial structures. Action 3475 reports that six studies were conducted on island coastlines in the Singapore Strait examining the creation of pit habitats (1-50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures. The outcomes showed that creating pit habitats altered the combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition on structure surfaces and supported macroalgae, invertebrate and fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without added habitats. Action 3475 indicates that creating pit habitats along with grooves increased fish species richness on and around structure surfaces, fish abundance, and the number of bites fishes took from structure surfaces. Action 3473 reports that two studies were conducted on island coastlines in the Singapore Strait examining the creation of groove habitats (1-50 mm). The outcomes showed that groove habitats created along with pits altered the fish community composition on and around structure surfaces, supported species that were absent from surfaces without grooves and pits, increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness and diversity, fish species richness, fish abundance, and the number of bites fishes took from structure surfaces. Action 3462 indicates that two studies were conducted on island coastlines in the Singapore Strait examining small protrusions (1-50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures. The outcomes showed that creating small protrusions along with grooves, small ridges and pits increased the combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness on structure surfaces, with mixed effects on community composition and abundance depending on site and size/arrangement of features. Action 3471 reports that one study was conducted on an island coastline in the Singapore Strait examining coral transplantation onto subtidal artificial structures. The outcomes showed that transplanting corals increased coral species richness and coral cover on structure surfaces, with survival and growth varying depending on coral species.",

Creating physical habitat features, including hole habitats (>50 mm), altered the combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition on and around structures and supported mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate and fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without added habitat features (Action 3434). Creating groove habitats and small protrusions, ridges or ledges (1-50 mm) altered the combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition on structure surfaces and supported non-mobile invertebrate species that were absent from structure surfaces without added habitat features (Action 3452). Creating textured surfaces (\u22641 mm) altered the combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition on structure surfaces, with textured surfaces using environmentally-sensitive material supporting mobile and non-mobile invertebrate species that were absent from fibreglass surfaces without texture (Action 3449). Creating groove habitats (1-50 mm) altered the combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition on structure surfaces and supported macroalgae, non-mobile invertebrate and fish species that were absent from similar structures without added habitat features (Action 3448). Creating pit habitats (1-50 mm) altered the combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition on structure surfaces and supported mobile and non-mobile invertebrate and fish species that were absent from similar structures without the added habitat features (Action 3455). Using environmentally-sensitive materials, such as shell-concrete, quarried rock, or ECOncrete\u2122 in place of standard-concrete or fibreglass, altered the combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition on structure surfaces, with ECOncrete\u2122 surfaces with added habitats supporting mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate and fish species that were absent from standard-concrete or fibreglass structure surfaces (Action 3470). Creating short flexible habitats (1-50 mm) had mixed effects on mobile and/or non-mobile invertebrate community composition, depending on the density or length of flexible habitats and/or the site, with one study finding it altered the non-mobile invertebrate community composition (Action 3450).

    "relevant_summary": "Based on studies examining oyster transplantation onto intertidal artificial structures, several factors influence effectiveness for enhancing biodiversity in Australian estuaries. Surface texture features significantly affect outcomes - transplanting oysters onto surfaces with grooves and small ridges (1-50 mm) shows mixed effects on species richness and diversity depending on the presence and size of these features and the site (action 3472). Studies in southeast Australia found that oyster survival was higher when transplanted into grooves compared with on ridges, while survival in grooves and on ledges varied depending on the site (action 3472). The presence of hole habitats (>50 mm) on structures, along with grooves and small ridges, supported macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate species that were absent from structure surfaces without added habitat features, and increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species diversity and richness on structure surfaces (action 3467). Material composition affects colonization success - environmentally-sensitive materials like hemp-concrete or reduced-pH-concrete can alter community composition and support species absent from standard-concrete surfaces (action 3469). Shore level positioning influences transplant success, with studies showing that survival and abundance effects vary depending on the intertidal zone where oysters are placed (action 3472). Site-specific conditions create variable outcomes, as multiple studies found that transplantation effects depend on the particular location within Australian estuaries (actions 3472, 3474). The effectiveness for enhancing wider biodiversity shows mixed results - while transplanted oysters supported additional macroalgae, mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate and fish species that were absent from surfaces without oysters, the actual increases in species richness and diversity varied depending on site and structural features (action 3472).",

Similarly, Action 3434 reports that hole habitats, along with grooves, environmentally-sensitive material and pits, altered the combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition on and around structures and supported mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate and/or fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without added habitat features. Both habitat types increased species diversity, with Action 3455 showing that pit habitats increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species diversity on structure surfaces, while Action 3434 found that hole habitats increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness and/or diversity on and around structures. Regarding population responses, both habitat types had mixed effects on species abundances. Action 3455 reports that pit habitats had mixed effects on macroalgal, invertebrate, and fish abundances depending on the species group. Action 3434 similarly reports that hole habitats had mixed effects on macroalgal abundances, invertebrate abundances, and fish abundances, depending on the species group.

Studies were conducted across multiple regions: ten studies in estuaries in Australia, the UK and eastern USA; five on open coastlines in the UK, Ireland and southeast Spain; two in straits in the UK and Malaysia; and one in a marina in Australia (Action 3476).\n\nLocation-specific outcomes include: In Ireland, shore level and wave-exposure affected community composition, with wave-sheltered pools filling with sediment within two years (Action 3476). In Australia, the effectiveness varied by pool depth, shore level and site, with mixed effects on community composition depending on these factors (Action 3476). Studies in Australia, the UK, Spain and Malaysia found that rock pools generally supported macroalgae, mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate and/or fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without pools (Action 3476).\n\nThe studies showed that nine of 12 replicated, controlled studies in Australia, the UK, Spain and Malaysia found rock pools supported higher combined macroalgae, invertebrate and/or fish species diversity and/or richness than structure surfaces without pools, though three studies reported similar species richness between pools and structure surfaces (Action 3476). Location also influenced functional outcomes, with one study finding that functional richness was lower in high-shore pools than mid-shore pools (Action 3476).\n\nPool characteristics interacted differently with environmental conditions across locations - two studies found pool depth did not affect community composition, while wave exposure and shore level had varying effects depending on the specific site location (Action 3476). The effectiveness of rock pools in supporting biodiversity appears to be influenced by local environmental conditions including wave exposure, shore level, and site-specific factors that vary by geographical region.",

For larger hole habitats (>50 mm), three studies found they altered combined macroalgae and invertebrate or mobile invertebrate and fish community composition and supported mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate and/or fish species absent from structure surfaces without added habitat features, with two of three studies finding increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness and/or diversity (action 3434). However, no studies were found that evaluated the effects of creating crevice habitats (>50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures (action 3454), and natural rocky reef topography showed no increase in juvenile canopy macroalgae abundance (action 3446). The effects on species abundances were consistently described as mixed, depending on the species group examined.",

    "relevant_summary": "Multiple studies conducted in Australian estuaries have documented diverse biodiversity outcomes from interventions on intertidal artificial structures. Transplanting or seeding organisms onto intertidal artificial structures (Action ID: 3472) showed that oysters transplanted onto structures supported macroalgae, mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate and fish species that were absent from surfaces without transplanted oysters, with increased mobile invertebrate species richness observed in some cases. However, effects on fish species richness were mixed depending on site and presence of grooves and ridges. Creating 'rock pools' on intertidal artificial structures (Action ID: 3476) demonstrated that pools supported macroalgae, mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate and fish species absent from structure surfaces without pools, with most studies showing higher combined species diversity and richness compared to surfaces without pools. Rock pools were documented to be used by sea slugs, urchins, octopuses, macroalgae, invertebrates and fishes. Creating hole habitats (Action ID: 3467) on structures along with other features like rock pools or grooves supported macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate species absent from surfaces without added habitat features, and increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species diversity and richness on structure surfaces. Creating short flexible habitats (Action ID: 3459) altered combined macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate community composition on structure surfaces, but decreased combined macroalgae, invertebrate and fish species richness during low tide. Creating small ridges or ledges (Action ID: 3464) showed mixed results, with some studies finding no increase in species richness and others showing that ridges supported lower species richness than grooves created between them. Creating pit habitats (Action ID: 3475) altered combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition and increased species richness in some studies, but results varied by site and arrangement of features. Using environmentally-sensitive materials (Action ID: 3469) such as hemp-concrete showed altered community composition and increased mobile invertebrate species richness compared to standard concrete. Reducing slope (Action ID: 3461) combined with creating rock pools increased combined macroalgae, invertebrate and fish species richness on structures.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the studies reviewed, creating protrusions, ridges, or ledges on artificial marine structures generally has limited or mixed effects on mobile invertebrate abundance. For small ridges or ledges (1-50 mm) on intertidal structures, one study found that small ledges supported lower mobile invertebrate abundances than grooves created between them (Action 3464). When grooves and small protrusions, ridges or ledges were created together on intertidal structures, studies showed mixed effects on mobile invertebrate abundance depending on factors such as the depth/height of grooves and ridges, the presence of large ledges or water-retaining covers, shore level, and site location (Action 3474). Two studies found that creating grooves and small ridges/ledges increased oyster but not mobile invertebrate abundance (Action 3474). For subtidal structures with grooves and small protrusions, ridges or ledges, one study found mixed effects on combined macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate abundance depending on the orientation of structure surfaces (Action 3452). For large ridges or ledges (>50 mm) on intertidal structures, studies found that they increased the abundance of mussels or limpets, but not barnacles (Action 3465). Large protrusions on intertidal structures were found to support mobile and non-mobile invertebrate species that were absent from structure surfaces without protrusions, and increased limpet but not barnacle abundance (Actions 3463). The effects varied considerably based on specific design features, environmental conditions, and the particular invertebrate species examined.",

Long flexible habitats (>50 mm) supported macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate or fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without flexible habitats, and altered non-mobile invertebrate community composition (Action 3451). Hole habitats (>50 mm) altered combined macroalgae and invertebrate or mobile invertebrate and fish community composition when combined with other features like grooves and pits, and supported species that were absent from surfaces without added habitat features (Action 3434). Groove habitats (1-50 mm) altered combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition and supported macroalgae, non-mobile invertebrate and fish species that were absent from structures without added habitat features (Action 3448). Pit habitats (1-50 mm) altered combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition and supported mobile and non-mobile invertebrate and fish species that were absent from structures without the added habitat features (Action 3455). Grooves and small protrusions/ridges/ledges (1-50 mm) altered combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition and supported non-mobile invertebrate species that were absent from structure surfaces without added habitat features (Action 3452). Short flexible habitats (1-50 mm) had mixed effects on mobile and/or non-mobile invertebrate community composition but did alter non-mobile invertebrate community composition in one study (Action 3450). Small adjoining cavities or 'swimthrough' habitats (\u2264100 mm) had mixed effects on juvenile fish community composition but supported six species that were absent from structure surfaces without swimthroughs (Action 3436).
