    "relevant_summary": "Several management practices can improve soil aggregation and stability on Mediterranean farmland beyond organic amendments. Cover crops grown beneath main crops or between crop rows can increase soil stability, with studies from Spain and the USA showing reduced erosion and highest soil stability under grass cover (Action 897). Reduced tillage practices significantly improve soil aggregation, with multiple studies from Mediterranean countries showing higher water-stability of soil aggregates in reduced tillage systems compared to conventional tillage, and some studies finding more large aggregates (Action 1371). No-tillage systems also enhance soil stability, with studies from Spain and the USA demonstrating that soils without tillage were more stable than tilled soils in multiple comparisons (Action 1369). Crop rotation can contribute to soil stability improvement, with studies from Syria showing increased water infiltration and higher water-stability in rotated soils compared to continuous crops, particularly when legumes are included (Actions 857, 1368). Adding mulch to crops increases soil stability and reduces erosion according to studies from multiple countries including France and the UK (Action 887). Reducing grazing intensity helps prevent soil compaction and aids recovery, with studies from Australia showing compacted soils recovered when sheep were excluded for 2.5 years, and trials from Syria finding less sediment erosion when grazing time was reduced (Action 901).",

Crop rotation can contribute to soil stability improvement, with studies from Syria showing increased water infiltration and higher water-stability in rotated soils compared to continuous crops, particularly when legumes are included (Actions 857, 1368). Adding mulch to crops increases soil stability and reduces erosion according to studies from multiple countries including France and the UK (Action 887). Reducing grazing intensity helps prevent soil compaction and aids recovery, with studies from Australia showing compacted soils recovered when sheep were excluded for 2.5 years, and trials from Syria finding less sediment erosion when grazing time was reduced (Action 901).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"897\",\n    \"1371\",\n    \"1369\",\n    \"857\",\n    \"1368\",\n    \"887\",\n    \"901\"\n  ]\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "Based on studies from Mediterranean orchards and vineyards, planting or maintaining ground cover for pest regulation shows mixed benefits and drawbacks. Benefits include: increased natural enemy numbers in some comparisons, with four replicated, controlled studies from Spain and the USA finding more natural enemies in plots with ground cover compared to plots without ground cover (Action 1395). One study found more natural enemies in plots with mown cover crops one week after mowing compared to before mowing (Action 1395). Studies show potential for increased parasitism of leafhopper eggs, though effects were inconsistent across different comparisons (Action 1395).\n\nHowever, significant drawbacks were documented: one replicated, randomized, controlled study from the USA found that more grapes were damaged by pests in plots with cover crops compared to bare fallows in some comparisons (Action 1395). For specific pest species, studies found inconsistent effects on leafhopper numbers, with some studies showing fewer leafhoppers in plots with cover crops while others found more leafhoppers or similar numbers (Action 1395). One study found more navel orangeworm moths in plots with resident vegetation compared to tilled soil in one of two comparisons (Action 1395). Additionally, competition effects were noted, with some studies finding more weeds in plots with cover crops compared to bare soil (Action 1395).\n\nNatural regeneration studies showed that effects varied between natural enemy groups, with some studies finding mixed effects where higher numbers of some natural enemy groups occurred but not others, and some studies found more pests in natural ground covers compared to sown ground covers (Action 720). Implementation approaches matter, as studies found fewer pests in plots with mown ground cover compared to unmown ground cover (Action 1395).",

    "relevant_summary": "The evidence regarding impacts of different grazing management strategies on invertebrate biodiversity shows mixed and limited results, with very few studies specifically focused on Mediterranean farmland contexts. From seasonal grazing strategies, one replicated, randomized, controlled before-and-after study in wet grasslands in the USA found more aquatic invertebrate species in continuously grazed plots compared to seasonally grazed plots in some comparisons (action 1421). For general grazing management, multiple studies show varied outcomes: two replicated studies in grasslands in the USA and Spain found more invertebrates in sheep-, goat-, or cattle-grazed plots compared to ungrazed plots in some or all comparisons, while one before-and-after study found that a threatened, endemic butterfly species did not recolonize a site after grazing was reintroduced (action 1419). Studies on grazer exclusion found that two replicated studies in wetlands and grasslands in the USA found more species or families of invertebrates in areas with cattle excluded compared to grazed areas for some or all groups, though one study found fewer aquatic invertebrate species in areas with cattle excluded in some comparisons (action 1417). Regarding grazing intensity, one replicated, randomized, controlled study in wet grasslands in the USA found more families of insects in streams in areas grazed by cattle at lower compared to higher intensities (action 1418). For rotational grazing, no studies specifically examined invertebrate responses, with available evidence limited to plant effects (action 1420). From broader evidence on reduced grazing intensity, studies from France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and the UK found that reducing grazing intensity increased invertebrate diversity and abundance in some cases (action 704). For butterfly and moth communities specifically, multiple studies from France, the USA and the UK showed that rotational grazing had variable effects on species richness and abundance compared to continuous grazing, with some studies finding benefits and others showing no difference (action 3965). The evidence base appears to be predominantly from temperate regions rather than Mediterranean farmland specifically, limiting direct applicability to Mediterranean contexts.",

Six studies (including three replicated controlled trials of which two randomized) found that excluding or delaying summer grazing increased plant species diversity, invertebrate abundance and benefited breeding Eurasian skylark. A review found a study that showed that removing autumn grazing after a silage cut increased the winter abundance of seed-eating birds. A review and a replicated controlled study from the UK\\u00a0found that reduced grazing intensity or seasonal removal of livestock increased the number of invertebrates, plant seed heads and foraging skylark, and that some bird species preferred plots with seasonal removal of livestock.\\nThree studies (including one randomized, replicated, controlled trial) from the Netherlands and the UK found no benefit to plants or invertebrates from reduced grazing intensity. One randomized, replicated controlled trial excluded grazing in autumn/winter and another study excluded grazing in the summer. A further study found that reducing grazing intensity throughout the year did not increase plant diversity.\\nNine studies from France, Germany and the UK reported mixed results for some or all species or wildlife groups considered (including one randomized, replicated, controlled trial and two reviews and a systematic review). Of these, eight studies found that reduced grazing intensity throughout the year benefited some species but not others, one found that the impact depended on the type of vegetation grazed, and one found benefits to bee and wasp abundance but not species richness. One study found that the response of birds to removal of summer grazing varied between functional groups and depended on time of year. A UK review found that reduced grazing benefited invertebrates, plants, rodents and some but not all birds. \\nA systematic review of the effects of grazing intensity on meadow pasture concluded that intermediate levels of grazing are usually optimal for plants, invertebrates and birds but that trade-offs are likely to exist between the requirements of different taxa.\"\n}"

Similarly, no-tillage systems (Action 1355) have demonstrated higher crop yields in some or all comparisons across studies from Italy and Spain.\n\n**Fertilization Strategies:** Adding compost to soil (Action 1346) has resulted in higher crop yields in studies from Italy, Spain, and the USA compared to plots without added compost, in some or all comparisons. Using organic fertilizer instead of inorganic (Action 1350) has shown higher yields in plots from Italy and Spain in some comparisons, though results were mixed with some studies showing lower yields.\n\n**Soil Amendment:** Amending soil using a mix of organic and inorganic amendments (Action 902) has increased maize yield in studies from China with mixed manure and inorganic fertilizer amendments.\n\n**Crop Management Practices:** Using crop rotations (Action 1354) has resulted in higher crop yields in studies from Italy, Spain, and Turkey compared to monocultures in some comparisons. Growing cover crops in arable fields (Action 1351) showed mixed results, with some studies from Spain and the USA finding higher cash crop yields with winter cover crops in some comparisons, while others found lower yields.\n\n**Orchard and Vineyard Management:** Planting or maintaining ground cover in orchards or vineyards (Action 1367) provides soil benefits including increased organic matter and nitrogen in soils, which can support crop productivity, as evidenced by studies from Chile, France, Spain, and the USA.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence from Mediterranean studies, the effectiveness of actions for improving crop quality varies considerably. For crop yield improvements, several actions show promising results: Crop rotations (action 1354) showed higher crop yields in Italy, Spain, and Turkey studies, and one study from Italy found more protein in wheat grown in rotation compared to continuously-grown wheat. Adding slurry to soil (action 1349) demonstrated consistent positive effects, with six studies from Spain finding higher crop yields in plots with added pig slurry. Cover crops (action 1351) showed mixed but often positive results, with three studies from Italy and the USA finding higher cash crop yields with winter cover crops, though effectiveness varied by implementation with legume cover crops generally outperforming non-legumes.\n\nFor no-tillage practices, results were highly variable. No tillage in arable fields (action 1355) showed eight studies from Italy and Spain finding higher crop yields in some comparisons, but seven studies found lower yields, indicating inconsistent effectiveness. One study from Italy found less protein in wheat grains from no-tillage plots, while one Spanish study found heavier cereal grains. No tillage instead of reduced tillage (action 1358) showed mixed results with three Spanish studies finding higher cereal yields but three Italian studies finding lower fruit or vegetable yields.\n\nFertilization approaches showed moderate effectiveness. Using organic fertilizer instead of inorganic (action 1350) produced mixed results with four studies from Italy and Spain finding higher yields in some comparisons, but three studies finding lower yields. Adding compost (action 1346) showed three studies finding higher crop yields in some or all comparisons, but effectiveness was inconsistent. Adding manure (action 1347) showed limited evidence with only one Greek study finding higher maize yields in two of three comparisons.\n\nActions with limited effectiveness for crop quality included planting flowers (action 1360), which showed only two studies with positive yield effects but no specific crop quality improvements documented. Ground cover in orchards/vineyards (action 1352) showed mixed results for crop yields but provided some crop quality benefits, with studies finding similar sugar contents in grapes and some improvements in grape weight and chestnut size.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on studies from Mediterranean countries, different organic amendments show varying effects on crop yields. Manure application resulted in higher crop yields according to four controlled, replicated studies from India, Spain and Turkey (Action 911). In Mediterranean-specific research, studies from Spain found higher crop yields in plots with added pig slurry compared to plots without it (Action 1349). For compost, studies primarily from Spain and Italy are referenced, though specific yield comparisons are limited in the Mediterranean context. Studies from Spain found that cotton gin compost and poultry manure improved soil structure and reduced soil loss, while molasses addition improved nutrient retention and increased barley yield (Action 891). One study from Italy found that high rates of compost increased fruit yield (Action 889). When comparing organic amendments, research from Italy found more organic matter, nutrients, and microbial biomass in plots fertilized with compost compared to manure (Action 1366). Studies from Spain indicated that plots with slurry absorbed methane while plots with manure emitted methane (Action 1366). Mixed organic and inorganic amendments showed increased maize yields in controlled trials from China (Action 902), though this is outside the Mediterranean region. The research indicates that slurry and manure both effectively increase crop yields in Mediterranean conditions, while compost shows benefits for soil health and fruit production, with compost potentially providing greater soil benefits than manure alone.",

    "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4",
    "provider": null,
    "relevant_summary": "Based on studies from Mediterranean countries including Italy, Spain, Lebanon, and other Mediterranean regions, tillage systems show complex effects on weed populations with several key trade-offs. No-till versus reduced-till comparisons reveal mixed outcomes for weed management (Action 1398). Four studies from Italy, Lebanon, and Spain found fewer weeds in no-till plots compared to reduced-till in some or all comparisons, while two of these studies also found more weeds in some comparisons. One study from Australia found more weeds in no-till compared to reduced-till, and one Spanish study found similar weed amounts between systems. For weed species diversity, one Spanish study found fewer weed species in no-till versus reduced-till, while two studies from Italy and Spain found similar numbers of weed species between systems (Action 1398).\n\nWhen comparing no-till to conventional tillage, Mediterranean studies show predominantly increased weed pressure with no-till systems (Action 1397). Three studies from Italy and Spain found more weeds in no-till plots compared to conventional tillage in some comparisons. Four studies from Italy, Spain, and the USA found inconsistent differences, with sometimes more weeds in no-till and sometimes fewer. Only one Lebanese study found similar weed numbers between no-till and conventional systems. For weed species diversity, one Italian study found more weed species in no-till compared to conventional tillage, while three studies from Italy and Spain found similar numbers of species.\n\nReduced-till systems generally increase weed populations compared to conventional tillage (Action 1399). Seven studies from Italy, Lebanon, Spain, Turkey, and the USA found more weeds in reduced-till plots compared to conventional tillage in some or all comparisons. One study also found fewer weeds in reduced-till in some comparisons, while one Italian study found similar weed numbers between systems. Weed species diversity showed mixed results, with two studies from Spain and Turkey finding similar numbers of species between reduced-till and conventional systems, while one USA study found different weed community compositions.\n\nAdditional research from Mediterranean countries confirms that reduced tillage practices generally lead to increased weed challenges compared to conventional approaches (Action 126). Studies indicate that crop type can affect the number of weeds under different tillage regimes, suggesting that weed management trade-offs may vary depending on the specific crops grown in Mediterranean arable systems.",

Planting or maintaining ground cover in orchards or vineyards has shown positive results, with one replicated site comparison from Greece finding more bee species and more deposited pollen grains in managed olive orchards compared to abandoned olive orchards, which differed in ground cover (action ID 1404). No-tillage practices in arable fields provide benefits, with one replicated, randomized, controlled study from the USA finding more pollinators in plots with no tillage compared to deep tillage (action ID 1405). Planting hedgerows demonstrates multiple benefits for pollinators, with studies showing higher seed-set in canola plants due to flower visitation by native bees in fields next to planted hedgerows, higher crop visitation rates by native bees, and more bee species in fields with hedgerows or in hedgerows themselves compared to fields without hedgerows (action ID 1407). Restoring habitat along watercourses provides pollinator benefits, with one replicated, paired site comparison finding similar numbers of bees and bee species in restored and remnant sites (action ID 1408). Managing the agricultural landscape to enhance floral resources shows promise, with one large replicated controlled trial demonstrating that the average abundance of long-tongued bumblebees on field margins was positively correlated with the number of 'pollen and nectar' agri-environment agreements in a 10 km grid square (action ID 362). Planting dedicated floral resources on farmland has been evaluated, though one replicated trial shows that phacelia is not very attractive to wild bees in Greece (action ID 17).",

    "relevant_summary": "Evidence from US grassland studies shows varied impacts of different grazing management strategies on invertebrate and mammal biodiversity, though specific Mediterranean climate studies are limited in the available data.\n\nFor invertebrate biodiversity, multiple grazing strategies show different effects. Studies found that two replicated studies in grasslands in the USA found more invertebrates in sheep-, goat-, or cattle-grazed plots compared to ungrazed plots in some or all comparisons (Action 1419). However, one replicated randomized controlled study in grasslands in the USA found fewer invertebrates in plots with simulated grazing compared to ungrazed plots, but found similar numbers of invertebrate species (Action 1419). One before-and-after study in grassland in the USA found that a threatened, endemic butterfly species did not recolonize a site after grazing was reintroduced (Action 1419). Additionally, one replicated site comparison in forested grasslands found higher beetle diversity in grazed plots compared to ungrazed plots in one of two beetle groups (Action 1419).\n\nRegarding grazing exclusion effects on invertebrates, two replicated studies in wetlands and grasslands in the USA found more species or families of invertebrates in areas with cattle excluded compared to grazed areas for some or all groups (Action 1417). One replicated before-and-after site comparison in grasslands in the USA found that populations of a threatened, endemic butterfly declined in sites with cattle excluded, but also declined in cattle-grazed sites (Action 1417).\n\nFor reduced grazing intensity, one replicated randomized controlled study in wet grasslands in the USA found more families of insects in streams in areas grazed by cattle at lower compared to higher intensities (Action 1418). Studies on reduced stocking density found that eight replicated studies in the USA found that grasslands grazed with lower stocking densities had a greater abundance of all butterflies, butterflies with grass host plants, all moths, burnet moths, their caterpillars or specific species than grasslands grazed at higher stocking densities (Action 3959).\n\nFor rotational grazing, two of four replicated controlled studies in the USA found that rotational cattle-grazed grassland had a higher abundance of butterflies and burnet moths and caterpillars than continuously grazed grasslands, though one study only found this in the first of three years of management (Action 3965).\n\nFor mammal biodiversity, evidence shows that two replicated controlled studies in grasslands in the USA found that abundances of some or all rodents were higher, or increased more, on sheep- or cow-grazed plots compared to ungrazed plots, but they also found that some species were less abundant or monthly survival was lower on grazed plots (Action 1419). Two replicated site comparisons in deserts and grasslands found more mammal species in areas with cattle or sheep excluded compared to grazed areas, with one study also finding higher mammal diversity, and both studies found higher mammal abundance in areas with grazers excluded compared to grazed areas in some or all comparisons (Action 1417).",

One replicated site comparison from Spain found similar numbers of birds and bird species in restored contaminated sites and uncontaminated sites (action 1416). However, evidence from other regions shows that bird populations increased with the area of restored habitat in the landscape in some comparisons, and implementation studies found more birds or bird species in older restored plots compared to younger restored plots (action 1416).\n\nFor plant communities, studies show that restored sites generally had lower plant cover compared to remnant sites, with some studies finding higher cover of exotic plants (action 1416). Two replicated studies found fewer native plant species in restored forests compared to remnant forests, with one study finding more exotic species (action 1416). However, one study found more plant species in restored sites compared to remnant sites (action 1416).\n\nFor other biodiversity groups, one replicated site comparison found similar numbers of amphibian species, mammal species, and reptile species in restored and remnant sites (action 1416). For invertebrates, evidence shows fewer native ants but similar numbers of invasive ants in restored sites compared to remnant sites, and similar numbers of freshwater invertebrates in restored and reference sites after restoration (action 1416). Pollinator studies found similar numbers of bees and bee species, but different bee communities, in restored and remnant sites (action 1408).\n\nRegarding buffer strips alongside watercourses, three studies from the Netherlands and UK reported positive influence on plant, invertebrate and bird diversity or abundance (action 120). However, two studies from France and Ireland found that riparian buffer strips did not result in an increase in plant species numbers compared to farms without buffer strips (action 120).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from studies conducted in Mediterranean countries, the most beneficial tillage practices for increasing soil organic matter in arable fields are:\n\nNo-tillage practices showed the strongest benefits for soil organic matter. A meta-analysis from Mediterranean countries found more organic matter in soils without tillage compared to soils with tillage (action 1369). Fourteen replicated studies from Italy, Spain, and the USA found more organic matter in soils without tillage compared to soils with tillage in some or all comparisons (action 1369). One replicated study from Spain found more organic matter in soils that had not been tilled for a long time compared to a short time (action 1369).\n\nReduced tillage also provides significant benefits. A meta-analysis from multiple Mediterranean countries found more organic matter in soils with reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage (action 1371). Eleven replicated studies from Italy, Spain, Syria, and the USA found more organic matter in soils with reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage in some or all comparisons (action 1371).\n\nWhen comparing no-tillage versus reduced tillage, three replicated studies from Spain found more organic matter in soils with no tillage compared to reduced tillage in some or all comparisons (action 1370).\n\nAdditional practices that enhance soil organic matter include retaining crop residues, which two randomized replicated trials from Australia and China found increases soil organic carbon and nitrogen when residues were retained (action 907). Growing cover crops also benefits soil organic matter, with two controlled trials from India and South Africa finding that soil organic matter increased under cover crops (action 897).\n\nThe use of organic fertilizers instead of inorganic fertilizers provides complementary benefits, with eight replicated studies including one meta-analysis from France, Italy, Spain, Turkey, and Mediterranean countries finding more organic matter in soils with organic fertilizer compared to inorganic fertilizer in some comparisons (action 1366).",

One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention.

    "relevant_summary": "Based on studies from Mediterranean countries including Spain, Italy, Portugal, France, and Israel, several trade-offs of growing cover crops in arable fields have been documented regarding crop yield and water availability.\n\nRegarding crop yield impacts, studies show mixed results. Six replicated, controlled studies from Spain and the USA found lower cash crop yields in plots with winter cover crops compared to plots without them in some comparisons (Action 1351). However, three replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Italy and the USA found higher cash crop yields in plots with winter cover crops compared to plots without them in some comparisons (Action 1351). Eight replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Italy and the USA found inconsistent differences in cash crop yields between plots with or without cover crops (Action 1351). Seven controlled studies from France, Israel, Spain, and the USA found no differences in cash crop yields between plots with or without cover crops (Action 1351).\n\nConcerning water availability, the evidence shows competing effects. Seven replicated, randomized, controlled studies from the USA found less water in soils with winter cover crops compared to soils without them in some or all comparisons, while two studies found more water in soils with winter cover crops in some comparisons (Action 1357). Of two replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Spain, one found that cover crops used more water than bare fallows, and one found no difference in water use (Action 1357). Five controlled studies from France, Israel, Spain, and the USA found that less water was lost through drainage, runoff, or evaporation from plots with cover crops compared to plots without them in some or all comparisons, although one study from Spain found that more water was lost through drainage from plots with winter cover crops in some comparisons (Action 1357). Four replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Spain and the USA found that less nitrate was leached from soils with winter cover crops compared to soils without them in some or all comparisons (Action 1357).\n\nIn Mediterranean vineyard systems, studies from Spain, Italy, Portugal, and France show similar trade-offs. Two replicated, randomized, controlled studies from France and the USA found lower grape yields in plots seeded with grass between vine rows compared to plots with bare soil in some or all comparisons, while six studies from Italy, Portugal, Spain, and the USA found similar grape yields with or without ground cover (Action 1352). Four studies from Spain and the USA found less water or less available water in soils with seeded cover crops compared to tilled soils in some comparisons, while two studies from Portugal and the USA found more water or more available water in soils with ground cover compared to tilled soils in some comparisons (Action 1382). Six replicated, controlled studies from Chile, France, Italy, Spain, and the USA found that less water was lost as runoff from plots with seeded cover crops compared to bare or tilled plots in some or all comparisons (Action 1382).",

Seven controlled studies from France, Israel, Spain, and the USA found no differences in cash crop yields between plots with or without cover crops (Action 1351).\\n\\nConcerning water availability, the evidence shows competing effects. Seven replicated, randomized, controlled studies from the USA found less water in soils with winter cover crops compared to soils without them in some or all comparisons, while two studies found more water in soils with winter cover crops in some comparisons (Action 1357). Of two replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Spain, one found that cover crops used more water than bare fallows, and one found no difference in water use (Action 1357). Five controlled studies from France, Israel, Spain, and the USA found that less water was lost through drainage, runoff, or evaporation from plots with cover crops compared to plots without them in some or all comparisons, although one study from Spain found that more water was lost through drainage from plots with winter cover crops in some comparisons (Action 1357). Four replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Spain and the USA found that less nitrate was leached from soils with winter cover crops compared to soils without them in some or all comparisons (Action 1357).\\n\\nIn Mediterranean vineyard systems, studies from Spain, Italy, Portugal, and France show similar trade-offs. Two replicated, randomized, controlled studies from France and the USA found lower grape yields in plots seeded with grass between vine rows compared to plots with bare soil in some or all comparisons, while six studies from Italy, Portugal, Spain, and the USA found similar grape yields with or without ground cover (Action 1352). Four studies from Spain and the USA found less water or less available water in soils with seeded cover crops compared to tilled soils in some comparisons, while two studies from Portugal and the USA found more water or more available water in soils with ground cover compared to tilled soils in some comparisons (Action 1382). Six replicated, controlled studies from Chile, France, Italy, Spain, and the USA found that less water was lost as runoff from plots with seeded cover crops compared to bare or tilled plots in some or all comparisons (Action 1382).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"1357\",\n    \"1345\",\n    \"1351\",\n    \"1394\",\n    \"1352\",\n    \"1382\"\n  ]\n}"

Planting flower strips increases natural enemy numbers, with studies from Italy and the USA finding more natural enemies in fields with planted flower strips compared to fields without them (Action ID: 1400). Some flower species are more attractive to natural enemies than others, and planting more flower species results in more species of natural enemies over time (Action ID: 1400). Planting hedgerows also increases natural enemy populations, with studies from the USA finding more natural enemies in fields with hedgerows compared to fields with weedy edges, and higher ratios of natural enemies to pests in hedgerows (Action ID: 1401). Additionally, hedgerows result in a higher proportion of pest eggs being parasitized in tomato fields up to 100 meters into the crop (Action ID: 1401). Planting nettle strips in field margins increases the number of aphid predator species, with some insect families including green lacewings only found on nettles (Action ID: 118). Managing ant populations can also enhance natural enemies - excluding ants that protect pests leads to greater parasitism of pests by natural enemies in studies from Japan and the USA (Action ID: 886), while isolating colonies of beneficial ants results in predatory ants occupying more trees and providing better pest control (Action ID: 773). Reduced or no tillage practices in arable fields show some potential, with one study from the USA finding similar numbers of predatory mites in soils with reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage (Action ID: 1399, 1397).

For flower planting, one replicated controlled study from Spain found more pollinators on coriander flowers next to planted flower strips compared to coriander flowers next to unplanted field margins (action 1406, 2468). Additionally, replicated controlled studies from Italy found that bee numbers increased over time in areas planted with three or six flower species, but decreased over time in areas planted with nine flower species (action 2468). Studies from Italy and Spain found more pollinators where more flower species had been planted in some comparisons, but in other comparisons found fewer pollinators where more flower species had been planted (action 1406, 2468). For hedgerows, replicated studies from the USA found more bee species in fields with hedgerows or in hedgerows themselves compared to fields or field edges without hedgerows, and more syrphid fly species in hedgerows compared to field edges without hedgerows (action 1407, 2515). One replicated paired site comparison from the USA found higher crop visitation rates by native bees, but not by honey bees or syrphid flies, in fields next to planted hedgerows compared to fields next to unplanted edges (action 1407, 2515). However, the available evidence contains limited direct comparisons between flowers and hedgerows specifically on Mediterranean farmland, with most hedgerow studies conducted in the USA rather than Mediterranean regions.",
