    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from action documents, acoustic devices deployed on fishing gear show the strongest evidence for effectiveness in reducing human-wildlife conflict, with 19 studies demonstrating significant benefits. Specifically, 14 studies showed reductions in entanglements and unwanted catch, while 6 studies demonstrated reduced damage to fish catches and fishing nets caused by marine mammals. In contrast, acoustic devices on fishing vessels have limited evidence for conflict reduction, with only one study finding no reduction in predation of squid catches by Risso's dolphins, though they did show behavioral effects on marine mammals in 4 studies. Acoustic devices on moorings have moderate evidence for effectiveness, with one study showing reduced harbor seal predation on migrating juvenile salmon and 7 studies demonstrating behavioral changes in marine mammals. The fishing gear deployment appears most effective for directly addressing human-wildlife conflict through reduced bycatch and gear damage, while vessel-based devices primarily affect animal behavior without clearly reducing conflict, and mooring-based devices show intermediate effectiveness with some conflict reduction benefits.",

Survival rates vary by species, with approximately three-quarters of captive-reared Antillean manatees and two-thirds of Florida manatees surviving at least one year post-release. Captive-reared Pacific harbour seal pups showed survival similar to wild pups, and controlled breeding programs have produced viable offspring in some species.\n\nNegative outcomes include high mortality rates during and after rehabilitation, with some studies showing death before or after release, or individuals requiring return to captivity. One review found that most captive-born Amazon river dolphins, narrow-ridged finless porpoises, and Irrawaddy dolphins did not survive in captivity, and one controlled study found at least a quarter of California sea lions treated for toxic algae poisoning and released died or required euthanasia. Some captive-reared individuals displayed problematic post-release behaviors, such as travelling greater distances from release sites and showing reduced diving behaviors compared to wild counterparts, potentially affecting their ability to survive in natural environments. A Yangtze finless porpoise population maintained in semi-captive conditions had notably low genetic diversity.",
