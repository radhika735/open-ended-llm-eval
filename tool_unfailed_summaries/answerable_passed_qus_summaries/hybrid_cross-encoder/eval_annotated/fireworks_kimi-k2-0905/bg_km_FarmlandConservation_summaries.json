    "relevant_summary": "Based on a replicated controlled trial in Northern Ireland, heather Moorland managed through flailing (swiping) to simulate burning had more plant species eight years after management compared to control unflailed plots, but fewer plant species than burned plots (Action 151). The same study found that heather moorland subject to a single controlled burn had more plant species eight years after management than control unburned plots (Action 152). This indicates that while swiping can increase plant diversity compared to no management, controlled burning may be more effective at promoting plant species richness than swiping in UK heather moorland management.\n\nEvidence also suggests that cutting to control bracken can increase the species richness of heathland plant species (Action 1653), though the effects may vary depending on the specific vegetation being managed. Overall, the available evidence suggests that controlled burning appears to be more effective than swiping for maximizing plant diversity in heather moorland management in the UK.",

Impacts included increases in the abundance of Scottish primrose and other broadleaved plant species, heather cover and numbers of true bugs, biomass of arthropods associated with the bird diet, number and diversity of moths and benefits to black grouse. Among other treatments, repeated cutting and grazing by goats were found to be effective in controlling the dominance of certain grass species. A review found management under the Environmentally Sensitive Areas scheme had broadly positive effects on moorland birds and a reduction in grazing benefited most bird species and increased heath vegetation and heather cover. A replicated before-and-after study found that moorland management under the Environmentally Sensitive Area scheme maintained the number of plant species in two out of three areas.\\nThree studies (including one before-and-after trial) reported mixed results for invertebrates or birds, where management to maintain upland heath or moorland benefited some but not all species or where the effect depended on the vegetation type. Treatments tested included reducing grazing intensity and grouse moor management (burning and predator control).\\nFour studies (including one controlled site comparison and two reviews) found that reducing the intensity of livestock grazing reduced the abundance of soil organisms including invertebrates, bacteria or fungi.

Position and orientation are critical - fourteen studies found different occupation or success rates depending on position and orientation, with nest boxes positioned higher above ground showing higher occupancy rates, more eggs, and more hatched young. Habitat context matters significantly, with studies finding that nest success within boxes was related to the amount of pasture available in the surrounding landscape. Predation risk is a major factor, with studies showing that hidden nest sites have higher success rates than easily visible ones, and relocating nest boxes can reduce predation rates. Management practices also influence success - cleaning nest boxes can affect occupancy preferences, though effects vary by species. Competition between species for nest boxes is documented, but providing additional boxes doesn't necessarily reduce competitive interactions. Environmental factors like proximity to water versus land positioning affect wildfowl nest success, and some species show strong preferences for specific habitat types like wetland versus farmland locations.",

Specific studies provide more detailed insights: grasslands restored from bare soil by seeding showed butterfly communities becoming increasingly similar to existing high-quality grasslands over the first 10 years after establishment. One replicated controlled site comparison from Sweden found that plant species richness increased with time since restoration. However, two studies from Germany and the UK found that differences in vegetation between restored and existing species-rich grasslands persisted even nine or 60 years after restoration. For wet grassland restoration, studies found some positive effects within five years, but restoration was often incomplete even after extended periods.

However, one study found no effect on overwinter survival of three stable house sparrow populations, indicating effectiveness may vary by species and population status.\n\nFor wild bird seed mixtures (actions 594, 187, 3930), 21 out of 30 studies found positive effects, including higher abundance, density, species diversity and species richness of birds compared to other farmland habitats. Six studies found birds showed preference for wild bird cover and used it significantly more than other habitats. One study specifically found higher small mammal activity in wild bird cover than in crops during winter, suggesting food resource availability.\n\nThe evidence indicates both interventions can be effective, with wild bird seed mixtures showing more consistent positive results across bird communities, while supplementary food effectiveness may be more species-specific and dependent on factors like population stability and habitat context.",

    "relevant_summary": "The evidence for hedgerow management and planting benefits to farmland wildlife is mixed and varies by species group. For hedge management specifically, ten studies from Switzerland and UK found managing hedges for wildlife resulted in increased berry yields, species diversity or richness of plants and invertebrates, and diversity or abundance of farmland birds (action 116). However, five UK studies found hedge management did not affect plant species richness, bumblebee queen numbers, or farmland birds, with two studies showing mixed or adverse effects including reduced hawthorn berry yield when management involved removing fruit-bearing wood (action 116).\n\nFor birds specifically, seven UK and Swiss studies found some species increased with managed hedges or were more likely to use managed hedges, though one study found no difference in species richness and four UK studies found some species declined or showed no response (action 177). For bats, one UK study found more bat species along hedges trimmed \u22653 years prior compared to recently trimmed hedges, though another study found no difference in pipistrelle activity between wildlife-managed and conventional farm hedges (action 1943).\n\nFor invertebrates, US studies show hedgerows can benefit pollinators with five studies finding more bee species in fields with hedgerows or in hedgerows themselves compared to field edges without hedgerows, and three studies finding more syrphid fly species (action 2515). For predatory invertebrates, one US study found more natural enemies in fields with hedgerows compared to weedy edges (action 2314).\n\nFor mammals, one UK study found establishing hedgerows alongside arable land increased small mammal abundance (action 2383). For reptiles, one Madagascar study found reptile communities in cultivated areas with hedges were more similar to forest communities than those from areas without hedges (action 3519).\n\nSignificant evidence gaps exist, with no studies found evaluating effects of managing hedgerows to benefit mammals (action 2382) or planting new hedges on bats (action 1942).",

However, two replicated trials in the UK found that bumblebee populations were not enhanced on farmland managed under agri-environment schemes at the landscape scale (action 24). For birds, twenty-six European studies found that agri-environment schemes increased population size or density for some species at the farm level, but landscape-scale effects varied (action 700). The Swiss Ecological Compensation Areas scheme, monitored at landscape scale, showed mixed effects with some bird species increasing while others decreased (action 145). A Dutch mosaic management approach within agri-environment schemes showed positive population-level changes for some wading birds like northern lapwing (action 130).",

For species-rich grassland restoration (action 3955), 2 of 5 studies found restored grasslands had lower total abundance of butterflies and day-flying moths compared to unmanaged abandoned grasslands, 2 studies found similar abundance to continuously managed grasslands, and 1 study found higher density of blue-spot hairstreak eggs. Reducing management intensity for butterflies and moths specifically (action 3958) showed 6 of 10 studies found higher species richness in less intensively managed grasslands, 3 studies found higher abundance of butterflies and declining macro-moths, while 4 studies found similar species richness between management types.

Maintaining traditional water meadows was found to increase population sizes or territories of species like northern lapwing, common redshank, and black-tailed godwit. Raising water levels in ditches or grassland was associated with increased bird numbers and breeding bird populations in agricultural landscapes. Mosaic management was particularly effective, changing northern lapwing population trends from decreases to increases and resulting in higher productivity for black-tailed godwits with reduced nest trampling by livestock. Delayed mowing or grazing dates led to increased breeding wading bird densities, though effects varied among species. Per-clutch payment schemes showed mixed results, with some studies finding slightly higher breeding densities of wading birds but no significant effects on overall population sizes over short time periods. Controlled water levels through agri-environment schemes were considered more effective than easier-to-implement options for providing good habitat for wading birds.",
