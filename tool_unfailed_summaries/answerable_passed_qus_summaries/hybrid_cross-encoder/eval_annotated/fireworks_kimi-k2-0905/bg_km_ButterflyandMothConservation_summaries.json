    "provider": "fireworks/fp8",
    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from action documents, both rough grazing and prescribed fire management of semi-natural open habitats show mixed but generally positive effects on butterfly and moth populations, with outcomes varying by species and management intensity.\n\nRough grazing studies: Evidence from 9 studies showed that rough grazing in semi-natural habitats (salt marsh, lowland heath, bog, fen) had variable effects. Community responses showed that lightly grazed saltmarsh had different micro-moth communities than heavily grazed areas, with some studies finding similar species richness between grazed and unmanaged areas, while others found greater species richness with light grazing. Population responses were also mixed - some studies found higher butterfly abundance on grazed fenland and coastal dunes compared to unmanaged areas, while others found lower abundance on grazed meadow steppe. Light sheep grazing specifically showed higher micro-moth abundance compared to moderate/heavy grazing or no grazing. Behavior studies indicated that brown argus and Alcon large blue butterflies were more likely to occupy areas managed by cattle or pony grazing compared to unmanaged land.\n\nPrescribed fire studies: Evidence from 13 studies showed that prescribed burning in grasslands and open habitats also produced variable results. Community composition was generally similar between burned and unburned areas, though one study found lower species richness in patch-burned pastures compared to rotationally grazed ones. Population responses showed that some species (heath fritillary adults, marsh fritillary caterpillars, Fender's blue caterpillars and eggs) had higher abundance after burning, while others (Brenton blue butterfly, rosy marsh moth caterpillars, regal fritillary adults) had lower abundance on burned land. Some prairie specialists were less abundant in burned areas compared to hayed or grazed prairies, while generalist and migrant species showed higher abundance in burned areas. Leaving unburned patches during prescribed burning was beneficial, increasing abundance for 6 out of 9 specialist butterfly species.\n\nBoth management approaches showed species-specific responses, with the effectiveness depending on factors such as grazing intensity, burning frequency, and the presence of refugia (unburned patches in fire management).",

One replicated study from Hungary found that semi-natural grasslands managed by either light grazing or mowing once/year in May or June had a higher abundance of butterflies than conventional wheat fields (action 3908). Multiple European studies demonstrated that old meadows managed through traditional practices had higher species richness of adult butterflies and caterpillars than recently established set-aside areas (action 3908).\n\nSet-aside areas, while showing some benefits over intensive arable farming, had mixed results for butterfly conservation. Studies found that set-aside fields had similar abundance of butterfly and moth adults and caterpillars to uncultivated field boundaries and extensively farmed land (action 3980), but did not consistently outperform semi-natural grasslands. While some set-aside areas sown with less competitive grasses showed higher butterfly abundance than cereal fields, they did not match the conservation value of established species-rich grasslands (action 3980).\n\nThe research demonstrates that restored grasslands from arable land can achieve similar or higher abundance of moths compared to conventional grasslands, but the time since restoration and seed mix composition significantly affects outcomes (action 3929). In contrast, long-established species-rich, semi-natural grasslands maintained through traditional management practices consistently provided more reliable and superior habitat for butterfly communities across multiple European studies.",

Sixty-four individual studies show some benefits to one or more wildlife groups.\\n\\n\\nSixty-five individual studies reported the effects of flower strips on invertebrates. Of these, fifty reported positive effects. Forty-one studies from eight European countries (including five reviews and twenty-three replicated controlled studies, of which one randomized and two site comparisons) found evidence that flower strips had a positive influence on invertebrate numbers with increased abundance, species richness/diversity, or both. Ten studies (nine replicated of which two controlled) found invertebrates visited or foraged on flower strips but did not specify increases/decreases in numbers. Two studies found effects on ground beetles other than changes in numbers. One replicated controlled study showed that ground beetles were more active or had enhanced feeding/reproductive conditions in flower strips. A review found flower strips supported ground beetle species that were rarely found in crops. Fifteen studies reported mixed or negative effects of flower strips on invertebrates. Six studies found no significant effects.\\n\\n\\nTwenty-one studies looked at the effects of flower strips on plants. Sixteen studies from seven European countries (including ten replicated controlled studies of which one randomized) found evidence that flower strips had higher plant cover, number of flowers, diversity, and species richness. One review found flower strips benefited plants but did not specify how. Four studies found negative or no effects of flower strips on the number or diversity of plant species.\\u00a0Five studies described the effects of different margin establishment or management techniques on plants.\\n\\n\\nSeven studies investigated birds and wildflower strips. Four replicated, controlled studies from Switzerland and the UK (two of which were randomized) and one review of European studies found evidence that plots sown with a wildflower or legume seed mix had a positive influence on birds. Flower strips attracted more birds or bird species and the number of birds using flower strips increased over time. Eurasian skylarks preferentially foraged in, and nested in or near, sown weed patches and were less likely to abandon their territories when they included sown weed patches. However one replicated trial in Switzerland found barn owls avoided sown wildflower areas. Two winter recording periods of the same replicated, controlled study in the UK found there were not more bird species or individuals on wildflower plots compared to control margins.\\n\\n\\nAll five studies investigating the effects of wildflower strips on small mammals (four replicated studies from Switzerland and one review of studies from north-western Europe) found evidence that small mammals benefit from strips sown with wildflowers or flowers rich in pollen and nectar, with increases in abundance, density and species richness.

Rearing conditions significantly affect outcomes, with lower densities showing higher survival rates for various species, and temperature playing a crucial role with 20\u00b0C being optimal compared to 25\u00b0C. For ant-associated species, survival varies depending on ant nest characteristics and species. Host plant quality is critical - monarch caterpillars showed different survival on different milkweed species, and some species require specific plant combinations for survival. Long-term captivity can affect butterfly condition, with populations becoming heavier but developing smaller wings over generations. Release success rates are variable, with only 25% of programs surviving >3 years and 8% surviving >10 years, often requiring continued supplementation. Captive-bred individuals frequently show lower survival than wild or translocated counterparts.",

One study in South Africa\\u00a0reported that wild-caught, gravid scarce mountain copper butterflies laid eggs but none hatched.\\nSurvival (14 studies): Five of six studies (including one replicated, controlled study, four controlled studies and one site comparison study) in the UK, the UK and France, Spain, Belgium\\u00a0and Poland\\u00a0found that large copper, large blue, mountain Alcon blue, cranberry fritillary\\u00a0and scarce large blue\\u00a0caterpillars had higher survival rates when reared on plants\\u00a0or in ant nests\\u00a0at a lower than higher density, in ant nests without queens\\u00a0or with winged females\\u00a0present than with queens\\u00a0or without winged females, when reared at 20 \\u00b0C than 25 \\u00b0C, and when reared with ants collected from sites where parasitic butterfly species occur than from sites where parasites do not occur. The sixth study\\u00a0found that mountain Alcon blue caterpillars had a similar survival rate in ant nests with or without queens present. Two of these studies, and one replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the USA, found that the survival of large blue, mountain Alcon blue\\u00a0and monarch\\u00a0caterpillars differed when reared in ant nests of different species\\u00a0or on different species of milkweed. Two site comparison studies in the UK\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0found that large copper\\u00a0and Puget blue\\u00a0eggs had a similar survival rate to the caterpillar\\u00a0and adult\\u00a0stage whether they were laid in captivity or collected from the wild and reared in captivity. One of these studies also found that Puget blue caterpillars kept in refrigerators while overwintering had a lower survival than caterpillars kept in environmental chambers or outside. Three of four studies in South Africa\\u00a0and the UK\\u00a0reported that some wild-collected Brenton blue butterfly, Karkloof blue butterfly\\u00a0and Fishers\\u2019 estuarine\\u00a0moth eggs hatched, survived as caterpillars for three months\\u00a0or to adulthood, bred in captivity\\u00a0and the resulting captive population survived for at least eight generations. The other study reported that wild-collected Brenton blue butterfly eggs hatched in captivity and those caterpillars reared with only Pyllanthus incurvatus leaves died whereas all caterpillars also given Indigofera erecta leaves survived to the fourth instar of development. One study in South Africa\\u00a0reported that wild-caught final instar Cape Peninsula butterfly caterpillars reared in an artificial pugnacious ant nest successfully pupated and became adults, but captive-hatched first instar Cape Peninsula and Riley\\u2019s skolly butterfly caterpillars placed next to a nest did not survive to pupation.\\nCondition (5 studies): Two studies (including one controlled study) in the UK\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0found that adult large white from a population kept in captivity for &gt;25 years were heavier, and had smaller wings, than individuals from a population in its third generation in captivity, and captive-reared Puget blue adults were smaller than wild-caught butterflies. One of these studies also found that Puget blue caterpillars raised in environmental chambers or outdoor enclosures reached a similar size as adults. One replicated, controlled study in Spain\\u00a0found that mountain Alcon blue caterpillars reared in ant colonies with winged females were lighter than caterpillars reared in colonies without winged females. One replicated, controlled study in Israel\\u00a0found that spring webworm caterpillars fed vegetation from cattle-grazed pasture had a similar growth rate to caterpillars fed vegetation from an ungrazed paddock. One study in South Africa\\u00a0reported that Brenton blue butterfly caterpillars reared on Indigofera erecta leaves with no ants became dwarf adults, but those reared on whole Indigofera plants with an ant colony became full-sized adults.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\"\n}"

However, one study found beetle banks managed under agri-environment schemes had higher species richness and abundance of micro-moths compared to conventionally managed margins (3927).\n\nUncropped cultivated margins also show varied effects. Four studies found these margins can increase butterfly abundance in some years, with farms under agri-environment schemes (including uncropped margins) having higher abundance of butterflies and micro-moths compared to conventional farms (3923). However, three studies found similar species richness between farms with and without these management options (3923).\n\nWildflower strips and floristically enhanced margins consistently show positive effects, with 10 of 17 studies finding higher abundance of butterflies and moths compared to conventional margins or cropped fields (3932, 3982).

Clearing patches in forests was found to increase butterfly species richness and abundance compared to unmanaged patches or closed canopy forest, as evidenced by studies showing higher general butterfly abundance and specific species increases (e.g., chequered blue, woodland brown, high brown fritillary, small pearl-bordered fritillary). However, cleared patches showed lower moth species richness than coppiced woodland or mature forest. One UK study found that larger cleared patches supported higher butterfly species richness and abundance than undisturbed forest, while another found both wider and standard width rides had similar macro-moth species richness to mature forest. Woodland coppicing also created habitat for butterflies, with studies showing higher butterfly species richness in coppiced woodland compared to unmanaged woodland, and higher abundance of butterflies generally and heath fritillary specifically. Coppiced woodlands supported different communities of moths and butterflies depending on coppice age, with recent coppice (2-4 years) generally supporting higher abundances than older coppice (>15 years). Both management techniques created habitat heterogeneity important for different species groups.",

A review of UK and Irish translocations found only 25% survived over three years and only 8% survived over 10 years. Translocation outside known native range showed similar patterns: two of three studies reported successful establishment lasting 8-28 years, while one population died out within a year.\n\nThirteen studies on captive breeding programs also showed mixed outcomes. Six studies reported captive-bred populations persisted 2-28 years and increased in abundance, while two studies documented population die-outs within 1-12 years. One review found the same survival statistics as translocations: 25% survival over three years and 8% over 10 years.

    "relevant_summary": "The most effective ways to manage field margins in arable landscapes for increasing butterfly abundance include planting wildflower strips or nectar flower mixtures, which consistently increased both butterfly abundance and species richness compared to conventional field margins and cropped fields (Action ID 3932). Floristically enhanced grass buffer strips with wildflowers also proved effective, showing higher butterfly abundance and species richness than standard grass margins (Action ID 3982). Creating uncultivated margins around intensive arable fields increased butterfly species richness, especially when these margins were not cut in summer and were longer/wider rather than shorter/narrower, though butterfly abundance was sometimes lower than in sown margins (Action ID 3981). Leaving headlands unsprayed (conservation headlands) had positive effects on butterfly species richness and abundance compared to sprayed headlands (Action ID 3898). Wider grass margins (up to 6m) generally supported greater butterfly species richness and abundance than conventional-width margins (Action ID 3982). The key factors for success include: 1) Sowing wildflower or nectar mixtures rather than leaving natural regeneration, 2) Avoiding summer cutting to maintain flowering resources, 3) Creating wider margins where possible, and 4) Reducing pesticide use on headlands and margins.",

One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK\\u00a0found that farms with wildflower strips (along with other enhanced agri-environment scheme options) had a higher abundance of some butterflies, but a lower abundance of other butterflies, than farms with simpler agri-environment scheme management such as grass-only margins. One of two replicated, paired, controlled studies (including one randomized study) in the USA\\u00a0and the UK\\u00a0found that plots sown with one of three wildflower mixes had a higher abundance of moths than plots sown with two other mixes or a single flower species. The other study found that plots sown with either complex or simple flower mixes had a similar abundance of butterflies. One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK\\u00a0found that wildflower plots sown with lucerne\\u00a0had a higher abundance of butterflies than plots sown with borage, chicory or sainfoin.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)\\n\\nUse (2 studies): Two studies (including one replicated study) in the UK\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0reported that sown nectar flower plots\\u00a0and tropical milkweed plots\\u00a0were used by six species of butterflies and moths\\u00a0and monarch butterflies and caterpillars.\"\n}"
