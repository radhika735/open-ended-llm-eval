    "relevant_summary": "Mowing benefits: Cutting/mowing in fen meadows altered overall plant community composition and increased cover of fen- or wet meadow-characteristic plants in multiple studies from Switzerland, Germany, Czech Republic and Poland. Mowing increased total moss or bryophyte cover in four studies from Belgium, Switzerland and Czech Republic. Eight studies in fens and fen meadows across the UK, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Czech Republic and Poland found that mowing increased plant species richness compared to no mowing or grazing. Mowing reduced cover of problematic herbs including bindweed, reeds, sedges, purple moor grass and grass-like plants overall, and reduced shrub cover in some cases.\n\nMowing trade-offs: Some studies found mixed effects on vegetation biomass and structure. Three studies reported that single mowing events had no effect on vegetation height, and two studies found single mows had no effect on bryophyte cover or plant species richness.\n\nGrazing benefits: Two UK studies reported that grazing with cattle or horses increased cover of some herb groups (cottongrasses, sedges or all grass-like plants) and reduced purple moor grass cover in some cases. One UK study found that plant species richness increased after grazing was reinstated. Grazing reduced shrub cover in one UK study.\n\nGrazing trade-offs: One replicated, paired, site comparison study in Germany found that grazed fen meadows contained fewer fen-characteristic plant species and fewer plant species overall than mown meadows. The overall plant community composition differed between grazed and mown fen meadows. Grazing reduced Sphagnum moss cover in one UK study and typically had no effect on shrub cover in another UK study. Two before-and-after studies in UK fens reported that there was typically no effect on plant species richness.",

When peatland surfaces are disturbed without planting, evidence shows that soil disturbance affects plant community development over 2-3 years, with disturbed plots developing greater cover of weedy species from the seed bank, and wetland-characteristic plant species colonizing disturbed areas, though peat-forming species may not colonize.

Cutting/mowing has mixed effects on plant community composition, with some studies finding no significant changes while others report shifts toward target fen communities. For characteristic plants, mowing has been shown to increase cover of fen-characteristic species in several studies from Switzerland, Germany, the Czech Republic, and Poland. Vegetation cover responses vary: four studies in Belgium, Switzerland, and the Czech Republic found mowing increased total moss or bryophyte cover, while studies in Sweden showed mixed effects on Sphagnum moss cover. Cutting problematic herbaceous plants typically increased Sphagnum moss cover while reducing purple moor grass cover. For large tree/shrub management, cutting and removal has been shown to alter plant community composition toward more open fen conditions, with studies in Sweden and the USA reporting increased species richness and cover of fen-characteristic plants. Physical removal of problematic plants such as moss carpets had mixed effects on herb cover and typically reduced total bryophyte and Sphagnum cover in the short term, though effects varied depending on drainage conditions. Tree removal from forest plantations increased herb cover including cottongrasses and sedges, while reducing forest-characteristic moss cover. The timing of cutting/mowing matters: summer mowing increased plant species richness more than spring or autumn mowing in UK fen meadows. Overall plant species richness typically increased with regular mowing regimes across 8 studies from various European fens.",

The only alternative with direct evidence is reducing grazing intensity, which showed greater total vegetation and shrub cover compared to higher intensity grazing, with cottongrass responses varying by species, and higher vegetation biomass where grazing intensity was lower (1735). Changing livestock type, limiting livestock density near peatlands, and changing grazing timing have no direct evaluation studies, so their effectiveness remains unassessed (1736, 1786, 1737). Complete livestock exclusion typically had no effect on herb, moss, or shrub cover in most studies, with effects varying by site conditions - some showing increased shrub cover in drier areas or favoring dry moorland plants (1734). These findings suggest that moderate grazing intensity reduction may be a viable alternative to complete exclusion, though more research is needed on other livestock management modifications.",
