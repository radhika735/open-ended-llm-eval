    "relevant_summary": "Based on controlled studies in the UK, both mowing and turf stripping have been tested for controlling problematic grass in heathland/shrubland habitats, with mixed results. Mowing was found to increase the number of heathland plants in one of two sites, and increased the presence of a minority of heathland plants, but did not change the presence of non-heathland plants (action 1638). One study found that cutting to control purple moor grass reduced vegetation height but had mixed effects on purple moor grass cover and did not alter common heather cover (action 1638). Turf stripping was found to increase the number of heathland plants and decreased the presence of non-heathland plants (action 1647). Both approaches showed similar effectiveness in maintaining heather presence, with one study finding that heather presence was similar in areas where turf was cut compared to areas that were mown (action 1647). Similarly, wavy hair grass presence was not significantly different between turf stripping and mowing treatments (action 1647).",

Regarding impacts on shrubland vegetation, cutting increased the cover or biomass of heather in two studies, but did not increase heather cover or abundance of heather seedlings in two other studies. One study found cutting increased species richness of heathland plant species, while another found it increased species diversity without affecting species richness. Cutting also increased cover of wavy hair-grass and sheep's fescue in one study. Increasing livestock numbers has been proposed as another alternative intervention, but no studies have evaluated its effectiveness for bracken control in shrublands. Cutting and burning has also been suggested, but no studies have evaluated this combined approach either.\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"1653\",\n    \"1659\",\n    \"1655\"\n  ]\n}"

Further observations from these studies included that elk preferred more open, shorter underpasses to those that were enclosed or longer, underpass use was not affected by traffic levels and that mule deer used underpasses less than they used overpasses.

In the UK, studies consistently show that reducing or stopping grazing increases shrub cover or abundance. Two before-and-after trials and one replicated, controlled study in the UK found increased shrub abundance when grazing was reduced. Additionally, two site comparison studies in the UK found that common heather cover declined with high livestock density but increased with low livestock density. In South Africa, one before-and-after trial found that reducing grazing increased shrub abundance. In the Netherlands, a site comparison study found that dwarf shrub cover was higher in ungrazed sites compared to grazed sites. In Spain, a replicated, randomized, before-and-after study found that reducing grazing increased the cover of western gorse. In France, a site comparison study found that ungrazed sites had higher cover of ericaceous shrubs but lower cover of non-ericaceous shrubs compared to grazed sites. However, in the USA, two studies (one randomized controlled trial and one before-and-after trial) found that stopping grazing did not increase shrub abundance. In Namibia and South Africa, one replicated, controlled, paired site comparison study found that reducing livestock numbers increased overall plant cover and the number of plant species. The variations appear to depend on factors such as shrub species type, local climate conditions, soil characteristics, and the specific grazing history of each region.",

Topsoil addition has shown positive effects on heathland/shrubland restoration, with studies in the UK finding increased cover or abundance of heathland plant species, increased seedlings for a majority of heathland plants, and increased forb cover but reduced grass cover. A study in Spain found topsoil addition increased woody plant abundance, while research in Namibia showed increased plant cover and species richness, though still lower than undisturbed sites. Adding topsoil alongside planting/seeding was found to increase grass biomass but reduce forb biomass compared to topsoil alone. Organic matter addition demonstrated benefits including increased young tree species richness in Brazil, increased total plant cover in Portugal, and varied effects on understory plant cover in the USA. Soil amendment using mixed organic and inorganic materials showed increased microbial biomass and activity in five controlled trials from China, India, and Japan, plus increased soil organic carbon and nutrients. Amendment with fresh plant material or crop remains increased soil carbon levels in six studies from China, Denmark, and India, while also improving soil structure and reducing erosion in some cases. Fertilizer addition showed mixed vegetation responses, with most studies finding increased vegetation cover, though effects varied by plant group and species.",

Adding topsoil has demonstrated positive effects on heathland plant species, increasing their cover and abundance (action 1686, 1857). Planting turf from intact heathland sites increased the abundance and cover of heathland species (action 1703). Irrigation of degraded shrublands increased shrub cover (action 1696). Adding fertilizer alongside planting/seeding increased cover of shrubs and trees (action 1704). For heathland restoration specifically, topsoil removal combined with spreading heather litter resulted in higher butterfly abundance compared to sites without litter spreading (action 3946). Transplanting turf increased seedling abundance for a majority of heathland plant species (action 1703). However, one study found that sowing seeds and planting individual plants together did not increase native plant cover compared to either method alone (action 1700).",
