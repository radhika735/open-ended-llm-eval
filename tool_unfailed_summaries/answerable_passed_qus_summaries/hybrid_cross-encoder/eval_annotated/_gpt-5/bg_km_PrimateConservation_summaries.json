Most reintroduced golden lion tamarins born and reared in cages did not survive over seven years or had higher mortality than wild-born tamarins [1594]. A reintroduced chimpanzee population increased over 25 years; all Sumatran orangutans survived at least three months; a majority of reintroduced gorillas survived at least four years; a reintroduced lar gibbon population declined over three years; and a reintroduced rhesus monkey population persisted for at least four years [1590]. Across six studies, a majority of primates survived for two to thirty months, while two studies found a minority survived between three months and 12 years [1590]. Four studies found a majority of reintroduced chimpanzees survived at least one to five years; one controlled study found a reintroduced orangutan population had declined 33 years after reintroduction; one study found a primate population increased five years after reintroduction; and across multiple studies, a minority survived for at least fifteen weeks to seven years while a majority survived for at least two months to one year [1591]. Four studies reported a minority of primates survived between two months and one year after reintroduction as single/multiple individuals [1589].",

One controlled study reported that black-and-white ruffed lemur diets were similar to wild individuals after scarce-period feeding (Madagascar) [1527]. Limited-time feeding: One study reported a chimpanzee population increase after two months of post-reintroduction feeding (Tanzania). One before-and-after study reported a golden lion tamarin population declined after one year following supplementary feeding (Brazil). One study reported an abandoned infant muriqui was retrieved by its mother and rejoined the wild group after feeding (Brazil). Four studies reported that only a minority of reintroduced primates survived (Brazil; Madagascar; South Africa). One study reported the majority of introduced chimpanzees survived for at least 27 months (Guinea). Three studies reported a majority of primates survived reintroduction while being supplementary fed (Gabon; South Africa; Vietnam). Two studies reported the majority of lowland gorillas survived for at least nine months to four years (Gabon; Republic of Congo) [1528].\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"1526\",\n    \"1527\",\n    \"1528\"\n  ]\n}"
