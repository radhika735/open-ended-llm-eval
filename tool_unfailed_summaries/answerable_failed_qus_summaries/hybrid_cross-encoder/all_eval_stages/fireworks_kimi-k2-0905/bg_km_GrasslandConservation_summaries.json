Of these, 20 from Finland, Germany, Lithuania, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK (15 replicated of which eight controlled and three also randomized) found restoring species-rich grassland resulted in higher ground beetle abundance, increased plant species richness, farmland bird abundance, pollinating insect density and diversity and earthworm abundance than other types of grassland, or that restored grasslands had similar abundance and species richness of insects to old traditionally managed sites.\\nSeven studies from Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK (five replicated and controlled, two also randomized) found that efforts to restore species-rich grassland had no clear effect on the species richness or abundance of plants, beetles, or the abundance of butterflies and moths. Three replicated studies from Sweden and the UK (one also controlled and two site comparisons) found that restored grassland had a lower diversity and frequency of certain plant species, and attracted fewer foraging queen bumblebees than continuously grazed or unmanaged grasslands.\\nWe captured 40 studies (including 19 replicated and controlled studies of which six were also randomized, and six reviews) from nine European countries that found ten different techniques used alone or in combinations were effective for restoring species-rich grassland. Effective techniques included: grazing, introducing plant species, hay spreading and mowing.\\nWe found 22 studies from seven European countries that included information on the length of time taken to restore grassland communities (including 16 replicated trials of which nine also controlled and three reviews). Six studies saw positive signs of restoration in less than five years, 11 studies within 10 years and two studies found restoration took more than 10 years. Six studies found limited or slow changes in plant communities following restoration. Two studies from Germany and the UK (one replicated controlled trial) found differences in vegetation between restored and existing species-rich grasslands nine or 60 years after restoration.\"\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "Different seeding strategies in North American grasslands can have several negative impacts on existing native vegetation. When sowing grass seeds specifically, studies have documented reduced abundance of native forb species and reduced abundance of shrub species. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in Hungary found that sowing grass seeds reduced the abundance of grassland species. Additionally, three of four replicated studies found that sowing grass seeds either reduced native grass cover or did not alter native grass density, and two studies found it reduced the abundance of native forb species. Research on sowing native grass and forb seeds showed that while some studies found increased species richness initially, after 3-13 years, species richness did not differ between sown and unsown areas or was lower in sown areas compared to unsown areas. Furthermore, three studies found that species richness was lower in sown areas than in nearby intact grasslands when using native seed mixes. These findings suggest that various seeding approaches, whether using native or non-native species, can potentially suppress existing native vegetation through competition and may not maintain long-term species richness comparable to intact grassland communities.",

    "relevant_summary": "The evidence from multiple studies suggests mixed but generally positive long-term effectiveness of grassland seeding projects. Key findings show that sowing native grass and forb seeds led to long-term improvements in plant community composition, with five of eleven studies finding increased similarity to target communities over time (Action ID: 3432). However, temporal patterns varied: three studies found that species richness was higher during the first year but after 3-13 years, richness did not differ between sown and unsown areas or was lower in sown areas (Action ID: 3432). Similarly, one study found increased forb cover one year after sowing, but after 10 years there was no difference (Action ID: 3432). \n\nFor basic grass seeding, one study found that grass cover was higher two years after sowing compared to unsown areas, but after seven years there was no difference (Action ID: 3397). Regarding vegetation cover, evidence was mixed - some studies found increased vegetation cover while others found no change or variable effects over time (Action ID: 3397). The restoration of species-rich grasslands typically took between 5-10 years to show positive results, with six studies seeing positive signs in less than five years, eleven studies within 10 years, and two studies finding restoration took more than 10 years (Action ID: 133). Two studies found differences in vegetation between restored and existing species-rich grasslands even after 9 or 60 years (Action ID: 133).\n\nSowing local seed sources showed potential for maintaining higher vegetation cover over time compared to non-native seeds, though individual plant density declined (Action ID: 3400). Overall, while grassland seeding can improve plant community composition and vegetation cover in the short to medium term, long-term effectiveness varies depending on seed mix composition, local conditions, and management practices.",

Sowing seeds at a higher density can increase the number of grassland seedlings (Action 3405). Removing vegetation before sowing can increase the germination rate of sown species, while removing both vegetation and leaf litter together can increase seedling numbers for some species (Action 3416). Disturbing soil before seeding, through methods like rotovating or harrowing, can increase plant emergence in most cases (Action 3413). Applying herbicide before sowing seeds can enhance seedling emergence for wildflower species (Action 3418). Removing leaf litter alone may have mixed effects on seedling numbers depending on the species (Action 3414). Timing is also important, with sowing at the start of the growing season (spring) increasing the cover of sown grass and forb species compared to autumn sowing (Action 3407). These interventions focus on creating favorable conditions for seed germination and emergence by reducing competition, improving seed-soil contact, and optimizing environmental conditions.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on studies from European grasslands and other temperate regions, mechanical vegetation removal and soil disturbance techniques have shown documented outcomes when used before seeding in sites with dense existing vegetation. The combination of vegetation removal with mechanical soil disturbance has been found to increase plant species cover and diversity (Action 1274). Specific soil disturbance techniques including rotovating before seeding increased both grass and forb species richness compared to lighter disturbance methods like harrowing (Action 3413). Similarly, more intensive soil preparation through ploughing increased understory plant cover and diversity in multiple studies (Action 1251). Topsoil removal, another intensive technique, increased plant species richness and improved community similarity to intact reference grasslands (Action 3415), while also enhancing survival of planted species. The primary mechanism appears to be reduced competition from existing vegetation, with studies showing that any form of vegetation removal before seeding increased germination rates of sown species (Action 3416). For dealing with dense vegetation specifically, sowing seed in prepared gaps within vegetation showed better establishment success with larger gap sizes (Action 3409). These mechanical and soil disturbance approaches generally showed more consistent positive outcomes for species establishment compared to chemical vegetation control methods.",

Increasing the number of species in seed mixes has been shown to increase the species richness of target plants and sown plant species, though results vary among studies. Using locally sourced grassland seeds is another effective strategy, with studies finding increased plant species richness, higher cover of target plant species, and improved establishment of characteristic plant species compared to commercial seed mixes. Sowing native grass and forbs is a fundamental approach that has shown positive effects on plant species richness and community composition in the majority of studies. For seed density, sowing at higher densities can increase forb species richness, grass cover, and abundance of specific species like thickspike wheatgrass. The use of nurse plants alongside regular seeding is another composition strategy, though results show mixed effects on plant abundance and community composition. These findings suggest that combining multiple composition strategies - using diverse, locally adapted native species at appropriate densities - may provide the best outcomes for grassland restoration projects.",

Thirty-six studies were in Europe, twelve studies were in North America\\u00a0and one study was in New Zealand. One review\\u00a0included studies from Europe, North America and Africa.\\n\\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY (42 STUDIES)\\n\\nCommunity composition (11 studies): Five of 11 studies (10 of which were replicated and/or controlled, and three of which were site comparisons) in the UK, the Czech Republic, Norway\\u00a0and Germany\\u00a0found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased the similarity of plant community composition to that of target communities. Three studies found no increase in community similarity to target communities. Two studies\\u00a0found that over time communities became more similar to those of intact grasslands. One study\\u00a0found that over time areas sown with native grass and forb seeds became more similar to areas that were not sown with seeds.\\nOverall richness/diversity (28 studies): Sixteen of 28 studies (24 of which were controlled and four of which were site comparisons) in Europe, North America\\u00a0and New Zealand\\u00a0found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased overall plant species richness. Seven studies found that there was no change in plant species richness\\u00a0or mixed effects on plant species richness\\u00a0and plant diversity. Three studies\\u00a0found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased plant species richness during the first year, but after 3\\u201313 years, species richness did not differ between sown and unsown areas or was lower in sown areas. One study\\u00a0found that after one year, sowing did not alter plant species richness but after eight years, species richness was higher than in unsown areas. Three\\u00a0studies found that species richness was lower in sown areas than in nearby intact grasslands.\\nCharacteristic plant richness/diversity (9 studies): Six of nine studies (eight of which were replicated and/or controlled, and two of which were site comparisons) in Europe\\u00a0found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased the species richness of characteristic grassland plants. Two studies\\u00a0found no change in the species richness of characteristic grassland plants. One study\\u00a0found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased the species richness of target forbs but not target grasses.\\nSown/planted species richness/diversity (3 studies): Three replicated, paired, controlled studies in the UK\\u00a0and the Czech Republic\\u00a0found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased sown species richness.\\nGrass richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the UK\\u00a0found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased grass species richness in 54% of cases.\\nForb richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the UK\\u00a0found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased forb species richness in 71% of cases.\\nNative/non-target richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in the USA\\u00a0found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased the species richness of native plants.\\n\\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE (24 STUDIES)\\n\\nOverall abundance (8 studies): Three\\u00a0of eight replicated, controlled studies (four of which were randomized and paired) in Europe\\u00a0and North America\\u00a0found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased overall vegetation cover, biomass\\u00a0or density. One study\\u00a0found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased plant species richness during the first 2\\u20137 years, but after eight years, species richness did not differ between sown and unsown areas.\\u00a0Four studies found that there was no change in overall vegetation abundance in all\\u00a0or most cases.\\nCharacteristic plant abundance (5 studies): Three of five replicated studies (four of which were controlled, and one of which was a site comparison) in Europe\\u00a0found that sowing native grass and forb seeds did not alter the cover of characteristic grassland species. The other two studies\\u00a0found an increase in the cover of characteristic or target grassland species.\\nSown/planted species abundance (6 studies): Five\\u00a0of six studies (four of which were replicated and controlled, and two of which were reviews) in Europe, North America, Africa\\u00a0and New Zealand\\u00a0found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased the abundance of sown species in all\\u00a0or most cases. The other study\\u00a0found mixed effects on sown species abundance.\\nGrass abundance (3 studies): Two of three replicated, randomized, controlled studies (two of which were paired) in the Czech Republic\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased the cover of grass species. The other study\\u00a0found no change in the cover of grass species.\\nForb abundance (4 studies): Three of four replicated, randomized, controlled studies (three of which were paired) in the Czech Republic\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased the cover\\u00a0or density\\u00a0of forb species. The other study\\u00a0found that one year after sowing, the cover of forb species increased, but after 10 years it did not differ between sown and unsown areas.\\nNative/non-target species abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in the USA\\u00a0found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased the cover of native plant species.\\nIndividual plant species abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the UK\\u00a0found that sowing native grass and forb seeds did not alter yellow rattle abundance.\\n\\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE (0 STUDIES)\\nOTHER (2 STUDIES)\\n\\nGermination/Emergence (2 studies): One of two replicated, controlled studies (one of which was paired) in the USA\\u00a0and Germany\\u00a0found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased the number of seedlings that emerged.

Three replicated studies from Sweden and the UK (one also controlled and two site comparisons) found that restored grassland had a lower diversity and frequency of certain plant species, and attracted fewer foraging queen bumblebees than continuously grazed or unmanaged grasslands.\\nWe captured 40 studies (including 19 replicated and controlled studies of which six were also randomized, and six reviews) from nine European countries that found ten different techniques used alone or in combinations were effective for restoring species-rich grassland. Effective techniques included: grazing, introducing plant species, hay spreading and mowing.\\nWe found 22 studies from seven European countries that included information on the length of time taken to restore grassland communities (including 16 replicated trials of which nine also controlled and three reviews). Six studies saw positive signs of restoration in less than five years, 11 studies within 10 years and two studies found restoration took more than 10 years.

Mowing before or after seeding can increase germination of grassland plant species (3419), while applying herbicide before seeding increased seedling emergence for five of eight wildflower species and improved sown species richness (3418). Removing vegetation before seeding increased germination rate of sown species (3416), and removing leaf litter had mixed effects on seedling numbers depending on the species (3414). Soil disturbance before seeding increased plant emergence in most cases and improved seedling survival (3413). Adding mulch before seeding increased seedling numbers in most cases (3425), while sowing seeds in prepared gaps within vegetation led to greater cover of sown target plant species when larger gaps were used (3409). Adding topsoil before seeding increased plant species richness and biomass of sown species (3420).",

Local seed sources were also found to maintain or increase vegetation cover over time compared to areas sown with non-native seeds (Action ID: 3400). The evidence indicates that grasslands established with local seed sources developed communities more similar to those of intact grasslands over time (Action ID: 3397).
