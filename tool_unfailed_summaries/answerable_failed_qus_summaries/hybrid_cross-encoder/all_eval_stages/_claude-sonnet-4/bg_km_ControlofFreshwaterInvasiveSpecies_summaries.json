In contrast, physical barriers show documented effectiveness for both species. For Asian clams, gas-impermeable barriers placed across lake bottoms significantly reduced their abundance (action 1117). For Crassula helmsii, lightproof barriers such as black sheeting or carpet strips eradicated or severely reduced plant cover in five UK studies, though progressive recolonization occurred at two sites where initial eradication was reported (action 1294). A combination approach using carpet covering followed by herbicide treatment achieved 80% plant mortality for Crassula helmsii (action 1313). Additionally, mechanical removal methods for Asian clams demonstrated high effectiveness, with suction dredging reducing densities by 96% over two weeks with persistence for a year, and various dredging types achieving 65-95% density reductions and 74-95% biomass reductions (action 1120).",

For Ponto-Caspian gammarids, one replicated laboratory study in Canada found that an introduced parasitic mould reduced populations of an invasive shrimp (Action 1089). However, no evidence was captured for the use of predatory fish (Action 1087) or disease-causing organisms (Action 1090) to control Ponto-Caspian gammarids. For Procambarus crayfish, evidence focuses on predator encouragement rather than parasites or host-specific herbivores. Two replicated controlled studies in Italy found that eels fed on red swamp crayfish and reduced population size, and one replicated controlled study from France found that pike predated red swamp crayfish (Action 1030). A before-and-after study in Switzerland found that introducing predators combined with trapping significantly reduced red swamp crayfish populations in a pond, and a replicated controlled study from Italy demonstrated that trapping and predation in combination was more effective than predation alone (Action 1031). Regarding host-specific herbivores, no evidence was captured for their use against these specific invertebrate species. A replicated laboratory and field study in South America examined a South American weevil on floating pennywort, finding it caused more feeding lesions than on other plant species, but field results showed the weevil did not reduce floating pennywort biomass (Action 1123). No evidence was found for biological control using herbivores on other invasive plant species (Actions 1098, 1277). No studies were found that evaluated the effects of using biological control to manage invasive or problematic species on marine and freshwater mammal populations (Action 2852).",

Herbicide type appears critical, as demonstrated by skunk cabbage studies where 2,4-D Amine at 9 litres/ha successfully eradicated skunk cabbage while glyphosate was unsuccessful at eradicating the same species, achieving only limited reduction in growth (Action 1102). For water primrose, herbicide concentration affects outcomes, with triclopyr TEA at 0.25% concentration achieving 100% mortality of young cultivated plants within two months (Action 1139). The addition of adjuvants enhances effectiveness, as shown in water primrose control where glyphosate achieved 97% mortality when mixed with a non-oil based sticking agent and 100% mortality when combined with TopFilm (Action 1139). Plant age and development stage influence control success, with young water primrose plants showing complete mortality to triclopyr TEA treatment (Action 1139). Combination approaches may improve outcomes, as demonstrated where glyphosate with Cygnet-Plus surface active agent followed by mechanical removal achieved 75% kill rate of water primrose (Action 1140), and combining herbicide application with physical removal and other actions like native plant promotion achieved 85-90% reduction in Peruvian primrose-willow coverage (Action 1140).

Herbicide type appears critical, as demonstrated by skunk cabbage studies where 2,4-D Amine at 9 litres/ha successfully eradicated skunk cabbage while glyphosate was unsuccessful at eradicating the same species, achieving only limited reduction in growth (Action 1102). For water primrose, herbicide concentration affects outcomes, with triclopyr TEA at 0.25% concentration achieving 100% mortality of young cultivated plants within two months (Action 1139). The addition of adjuvants enhances effectiveness, as shown in water primrose control where glyphosate achieved 97% mortality when mixed with a non-oil based sticking agent and 100% mortality when combined with TopFilm (Action 1139). Plant age and development stage influence control success, with young water primrose plants showing complete mortality to triclopyr TEA treatment (Action 1139). Combination approaches may improve outcomes, as demonstrated where glyphosate with Cygnet-Plus surface active agent followed by mechanical removal achieved 75% kill rate of water primrose (Action 1140), and combining herbicide application with physical removal and other actions like native plant promotion achieved 85-90% reduction in Peruvian primrose-willow coverage (Action 1140).

For Ponto-Caspian gammarids, dewatering habitat by lowering water levels in sand killed three species of invasive freshwater shrimp, though one species required water content levels of 4% and below before being killed (Action ID: 1094). Chemical treatment methods have been tested but with limited field applicability - iodine solution, acetic acid, Virkon S and sodium hypochlorite killed invasive killer shrimp in laboratory conditions but were considered impractical for field application, while methanol, citric acid, urea, hydrogen peroxide and sucrose did not kill invasive killer shrimp (Action ID: 1095). For red swamp crayfish, the natural pyrethrum Pyblast at 0.05 mg/l concentration was effective but application to drained crayfish burrows was not effective (Action ID: 1036). Changing water salinity showed mixed results, with one study finding increased salinity killed the majority of invasive shrimp within five hours while another found it did not kill invasive killer shrimp (Action ID: 1091). Movement control can be achieved through water exposed to predatory fish, which slowed down or stopped movements of invasive freshwater shrimp, and carbonating water was found to stun invasive killer shrimp (Action ID: 1088).

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from action documents, several non-chemical management strategies for controlling invasive red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) in European ponds have been studied. Creating barriers has shown effectiveness, with a study from Spain (2007-2010) finding that concrete dams designed with features to prevent red swamp crayfish from crawling over them were effective at containing population spread upstream (Action 1037). Trapping and removal methods have been tested, with an Italian study finding that traps baited with food (tinned meat) were most effective at capturing red swamp crayfish compared to pheromone baits or no bait, with over half of all crayfish caught in food-baited traps (Action 1029). Encouraging predators shows promise, with studies from Italy demonstrating that eels can reduce red swamp crayfish population size by feeding on them, and a French study showing that pike also predate on red swamp crayfish (Action 1030). The combination of trapping with predator encouragement appears particularly effective, with a Swiss study showing significant population reduction when introducing predators combined with trapping, and an Italian study demonstrating this combination was more effective than predation alone (Action 1031). Male sterilization represents another potential approach, with an Italian laboratory study finding that X-ray exposure of male red swamp crayfish reduced offspring production by 43% (Action 1032). However, several strategies including draining waterways (Action 1034), electrofishing (Action 1035), and food source removal (Action 1033) currently lack sufficient research evidence to assess their effectiveness.",

For crayfish control, one before-and-after study conducted between 2007 and 2010 in Spain found that concrete dams across a stream, specifically designed with features to prevent red swamp crayfish from crawling over them, were effective at containing spread of the population upstream (action 1037). For aquatic plant control, evidence exists for lightproof barriers. Five before-and-after studies in the UK found that covering Crassula helmsii with black sheeting or carpet strips eradicated or severely reduced the cover of the plant, however C. helmsii was reported to have progressively recolonized two of the sites where it had been initially reported as eradicated (action 1294). One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in iris-invaded lakeshore marshes in Canada reported that covering plots with rubber sheeting after cutting back yellow iris prevented most vegetation regrowth in an intermittently flooded marsh, but had no clear effect in a permanently flooded marsh (action 3124). For parrot's feather control, no evidence was found for the use of lightproof barriers (action 1576). Barriers are also used to protect planted vegetation from interference, with studies showing that fences or barriers protecting freshwater wetlands planted with non-woody plants increased plant survival rates over 12-18 months after planting and affected plant community composition (action 3328).",

A study in Western Australia found that following a two-week program of physical removal of floating pennywort, the rate of growth exceeded the rate of removal (Action 1126). A study in the UK found that removal using a mechanical digger and monthly picking by hand greatly reduced the cover of floating pennywort but did not completely eradicate it (Action 1126). Chemical herbicide control shows varying effectiveness depending on the specific herbicide used. A controlled, replicated study in the UK found that the herbicide 2,4-D amine applied at 4.2 kg/ha achieved near to 100% mortality, compared with the herbicide glyphosate applied at 2.2 kg active ingredient/ha (without an adjuvant) which achieved negligible mortality (Action 1127). Combination treatments can be effective, as a before-and-after study in Western Australia found that a combination of cutting followed by glyphosate chemical treatment removed floating pennywort (Action 1128). Novel chemical methods have shown limited success. A controlled, replicated pilot study in The Netherlands found that hydrogen peroxide sprayed on potted floating pennywort plants resulted in curling and transparency of the leaves when applied at the highest tested concentration (30%), but this was still not sufficient to kill the plant (Action 1129). Physical flame treatment shows promise, as a controlled, replicated, pilot experiment in 2010 in The Netherlands found that flame treatments of 1, 2 or 3 seconds had a significantly negative and progressive impact on floating pennywort, and a 3 second repeat treatment after 11 days proved fatal (Action 1131).",
