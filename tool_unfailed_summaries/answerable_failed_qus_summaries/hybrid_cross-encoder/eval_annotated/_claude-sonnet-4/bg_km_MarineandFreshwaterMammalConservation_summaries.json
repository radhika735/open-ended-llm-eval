    "relevant_summary": "Actions to reduce predation by marine mammals at aquaculture systems include replacing or repairing damaged anti-predator nets, which one study found resulted in fewer salmon losses to harbour seal predation when nets were replaced more frequently at salmon farms (Action 2774). Acoustic devices can be used at aquaculture systems, with studies showing that four of six studies found acoustic devices reduced predation on caged salmon by grey seals, harbour seals and South American sea lions, or reduced the number of harbour seals approaching fish cages, though two studies found they did not reduce harbour seal predation or affect common bottlenose dolphin behavior around fin-fish farms (Action 2775). Translocating mammals away from aquaculture systems has been attempted, though studies found that more than half or nearly all of Australian and New Zealand fur seals translocated away from salmon farms returned (Action 2776). Other potential actions include modifying anti-predator nets around aquaculture systems, minimizing food waste at aquaculture systems, and introducing regulations to prevent the use of harmful deterrents, though no studies were found evaluating the effectiveness of these approaches (Actions 2743, 2744, 2746).",

Deploying fishing gear at different depths proved effective, with one controlled study in the Arafura Sea finding that fishing nets deployed 4.5 m below the water surface had fewer entanglements of dolphins than surface nets (Action 2793). Acoustically reflective fishing gear materials demonstrated mixed but promising results, with two of three controlled studies in the North Sea, Bay of Fundy and South Atlantic Ocean finding that fishing nets made from acoustically reflective materials (iron-oxide or barium sulfate) had fewer entanglements of harbour porpoises than conventional fishing nets, though one study found that barium sulfate nets did not reduce dolphin entanglements (Action 2807). Catch and hook protection devices showed effectiveness for certain species, with one study in the South Pacific Ocean finding that using cage or chain devices on fishing hooks resulted in fewer unwanted catches of toothed whales (Action 2821). However, several other modification approaches showed no evidence of effectiveness: stiffened materials or increased tension in fishing nets did not reduce Franciscana dolphin entanglements in one controlled study in the South Atlantic Ocean (Action 2801). Several potential modifications including biodegradable fishing gear, weakened fishing gear, smaller mesh sizes, and limiting fishing gear length have no available studies evaluating their effectiveness on marine mammal populations (Actions 2885, 2797, 2802, 2795).",

    "relevant_summary": "Studies have documented several population-level effects of legal protection for marine mammals and their habitats. Legal habitat protection showed positive population responses in four studies across different regions (action ID 2915). One study in the North Atlantic Ocean found that Mediterranean monk seal populations increased during eight years after their inhabited islands were legally protected (action ID 2915). Another study in the South Pacific Ocean found that Hector's dolphin survival rates were higher after a coastal area was legally protected than before protection (action ID 2915). However, one study in the North Sea found that bottlenose dolphin population size remained similar before and after part of their range was protected (action ID 2915). A study in the Port River estuary found that after legal protection, similar numbers of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin strandings were recorded compared to before protection, but human-caused strandings decreased (action ID 2915).\n\nProhibiting hunting of marine mammal species demonstrated strong population effects in five studies (action ID 2780). Four of five studies found that after hunting was prohibited, harbor seal and humpback whale abundance increased over 7-30 years in the Kattegat and Skagerrak Seas, South Pacific Ocean, North Atlantic Ocean, and Southern Ocean (action ID 2780). One review covering the North Atlantic Ocean, North Pacific Ocean and Southern Hemisphere found significant increase rates for 10 of 12 baleen whale populations during 7-21 years after legislation prohibiting hunting was introduced (action ID 2780). However, one study found that mature male sperm whale numbers did not differ significantly before or 31 years after hunting was prohibited (action ID 2780).\n\nProhibiting activities that cause disturbance in sensitive areas showed positive effects in limited studies (action ID 2917). One study in the Kattegat Sea found that harbor porpoise activity increased at a stony reef after fishing was prohibited and the reef was restored (action ID 2917). One study in the Indian Ocean found that a beach with fully prohibited human access had fewer Australian sea lions showing aggression or retreating compared to a beach with partial access restrictions (action ID 2917).\n\nNo studies were found that evaluated the effects of directly legally protecting marine and freshwater mammal species (action ID 2923), enforcing existing legislation for habitat protection (action ID 2916), or establishing networks of legally protected areas (action ID 2913).",

For population re-establishment goals in the North Pacific Ocean, four studies on Hawaiian monk seals showed positive outcomes: 50-83% of translocated seal pups survived for at least one year, with translocated pups having similar survival rates to non-translocated pups born at release sites or greater survival rates than non-translocated pups remaining at the original site. More than a quarter of translocated Hawaiian monk seals reproduced, and more than a quarter survived when translocation was combined with at least seven other survival enhancement interventions. Translocated Hawaiian monk seal pups also showed similar dispersal times to non-translocated seal pups born at release sites (Action ID: 2930). In contrast, for human-wildlife conflict reduction goals in the Tasman Sea and Southern Ocean around Tasmania, two studies found that translocation was less effective: more than half or nearly all of Australian and New Zealand fur seals translocated away from salmon farms returned to the original location (Action ID: 2776).",

For rehabilitated and released injured, sick or weak marine mammals, 21 studies found that 10-100% of dolphins, porpoises, whales, seals, sea lions and manatees survived during post-release monitoring periods ranging from three days to five years (Action 2925). For rescued and released stranded or trapped marine mammals, seven studies found that 17-100% of Atlantic white-sided dolphins, short-beaked common dolphins, common bottlenose dolphins, long-finned pilot whales, short-finned pilot whales, and Cape fur seals survived during post-release monitoring periods ranging from three weeks to three years (Action 2924). \n\nSpecific long-term survival evidence includes: more than a quarter of rehabilitated and released Hawaiian monk seals reproduced (Action 2925), a stranded common bottlenose dolphin was observed with a calf a year later after rescue and release (Action 2924), and more than a quarter of Hawaiian monk seals survived after rescue, release and other interventions (Action 2924). For hand-reared orphaned mammals, approximately three-quarters of Antillean manatees and two-thirds of Florida manatees that were captive-reared and released were known to survive for at least one year, with some surviving for more than seven years (Action 2926). Captive-reared and released Pacific harbour seal pups had similar survival estimates to wild pups (Action 2926). For captive-bred releases, two of three Antillean manatees and two of 14 Florida manatees born in captivity survived for at least one year without further intervention (Action 2933).",

    "relevant_summary": "Several actions are available to reduce human-wildlife conflict at commercial fisheries in riverine systems based on documented studies:\n\nPHYSICAL BARRIERS: Installing barriers at wild fisheries has been tested, though one study in the Puntledge River found that installing a 'cork line' barrier did not deter harbour seals from feeding on salmon released from a hatchery (Action 2824). Anti-predator nets can be effective when properly maintained - replacing anti-predator nets more frequently at salmon farms resulted in fewer salmon losses to harbour seal predation according to one study in the North Atlantic Ocean (Action 2774).\n\nACOUSTIC DETERRENTS: Acoustic devices show mixed effectiveness. At aquaculture systems, four of six studies found that acoustic devices reduced predation on caged salmon by grey seals, harbour seals and South American sea lions, or reduced the number of harbour seals approaching fish cages, though two studies found no effect on harbour seal predation or dolphin presence (Action 2775). On fishing gear, acoustic devices showed better results - nine studies found they resulted in fewer entanglements of harbour porpoises, Franciscana dolphins, beaked whales and small cetaceans, and five of six studies found they reduced damage to fish catches and fishing nets caused by dolphins and seals (Action 2808). On fishing vessels, acoustic devices had limited success for conflict reduction, with only one study finding no reduction in predation of squid catches by dolphins (Action 2815).\n\nLIGHTING MODIFICATIONS: Switching off artificial lighting at wild fisheries was tested in one study in the Puntledge River, but did not deter harbour seals from feeding on salmon released from a hatchery (Action 2825).\n\nTRANSLOCATION: Translocating mammals away from aquaculture systems has limited long-term effectiveness, as studies in the Tasman Sea found that more than half or nearly all of translocated Australian and New Zealand fur seals returned to salmon farms (Action 2776).\n\nREGULATORY APPROACHES: Two regulatory actions to prevent harmful deterrents at aquaculture systems and wild fisheries exist but have no documented studies evaluating their effectiveness (Actions 2746, 2779).",

    "relevant_summary": "The non-lethal alternatives for managing marine mammal presence and predation at aquaculture facilities include acoustic devices, anti-predator nets, translocation, and diversionary feeding. Acoustic devices at aquaculture systems showed mixed effectiveness across six studies in the North Atlantic Ocean, Chile, and Mediterranean Sea - four studies found that acoustic devices reduced predation on caged salmon by grey seals, harbour seals and South American sea lions, or reduced the number of harbour seals approaching fish cages, while two studies found no reduction in harbour seal predation or in the presence of common bottlenose dolphins around fin-fish farms (Action 2775). Anti-predator nets are used as physical barriers, with one study in the North Atlantic Ocean finding that replacing anti-predator nets more frequently at salmon farms resulted in fewer salmon losses to harbour seal predation (Action 2774). However, no studies were found evaluating the effects of modifying anti-predator nets around aquaculture systems (Action 2743). Translocation of mammals away from aquaculture systems was evaluated in two studies in the Tasman Sea and Southern Ocean, but showed limited effectiveness as more than half or nearly all of Australian and New Zealand fur seals translocated away from salmon farms returned (Action 2776). Diversionary feeding to reduce nuisance behaviour and human-wildlife conflict was studied with mammals, with two studies in the USA finding that diversionary feeding reduced nuisance behaviour by black bears (Action 2323). Other potential alternatives include minimizing food waste at aquaculture systems and modifying aquaculture gear, but no studies were found evaluating their effects on marine and freshwater mammal populations (Actions 2744, 2742). Installing barriers at wild fisheries showed poor results, with one study finding that a cork line barrier did not deter harbour seals from feeding on salmon released from a hatchery (Action 2824).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence from action documents, several non-lethal methods have been evaluated for reducing human-wildlife conflict involving seals at wild fisheries:\n\nPhysical modifications to fishing equipment: Action 2822 found that installing steel rods on lobster pots or metal frames on fishing pots reduced the number of Australian sea lion pups or grey seals and harbour seals that entered or became trapped in pots. Action 2822 also showed that installing wire grids or steel bars on fishing trap-nets or bag-nets, along with strengthened netting or other modifications to prevent seal access, reduced damage to salmon catches by seals. Action 2823 demonstrated that installing exclusion and/or escape devices on trawl nets reduced the number of trapped or entangled Antarctic fur seals, and that fewer fur seals died in exclusion devices with large escape openings than in those with small openings.\n\nAcoustic deterrents: Action 2808 found that using acoustic devices on fishing nets resulted in seals approaching nets less closely, having fewer encounters or interactions with nets, or reduced activity and sightings in the surrounding area. Action 2808 also showed that acoustic devices reduced damage to fish catches and/or fishing nets caused by seals. Action 2816 found that deploying an acoustic device on a mooring reduced the number of harbour seals feeding on migrating juvenile salmon. Action 2816 also showed that deploying acoustic devices on moorings reduced numbers of grey and harbour seals.\n\nMethods with limited effectiveness: Action 2824 found that installing a 'cork line' barrier did not deter harbour seals from feeding on salmon released from a hatchery. Action 2825 found that switching off artificial lights on a bridge did not deter harbour seals from feeding on salmon released from a hatchery. Action 2806 found that attaching acrylic beads next to fishing hooks did not reduce predation on fish catches by sperm whales.",

Fishing nets can be made from acoustically reflective materials containing iron-oxide or barium sulfate, with two of three controlled studies showing fewer harbour porpoise entanglements compared to conventional nets (action 2807). Fishing gear can be deployed at different depths, with one study showing that nets deployed 4.5 m below the water surface had fewer dolphin entanglements than surface nets (action 2793). Exclusion and/or escape devices can be installed on fishing nets, with studies showing reduced trapped or entangled Antarctic fur seals and common bottlenose dolphins, and that larger escape openings resulted in fewer fur seal deaths than smaller openings (action 2823). Different twine types can be used in trawl nets, with studies examining effects of twine thickness and construction material on selectivity (action 2710).

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence, several management actions can reduce disturbance to marine mammals from tourism and recreational activities: Introducing and enforcing regulations for marine and freshwater mammal watching tours has been shown to be effective, with four studies demonstrating that when whale-watching vessels followed approach regulations, fewer sperm whales and humpback whale pods changed their behaviours or avoided vessels compared to when regulations were not followed (Action 2838). Similarly, when tour boats followed approach regulations, fewer Guiana dolphins displayed negative behaviours such as moving away, diving, or group separation (Action 2838). Additionally, when boats approached seal colonies to 75 meters versus 25 meters, more seals remained on shore (Action 2838). Setting and enforcing vessel speed limits has proven beneficial for marine mammal survival, with studies showing fewer manatee deaths after speed limits were set and enforced in all areas, and fewer North Atlantic right whale deaths caused by collisions when vessel speed limits were set during specific periods in key habitats (Action 2777). Other potential management actions include creating designated areas or access points for recreational activities (Action 2842), introducing permits or licences for recreational watersports (Action 2841) and marine mammal watching tours (Action 2839), developing regulations for operating vessels around mammals (Action 2758), delaying or ceasing operations if marine mammals are detected within specified zones (Action 2898), and controlling human activity in marine protected areas with zonation systems (Action 2674), though no studies were found evaluating the effectiveness of most of these actions on marine mammal populations.",

For population re-establishment or boosting native populations, four studies found that 50-83% of translocated Hawaiian monk seal pups survived for at least one year, with 52% of rehabilitated and translocated seals also surviving one year (Action 2930). Translocated seal pups had similar survival rates to non-translocated pups born at release sites or greater survival rates than non-translocated pups remaining at the original site, and more than a quarter of translocated seals reproduced (Action 2930). Translocated Hawaiian monk seal pups had similar dispersal times to non-translocated seal pups born at release sites (Action 2930). For translocation away from contaminated sites, one study found that most sea-otters survived for the duration of monitoring and most did not return to their capture location (Action 2542). For stress reduction during translocation, one study found that using tranquilizers did not increase post-release survival of European rabbits (Action 2465). For rehabilitation and release, 10-100% of dolphins, porpoises, whales, seals, sea lions and manatees released after rehabilitation survived during post-release monitoring periods ranging from three days to five years (Action 2925). More than a quarter of rehabilitated and released Hawaiian monk seals reproduced (Action 2925). Some rehabilitated animals showed similar movements and behaviors to wild mammals, while others showed behavioral differences such as traveling further from shore and making shorter, shallower dives (Action 2925). For captive-bred releases, two of three Antillean manatees and two of 14 Florida manatees born in captivity and released survived for at least one year without further intervention (Action 2933). However, no studies were found evaluating effects of translocation before onset of impactful activities, translocation to reduce disease exposure, or relocation following oil spills (Actions 2931, 2859, 2872, 2871).",

For captive-bred releases, two of three Antillean manatees and two of 14 Florida manatees born in captivity and released survived for at least one year without further intervention (Action 2933). However, no studies were found evaluating effects of translocation before onset of impactful activities, translocation to reduce disease exposure, or relocation following oil spills (Actions 2931, 2859, 2872, 2871).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"2930\",\n    \"2542\",\n    \"2465\",\n    \"2925\",\n    \"2933\",\n    \"2931\",\n    \"2859\",\n    \"2872\",\n    \"2871\"\n  ]\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, several interventions have shown effectiveness for reducing marine mammal bycatch in Australian fisheries. Acoustic devices on fishing gear have been extensively studied and show promising results, with 14 studies demonstrating reduced entanglements of harbour porpoises, Franciscana dolphins, beaked whales and small cetaceans when acoustic devices were used on cod traps or fishing nets (Action 2808). In Australian waters specifically, studies in Moreton Bay, the Rainbow Channel and the Indian Ocean found that acoustic devices on fishing nets resulted in marine mammals approaching nets less closely and having fewer encounters (Action 2808). Deploying fishing gear at different depths has proven effective in Australian waters, with one controlled study in the Arafura Sea finding that fishing nets deployed 4.5 m below the water surface had fewer entanglements of dolphins than surface nets (Action 2793). Establishing handling and release protocols for captured mammals has shown measurable benefits, with one before-and-after study in the Great Australian Bight finding that introducing a code of conduct for releasing dolphins trapped in nets, along with avoiding dolphins during fishing, resulted in lower mortality of short-beaked common dolphins (Action 2829). Move-on rules for fishing vessels when mammals are encountered have demonstrated effectiveness in Australian waters, with the same Great Australian Bight study showing that measures to delay or relocate fishing if dolphins were encountered, along with releasing trapped dolphins, resulted in fewer short-beaked common dolphins being encircled and killed (Action 2790). Catch and hook protection devices have shown mixed results, with studies in the South Pacific Ocean (including Australia) finding that cage or chain devices on fishing hooks resulted in fewer unwanted catches of toothed whales, though effectiveness varied by device type (Action 2821). Acoustic devices on fishing vessels have been tested in Australian waters, with studies in the Rainbow Channel and Keppel Bay showing that acoustic devices deployed alongside vessels reduced surfacing and echolocation rates and time spent foraging or socializing of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins and Australian snubfin dolphins (Action 2815).",

    "relevant_summary": "The evidence for mitigating seal predation differs significantly between aquaculture systems and wild fisheries in terms of available research and effectiveness of interventions. For aquaculture systems, the evidence shows that replacing anti-predator nets more frequently at salmon farms resulted in fewer salmon losses to harbour seal predation (Action 2774). Acoustic devices at aquaculture systems demonstrated mixed effectiveness, with four of six studies showing that using acoustic devices at salmon farms reduced predation on caged salmon by grey seals, harbour seals and South American sea lions, while two studies found that acoustic devices did not reduce harbour seal predation at salmon farms (Action 2775). Translocation of mammals away from aquaculture systems showed limited effectiveness, with more than half or nearly all of Australian and New Zealand fur seals translocated away from salmon farms returning (Action 2776). For wild fisheries, the evidence is more limited and shows different patterns. Modifying fishing pots and traps to exclude mammals showed positive results, with studies finding that installing steel rods on lobster pots or metal frames on fishing pots reduced the number of Australian sea lion pups or grey seals and harbour seals that entered or became trapped in pots, and that installing wire grids or steel bars on fishing trap-nets reduced damage to salmon catches by seals (Action 2822). Acoustic devices on moorings in wild fisheries showed variable effectiveness, with one randomized controlled study finding that deploying an acoustic device on a mooring reduced the number of harbour seals feeding on migrating juvenile salmon, while other studies showed mixed results on marine mammal behavior (Action 2816). However, installing barriers at wild fisheries and switching off artificial lighting at wild fisheries both showed no effectiveness, with studies finding that these measures did not deter harbour seals from feeding on salmon released from a hatchery (Actions 2824, 2825). Notably, no studies were found evaluating regulations to prevent harmful deterrents in either aquaculture systems or wild fisheries (Actions 2746, 2779).",
