However, one study in the USA found that bullfrog populations can rebound rapidly after the intensive removal of adults (1045). The shooting of metamorphosed individuals, as part of a combination treatment, was found to significantly reduce the number of recorded adults and juveniles in one study in France (1045). For the removal of juveniles, double fyke nets were found to be effective in catching bullfrog tadpoles in small shallow ponds in a Belgian study (1046), and a study in France showed a significant reduction in recorded adults and juveniles following the removal of juveniles by trapping as part of a combination treatment (1046). The removal of American bullfrogs has been shown to benefit native species, with one study in the USA finding it significantly increased a population of California red-legged frogs, and another study in the USA and Mexico showing it increased the range of leopard frogs (825). No evidence was found to support the effectiveness of pond destruction (1043) or the collection of egg clutches (1047) for American bullfrog control.\n\nFor red-eared terrapins, no evidence was captured on the effectiveness of several removal methods, including draining invaded waterbodies (1057), using biological control with native predators (1056), or using sniffer dogs for search and removal (1058).",
