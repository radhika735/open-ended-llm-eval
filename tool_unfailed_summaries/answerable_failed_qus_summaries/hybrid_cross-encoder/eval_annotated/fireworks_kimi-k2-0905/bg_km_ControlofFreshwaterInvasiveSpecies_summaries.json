Only one replicated laboratory study in Canada found that an introduced parasitic mould reduced populations of an invasive shrimp (Action ID: 1089). No evidence was captured for using predatory fish to control Ponto-Caspian gammarids (Action ID: 1087) or for using disease-causing organisms to control them (Action ID: 1090).\n\nMore broadly, no studies were found that evaluated the effects of using biological control to manage non-native, invasive or other problematic species populations on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations (Action ID: 2172) or marine and freshwater mammal populations (Action ID: 2852).

Evidence indicates that trapping with food bait (tinned meat) is more effective than using pheromones or unbaited traps, with over half of all crayfish caught in food-baited traps (Action 1029). Creating physical barriers using concrete dams specifically designed with features to prevent crayfish from crawling over them has been shown to effectively contain population spread upstream in Spain (Action 1037). Combining trapping with predator encouragement has demonstrated significant population reductions - a Swiss study found that introducing predators combined with trapping significantly reduced crayfish populations, and an Italian study showed this combination was more effective than predation alone (Action 1031). Natural predation by eels has been shown to reduce crayfish populations in Italian studies, and pike also predate on red swamp crayfish according to French research (Action 1030). Sterilization of males through X-ray exposure reduced offspring production by 43% in laboratory studies (Action 1032).

However, one study found that bullfrog populations rapidly rebounded following intensive removal of adults (action 1045).\n\nFor red-eared terrapins, Aranzadi turtle traps were found effective for trapping adults from rivers in Spain, though they did not eradicate the population (action 1055). Sein nets were used to trap adults and juveniles in the British Virgin Islands but were not successful in eradicating the population (action 1055). Draining invaded waterbodies was considered as a removal technique for red-eared terrapins but no evidence was found on its impact on population reduction (action 1057).\n\nBoth species showed rapid population recovery following removal efforts, indicating that sustained and repeated removal efforts are necessary for effective control.",
