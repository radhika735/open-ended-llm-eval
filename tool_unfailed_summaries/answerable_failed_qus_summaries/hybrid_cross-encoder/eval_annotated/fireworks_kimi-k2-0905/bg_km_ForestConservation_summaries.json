    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence found in the action documents, alternative harvesting methods like shelterwood and partial retention harvesting show several documented effects compared to clearcutting in European and North American forests. Studies from Sweden and the USA found that shelterwood harvesting resulted in higher plant diversity, lower grass cover, and higher density of tree species compared to clearcutting. Research across multiple countries including Australia, Iran, Nepal, and the USA found that shelterwood harvesting increased abundance, species richness and diversity of understory plants, as well as the growth and survival rate of young trees in six of seven studies, though one study found negative effects. For wildlife impacts, studies in the USA found that shelterwood harvesting and group harvesting resulted in smaller reductions in salamander populations compared to clearcutting, with shelterwood showing higher or initially higher salamander abundance. However, both shelterwood harvesting and group harvesting still decreased salamander abundance compared to unharvested forests in most cases. Research on butterflies and moths found that shelterwood harvesting maintained higher species richness and faster recovery of moth populations compared to clearcutting. Regarding forest structure, Canadian studies found that partial retention harvesting decreased the density of young trees compared to clearcutting. Studies on mammals showed that selective harvesting did not consistently increase small mammal abundance compared to clearcutting, though it sometimes maintained red-backed vole populations better.",

Three studies involved planting shrubs in the USA\\u00a0or Spain. There was overlap in the sites used in two studies. One systematic review\\u00a0included several of the other summarized studies.\\n\\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\\n\\nOverall extent (3 studies): Two before-and-after studies in India\\u00a0and South Africa\\u00a0reported that the area of mangrove forest was greater 6\\u201342 years after planting mangrove trees (sometimes\\u00a0along with other interventions) than in the years before. One study in Sri Lanka\\u00a0simply quantified the area of mangrove vegetation present 8\\u201310 years after planting seedlings (and propagules).\\nTree/shrub richness/diversity (6 studies): Three site comparison studies in the USA, Mexico\\u00a0and Brazil\\u00a0reported that where mangrove forests developed after planting trees (sometimes\\u00a0along with other interventions), they contained a similar number of tree species to mature\\u00a0and/or naturally regenerating\\u00a0forests after 10\\u201330 years. One site comparison study in Vietnam\\u00a0reported that after 14\\u201334 years, a planted mangrove forest contained more tree species than a (slightly older) naturally regenerated forest. One replicated, paired, before-and-after, site comparison study in Kenya\\u00a0reported that planted mangrove forest contained fewer adult tree species than mature natural forest after five years, but more species of seedling. One study in a former shrimp pond in Thailand\\u00a0simply reported the number of unplanted tree species that had colonized six years after planting (along with other interventions).\\n\\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\\n\\nTree/shrub abundance (9 studies): Three replicated, site comparison studies of coastal sites in the Philippines, the USA\\u00a0and Brazil\\u00a0reported that where mangrove forests developed after planting trees (sometimes\\u00a0along with other interventions), woody vegetation was typically more dense than in mature natural forests\\u00a0and/or naturally regenerating forests. Two site comparison studies in Kenya\\u00a0and Vietnam\\u00a0found that tree abundance (density\\u00a0and biomass) was similar in planted and natural mangroves after 5\\u201334 years. One site comparison study in Mexico\\u00a0reported that a planted mangrove forest contained fewer trees than pristine natural forests after 12 years. Two site comparison studies in the Philippines\\u00a0reported mixed results according to time since planting\\u00a0and site. One study in Thailand\\u00a0simply quantified the abundance of mangrove trees six years after planting (along with other interventions).\\nAlgae/phytoplankton abundance (1 study): One site comparison study in Kenya\\u00a0found that mangrove forests restored by planting contained a similar algal biomass, after eight years, to mature natural forests. However, mangrove forests created by planting into bare sediment contained less algal biomass than mature natural forests.\\nIndividual species abundance (7 studies): Seven studies\\u00a0quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. Four of the studies compared the abundance of woody vegetation\\u00a0or algae\\u00a0in planted mangrove forests and mature natural forests \\u2013 and sometimes\\u00a0naturally regenerating forests (see original papers for data). One replicated, paired, controlled study in a brackish wetland in the USA\\u00a0reported that there were fewer common reed Phragmites australis stems in plots planted with wetland shrubs (and herbs) than in unplanted plots, after 1\\u20133 years. One before-and-after study of an intertidal site in the USA\\u00a0reported greater abundance of red mangrove Rhizophora mangle over five years after planting (along with other interventions) than before.\\n\\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE\\n\\nOverall structure (3 studies): Three replicated, site comparison studies of coastal sites in the Kenya, the USA\\u00a0and the Philippines\\u00a0reported that where mangrove forests developed after planting trees (sometimes\\u00a0along with other interventions), their overall structure differed from mature natural forests for up to 50 years.\\nHeight (18 studies): Four site comparison studies (three replicated, three paired) of coastal sites in Kenya, the USA, Brazil\\u00a0and the Philippines\\u00a0reported that where mangrove forests developed after planting trees (sometimes\\u00a0along with other interventions), the vegetation was shorter than in mature\\u00a0and naturally regenerating\\u00a0forests after 5\\u201330 years. One site comparison study in Mexico\\u00a0reported that planted mangrove forests contained taller trees than pristine natural forests after 12 years. Fourteen studies (four replicated) in Asia, Central/South America, Africa\\u00a0and North America\\u00a0simply quantified the height of mangrove trees for up to six years after they were planted; in 13 of these studies, the average height increased over time.\\nDiameter (7 studies): Two site comparison studies in Mexio\\u00a0and Vietnam\\u00a0reported that tree diameters were similar in planted and natural mangroves after 12\\u201334 years. In contrast, two site comparison studies in Brazil\\u00a0and the Philippines\\u00a0reported that planted mangroves contained thinner tree stems than mature natural mangroves after 7\\u201312 years. The study in Brazil\\u00a0also reported that stem diameters were thinner than in naturally regenerating areas. Three studies in India\\u00a0and Nigeria\\u00a0simply quantified the diameter of mangrove trees for up to three years after they were planted; in all three studies, the average stem diameter increased over time.\\nBasal area (3 studies): Two site comparison studies (one also replicated, paired, before-and-after) in Kenya\\u00a0and Mexico\\u00a0reported that planted mangrove forests had a smaller basal area than mature natural forests after 5\\u201312 years. One replicated, site comparison study in the USA\\u00a0reported that where mangrove forests developed after planting trees (along with other interventions), their basal area was similar to mature natural forests after 17\\u201330 years.\\n\\nOTHER\\n\\nSurvival (37 studies): Thirty-six studies (including one review\\u00a0and one systematic review) quantified survival rates of individual trees/shrubs planted in brackish/saline wetlands. Survival rates ranged from 0% to 100% after 15 days to 21 years. The studies were of mangroves in North America, Central/South America,\\u00a0Asia, Africa, Oceania\\u00a0or globally, and of shrubs in the USA\\u00a0or Spain. Six studies\\u00a0reported 100% survival in some cases. Eleven studies\\u00a0reported 0% survival or absence of planted species in some cases. In six studies, survival of planted seedlings was not distinguished from survival of seeds or propagules. Proposed factors affecting survival included elevation/water levels, exposure to wind/waves, soil properties, sediment deposition, oyster/barnacle colonization, salinity, use of guidance\\u00a0and post-planting care.\\nGrowth (9 studies): Nine studies monitored true growth of individual trees/shrubs (rather than changes in average height of survivors). The nine studies, in Colombia, the USA, the Philippines, Brazil\\u00a0and China, reported that planted trees/shrubs typically grew, over periods from 40 days to 50 years. One replicated study in the USA\\u00a0reported that planted seedlings grew less quickly than naturally colonizing seedlings. One replicated, site comparison study in the Philippines\\u00a0found that growth rates of trees in planted mangroves became more similar to those in mature natural mangroves over time.\"\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "Several actions are available to protect newly planted trees from competition and other threats. To reduce competition from other vegetation, selective thinning can be used after restoration planting, which has been shown to increase herbaceous species abundance while decreasing tree competition. Ground covering techniques such as plastic mats can decrease cover of competing herbaceous plants and grasses, while mulch application can increase total plant cover. For protection from animal damage, tree guards or shelters can increase survival rates of planted tree seedlings, with light-colored plastic shelters being more effective than dark-colored ones. Physical barriers like fences can be used to exclude wild herbivores from restoration areas. Ground preparation before planting is another important action, with most studies showing increased survival and growth rates of planted trees when proper ground preparation treatments are applied. Mechanical thinning before or after planting has also been shown to increase survival and size of planted trees in most cases.",

Shelterwood harvesting increased abundance, species richness and diversity of understory plants, as well as the growth and survival rate of young trees (action ID 1223). Group-selection harvesting showed mixed results, with some studies finding increased cover and diversity of understory plants and density of young trees, while other studies found it decreased understory species richness and biomass or had no effect (action ID 1224). Woody debris removal after timber harvest showed varied effects on understory vegetation and young trees, with one study finding increased understory cover, but most studies showing no effect or mixed effects on species richness, diversity, and young tree density (action ID 1213). Thinning followed by prescribed fire increased cover and abundance of understory plants and density of deciduous trees in some studies, while other studies found it decreased tree density and species richness or had no effect (action ID 1227). Mechanical removal of understory vegetation after tree planting showed no effect on emergence, survival, growth rate or frost damage in planted seedlings in most studies (action ID 1256). Soil scarification or ploughing increased cover and diversity of understory plants, but had mixed effects on young tree density (action ID 1251). Vegetation removal combined with mechanical soil disturbance increased cover, diversity of understory plants, and density of young trees (action ID 1274).",

Mulching with woodchips before planting native shrubs showed mixed results - it had no significant effect on overall shrub cover or swamp gum seedling height in Australian floodplain swamps, but reduced cover of problematic herb species in one of two tested swamps (3314). Covering plots with plastic or jute mats before planting reduced cover of two problematic herb species in Australian floodplain swamps (3318), while shading black mangrove seedlings with black mesh on a Mexican sandflat resulted in increased height growth over six months (3319). Prescribed burning can be used to control trees (1721) and problematic plants in freshwater swamps (3118), with one study finding that burning canarygrass-invaded vegetation after herbicide spraying increased overall plant diversity compared to spraying alone.

Adding below-ground organic matter like compost to freshwater wetlands planted with tree seedlings showed mixed results: large amounts led to plant communities characteristic of drier conditions and reduced plant species richness and diversity after three years, while smaller doses had no significant effects on these outcomes. However, birch saplings were larger when planted with large amounts of compost. Ground coverings like straw showed positive effects, with one study in the Czech Republic finding that straw mulch increased growth rates of planted trees and shrubs. Lime amendments showed variable effects: two studies found either decreased survival of pine seedlings or no effect on oak seedling growth. The effectiveness appears context-dependent, with studies showing that organic matter incorporation generally increased soil carbon levels, microbial biomass, and sometimes improved yields, while lime effects varied between vegetation types and study sites.",
