    "relevant_summary": "Raising mowing height on grasslands has shown mixed effects on farmland wildlife. A UK replicated controlled study found it increased productivity of Eurasian skylark and reduced damage to amphibians and invertebrates, but other studies found no effects on foraging birds or invertebrates, and shorter grass actually improved foraging success of northern lapwing and common starling chicks.\n\nDifferent mowing techniques significantly affect wildlife mortality. Studies from Germany, Ireland, Switzerland and the UK found that specific techniques can reduce bird, mammal, amphibian and invertebrate mortality. Corncrake Friendly Mowing schemes increased the UK corncrake population, with 68% of chicks escaping when fields were mown from center outwards versus 45% with conventional edge-in mowing. Bar mowers caused less damage to amphibians and invertebrates than other types. Wider mowing machinery increased skylark chick survival fourfold, while mower-conditioners resulted in higher skylark nest survival than tedders.\n\nRotational mowing strategies benefit many butterfly and moth species. Ten studies found rotational mowing (mowing strips in alternate years, leaving some areas uncut) increased butterfly species richness and abundance compared to complete annual mowing. This benefited 27 out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern in Europe, with some heath fritillary populations surviving on rotationally mown grasslands while others went extinct on unmanaged sites.\n\nTiming of cutting significantly impacts butterfly and moth populations. Studies from seven countries found delayed cutting (July-September vs May-June) generally increased abundance and richness of butterflies, burnet moths and caterpillars, though results varied between years. Some species like short-tailed blue preferred late-mown meadows, while others such as marbled white and meadow brown preferred early-mown areas.\n\nSpecific wildlife protection techniques during mowing include marking nests and caterpillar locations. Marking northern lapwing nests reduced their destruction probability. Marking marsh fritillary caterpillar webs before mowing led to increased web numbers the following year.",

For invasive non-native plants such as Himalayan balsam and Japanese knotweed, control methods involve removing all flower heads at peak flowering time, which dramatically reduced seed production in giant hogweed according to studies in the Czech Republic. For bracken management specifically, multiple techniques are available: herbicide application using asulam can reduce bracken abundance if applied repeatedly, though cutting may be equally effective; cutting bracken alone has been shown to increase heather cover and biomass while reducing bracken cover; a combination of cutting followed by herbicide application can effectively reduce bracken biomass and cover; and cutting followed by rotovating is another option, though it showed no effect on total plant biomass. Additional actions include general removal or control of non-native or problematic plants, with studies showing that such removal can increase plant species richness and benefit butterfly populations. For managing overabundant native species more broadly, reducing numbers of large herbivores like red deer can increase cover and height of common heather, and removing feral livestock can shift vegetation composition from grass to shrub dominance.",

However, 6 studies found no clear effects on some insect and bird groups (action 246).\n- Providing buffer strips alongside water courses had mixed results: 3 studies reported positive influence on plant, invertebrate and bird diversity or abundance, while 2 studies found no increase in plant species numbers compared to farms without buffer strips (action 120).\n- Buffer strips managed with restrictions on fertilizer and pesticide use showed greater abundance of moths compared to conventionally managed margins, though species richness was similar (action 3894).\n\n**Beetle Banks:**\n- Creating beetle banks showed benefits for farmland biodiversity with 14 reports from 8 studies finding positive effects. For invertebrates, beetle banks provided higher ground beetle density and species diversity in spring and summer, though effects varied between grass species sown and between invertebrate groups. For birds, 2 reviews and 1 study found positive effects on bird numbers or evidence of use, while 2 studies found mixed effects and 1 study found no farmland bird species were associated with beetle banks.

Planting wild bird seed or cover mixtures is the most widely supported option, with 21 out of 33 studies showing positive effects on bird abundance, density, species diversity and richness compared to other farmland habitats (Action IDs 187, 594, 3930). These mixtures can include kale or combinations of kale with other species which attract the highest bird abundance. Undersowing spring cereals with clover or other species provides benefits to barnacle geese, Eurasian skylark, arthropods, bumblebees, butterflies and earthworms (Action IDs 136, 3926). Planting cereals for whole crop silage, particularly barley, provides food resources for seed-eating birds in both summer and winter (Action ID 225). Creating skylark plots through undrilled patches within cereal fields increases Eurasian skylark breeding density, duration and success (Action ID 540). Leaving cultivated uncropped margins or plots (including lapwing plots) benefits plants, bumblebees, spiders, ground-dwelling invertebrates and ground beetles, with northern lapwing, Eurasian skylark, grey partridge and yellow wagtail breeding in lapwing plots (Action ID 562).",

Planting nectar flower mixtures or wildflower strips has been found to increase butterfly and moth species richness and diversity compared to conventional field margins, unsown margins, cropped fields, or conventional grassland. These habitats also support higher abundance of butterflies, including generalist and specialist species. Field margins sown with wildflowers attract significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated, grassy, or cropped field margins. Planting nettle strips in field margins has been shown to increase the number of aphid predator species, with some insect families like green lacewings found exclusively on nettles. The evidence comes from multiple replicated studies across Europe, with 23 studies evaluating wildflower strips and 5 replicated trials examining nectar and pollen mixes.",

Two studies of a replicated and controlled experiment in the UK found that no more birds used nectar/wildflower strips in winter than used land under other management.\\nA replicated, controlled study from Switzerland found that Eurasian skylarks Alauda arvensis were more likely to nest in patches of fields sown with annual weeds than in crops, and were less likely to abandon nests in these patches.\\nA randomised, replicated and controlled study from the UK found that field margin management affected their use by birds more than the seed mix used on them.\"\n}"
