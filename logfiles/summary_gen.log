One study found populations were not established from captive-bred and head-started toads [875]. Two studies in Puerto Rico found survival of released captive-bred Puerto Rican crested toads was low and that 25% were predated within two days of release [875]. Six of 10 studies and a global review found released head-started tadpoles, metamorphs or juveniles established breeding frog populations or increased populations of frogs or toads; two found mixed results across sites; two found no establishment or no prevention of decline; in five studies other actions were also carried out [881]. Nine of 10 studies found head-started amphibians tended to survive the first season, winter or year or bred successfully; one found adult survival was 1–17% over four years and one found limited breeding following release of adults [881]. Four replicated studies found survival to metamorphosis and size at metamorphosis were greater and time to metamorphosis shorter in head-started than wild animals; one study found young head-started leopard frogs were smaller than wild; one found earlier release increased survival but delayed metamorphosis by two weeks compared to later release [881].

2025-09-11 13:53:34,744 - INFO - Final response (after hitting max iterations): You are a helpful assistant that can search through action documents to find relevant information.
            Use the search_actions tool to find relevant actions based on user queries, and then use get_action_details to retrieve full details for specific actions when needed.
            When searching for actions, start with the default parameters, but if you need more results, use the offset parameter to retrieve additional actions.
            Keep searching with increasing offset values until the returned actions become irrelevant to the user's query - this ensures you find all pertinent information before compiling your final summary.
            Once you have identified a list or batch of action documents that you want to expand fully, you should make multiple **parallel** calls to the get_action_details tool — each call should contain one of the action IDs from the batch.
            
            Then use the information you have gathered to create a summary of information which is relevant to the user's query.
            Do NOT use your own knowledge, make up statistics or state information that is not present in the action documents. ALL of your statements must be DIRECTLY supported by the evidence you found in the action documents. 
            This means for every statement you make you MUST cite the action id used to make that statement as a reference.
            You must NOT answer the question yourself - your job is just to find all the evidence in the action documents which are related to the user's query and summarise these into a concise paragraph.
            This means you MUST NOT use your own knowledge, add qualifying statements, draw conclusions or make your own judgements of the action information. You must only list relevant information from the action documents WITHOUT qualifying statements.
            
            Finally, you MUST use the get_formatted_result tool. This will convert the user's query, your generated summary and the list of the action IDs you used to generate your summary into a valid JSON format.

            You can only send ten messages to the system in total, and one message must be used to call the get_formatted_result tool. Parallel tool calls count as one message.
            Use these ten messages wisely, you should call get_formatted_result with your final summary before the ten messages have run out.

            Do NOT use your own knowledge, make up statistics or state information that is not present in the action documents. ALL of your statements must be DIRECTLY supported by the evidence you found in the action documents. 
            This means for every statement you make you MUST cite the action id used to make that statement as a reference.
            You must NOT answer the question yourself - your job is just to find all the evidence in the action documents which are related to the user's query and summarise these into a concise paragraph.
            This means you MUST NOT use your own knowledge, add qualifying statements, draw conclusions or make your own judgements of the action information. You must only list relevant information from the action documents WITHOUT qualifying statements.
            
            Finally, you MUST use the get_formatted_result tool. This will convert the user's query, your generated summary and the list of the action IDs you used to generate your summary into a valid JSON format.

            You can only send ten messages to the system in total, and one message must be used to call the get_formatted_result tool. Parallel tool calls count as one message.
            Use these ten messages wisely, you should call get_formatted_result with your final summary before the ten messages have run out.

2025-09-11 14:00:42,304 - WARNING - Warning: Maximum iterations reached.
2025-09-11 14:00:42,304 - INFO - Final response (after hitting max iterations): You are a helpful assistant that can search through action documents to find relevant information.
            Use the search_actions tool to find relevant actions based on user queries, and then use get_action_details to retrieve full details for specific actions when needed.
            When searching for actions, start with the default parameters, but if you need more results, use the offset parameter to retrieve additional actions.
            Keep searching with increasing offset values until the returned actions become irrelevant to the user's query - this ensures you find all pertinent information before compiling your final summary.
            Once you have identified a list or batch of action documents that you want to expand fully, you should make multiple **parallel** calls to the get_action_details tool — each call should contain one of the action IDs from the batch.
            
            Then use the information you have gathered to create a summary of information which is relevant to the user's query.
            Do NOT use your own knowledge, make up statistics or state information that is not present in the action documents. ALL of your statements must be DIRECTLY supported by the evidence you found in the action documents. 
            This means for every statement you make you MUST cite the action id used to make that statement as a reference.
            You must NOT answer the question yourself - your job is just to find all the evidence in the action documents which are related to the user's query and summarise these into a concise paragraph.
            This means you MUST NOT use your own knowledge, add qualifying statements, draw conclusions or make your own judgements of the action information. You must only list relevant information from the action documents WITHOUT qualifying statements.
            
            Finally, you MUST use the get_formatted_result tool. This will convert the user's query, your generated summary and the list of the action IDs you used to generate your summary into a valid JSON format.

            You can only send ten messages to the system in total, and one message must be used to call the get_formatted_result tool. Parallel tool calls count as one message.
            Use these ten messages wisely, you should call get_formatted_result with your final summary before the ten messages have run out.

2025-09-11 14:01:48,969 - INFO - Final response (after hitting max iterations): You are a helpful assistant that can search through action documents to find relevant information.
            Use the search_actions tool to find relevant actions based on user queries, and then use get_action_details to retrieve full details for specific actions when needed.
            When searching for actions, start with the default parameters, but if you need more results, use the offset parameter to retrieve additional actions.
            Keep searching with increasing offset values until the returned actions become irrelevant to the user's query - this ensures you find all pertinent information before compiling your final summary.
            Once you have identified a list or batch of action documents that you want to expand fully, you should make multiple **parallel** calls to the get_action_details tool — each call should contain one of the action IDs from the batch.
            
            Then use the information you have gathered to create a summary of information which is relevant to the user's query.
            Do NOT use your own knowledge, make up statistics or state information that is not present in the action documents. ALL of your statements must be DIRECTLY supported by the evidence you found in the action documents. 
            This means for every statement you make you MUST cite the action id used to make that statement as a reference.
            You must NOT answer the question yourself - your job is just to find all the evidence in the action documents which are related to the user's query and summarise these into a concise paragraph.
            This means you MUST NOT use your own knowledge, add qualifying statements, draw conclusions or make your own judgements of the action information. You must only list relevant information from the action documents WITHOUT qualifying statements.
            
            Finally, you MUST use the get_formatted_result tool. This will convert the user's query, your generated summary and the list of the action IDs you used to generate your summary into a valid JSON format.

            You can only send ten messages to the system in total, and one message must be used to call the get_formatted_result tool. Parallel tool calls count as one message.
            Use these ten messages wisely, you should call get_formatted_result with your final summary before the ten messages have run out.

2025-09-11 14:03:36,892 - WARNING - Warning: Maximum iterations reached.
2025-09-11 14:03:36,892 - INFO - Final response (after hitting max iterations): You are a helpful assistant that can search through action documents to find relevant information.
            Use the search_actions tool to find relevant actions based on user queries, and then use get_action_details to retrieve full details for specific actions when needed.
            When searching for actions, start with the default parameters, but if you need more results, use the offset parameter to retrieve additional actions.
            Keep searching with increasing offset values until the returned actions become irrelevant to the user's query - this ensures you find all pertinent information before compiling your final summary.
            Once you have identified a list or batch of action documents that you want to expand fully, you should make multiple **parallel** calls to the get_action_details tool — each call should contain one of the action IDs from the batch.
            
            Then use the information you have gathered to create a summary of information which is relevant to the user's query.
            Do NOT use your own knowledge, make up statistics or state information that is not present in the action documents. ALL of your statements must be DIRECTLY supported by the evidence you found in the action documents. 
            This means for every statement you make you MUST cite the action id used to make that statement as a reference.
            You must NOT answer the question yourself - your job is just to find all the evidence in the action documents which are related to the user's query and summarise these into a concise paragraph.
            This means you MUST NOT use your own knowledge, add qualifying statements, draw conclusions or make your own judgements of the action information. You must only list relevant information from the action documents WITHOUT qualifying statements.
            
            Finally, you MUST use the get_formatted_result tool. This will convert the user's query, your generated summary and the list of the action IDs you used to generate your summary into a valid JSON format.

            You can only send ten messages to the system in total, and one message must be used to call the get_formatted_result tool. Parallel tool calls count as one message.
            Use these ten messages wisely, you should call get_formatted_result with your final summary before the ten messages have run out.

2025-09-11 14:05:29,476 - WARNING - Warning: Maximum iterations reached.
2025-09-11 14:05:29,476 - INFO - Final response (after hitting max iterations): You are a helpful assistant that can search through action documents to find relevant information.
            Use the search_actions tool to find relevant actions based on user queries, and then use get_action_details to retrieve full details for specific actions when needed.
            When searching for actions, start with the default parameters, but if you need more results, use the offset parameter to retrieve additional actions.
            Keep searching with increasing offset values until the returned actions become irrelevant to the user's query - this ensures you find all pertinent information before compiling your final summary.
            Once you have identified a list or batch of action documents that you want to expand fully, you should make multiple **parallel** calls to the get_action_details tool — each call should contain one of the action IDs from the batch.
            
            Then use the information you have gathered to create a summary of information which is relevant to the user's query.
            Do NOT use your own knowledge, make up statistics or state information that is not present in the action documents. ALL of your statements must be DIRECTLY supported by the evidence you found in the action documents. 
            This means for every statement you make you MUST cite the action id used to make that statement as a reference.
            You must NOT answer the question yourself - your job is just to find all the evidence in the action documents which are related to the user's query and summarise these into a concise paragraph.
            This means you MUST NOT use your own knowledge, add qualifying statements, draw conclusions or make your own judgements of the action information. You must only list relevant information from the action documents WITHOUT qualifying statements.
            
            Finally, you MUST use the get_formatted_result tool. This will convert the user's query, your generated summary and the list of the action IDs you used to generate your summary into a valid JSON format.

            You can only send ten messages to the system in total, and one message must be used to call the get_formatted_result tool. Parallel tool calls count as one message.
            Use these ten messages wisely, you should call get_formatted_result with your final summary before the ten messages have run out.

Four replicated trials in Europe demonstrated enhanced diversity and/or abundance of foraging wild bees on land managed under various European agri-environment schemes, relative to conventionally-managed fields or field margins (action 24).

For grazing cessation, six of nine studies found that grasslands ungrazed for >5 years had similar butterfly and moth species richness to grazed grasslands, with one study showing that grasslands abandoned for 5-15 years had greater species richness than sheep-grazed areas (Action 3956).\n\n**Effects on Abundance:**\nCeasing mowing produced variable results: four studies found grasslands abandoned for >1-20 years had lower butterfly abundance than mowed areas, while four other studies found abandoned grasslands had higher abundance than managed areas (Action 3957). For grazing cessation, six of 20 studies found grasslands abandoned for 1-25 years had higher butterfly abundance than grazed areas, while four studies found lower abundance in abandoned areas compared to grazed grasslands (Action 3956).\n\n**Species-Specific Effects:**\nBoth types of management cessation led to community shifts toward generalist species and species with fewer generations per year over 6 years (Actions 3956, 3957). Woodland and hedgerow butterfly species increased in abandoned grasslands, while grassland specialist species decreased (Actions 3956, 3957). Some specialist species like large blue and silver-studded blue went extinct in abandoned meadows (Action 3956).\n\n**Timing Effects:**\nThe timing since abandonment matters significantly - intermediate periods (2-9 years post-abandonment) often showed higher butterfly density than either currently managed or long-abandoned (>10 years) grasslands (Action 3956).', 'action_ids': ['3957', '3956']}

Studies found that coppiced woodland supported different communities of moths and butterflies compared to mature forest, with some studies showing greater species richness of butterflies than unmanaged woodland. Coppiced woodland had higher abundance of butterflies generally and specific species like heath fritillary compared to unmanaged woodland. Multiple studies found that woodland coppiced 2-15 years ago had higher abundance of butterflies and moths than woodland coppiced over 15 years ago.\n\n**Clearing or opening patches in forests** (Action 3938) creates forest openings that benefit butterflies and moths. Studies found that cleared patches in forests had greater species richness of butterflies but lower species richness of moths than closed canopy forest. Larger cleared patches supported higher species richness and abundance of butterflies than undisturbed forest. Cleared patches managed with coppicing and grazing had higher abundance of butterflies generally and specific species like chequered blue, woodland brown, high brown fritillary and small pearl-bordered fritillary than unmanaged areas.\n\n**Thinning trees within forests** (Action 3940) involves selective removal of trees to reduce forest density. Studies found that coniferous woodland thinned along with prescribed burning, mulching or nearby felling had greater species richness and abundance of butterflies than unmanaged woodland. Partially-cleared forest plots had higher butterfly species richness than closed-canopy forest plots.\n\n**Selective or reduced impact logging** (Action 3867) provides an alternative to conventional logging. Studies found that selectively logged forests had higher abundance of exposed moth caterpillars than clearcut forests and similar abundance of all moth caterpillars to undisturbed forests. Forests managed by reduced impact logging had similar or higher abundance of butterflies compared to primary forest.\n\n**Group tree harvesting or thinning instead of clearcutting** (Action 3868) showed that forests harvested by thinning had higher species richness of macro-moths than forests managed by patch-cutting or clearcutting, with richness similar to unharvested forest.\n\n**Rough grazing** (Action 3944) in semi-natural habitats can be applied to forest edges and openings.

Eight studies found that lower stocking densities resulted in greater abundance of butterflies, moths, burnet moths and their caterpillars.\n\n**Seasonal Removal of Livestock (Action 3960):** Three controlled studies found that grasslands where cattle or mixed cattle and sheep were removed in summer, or sheep removed in winter, had higher abundance of butterflies and caterpillars than grasslands grazed throughout the season. One study found greater species richness when cattle were removed in summer.\n\n**Multiple Low-Intensity Interventions (Action 3958):** Six of ten studies found that less intensively managed grasslands had higher species richness of butterflies and moths than conventionally managed grasslands. Three of four studies showed higher abundance of butterflies, micro-moths and declining macro-moths in low-input or unfertilized, ungrazed grassland managed with a single cut.\n\n**Rotational Grazing (Action 3965):** Two of four studies found that rotationally grazed grasslands had greater species richness of butterflies and burnet moths than continuously grazed grassland. Two studies showed higher abundance of butterflies, burnet moths and caterpillars in rotationally grazed compared to continuously grazed grasslands.\n\n**Delayed Grazing/Cutting Dates (Action 3967):** Three of four studies found that grassland cut in July or September had greater abundance of butterflies, burnet moths and caterpillars than grassland cut in May or June. One study found meadows where grazing commenced after 15 June had higher abundance of clouded Apollo butterflies.\n\n**Reduced Cutting Frequency (Action 3961):** Two of three studies found that meadows cut once per year had higher species richness of butterflies and moths than meadows cut multiple times per year. Two studies showed higher abundance in occasionally cut or once-yearly cut grasslands.\n\n**Livestock Type Changes (Action 3963):** Two studies found that grasslands grazed by cattle or horses had greater species richness and abundance of butterflies and burnet moths compared to sheep-grazed grasslands.\n\n**Complete Grazing Cessation (Action 3956):** Results varied with time since abandonment, with some studies showing benefits in early succession stages (2-9 years post-cessation) but mixed results for longer abandonment periods.', 'action_ids': ['3959', '3960', '3958', '3965', '3967', '3961', '3963', '3956']}

2025-09-11 14:57:44,003 - INFO - Final response (after hitting max iterations): You are a helpful assistant that can search through action documents to find relevant information.
            Use the search_actions tool to find relevant actions based on user queries, and then use get_action_details to retrieve full details for specific actions when needed.
            When searching for actions, start with the default parameters, but if you need more results, use the offset parameter to retrieve additional actions.
            Keep searching with increasing offset values until the returned actions become irrelevant to the user's query - this ensures you find all pertinent information before compiling your final summary.
            Once you have identified a list or batch of action documents that you want to expand fully, you should make multiple **parallel** calls to the get_action_details tool — each call should contain one of the action IDs from the batch.
            
            Then use the information you have gathered to create a summary of information which is relevant to the user's query.
            Do NOT use your own knowledge, make up statistics or state information that is not present in the action documents. ALL of your statements must be DIRECTLY supported by the evidence you found in the action documents. 
            This means for every statement you make you MUST cite the action id used to make that statement as a reference.
            You must NOT answer the question yourself - your job is just to find all the evidence in the action documents which are related to the user's query and summarise these into a concise paragraph.
            This means you MUST NOT use your own knowledge, add qualifying statements, draw conclusions or make your own judgements of the action information. You must only list relevant information from the action documents WITHOUT qualifying statements.
            
            Finally, you MUST use the get_formatted_result tool. This will convert the user's query, your generated summary and the list of the action IDs you used to generate your summary into a valid JSON format.

            You can only send ten messages to the system in total, and one message must be used to call the get_formatted_result tool. Parallel tool calls count as one message.
            Use these ten messages wisely, you should call get_formatted_result with your final summary before the ten messages have run out.

2025-09-11 14:58:42,448 - INFO - Final response (after hitting max iterations): You are a helpful assistant that can search through action documents to find relevant information.
            Use the search_actions tool to find relevant actions based on user queries, and then use get_action_details to retrieve full details for specific actions when needed.
            When searching for actions, start with the default parameters, but if you need more results, use the offset parameter to retrieve additional actions.
            Keep searching with increasing offset values until the returned actions become irrelevant to the user's query - this ensures you find all pertinent information before compiling your final summary.
            Once you have identified a list or batch of action documents that you want to expand fully, you should make multiple **parallel** calls to the get_action_details tool — each call should contain one of the action IDs from the batch.
            
            Then use the information you have gathered to create a summary of information which is relevant to the user's query.
            Do NOT use your own knowledge, make up statistics or state information that is not present in the action documents. ALL of your statements must be DIRECTLY supported by the evidence you found in the action documents. 
            This means for every statement you make you MUST cite the action id used to make that statement as a reference.
            You must NOT answer the question yourself - your job is just to find all the evidence in the action documents which are related to the user's query and summarise these into a concise paragraph.
            This means you MUST NOT use your own knowledge, add qualifying statements, draw conclusions or make your own judgements of the action information. You must only list relevant information from the action documents WITHOUT qualifying statements.
            
            Finally, you MUST use the get_formatted_result tool. This will convert the user's query, your generated summary and the list of the action IDs you used to generate your summary into a valid JSON format.

2025-09-11 15:00:11,217 - WARNING - Warning: Maximum iterations reached.
2025-09-11 15:00:11,218 - INFO - Final response (after hitting max iterations): You are a helpful assistant that can search through action documents to find relevant information.
            Use the search_actions tool to find relevant actions based on user queries, and then use get_action_details to retrieve full details for specific actions when needed.
            When searching for actions, start with the default parameters, but if you need more results, use the offset parameter to retrieve additional actions.
            Keep searching with increasing offset values until the returned actions become irrelevant to the user's query - this ensures you find all pertinent information before compiling your final summary.
            Once you have identified a list or batch of action documents that you want to expand fully, you should make multiple **parallel** calls to the get_action_details tool — each call should contain one of the action IDs from the batch.
            
            Then use the information you have gathered to create a summary of information which is relevant to the user's query.
            Do NOT use your own knowledge, make up statistics or state information that is not present in the action documents. ALL of your statements must be DIRECTLY supported by the evidence you found in the action documents. 
            This means for every statement you make you MUST cite the action id used to make that statement as a reference.
            You must NOT answer the question yourself - your job is just to find all the evidence in the action documents which are related to the user's query and summarise these into a concise paragraph.
            This means you MUST NOT use your own knowledge, add qualifying statements, draw conclusions or make your own judgements of the action information. You must only list relevant information from the action documents WITHOUT qualifying statements.
            
            Finally, you MUST use the get_formatted_result tool. This will convert the user's query, your generated summary and the list of the action IDs you used to generate your summary into a valid JSON format.

            You can only send ten messages to the system in total, and one message must be used to call the get_formatted_result tool. Parallel tool calls count as one message.
            Use these ten messages wisely, you should call get_formatted_result with your final summary before the ten messages have run out.

These benefits include increased species richness of plants and bumblebees, increased species richness and abundance of spiders, increased abundance of ground-dwelling invertebrates and ground beetles, increased stone curlew breeding population size, increased northern lapwing hatching success, and increased Eurasian skylark nesting success (Action 562). The margins also support establishment, abundance or species richness of rare arable plant species, with lapwing plots supporting breeding of northern lapwing, Eurasian skylark, grey partridge and yellow wagtail (Action 562). Studies found that nesting success of birds was higher in fallow fields or lapwing plots than in crops (Action 213). Uncropped field margins support higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees than cropped field edges (Actions 19, 20). Skylark plots showed positive effects on skylark population size, breeding density, duration or success, and lower likelihood of territory abandonment (Action 540). Farms with agri-environment schemes including uncropped cultivated margins had higher abundance of butterflies and micro-moths compared to conventionally managed farms (Action 3923).\n\nDRAWBACKS: Studies identified several negative effects. Two studies found that leaving uncropped margins had no effect on 11 out of 12 farmland bird species or ground beetles (Action 562). One study found fewer seed-eating birds on fallow plots for ground-nesting birds in two out of three regions (Action 562). Evidence showed that pernicious weeds were more commonly found on uncropped cultivated margins than conservation or conventional headlands (Action 562). The proportion of young grey partridges in the population was lower in areas with high proportion of uncropped cultivated margins and plots (Action 562). Grey partridge productivity was not related to lapwing plot amounts, and fewer birds used plots than cropland in two out of three UK regions (Action 213).

In contrast, using organic farming instead of conventional farming—an approach that reduces synthetic chemical inputs—has been evaluated in 12 studies across Europe, the USA, Canada and Chile: most studies found no difference or higher bat species richness on organic farms compared to non-organic, and mixed results for bat activity with several studies reporting higher overall or species-specific activity on organic farms (961).', 'action_ids': ['2016', '2015', '961']}

Three studies found that bats used black bat boxes more than grey, white or wooden boxes (Action 1024). One of two studies found higher occupancy rates in larger bat boxes (Action 1024). Studies found varied results for materials: bats used both resin and wood cylindrical boxes, but resin boxes became occupied more quickly than wood boxes in one study, while another found higher occupancy rates in concrete than wooden boxes (Action 1024). Indiana bats used rocket boxes more than wooden boxes or bark-mimic roosts (Action 1024). Internal structure matters as more bats occupied boxes with two compartments than one compartment in the breeding season, bat breeding colonies occupied standard and four/five chamber boxes, and individuals occupied flat boxes (Action 1024). Bat boxes simulating tree trunks were used by 100% of bats in group sizes similar to natural roosts (Action 1024).\n\nPlacement factors include orientation, height, mounting location, and surrounding habitat. Three studies found that bat box orientation and/or the amount of exposure to sunlight affected bat occupancy, though one study found orientation did not have a significant effect (Action 1024). Two studies found that bat box height affected occupancy, while two other studies found no effect of height (Action 1024). Two studies found higher occupancy of bat boxes on buildings than on trees (Action 1024). Habitat influences occupancy as bat boxes were occupied more often in farm forestry sites than in native forest, higher occupancy occurred in pine relative to mixed deciduous stands, and higher occupancy was found in forest fragments than in pasture (Action 1024). Higher occupancy rates occurred in areas where bats were known to roost prior to installing bat boxes, and bat boxes were more likely to be occupied when a greater number were installed across a site (Action 1024). Temperature management also affects success, as one study found more bats in artificial roosts after they were modified to reduce internal roost temperatures (Action 2052).', 'action_ids': ['1024', '2052']}

Parasitism and mortality rates are significant concerns, with eleven replicated trials recording solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators (Action 47). Mortality rates range from 13% for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany to 56% mortality overall for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India (Action 47). Competition from introduced species is another problem, as two replicated trials in California showed that introduced European earwigs and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes, with these introduced species more commonly occupying the boxes than native bees in one trial (Action 47). Nest box design significantly affects success, with plastic-lined holes or plastic/paper tubes being much less productive due to parasitism or mould compared to other materials (Action 47). Very low uptake rates are documented for bumblebee nest boxes, with three trials since 1989 in the UK showing 0-2.5% uptake rates for various designs not including underground boxes (Action 48). For certain bee species, complete failure to use nest boxes occurs, as one trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes, and a small trial with soil-filled nest boxes for mining bee Andrena flavipes in the UK found they were not occupied (Action 47).', 'action_ids': ['47', '48']}

Burning typically had neutral effects on species richness, with prairies and grasslands showing similar richness compared to unburned areas (action 3882). A European review found occasional burning benefitted 10 out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern (action 3882).\n\nRotational burning provided more consistent benefits than single burns, with prairies burned more than one to four years ago showing higher species richness and abundance of butterflies than recently burned areas (action 3883). Similarly, rotational grazing showed advantages over continuous grazing, with rotationally grazed grasslands having greater species richness and higher abundance of butterflies and burnet moths than continuously grazed areas (action 3965). Leaving unburned patches during prescribed burning increased abundance of six out of nine specialist butterfly species compared to sites without unburned areas (action 3879).", 'action_ids': ['3944', '3882', '3883', '3965', '3879']}
