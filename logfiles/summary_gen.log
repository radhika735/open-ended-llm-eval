For parrot's feather control using grass carp, environmental context appears to be a critical factor, as one replicated, controlled laboratory study in Portugal found that grass carp did not reduce biomass or cover of parrot's feather, while two replicated, randomized field studies in Argentina and the USA found that stocking with grass carp reduced the biomass or abundance of parrot's feather (Action 1599). This suggests that field conditions may be more favorable for grass carp effectiveness than controlled laboratory settings.

The feeding behavior and specificity of the biological control agent also influences success, as shown by a replicated laboratory and field study in South America where the South American weevil caused more feeding lesions on floating pennywort than on any other plant species, but field results found that the weevil did not reduce floating pennywort biomass (Action 1123), indicating that feeding damage does not always translate to effective population control.

For butterflies and moths, farms managed under AES (including options such as uncropped cultivated margins and wild bird seed plots) sometimes had higher abundance of butterflies and micro-moths than conventionally managed farms, yet comparisons of farms with larger versus smaller areas of in-field AES options often showed similar butterfly richness or abundance; wider field margins increased butterfly richness or abundance in some years [3923, 3930, 3926]. For bats, replicated paired-site studies in the UK found overall bat activity or occurrence often did not differ between AES and conventional farms, and in some cases was lower on AES farms; hedges trimmed \u22653 years prior had more bat species recorded and higher activity for some species than hedges trimmed the previous winter [962, 1943]. In wetland-focused options, raising water levels in ditches or grassland was associated with increased bird numbers (including breeding birds), plant species favoring wet conditions, and invertebrate numbers or biomass, with a UK review indicating that more expensive options like water-level control were more effective for providing habitat for wading birds than easier options [121]. Overall, evidence indicates that while several farm-level AES options can produce local gains, landscape-scale responses vary by taxon and implementation extent or placement [700, 24, 3923, 3926, 3930, 962, 1943, 121, 172].', 'action_ids': ['700', '172', '24', '3923', '962', '121', '3926', '1943', '3930']}

Specifically for birds, benefits include increased stone curlew breeding population size, northern lapwing hatching success, and Eurasian skylark nesting success (562). Uncropped margins, whether naturally regenerated or sown with wildflowers, have been shown to support a higher abundance and, in some cases, higher species richness of foraging bumblebees compared to cropped edges (19, 20, 562).

Studies also showed that hiding food around enclosures increased exploring and foraging behaviours in maned wolves along with other carnivore species (Action 1915).

One replicated study in Brazil found that scattered feeding increased locomotion in maned wolves (Action 1921). Another replicated study in Brazil demonstrated that maned wolves spent more time in sections of their enclosure with scattered food compared to sections with food presented on a tray (Action 1921). Studies also showed that hiding food around enclosures increased exploring and foraging behaviours in maned wolves along with other carnivore species (Action 1915). Regarding dietary composition, two studies in the USA found that a plant-derived protein diet increased digestible energy and dry matter digestibility but decreased mineral retention and plasma taurine levels in maned wolves compared to a supplemented animal-based protein diet (Action 1903). Additionally, studies on carnivores in general have demonstrated that providing food on a random temporal schedule reduced stereotypic pacing behaviours and increased behavioural diversity and alertness (Action 1904), while presenting food frozen in ice decreased abnormal or stereotypic behaviours and increased activity levels (Action 1923).", "action_ids": ["1921","1915","1903","1904","1923"]}
