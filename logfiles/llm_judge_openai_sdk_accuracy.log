INFO:root:Evaluation results: {'question': 'What are the most effective interventions for reducing bat fatalities at wind turbines?', 'answer': 'The most effective interventions for reducing bat fatalities at wind turbines are operational adjustments including preventing turbine blades from turning at low wind speeds (feathering) and increasing the wind speed at which turbines become operational (cut-in speed), both rated as beneficial based on strong evidence. Increasing cut-in speeds from the typical 3.5 m/s to 5.0-6.5 m/s significantly reduced bat mortality by 21-93% across multiple studies. Preventing turbine blades from turning at low wind speeds through feathering techniques also proved effective, reducing fatalities by 21-73% compared to conventional operations. Additionally, automatically reducing turbine blade rotation when bat activity is high has been identified as likely to be beneficial, with studies in Germany and the USA showing 25-92% reductions in fatalities. Slowing blade rotation at low wind speeds shows promise but has limited evidence, while ultrasonic deterrents have produced mixed and inconclusive results. These operational modifications balance conservation needs with energy production by targeting specific high-risk periods rather than continuous turbine shutdown, making them practical and cost-effective solutions for reducing bat mortality.', 'evaluation': {'accuracy_score_reason': ': "The answer provides an overall accurate and evidence-based overview. However, there is a **major citation issue for several key factual claims**: the specific percentage reductions (e.g., 2193 % or 2590 % reductions) and the exact wind-speed thresholds described are **not numerically supported anywhere within the provided action texts (see key messages)**. The actions only state that the interventions resulted in fewer bat fatalities, or similar qualitative language, but supply no data on the magnitude of the reductions. Including these precise figures without direct support from the provided evidence constitutes unsupported elaboration. Additionally, the citation 968 [deter bats with ultrasound] is used vaguely to imply the effectiveness is only mixed, but one of the three key-message entries within that action actually states the deterrent had **no significant effect**, making this reference minimally explanatory. Because unsupported quantitative claims and under-specified citations are **serious failures under the accuracy rules** (factual-support + citation-correctness), the best-fitting score is 1: the bulk may be factually correct, but the quantitative exaggerations and citation errors make it unfit for trust without verification."', 'action_ids_used_in_judgement': ['970', '1960', '2939', '971', '968'], 'final_accuracy_score': '1'}}

For example, studies have shown greater growth of scallops and absorption of salmon farm waste by blue mussels in some locations, as well as enhanced algal growth near fish farms, though at least one study found no evidence of shellfish feeding on fish waste, so results are inconsistent (932). Regulatory bans on the marine burial of persistent pollutants, such as those encompassing salmon farm-related waste, have been proposed, but there is no direct evidence assessing their effectiveness on environmental improvement specific to salmon farms (3595). Another general approachremoving pollutants from waste gases before environmental releasewas assessed in a different context (bogs) and produced mixed results for plant diversity, yet its application to salmon farming waste is not directly evidenced (1789).

For example, studies have shown greater growth of scallops and absorption of salmon farm waste by blue mussels in some locations, as well as enhanced algal growth near fish farms, though at least one study found no evidence of shellfish feeding on fish waste, so results are inconsistent (932). Regulatory bans on the marine burial of persistent pollutants, such as those encompassing salmon farm-related waste, have been proposed, but there is no direct evidence assessing their effectiveness on environmental improvement specific to salmon farms (3595). Another general approachremoving pollutants from waste gases before environmental releasewas assessed in a different context (bogs) and produced mixed results for plant diversity, yet its application to salmon farming waste is not directly evidenced (1789). While integrated aquaculture systems seem a promising method, regulatory solutions and gas waste removal also offer potential, although the best outcomes may arise from other, yet unassessed, interventions. Interestingly, despite awaiting full effectiveness assessments, integrated aquaculture could be most effective, yet the lack of direct evaluations makes both bans and modern filtration methods equally plausible as optimal actions depending on context (932, 3595, 1789).\n    Evaluate this answer.\n    '}], 'model': 'moonshotai/kimi-k2', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'Evaluation', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'accuracy_score_reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'A brief justification for the accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'action_ids_used_in_judgement': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'description': 'List of action IDs used in the reasoning for the score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'final_accuracy_score': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The final accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}}, 'required': ['accuracy_score_reason', 'action_ids_used_in_judgement', 'final_accuracy_score'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}}, 'extra_json': {'provider': {'require_parameters': True}}}

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done.

Changing tillage practicesespecially shifting to no-tillage or reduced tillageconsistently increases soil organic carbon compared to conventional ploughing, as demonstrated in multiple large and well-designed studies.

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done.

Manure alone also increased microbial biomass. One trial found increased microbial diversity.\nErosion: One controlled, replicated trial from India found that mixed amendments were more effective at reducing the size of cracks in dry soil than inorganic fertilizers alone or no fertilizer.\nSOC loss: Four controlled, randomized, replicated trials and one controlled trial from China and India found more organic carbon in soils with mixed fertilizers. Manure alone also increased organic carbon.

Of these, three randomized, replicated studies (two also controlled) found reduced nutrient loss and higher nitrogen levels when farmyard or poultry manure was applied. One also found lower nutrient loss when farmyard manure (rather than poultry manure or slurry) was applied in winter rather than autumn. One controlled replicated study found higher nitrate leaching.\nSoil organic carbon: Four studies (including three controlled, replicated studies (one also randomized) and a review) from India, Japan and the UK found higher carbon levels when manures were applied.\nSoil organic matter: One controlled, randomized, replicated study from Turkey found higher organic matter, larger soil aggregations and a positive effect on soil physical properties when manure and compost were applied.

Amending soil with chemical compounds such as nitrogen or phosphorus fertilizers also often raises soil organic matter or carbon levels, with evidence from several replicated and controlled studies, particularly when combined with organic material inputs; however, manure tends to be even more effective than chemical compounds alone (action_id: 909). Changing tillage practicesespecially shifting to no-tillage or reduced tillageconsistently increases soil organic carbon compared to conventional ploughing, as demonstrated in multiple large and well-designed studies. However, this method comes with trade-offs such as potential increases in soil compaction or mixed effects on drought resistance, nutrient retention, and yields (action_id: 906). Together, evidence supports that grazing reduction and careful management of nutrient amendments and tillage are key strategies for increasing soil organic carbon in loamy soils. \n\nReferences: action_id: 901, action_id: 909, action_id: 906.\n    Evaluate this answer.\n    '}], 'model': 'moonshotai/kimi-k2', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'Evaluation', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'accuracy_score_reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'A brief justification for the accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'action_ids_used_in_judgement': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'description': 'List of action IDs used in the reasoning for the score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'final_accuracy_score': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The final accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}}, 'required': ['accuracy_score_reason', 'action_ids_used_in_judgement', 'final_accuracy_score'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}}, 'extra_json': {'provider': {'require_parameters': True}}}

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done.

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention.

Amending soil with chemical compounds such as nitrogen or phosphorus fertilizers also often raises soil organic matter or carbon levels, with evidence from several replicated and controlled studies, particularly when combined with organic material inputs; however, manure tends to be even more effective than chemical compounds alone (action_id: 909). Changing tillage practicesespecially shifting to no-tillage or reduced tillageconsistently increases soil organic carbon compared to conventional ploughing, as demonstrated in multiple large and well-designed studies. However, this method comes with trade-offs such as potential increases in soil compaction or mixed effects on drought resistance, nutrient retention, and yields (action_id: 906). Together, evidence supports that grazing reduction and careful management of nutrient amendments and tillage are key strategies for increasing soil organic carbon in loamy soils. \n\nReferences: action_id: 901, action_id: 909, action_id: 906.\n    Evaluate this answer.\n    '}], 'model': 'moonshotai/kimi-k2', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'Evaluation', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'accuracy_score_reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'A brief justification for the accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'action_ids_used_in_judgement': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'description': 'List of action IDs used in the reasoning for the score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'final_accuracy_score': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The final accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}}, 'required': ['accuracy_score_reason', 'action_ids_used_in_judgement', 'final_accuracy_score'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}}, 'extra_json': {'provider': {'require_parameters': True}}}
