A study in France found a significant reduction in the number of recorded adults and juveniles following the shooting of metamorphosed individuals before reproduction when carried out as part of a combination treatment (action 1045).

Studies show that removing bullfrogs can benefit native species, with removal significantly increasing California red-legged frog populations and increasing leopard frog range (action 825).

However, twice-yearly full removal over four years still required large numbers of plants to be removed annually (Action ID: 1101). For floating pennywort (Hydrocotyle ranunculoides), a two-week physical removal program resulted in growth exceeding removal rates, and while mechanical digger removal plus monthly hand picking greatly reduced coverage, it did not achieve complete eradication (Action ID: 1126). These findings suggest that population size, plant age, frequency of removal, and use of combination treatments are key factors influencing success.', 'action_ids': ['1138', '1140', '1101', '1126']}

For black bullhead control, studies in the UK and USA reported that rotenone-containing piscicides achieved eradication, with one pond requiring two separate doses for complete control. However, the evidence base for biocide impacts is limited. No studies were found that evaluated the effects of using biocides or other chemicals to control invasive species on marine and freshwater mammal populations, and no studies were found assessing effects on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.

For leaving uncut strips of rye grass: Two reviews and two replicated controlled trials from the UK found that leaving uncut strips of rye grass on silage fields resulted in benefits to birds including increased numbers (Action 132). Seed-eating birds preferred rye grass cut once only, while insect-eating birds showed more variable results with some preferring plots cut two or more times (Action 132).

Water level management is a key technique, with raising water levels in ditches or grassland showing positive effects on wetland plants, invertebrates, and breeding birds (Action 121). Traditional water meadow maintenance involves managing water flow through irrigation systems, with studies from Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and UK showing increased bird populations and plant species richness (Actions 696, 3971, 119).\n\nVegetation management techniques include cutting or mowing, with 20 studies showing that cutting herbaceous plants can increase plant species richness and maintain stable vegetation communities. Summer cutting (June) was found to be particularly effective for maintaining vegetation stability.

For falcons, studies from Europe and elsewhere reported that local populations increased after nest-site installation in some cases, with high or equal-to-natural productivity often recorded, though other studies found lower productivity or non-use, and use and productivity could vary with box design and position (489). For owls, UK and European studies reported apparent local population increases following artificial nest installation and high or equal-to-natural breeding success in several cases, though other controlled studies found lower productivity, species interactions affecting success, or lower juvenile survival from artificial nests; use was at least as frequent as natural sites in some studies and varied with design and position in others (490).', 'action_ids': ['47', '81', '155', '494', '489', '490']}

There is a lack of evidence regarding the impact of introducing pre-stocked solitary bee nest boxes on farmland wildlife (81). For birds, providing nest boxes on agricultural land has been shown to boost the breeding numbers and clutches of species like the Eurasian kestrel and tree sparrow (155). These nest boxes on farmland have been observed to be inhabited by a variety of bird species, including the long-eared owl, common starling, tits, stock dove, jackdaw, Eurasian wryneck, and Eurasian hoopoe (155). The effectiveness of these bird nest boxes can be affected by their height and the availability of nearby pasture (155). Furthermore, a study focusing on European rollers in Spain noted a progressive increase in nest box use over time (494).', 'action_ids': ['47', '80', '81', '155', '494']}

For plant diversity, 14 of 24 studies found prescribed fire increased species richness and diversity of understory plants, while one study found it decreased species richness and nine found no effect or mixed effects (Action 1221).\n\nFor wildlife impacts, eight of 14 studies found no effect of prescribed forest fires on amphibian abundance or numbers of species, while four found mixed effects depending on species, season or year of burn, three found fires increased amphibian abundance, and one found abundance decreased (Action 877). For butterflies and moths, three of four studies found that coniferous forest burned within the last 20 years had higher species richness than unburned forest, while one study found similar species richness between burned and unburned sites (Action 3877). Two studies found pine forest restored by burning had higher butterfly abundance than unburned forest (Action 3877).\n\nAfter tree planting, two of four studies found prescribed fire increased survival and sprouting rate of planted trees, while one found fire decreased planted tree size and one found no effect (Action 1255). Bird studies in deciduous forests showed one study found similar bird species richness in burned and unburned aspen forests, though with changes in relative abundances of some species (Action 317).', 'action_ids': ['877', '1220', '1217', '3877', '1221', '1255', '317']}

The evidence base remains limited with many methods lacking systematic study in forest contexts.', 'action_ids': ['1229', '1314', '1228', '1196', '1195', '1277', '912']}

When sulphur was added alongside seeding in UK studies, it did not increase heather cover in most cases, had mixed effects on common heather, perennial rye-grass, and common bent cover, but increased heather seedling survival though survival remained very low after two years (Action 1710).', 'action_ids': ['3433', '3422', '3428', '1710']}

Mycorrhizal inoculation before seeding showed mixed results: one study found it initially increased vegetation cover but effects disappeared after three years, while another study found it increased the abundance of target conservation species and plant height, but did not affect plant species richness, overall abundance, or emergence rates (Action 3429). Adding topsoil before seeding increased plant species richness and the biomass of sown species in most cases, according to one study (Action 3420). When topsoil was added alongside seeding, it increased grass biomass but reduced forb biomass compared to adding topsoil alone (Action 1857). Conversely, removing topsoil before seeding increased plant species richness and community similarity to intact habitats, while also increasing the survival of seedlings and planted species (Actions 3415, 1711).

Regarding plant cover, one of two replicated, controlled studies in the USA, one of which was randomized, reported that increasing the number of species in a seed mix increased the cover of sown plant species, while the other study found no change (3406).\n\nWhen using seeds from a local source, one replicated study in the USA and Germany showed an increase in vegetation cover over time compared to areas sown with non-native seeds, but a decline in the density of individual plants (3400). Another replicated, randomized, controlled experiment in the USA found that sowing Sandberg bluegrass seeds from a local source did not affect the survival of sown plants compared to non-local varieties (3400). Furthermore, a replicated study in the USA and Italy indicated that sowing grassland seeds from a local source did not change vegetation height compared to sowing non-native grass seeds (3400).\n\nSowing native grass and forbs has shown some positive results in North American studies. Out of 28 studies, sixteen in Europe, North America, and New Zealand found an increase in overall plant species richness from sowing native grass and forb seeds (3432). Specifically in the USA, one replicated, controlled study found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased the species richness of native plants (3432). In terms of abundance, three of eight replicated, controlled studies in Europe and North America found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased overall vegetation cover, biomass, or density (3432). In the USA, two of three replicated, randomized, controlled studies found an increased cover of grass species, and three of four similar studies showed an increased cover or density of forb species (3432). Native plant species cover was also found to be increased in one replicated, controlled study in the USA (3432). Finally, one of two replicated, controlled studies in the USA and Germany found that sowing native seeds increased the number of emerged seedlings (3432).', 'action_ids': ['3406', '3400', '3432']}

Providing bones, hides or partial carcasses decreased stereotypic behaviours in lions and tigers (and Arctic foxes) and increased activity/manipulation time in felids (1902). Presenting food inside objects (e.g., Boomer balls) decreased stereotypic behaviours and increased exploratory/foraging in sloth and spectacled bears, though one case reported decreased exploring/foraging in a sloth bear (1924). Devices that simulate live prey had mixed effects: pacing decreased and walking increased in cougars, but pacing initially increased in tigers when a carcass was provided on a bungee (1927). Providing live vertebrate prey increased hunting and reduced sleeping in a fishing cat, but did not change stereotypical behaviours in tigers (1925). Allocating fast days was associated with more frequent pacing on non-feeding days in large felids (1906).","action_ids":["1923","1915","1902","1924","1927","1925","1906"]}

However, in a separate study, providing live fish to tigers did not result in any change in the occurrence of stereotypical behaviors (1925). The introduction of live invertebrate prey for fennec foxes was found to increase their explorative behaviors when compared to other forms of enrichment (1926). In a study focused on preparing captive mammals for release, black-footed ferrets that were fed live prairie dogs demonstrated a longer time to dispersal but greater subsequent movements after being released (2518).

Glyphosate controlled water primrose with 97% mortality when mixed with a non-oil based sticking agent and 100% mortality when combined with TopFilm (action 1139). Halosulfuron-methyl (Sempra) resulted in significant reduction in water primrose coverage (action 1139).\n\n**Herbicide Type for Parrot's Feather:**\n2,4-D reduced growth of parrot's feather and led to greater reduction compared to diquat, glyphosate or imazapyr (action 1606). The combined application of 2,4-D and MCPA completely eliminated parrot's feather (action 1606). Triclopyr reduced cover and led to greater reduction than glyphosate (action 1689). Other effective herbicides included carfentrazone-ethyl (action 1676), endothall (action 1681), diquat (action 1680), imazamox, imazapyr, glyphosate, gluphosinate-ammonium, flumioxazin, and florpyrauxifen-benzyl (action 1699). Some herbicides showed limited effectiveness: fluridone, clopyralid and copper chelate did not reduce growth (action 1699).\n\n**Use of Adjuvants:**\nFor water primrose, glyphosate showed differential effectiveness depending on adjuvant type - 97% mortality with non-oil based sticking agent versus 100% mortality when combined with TopFilm (action 1139). For water primrose, glyphosate combined with surface active agent Cygnet-Plus followed by mechanical removal achieved 75% kill rate (action 1140).\n\n**Application Factors:**\nConcentration affects effectiveness, as demonstrated with triclopyr TEA at 0.25% concentration achieving complete mortality in water primrose (action 1139). Some studies showed that effectiveness can vary between laboratory and field conditions, with some herbicides showing reduced effectiveness in field applications compared to laboratory studies (actions 1680, 1681).", 'action_ids': ['1139', '1676', '1681', '1680', '1606', '1689', '1699', '1140']}

Halosulfuron-methyl (Sempra) resulted in significant reduction in water primrose coverage (action 1139).\n\n**Herbicide Type for Parrot's Feather:**\n2,4-D reduced growth of parrot's feather and led to greater reduction compared to diquat, glyphosate or imazapyr (action 1606). The combined application of 2,4-D and MCPA completely eliminated parrot's feather (action 1606). Triclopyr reduced cover and led to greater reduction than glyphosate (action 1689). Other effective herbicides included carfentrazone-ethyl (action 1676), endothall (action 1681), diquat (action 1680), imazamox, imazapyr, glyphosate, gluphosinate-ammonium, flumioxazin, and florpyrauxifen-benzyl (action 1699). Some herbicides showed limited effectiveness: fluridone, clopyralid and copper chelate did not reduce growth (action 1699).\n\n**Use of Adjuvants:**\nFor water primrose, glyphosate showed differential effectiveness depending on adjuvant type - 97% mortality with non-oil based sticking agent versus 100% mortality when combined with TopFilm (action 1139). For water primrose, glyphosate combined with surface active agent Cygnet-Plus followed by mechanical removal achieved 75% kill rate (action 1140).\n\n**Application Factors:**\nConcentration affects effectiveness, as demonstrated with triclopyr TEA at 0.25% concentration achieving complete mortality in water primrose (action 1139). Some studies showed that effectiveness can vary between laboratory and field conditions, with some herbicides showing reduced effectiveness in field applications compared to laboratory studies (actions 1680, 1681).", "action_ids": ["1139","1676","1681","1680","1606","1689","1699","1140"]}

2025-09-17 15:05:56,309 - INFO - Final response (after hitting max iterations): Based on my search and the evidence I have gathered, I can now create a summary of what the evidence says about the effectiveness of providing supplementary food versus cover for farmland birds during winter.

From the evidence in the action documents:

The effectiveness of supplementary food versus cover for farmland birds during winter shows mixed results. For supplementary food (Action 648), nine studies from France, Sweden and the UK found that providing supplementary food increased farmland bird abundance, breeding population size, density, body mass, hatching, nestling growth and fledging rates, and increased overwinter survival of a declining house sparrow population. However, five replicated studies from the UK found that supplementary food had no clear effect on farmland bird breeding abundance, European turtle dove reproductive success, territory size or territory density, overwinter survival of three stable house sparrow populations, tree sparrow nest box use, or the abundance of weed seeds on the soil surface. Four studies found that the use of supplementary food by farmland birds varied between species and region, depended upon the time of year and proximity to other feeding stations and natural feeding areas.

For cover provision through wild bird seed or cover mixtures (Action 594), thirty individual studies were investigated, with twenty-one studies finding positive effects. Fourteen studies from the UK found that fields sown with wild bird cover mix had higher abundance, density, species diversity and species richness of birds than other farmland habitats. Six studies found that birds showed a preference for wild bird cover and used it significantly more than other habitats.

For overwinter stubbles as cover (Actions 695 and 203), eighteen studies investigated the effects, with thirteen studies finding evidence that leaving overwinter stubbles provides benefits including higher densities of farmland birds in winter, increased grey partridge productivity, and increased cirl bunting population size and territory density. However, three studies found only certain bird species showed positive associations with overwinter stubbles, and some studies found inconsistent or negative effects.

The evidence suggests that both supplementary food and cover provision can be effective for farmland birds during winter, but their effectiveness varies by species, location, and management approach.

Planting dedicated floral resources on farmland has shown substantial benefits, with fourteen trials in Europe and North America recording substantial numbers of wild bees foraging on perennial or annual sown flowering plants, particularly on patches sown with phacelia where all but one trial found substantial numbers of foraging wild bees and bumblebees, with six trials recording 8-35 bee species (Action ID: 17). Planting nectar flower mixture/wildflower strips has proven effective, with 80 individual studies investigating these strips and 64 showing benefits to wildlife groups, including 50 studies reporting positive effects on invertebrates with increased abundance and species richness (Action ID: 442).\n\nCreating beetle banks provides benefits to farmland biodiversity, with fourteen reports from eight studies finding positive effects on invertebrate densities, distribution, and higher ground beetle density and species diversity in spring and summer, though effects varied between specific grass species and invertebrate groups (Action ID: 651). Managing the agricultural landscape to enhance floral resources shows promise, with one large replicated controlled trial demonstrating that long-tongued bumblebee abundance on field margins was positively correlated with the number of pollen and nectar agri-environment agreements in a 10 km grid square (Action ID: 362).\n\nReducing chemical inputs supports invertebrate populations, with studies on restricting certain pesticides showing that using specific fungicides reduced chick food insect abundance less than others (Action ID: 565).

For birds, beetle banks showed mixed results - some evidence indicated birds used beetle banks and positive effects when combined with other conservation measures, while other studies found no farmland bird species associated with beetle banks (Action 651). Studies on butterflies and moths found that beetle banks had lower species richness of butterflies compared to hedgerows (Action 3927).\n\nFor hedgerows, evidence demonstrates stronger benefits. Newly planted hedges showed higher abundance, species richness and diversity of beetles and spiders compared to crop fields or field margins (Action 538). Established hedgerows had higher species richness of butterflies and macro-moths than beetle banks, crops or pasture (Action 3976). The abundance of butterflies, moths and macro-moths was higher along hedgerows than on beetle banks, grass margins, or field interiors (Action 3976). Hedgerows also increased small mammal abundance when established alongside arable land (Action 2383). For reptiles, cultivated areas with hedges had reptile communities more similar to forests than areas without hedges (Action 3519). Additionally, hedges trimmed three or more years prior had more bat species and higher activity of certain bat species than recently trimmed hedges (Action 1943).\n\nField margins provided additional evidence - uncropped cultivated margins benefited target farmland bird species, plants, invertebrates and mammals, including increased species richness and abundance across multiple taxa (Action 562). Plant diversity in field margins increased soprano pipistrelle and barbastelle bat activity (Action 1941).', 'action_ids': ['2393', '651', '3976', '3927', '538', '3519', '2383', '1943', '562', '1941']}

Wire fencing to exclude livestock from forest sections showed varied effectiveness across locations: four of eight studies in Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Israel, New Zealand, Spain, West Africa and the USA found increased biomass, species richness, density and cover of understory plants, while four studies found mixed effects or no effect (Action 1205). For tree regeneration specifically, three of four studies in Mexico, Kenya, Israel and Panama found that livestock exclusion increased the size and density of regenerating trees, while one study found decreased tree density but not tree size (Action 1205). Shortening grazing periods showed regional differences: one study in Spain found increased abundance and size of regenerating oak trees, one study in Australia found no effect on native plant species richness, and one study in the UK found higher numbers of tree seedlings following summer compared to winter grazing (Action 1208). Reducing grazing intensity also varied by location: studies in the UK found increased tree saplings and in Greece found increased understory biomass (Action 1207). Studies on ceasing livestock grazing in forest, open woodland and savanna showed that two studies in each of Argentina and Australia and one in Mexico had mixed results for reptile species richness and abundance (Action 3511).', 'action_ids': ['1206', '1205', '1208', '1207', '3511']}
