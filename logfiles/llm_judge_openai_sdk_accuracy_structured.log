Preventing bears from accessing anthropogenic food sources like garbage, crops, and pet food through bear-proof containers or exclusion methods is also likely beneficial for conflict reduction (ref: 2346). Conditioned taste aversion, which involves adding illness-inducing agents to problem foods at non-residential sites like orchards or campsites, shows promise in creating food aversions (ref: 2384). Enforcement measures for bear-proof garbage disposal demonstrate unknown effectiveness due to limited evidence (ref: 2345). Translocation of habituated bears is less recommended because it often leads to trade-offs - bears may return to conflict sites or re-offend after relocation (ref: 2341).\n    Evaluate this answer.\n    '}], 'model': 'moonshotai/kimi-k2', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'Evaluation', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'accuracy_score_reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'A brief justification for the accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'action_ids_used_in_judgement': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'description': 'List of action IDs used in the reasoning for the score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'final_accuracy_score': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The final accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}}, 'required': ['accuracy_score_reason', 'action_ids_used_in_judgement', 'final_accuracy_score'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}}, 'extra_json': {'provider': {'require_parameters': True}}}

Two studies conducted in the USA found that this method led black bears (as well as coyotes) to avoid the food items treated with these substances, suggesting its effectiveness in non-residential settings (2384). Another approach, providing diversionary feeding, was studied in the USA and Slovenia, and showed that it could reduce nuisance behaviour by black bears, as seen in before-and-after studies, though its effectiveness rating is still unknown (2323). Issuing enforcement notices to deter the use of non bear-proof garbage dumpsters was also tested in the USA, but a replicated, controlled study found it did not actually reduce garbage accessibility for black bears, and thus appears less beneficial (2345).\n    Evaluate this answer.\n    '}], 'model': 'moonshotai/kimi-k2', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'Evaluation', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'accuracy_score_reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'A brief justification for the accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'action_ids_used_in_judgement': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'description': 'List of action IDs used in the reasoning for the score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'final_accuracy_score': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The final accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}}, 'required': ['accuracy_score_reason', 'action_ids_used_in_judgement', 'final_accuracy_score'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}}, 'extra_json': {'provider': {'require_parameters': True}}}

Cleaning wastewater before it enters the environment has shown, in at least one case, to increase cover of low-nutrient mosses, suggesting it helps mitigate nutrient pollution (1778). Requiring mitigation for impacts to wetlands or swamps affected by aquaculture is rated as likely to be beneficial, with multiple studies indicating some wetland area is restored or preserved, though targets are not always fully met (3386). Modifying crop farming practices in watersheds has been studied for freshwater marshes, where abandonment of cropland altered plant communities compared to natural marshes, but evidence is limited (3166). Other actions, such as replacing or repairing anti-predator nets, mainly address wildlife conflict but may indirectly help by maintaining farm infrastructure (2774). For various other regulatory and pollutant removal actions, there is limited or no direct evidence on their effectiveness in this context (3595, 1789, 3179, 3169, 3167).\n    Evaluate this answer.\n    '}], 'model': 'moonshotai/kimi-k2', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'Evaluation', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'accuracy_score_reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'A brief justification for the accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'action_ids_used_in_judgement': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'description': 'List of action IDs used in the reasoning for the score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'final_accuracy_score': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The final accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}}, 'required': ['accuracy_score_reason', 'action_ids_used_in_judgement', 'final_accuracy_score'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}}, 'extra_json': {'provider': {'require_parameters': True}}}

Studies have shown that blue mussels can absorb waste from salmon farms, and scallops demonstrate greater growth when positioned near fish farms, suggesting these organisms can help reduce waste pollution by converting it into biomass (Action ID: 932). Additionally, enhanced algal growth has been observed when placed adjacent to fish farms, indicating that algae may also serve as natural biofilters for fish farm waste (Action ID: 932). Another strategy involves improving fish food and pellets to reduce aquaculture waste production at the source, though no studies have yet evaluated this intervention's effectiveness (Action ID: 2192). Water quality regulations for aquaculture systems could also be introduced and enforced to control pollution levels, although research on this approach is still lacking (Action ID: 3581). Some facilities may implement wastewater cleaning systems before discharge into the environment, which has shown some success in other contexts for reducing nutrient pollution (Action ID: 1778). Finally, artificial reefs can be strategically located near aquaculture systems to benefit from nutrient runoffs and potentially reduce the environmental impact of waste dispersal (Action ID: 2260).\n    Evaluate this answer.\n    "}], 'model': 'moonshotai/kimi-k2', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'Evaluation', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'accuracy_score_reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'A brief justification for the accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'action_ids_used_in_judgement': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'description': 'List of action IDs used in the reasoning for the score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'final_accuracy_score': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The final accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}}, 'required': ['accuracy_score_reason', 'action_ids_used_in_judgement', 'final_accuracy_score'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}}, 'extra_json': {'provider': {'require_parameters': True}}}

Cleaning wastewater through primary, secondary, and tertiary treatments (Action ID 1778)�including methods like filtration or wetland-based nutrient stripping�removes harmful pollutants like heavy metals or excess nutrients before environmental release, limiting contamination of water bodies. Establishing fallowing periods (Action ID 1027) involves periodically ceasing fish farming operations at sites for weeks to months, enabling natural dilution of accumulated waste such as organic matter and sediments, which supports sediment recovery and maintains biodiversity. Combining these strategies addresses direct waste by-products while reinforcing ecological balance in aquaculture zones. By tailoring treatments to specific pollutants and monitoring recovery during rest phases, pollution impacts from salmon farms can be substantially reduced.\n    Evaluate this answer.\n    '}], 'model': 'moonshotai/kimi-k2', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'Evaluation', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'accuracy_score_reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'A brief justification for the accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'action_ids_used_in_judgement': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'description': 'List of action IDs used in the reasoning for the score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'final_accuracy_score': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The final accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}}, 'required': ['accuracy_score_reason', 'action_ids_used_in_judgement', 'final_accuracy_score'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}}, 'extra_json': {'provider': {'require_parameters': True}}}

One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion.

Amending soil with chemical compounds such as nitrogen or phosphorus fertilizers also often raises soil organic matter or carbon levels, with evidence from several replicated and controlled studies, particularly when combined with organic material inputs; however, manure tends to be even more effective than chemical compounds alone (action_id: 909). Changing tillage practices�especially shifting to no-tillage or reduced tillage�consistently increases soil organic carbon compared to conventional ploughing, as demonstrated in multiple large and well-designed studies. However, this method comes with trade-offs such as potential increases in soil compaction or mixed effects on drought resistance, nutrient retention, and yields (action_id: 906). Together, evidence supports that grazing reduction and careful management of nutrient amendments and tillage are key strategies for increasing soil organic carbon in loamy soils. \n\nReferences: action_id: 901, action_id: 909, action_id: 906.\n    Evaluate this answer.\n    '}], 'model': 'moonshotai/kimi-k2', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'Evaluation', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'accuracy_score_reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'A brief justification for the accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'action_ids_used_in_judgement': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'description': 'List of action IDs used in the reasoning for the score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'final_accuracy_score': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The final accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}}, 'required': ['accuracy_score_reason', 'action_ids_used_in_judgement', 'final_accuracy_score'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}}, 'extra_json': {'provider': {'require_parameters': True}}}

Studies found increased soil carbon levels under cover crops, with further increases when legumes were included in the cover crop mix. Implementing reduced tillage or no-tillage practices significantly enhances soil organic carbon accumulation (Action 906). Twelve studies comparing no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems found consistently higher soil organic carbon in soils under reduced tillage systems, and the effectiveness is further enhanced when combined with cover cropping and manure application. Using crop rotation, especially when legumes are included, also proves beneficial (Action 857). Four studies found increased soil organic carbon under crop rotations, particularly when legumes were incorporated into the system. Applying mixed organic and inorganic amendments provides another effective approach (Action 902). Four controlled trials found more organic carbon in soils treated with mixed fertilizers compared to inorganic fertilizers alone. Additionally, applying manures and agricultural composts can increase soil carbon levels (Action 911), though this method requires careful consideration of potential trade-offs. Finally, formulated chemical compounds like nitrogen or phosphorus fertilizers can also contribute to soil organic matter increases (Action 909), with five of six studies showing increased soil organic matter when these compounds were applied to various soil types including loam.\n    Evaluate this answer.\n    '}], 'model': 'moonshotai/kimi-k2', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'Evaluation', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'accuracy_score_reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'A brief justification for the accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'action_ids_used_in_judgement': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'description': 'List of action IDs used in the reasoning for the score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'final_accuracy_score': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The final accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}}, 'required': ['accuracy_score_reason', 'action_ids_used_in_judgement', 'final_accuracy_score'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}}, 'extra_json': {'provider': {'require_parameters': True}}}

One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done. One randomized, replicated study from Portugal found no effect of tillage treatment on yield.\n\xa0\nSOIL TYPES COVERED: anthrosol, calcareous silt loam, chalky, clay, clay loam, fine sandy loam, loam, loamy-clay, loam - sandy loam, loam � silt-loam, loamy sand, loamy silt, non-chalky clay, sandy, sandy clay loam, sandy loam, sandy silt-loam, silt loam, silty, silty-clay, silty clay loam, silty loam.\n\nSynopsis Details:\nTitle: Soil Fertility\nDescription: Soils Synopsis\n\n\n907: Retain crop residues\nEffectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms\nKey Messages:\nBiodiversity: One replicated study from Mexico found higher microbial biomass when crop residues were retained.  \nErosion: One review found reduced water runoff, increased water storage and reduced soil erosion. One replicated site comparison from Canada found mixed effects on soil physical properties, including penetration resistance and the size of soil aggregates. One replicated study from the USA found that tillage can have mixed results on soil erosion when crop remains are removed.\nSoil organic matter: Two randomized, replicated trials from Australia and China found higher soil organic carbon and nitrogen when residues were retained.

Crop rotation (Action ID: 857) significantly boosts soil organic carbon through diverse crop sequences, particularly when legumes are included, as evidenced by four studies from Australia, Canada, and Denmark showing improved carbon levels in loamy soils (857). Cover cropping (Action ID: 898) enhances carbon sequestration by maintaining living roots and residue, with research from Denmark and Japan confirming higher soil carbon levels under cover crops, especially when legumes are incorporated (898). Reduced tillage (Action ID: 906) also increases soil organic carbon in loamy soils according to twelve global studies, though it carries trade-offs like potential yield impacts or erosion risks under certain conditions (906). Chemical amendments (Action ID: 909) show mixed results, with some trials reporting carbon gains from fertilizers but others indicating manure outperforms synthetic compounds (909). Organic farming (Action ID: 895) demonstrates inconsistent carbon benefits, and reduced grazing intensity (Action ID: 901) has limited evidence specific to loamy soils (901, 895). Prioritizing crop rotation and cover crops aligns with the strongest evidence for loamy soil carbon enhancement without significant drawbacks.\n    Evaluate this answer.\n    "}], 'model': 'moonshotai/kimi-k2', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'Evaluation', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'accuracy_score_reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'A brief justification for the accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'action_ids_used_in_judgement': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'description': 'List of action IDs used in the reasoning for the score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'final_accuracy_score': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The final accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}}, 'required': ['accuracy_score_reason', 'action_ids_used_in_judgement', 'final_accuracy_score'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}}, 'extra_json': {'provider': {'require_parameters': True}}}

Increasing cut-in speeds from the typical 3.5 m/s to 5.0-6.5 m/s significantly reduced bat mortality by 21-93% across multiple studies. Preventing turbine blades from turning at low wind speeds through feathering techniques also proved effective, reducing fatalities by 21-73% compared to conventional operations. Additionally, automatically reducing turbine blade rotation when bat activity is high has been identified as likely to be beneficial, with studies in Germany and the USA showing 25-92% reductions in fatalities. Slowing blade rotation at low wind speeds shows promise but has limited evidence, while ultrasonic deterrents have produced mixed and inconclusive results. These operational modifications balance conservation needs with energy production by targeting specific high-risk periods rather than continuous turbine shutdown, making them practical and cost-effective solutions for reducing bat mortality.', 'evaluation': {'accuracy_score_reason': "The answer contains multiple serious factual errors in the form of hallucinated statistics. For example, it claims that increasing cut-in speed reduced mortality by '21-93%' and that feathering reduced fatalities by '21-73%'. Neither Action 1960 nor 970 provides these percentages. Similarly, it claims automatic reduction of blade rotation led to '25-92% reductions in fatalities', which is not stated in Action 971. The answer also introduces an unsupported conclusion about the interventions being 'practical and cost-effective solutions', which is not mentioned in the source text. While the general ordering of interventions by effectiveness is correct, the inclusion of fabricated data makes the answer highly unreliable. According to the scoring rules, any factual error or hallucination limits the score to a maximum of 1.", 'action_ids_used_in_judgement': ['970', '1960', '2939', '971', '968'], 'final_accuracy_score': '1'}}

For example, studies have shown greater growth of scallops and absorption of salmon farm waste by blue mussels in some locations, as well as enhanced algal growth near fish farms, though at least one study found no evidence of shellfish feeding on fish waste, so results are inconsistent (932). Regulatory bans on the marine burial of persistent pollutants, such as those encompassing salmon farm-related waste, have been proposed, but there is no direct evidence assessing their effectiveness on environmental improvement specific to salmon farms (3595). Another general approach�removing pollutants from waste gases before environmental release�was assessed in a different context (bogs) and produced mixed results for plant diversity, yet its application to salmon farming waste is not directly evidenced (1789). While integrated aquaculture systems seem a promising method, regulatory solutions and gas waste removal also offer potential, although the best outcomes may arise from other, yet unassessed, interventions. Interestingly, despite awaiting full effectiveness assessments, integrated aquaculture could be most effective, yet the lack of direct evaluations makes both bans and modern filtration methods equally plausible as optimal actions depending on context (932, 3595, 1789).\n    Evaluate this answer.\n    '}], 'model': 'moonshotai/kimi-k2', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'Evaluation', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'accuracy_score_reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'A brief justification for the accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'action_ids_used_in_judgement': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'description': 'List of action IDs used in the reasoning for the score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'final_accuracy_score': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The final accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}}, 'required': ['accuracy_score_reason', 'action_ids_used_in_judgement', 'final_accuracy_score'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}}, 'extra_json': {'provider': {'require_parameters': True}}}

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done.

Amending soil with chemical compounds such as nitrogen or phosphorus fertilizers also often raises soil organic matter or carbon levels, with evidence from several replicated and controlled studies, particularly when combined with organic material inputs; however, manure tends to be even more effective than chemical compounds alone (action_id: 909). Changing tillage practices�especially shifting to no-tillage or reduced tillage�consistently increases soil organic carbon compared to conventional ploughing, as demonstrated in multiple large and well-designed studies. However, this method comes with trade-offs such as potential increases in soil compaction or mixed effects on drought resistance, nutrient retention, and yields (action_id: 906). Together, evidence supports that grazing reduction and careful management of nutrient amendments and tillage are key strategies for increasing soil organic carbon in loamy soils. \n\nReferences: action_id: 901, action_id: 909, action_id: 906.\n    Evaluate this answer.\n    '}], 'model': 'moonshotai/kimi-k2', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'Evaluation', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'accuracy_score_reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'A brief justification for the accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'action_ids_used_in_judgement': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'description': 'List of action IDs used in the reasoning for the score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'final_accuracy_score': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The final accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}}, 'required': ['accuracy_score_reason', 'action_ids_used_in_judgement', 'final_accuracy_score'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}}, 'extra_json': {'provider': {'require_parameters': True}}}

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done. One randomized, replicated study from Portugal found no effect of tillage treatment on yield.\n\xa0\nSOIL TYPES COVERED: anthrosol, calcareous silt loam, chalky, clay, clay loam, fine sandy loam, loam, loamy-clay, loam - sandy loam, loam � silt-loam, loamy sand, loamy silt, non-chalky clay, sandy, sandy clay loam, sandy loam, sandy silt-loam, silt loam, silty, silty-clay, silty clay loam, silty loam.\n\nSynopsis Details:\nTitle: Soil Fertility\nDescription: Soils Synopsis\n\n\n857: Use crop rotation\nEffectiveness rating: Beneficial\nKey Messages:\nBiodiversity: Four randomized, replicated trials from Canada, Portugal and Zambia measured the effect of including legumes in crop rotations and found the number of microbes and diversity of different soil animals increased.\nErosion: One randomized, replicated trial from Canada found that including forage crops in crop rotations reduced rainwater runoff and soil loss, and one replicated trial from Syria showed that including legumes in rotation increased water infiltration (movement of water into the soil).\nSoil organic carbon: Four studies from Australia, Canada, and Denmark (including two controlled replicated trials and one replicated site comparison study), found increased soil organic carbon under crop rotation, particularly when some legumes were included.\nSoil organic matter: Three of five replicated trials from Canada, Portugal and Syria (one also randomized, one also controlled and randomized), and one trial from the Philippines found increased soil organic matter, particularly when legumes were included in the rotation.

Manure alone also increased microbial biomass. One trial found increased microbial diversity.\nErosion: One controlled, replicated trial from India found that mixed amendments were more effective at reducing the size of cracks in dry soil than inorganic fertilizers alone or no fertilizer.\nSOC loss: Four controlled, randomized, replicated trials and one controlled trial from China and India found more organic carbon in soils with mixed fertilizers. Manure alone also increased organic carbon.

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done.

Amending soil with chemical compounds such as nitrogen or phosphorus fertilizers also often raises soil organic matter or carbon levels, with evidence from several replicated and controlled studies, particularly when combined with organic material inputs; however, manure tends to be even more effective than chemical compounds alone (action_id: 909). Changing tillage practices�especially shifting to no-tillage or reduced tillage�consistently increases soil organic carbon compared to conventional ploughing, as demonstrated in multiple large and well-designed studies. However, this method comes with trade-offs such as potential increases in soil compaction or mixed effects on drought resistance, nutrient retention, and yields (action_id: 906). Together, evidence supports that grazing reduction and careful management of nutrient amendments and tillage are key strategies for increasing soil organic carbon in loamy soils. \n\nReferences: action_id: 901, action_id: 909, action_id: 906.\n    Evaluate this answer.\n    '}], 'model': 'moonshotai/kimi-k2', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'Evaluation', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'accuracy_score_reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'A brief justification for the accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'action_ids_used_in_judgement': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'description': 'List of action IDs used in the reasoning for the score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'final_accuracy_score': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The final accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}}, 'required': ['accuracy_score_reason', 'action_ids_used_in_judgement', 'final_accuracy_score'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}}, 'extra_json': {'provider': {'require_parameters': True}}}

Amending soil with chemical compounds such as nitrogen or phosphorus fertilizers also often raises soil organic matter or carbon levels, with evidence from several replicated and controlled studies, particularly when combined with organic material inputs; however, manure tends to be even more effective than chemical compounds alone (action_id: 909). Changing tillage practices�especially shifting to no-tillage or reduced tillage�consistently increases soil organic carbon compared to conventional ploughing, as demonstrated in multiple large and well-designed studies. However, this method comes with trade-offs such as potential increases in soil compaction or mixed effects on drought resistance, nutrient retention, and yields (action_id: 906). Together, evidence supports that grazing reduction and careful management of nutrient amendments and tillage are key strategies for increasing soil organic carbon in loamy soils. \n\nReferences: action_id: 901, action_id: 909, action_id: 906.\n    Evaluate this answer.\n    '}], 'model': 'moonshotai/kimi-k2', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'Evaluation', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'accuracy_score_reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'A brief justification for the accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'action_ids_used_in_judgement': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'description': 'List of action IDs used in the reasoning for the score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'final_accuracy_score': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The final accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}}, 'required': ['accuracy_score_reason', 'action_ids_used_in_judgement', 'final_accuracy_score'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}}, 'extra_json': {'provider': {'require_parameters': True}}}

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done. One randomized, replicated study from Portugal found no effect of tillage treatment on yield.\n\xa0\nSOIL TYPES COVERED: anthrosol, calcareous silt loam, chalky, clay, clay loam, fine sandy loam, loam, loamy-clay, loam - sandy loam, loam � silt-loam, loamy sand, loamy silt, non-chalky clay, sandy, sandy clay loam, sandy loam, sandy silt-loam, silt loam, silty, silty-clay, silty clay loam, silty loam.\n\nSynopsis Details:\nTitle: Soil Fertility\nDescription: Soils Synopsis\n\n\n857: Use crop rotation\nEffectiveness rating: Beneficial\nKey Messages:\nBiodiversity: Four randomized, replicated trials from Canada, Portugal and Zambia measured the effect of including legumes in crop rotations and found the number of microbes and diversity of different soil animals increased.\nErosion: One randomized, replicated trial from Canada found that including forage crops in crop rotations reduced rainwater runoff and soil loss, and one replicated trial from Syria showed that including legumes in rotation increased water infiltration (movement of water into the soil).\nSoil organic carbon: Four studies from Australia, Canada, and Denmark (including two controlled replicated trials and one replicated site comparison study), found increased soil organic carbon under crop rotation, particularly when some legumes were included.\nSoil organic matter: Three of five replicated trials from Canada, Portugal and Syria (one also randomized, one also controlled and randomized), and one trial from the Philippines found increased soil organic matter, particularly when legumes were included in the rotation.

This forms part of the Conservation Evidence living evidence database. Each action is prefixed with a numerical id.\n\n    You are an expert evaluator of AI-generated answers to user questions about conservation.\n    You must assess accuracy of the answers strictly according to the rules below.\n\n    Your Task:\n    1) Read the user question, the AI-generated answer, and the relevant database actions.\n    2) Compare the answer against the database to see if it meets all accuracy criteria.\n    3) Construct a reasoning for which score to assign based on the accuracy criteria and scoring rules.\n    4) After you have formed the reasoning, assign a score from 0 to 5 following the scoring rules.\n    \n\n    Accuracy Criteria:\n    An answer is accurate if it satisfies all of the following:\n    1) Factual Support\n        Every statement is fully supported by the database.\n        No hallucinations, invented facts, overgeneralizations, or misinterpretations.\n        No unsupported conclusions drawn from otherwise correct facts.\n    2) Citation Correctness\n        Every statement is cited\n        Each cited action ID actually contains (or directly supports) the statement attributed to it.\n        No fabricated, non-existent, or irrelevant citations.\n        Repetition of citations is permitted.\n    3) Misleading Framing or Presentation (includes statement ordering)\n        The answer preserves meaning and context from the sources.\n        No omission of critical context that would change understanding.\n        No ambiguous language that could lead to incorrect interpretation.\n        No mixing of unrelated facts in a way that alters meaning.\n        Statements are well-ordered: \n            Important statements (those most directly responsive to the question and/or supported by stronger or more relevant evidence in the provided actions) should appear earlier. If the statement ordering materially shifts emphasis away from the most relevant/important evidence, treat this as misleading framing.\n            Signals of importance include: direct relevance to the question, clarity/strength of evidence as reflected in the provided key messages/effectiveness, breadth of support across actions, and specificity to the asked context.\n    4) Internal Consistency\n        No contradictions within the answer.\n\n    Scoring Rules (0 to 5):\n    5/5 � Perfect Accuracy: No factual errors; no misleading framing (including statement order); all citations correct  and all statements must be supported by citations.\n    4/5 � Minor Issues Only: All facts correct. Only small, low-impact citation issues. Only low-importance / less essential facts missing citations. No misleading framing.\n    3/5 � Factually Correct but Significant Citation Problems or Non-misleading Order Problems: All facts correct, but notable citation errors or missing citations for major facts, or notable prioritization issues in statement order that do not change meaning. No hallucinations.\n    2/5 � Meaning-Changing Misleading Framing: No hallucinations, but misleading framing that changes meaning (including materially misleading statement order). Citation issues may also be present.\n    1/5 � Serious Factual Errors: One or more factual inaccuracies, misleading framing, or citation problems. Cannot be trusted without major re-verification.\n\n    Severe penalty rules:\n        Any factual error or hallucination \u2192 score cannot exceed 1.\n        Any misleading framing that changes meaning \u2192 score cannot exceed 2.\n        Citation errors alone may reduce score depending on impact (from minor deductions to major if key facts lack correct citations).\n    Additional rules:\n        Repeated citations should NOT be penalised.\n\n    Output Requirements:\n\n    Your evaluation must include the following:\n    1) A short judgement evaluating the potential answer according to the scoring rules, which gives reasons behind which score should be assigned to the answer. This should reference specific statements, citations, or order issues as needed.\n    2) A list of the action ids you used in your judgement (unique list).\n    3) The final accuracy score you assign to the potential answer (i.e. "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5")\n    Format your answer as a valid JSON object with the following schema:\n    {\n        "accuracy_score_reasoning": str,\n        "action_ids_used_in_judgement": list[str],\n        "final_accuracy_score": "0|1|2|3|4|5"\n    }\n    '}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '\n    Here is a question: What are the most beneficial actions for reducing human-wildlife conflict with bears?\n    Here is a potential answer: The most effective bear conflict reduction strategies include deterrence techniques and preventing access to food sources, while translocation shows mixed results.\n\nScaring or deterring bears using projectiles, noisemakers, guard dogs, or unpleasant substances has proven beneficial in modifying bear behavior and reducing conflicts in human-occupied areas (ref: 2347). Preventing bears from accessing anthropogenic food sources like garbage, crops, and pet food through bear-proof containers or exclusion methods is also likely beneficial for conflict reduction (ref: 2346). Conditioned taste aversion, which involves adding illness-inducing agents to problem foods at non-residential sites like orchards or campsites, shows promise in creating food aversions (ref: 2384). Enforcement measures for bear-proof garbage disposal demonstrate unknown effectiveness due to limited evidence (ref: 2345). Translocation of habituated bears is less recommended because it often leads to trade-offs - bears may return to conflict sites or re-offend after relocation (ref: 2341).\n    Evaluate this answer.\n    '}], 'model': 'google/gemini-2.5-pro', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'Evaluation', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'accuracy_score_reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'A brief justification for the accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'action_ids_used_in_judgement': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'description': 'List of action IDs used in the reasoning for the score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'final_accuracy_score': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The final accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}}, 'required': ['accuracy_score_reason', 'action_ids_used_in_judgement', 'final_accuracy_score'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}}, 'extra_json': {'provider': {'require_parameters': True}}}

Preventing bears from accessing anthropogenic food sources like garbage, crops, and pet food through bear-proof containers or exclusion methods is also likely beneficial for conflict reduction (ref: 2346). Conditioned taste aversion, which involves adding illness-inducing agents to problem foods at non-residential sites like orchards or campsites, shows promise in creating food aversions (ref: 2384). Enforcement measures for bear-proof garbage disposal demonstrate unknown effectiveness due to limited evidence (ref: 2345). Translocation of habituated bears is less recommended because it often leads to trade-offs - bears may return to conflict sites or re-offend after relocation (ref: 2341).\n    Evaluate this answer.\n    '}], 'model': 'google/gemini-2.5-pro', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'Evaluation', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'accuracy_score_reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'A brief justification for the accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'action_ids_used_in_judgement': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'description': 'List of action IDs used in the reasoning for the score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'final_accuracy_score': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The final accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}}, 'required': ['accuracy_score_reason', 'action_ids_used_in_judgement', 'final_accuracy_score'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}}, 'extra_json': {'provider': {'require_parameters': True}}}

Another approach, providing diversionary feeding, was studied in the USA and Slovenia, and showed that it could reduce nuisance behaviour by black bears, as seen in before-and-after studies, though its effectiveness rating is still unknown (2323).

A replicated, controlled study in Australia\xa0found that ultrasonic sound deterrent units did not affect feeding location choices of dingoes. A study in Bangladesh\xa0found that domestic dogs accompanying people gave advance warning of tiger presence, enabling people to take precautionary actions. A study in Australia\xa0found that a motorised water pistol caused most dingoes to change direction or speed or move \u22655 m away, but sounding a horn did not.\n\nSynopsis Details:\nTitle: Terrestrial Mammal Conservation\nDescription: Terrestrial Mammal Conservation\n\n\n2346: Prevent mammals accessing potential wildlife food sources or denning sites to reduce nuisance behaviour and human-wildlife conflict\nEffectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial\nKey Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects of preventing mammals accessing potential wildlife food sources or denning sites to reduce nuisance behaviour and human-wildlife conflict.

The other two studies found that such actions did deter them from seeking food at human-occupied sites. Two of three studies, in the USA and Canada, found that chasing nuisance black bears with dogs and chasing elk with people or dogs caused them to stay away longer or remain further from human occupied areas. The other study found that attempts to scare coyotes did not cause them to avoid human occupied areas. A before-and-after study in Canada found that an electric fence prevented polar bear entry to a compound. A study in Canada found that chemical and acoustic repellents did not deter polar bears from baits in most cases. A replicated study in Tanzania found that drones caused African savanna elephants to quickly leave residential areas.\n\n\nSynopsis Details:\nTitle: Terrestrial Mammal Conservation\nDescription: Terrestrial Mammal Conservation\n\n\n2330: Exclude or limit number of visitors to reserves or protected areas\nEffectiveness rating: Beneficial\nKey Messages:\n\nFive studies evaluated the effects on mammals of excluding or limiting the number of visitors to reserves or protected areas.

Six studies were in the USA, two were in Canada, one was Russia, one was in India and one was in Romania.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (6 STUDIES)\n\nSurvival (6 studies):\xa0A controlled study in the USA found that grizzly bears translocated away from conflict situations had lower survival rates than did non-translocated bears.\xa0A replicated study study in the USA found that fewer than half of black bears translocated from conflict situations survived after one year. Two of three studies (two\xa0controlled), in the USA, found that after translocation away from urban sites, white-tailed deer survival was lower than that of non-translocated deer. The third study found that short-term survival was lower but long-term survival was higher than that of non-translocated deer. A study in Russia found that most Amur tigers translocated after attacking dogs or people did not survive for a year after release.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (6 STUDIES)\n\nHuman-wildlife conflict (6 studies): Five studies (including one controlled and two replicated studies), in the USA and Canada, of brown/grizzly or black bears translocated away from residential areas or human-related facilities, found that at least some returned to their original capture location and/or continued to cause nuisance. In two of the studies, most returned to their capture area and one black bear returned six times following translocation. A before-and-after study in India found that leopards translocated away from human-dominated areas, attacked more humans and livestock than before-translocation. A controlled study in Romania found that translocated brown bears occurred less frequently inside high potential conflict areas than outside, the opposite to bears that had not been translocated.\n\n\nSynopsis Details:\nTitle: Terrestrial Mammal Conservation\nDescription: Terrestrial Mammal Conservation\n\n\n2384: Use conditioned taste aversion to reduce human-wildlife conflict in non-residential sites\nEffectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial\nKey Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects on mammals of using conditioned taste aversion to reduce human-wildlife conflict in non-residential sites.

Cleaning wastewater before it enters the environment has shown, in at least one case, to increase cover of low-nutrient mosses, suggesting it helps mitigate nutrient pollution (1778). Requiring mitigation for impacts to wetlands or swamps affected by aquaculture is rated as likely to be beneficial, with multiple studies indicating some wetland area is restored or preserved, though targets are not always fully met (3386). Modifying crop farming practices in watersheds has been studied for freshwater marshes, where abandonment of cropland altered plant communities compared to natural marshes, but evidence is limited (3166). Other actions, such as replacing or repairing anti-predator nets, mainly address wildlife conflict but may indirectly help by maintaining farm infrastructure (2774). For various other regulatory and pollutant removal actions, there is limited or no direct evidence on their effectiveness in this context (3595, 1789, 3179, 3169, 3167).\n    Evaluate this answer.\n    '}], 'model': 'google/gemini-2.5-pro', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'Evaluation', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'accuracy_score_reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'A brief justification for the accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'action_ids_used_in_judgement': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'description': 'List of action IDs used in the reasoning for the score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'final_accuracy_score': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The final accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}}, 'required': ['accuracy_score_reason', 'action_ids_used_in_judgement', 'final_accuracy_score'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}}, 'extra_json': {'provider': {'require_parameters': True}}}

Studies have shown that blue mussels can absorb waste from salmon farms, and scallops demonstrate greater growth when positioned near fish farms, suggesting these organisms can help reduce waste pollution by converting it into biomass (Action ID: 932). Additionally, enhanced algal growth has been observed when placed adjacent to fish farms, indicating that algae may also serve as natural biofilters for fish farm waste (Action ID: 932). Another strategy involves improving fish food and pellets to reduce aquaculture waste production at the source, though no studies have yet evaluated this intervention's effectiveness (Action ID: 2192). Water quality regulations for aquaculture systems could also be introduced and enforced to control pollution levels, although research on this approach is still lacking (Action ID: 3581). Some facilities may implement wastewater cleaning systems before discharge into the environment, which has shown some success in other contexts for reducing nutrient pollution (Action ID: 1778). Finally, artificial reefs can be strategically located near aquaculture systems to benefit from nutrient runoffs and potentially reduce the environmental impact of waste dispersal (Action ID: 2260).\n    Evaluate this answer.\n    "}], 'model': 'google/gemini-2.5-pro', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'Evaluation', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'accuracy_score_reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'A brief justification for the accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'action_ids_used_in_judgement': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'description': 'List of action IDs used in the reasoning for the score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'final_accuracy_score': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The final accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}}, 'required': ['accuracy_score_reason', 'action_ids_used_in_judgement', 'final_accuracy_score'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}}, 'extra_json': {'provider': {'require_parameters': True}}}

Cleaning wastewater through primary, secondary, and tertiary treatments (Action ID 1778)including methods like filtration or wetland-based nutrient strippingremoves harmful pollutants like heavy metals or excess nutrients before environmental release, limiting contamination of water bodies. Establishing fallowing periods (Action ID 1027) involves periodically ceasing fish farming operations at sites for weeks to months, enabling natural dilution of accumulated waste such as organic matter and sediments, which supports sediment recovery and maintains biodiversity. Combining these strategies addresses direct waste by-products while reinforcing ecological balance in aquaculture zones. By tailoring treatments to specific pollutants and monitoring recovery during rest phases, pollution impacts from salmon farms can be substantially reduced.\n    Evaluate this answer.\n    '}], 'model': 'google/gemini-2.5-pro', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'Evaluation', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'accuracy_score_reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'A brief justification for the accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'action_ids_used_in_judgement': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'description': 'List of action IDs used in the reasoning for the score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'final_accuracy_score': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The final accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}}, 'required': ['accuracy_score_reason', 'action_ids_used_in_judgement', 'final_accuracy_score'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}}, 'extra_json': {'provider': {'require_parameters': True}}}

Amending soil with chemical compounds such as nitrogen or phosphorus fertilizers also often raises soil organic matter or carbon levels, with evidence from several replicated and controlled studies, particularly when combined with organic material inputs; however, manure tends to be even more effective than chemical compounds alone (action_id: 909). Changing tillage practicesespecially shifting to no-tillage or reduced tillageconsistently increases soil organic carbon compared to conventional ploughing, as demonstrated in multiple large and well-designed studies. However, this method comes with trade-offs such as potential increases in soil compaction or mixed effects on drought resistance, nutrient retention, and yields (action_id: 906). Together, evidence supports that grazing reduction and careful management of nutrient amendments and tillage are key strategies for increasing soil organic carbon in loamy soils. \n\nReferences: action_id: 901, action_id: 909, action_id: 906.\n    Evaluate this answer.\n    '}], 'model': 'google/gemini-2.5-pro', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'Evaluation', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'accuracy_score_reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'A brief justification for the accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'action_ids_used_in_judgement': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'description': 'List of action IDs used in the reasoning for the score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'final_accuracy_score': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The final accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}}, 'required': ['accuracy_score_reason', 'action_ids_used_in_judgement', 'final_accuracy_score'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}}, 'extra_json': {'provider': {'require_parameters': True}}}

One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done. One randomized, replicated study from Portugal found no effect of tillage treatment on yield.\n\xa0\nSOIL TYPES COVERED: anthrosol, calcareous silt loam, chalky, clay, clay loam, fine sandy loam, loam, loamy-clay, loam - sandy loam, loam  silt-loam, loamy sand, loamy silt, non-chalky clay, sandy, sandy clay loam, sandy loam, sandy silt-loam, silt loam, silty, silty-clay, silty clay loam, silty loam.\n\nSynopsis Details:\nTitle: Soil Fertility\nDescription: Soils Synopsis\n\n\n    Above is a document containing conservation actions, their effectiveness and key messages.

Studies found increased soil carbon levels under cover crops, with further increases when legumes were included in the cover crop mix. Implementing reduced tillage or no-tillage practices significantly enhances soil organic carbon accumulation (Action 906). Twelve studies comparing no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems found consistently higher soil organic carbon in soils under reduced tillage systems, and the effectiveness is further enhanced when combined with cover cropping and manure application. Using crop rotation, especially when legumes are included, also proves beneficial (Action 857). Four studies found increased soil organic carbon under crop rotations, particularly when legumes were incorporated into the system. Applying mixed organic and inorganic amendments provides another effective approach (Action 902). Four controlled trials found more organic carbon in soils treated with mixed fertilizers compared to inorganic fertilizers alone. Additionally, applying manures and agricultural composts can increase soil carbon levels (Action 911), though this method requires careful consideration of potential trade-offs. Finally, formulated chemical compounds like nitrogen or phosphorus fertilizers can also contribute to soil organic matter increases (Action 909), with five of six studies showing increased soil organic matter when these compounds were applied to various soil types including loam.\n    Evaluate this answer.\n    '}], 'model': 'google/gemini-2.5-pro', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'Evaluation', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'accuracy_score_reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'A brief justification for the accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'action_ids_used_in_judgement': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'description': 'List of action IDs used in the reasoning for the score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'final_accuracy_score': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The final accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}}, 'required': ['accuracy_score_reason', 'action_ids_used_in_judgement', 'final_accuracy_score'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}}, 'extra_json': {'provider': {'require_parameters': True}}}

Preventing bears from accessing anthropogenic food sources like garbage, crops, and pet food through bear-proof containers or exclusion methods is also likely beneficial for conflict reduction (ref: 2346). Conditioned taste aversion, which involves adding illness-inducing agents to problem foods at non-residential sites like orchards or campsites, shows promise in creating food aversions (ref: 2384). Enforcement measures for bear-proof garbage disposal demonstrate unknown effectiveness due to limited evidence (ref: 2345). Translocation of habituated bears is less recommended because it often leads to trade-offs - bears may return to conflict sites or re-offend after relocation (ref: 2341).\n    Evaluate this answer.\n    '}], 'model': 'google/gemini-2.5-pro', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'Evaluation', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'accuracy_score_reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'A brief justification for the accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'action_ids_used_in_judgement': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'description': 'List of action IDs used in the reasoning for the score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'final_accuracy_score': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The final accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}}, 'required': ['accuracy_score_reason', 'action_ids_used_in_judgement', 'final_accuracy_score'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}}, 'extra_json': {'provider': {'require_parameters': True}}}

Two studies conducted in the USA found that this method led black bears (as well as coyotes) to avoid the food items treated with these substances, suggesting its effectiveness in non-residential settings (2384). Another approach, providing diversionary feeding, was studied in the USA and Slovenia, and showed that it could reduce nuisance behaviour by black bears, as seen in before-and-after studies, though its effectiveness rating is still unknown (2323). Issuing enforcement notices to deter the use of non bear-proof garbage dumpsters was also tested in the USA, but a replicated, controlled study found it did not actually reduce garbage accessibility for black bears, and thus appears less beneficial (2345).\n    Evaluate this answer.\n    '}], 'model': 'google/gemini-2.5-pro', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'Evaluation', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'accuracy_score_reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'A brief justification for the accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'action_ids_used_in_judgement': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'description': 'List of action IDs used in the reasoning for the score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'final_accuracy_score': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The final accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}}, 'required': ['accuracy_score_reason', 'action_ids_used_in_judgement', 'final_accuracy_score'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}}, 'extra_json': {'provider': {'require_parameters': True}}}

Cleaning wastewater before it enters the environment has shown, in at least one case, to increase cover of low-nutrient mosses, suggesting it helps mitigate nutrient pollution (1778). Requiring mitigation for impacts to wetlands or swamps affected by aquaculture is rated as likely to be beneficial, with multiple studies indicating some wetland area is restored or preserved, though targets are not always fully met (3386). Modifying crop farming practices in watersheds has been studied for freshwater marshes, where abandonment of cropland altered plant communities compared to natural marshes, but evidence is limited (3166). Other actions, such as replacing or repairing anti-predator nets, mainly address wildlife conflict but may indirectly help by maintaining farm infrastructure (2774). For various other regulatory and pollutant removal actions, there is limited or no direct evidence on their effectiveness in this context (3595, 1789, 3179, 3169, 3167).\n    Evaluate this answer.\n    '}], 'model': 'google/gemini-2.5-pro', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'Evaluation', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'accuracy_score_reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'A brief justification for the accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'action_ids_used_in_judgement': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'description': 'List of action IDs used in the reasoning for the score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'final_accuracy_score': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The final accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}}, 'required': ['accuracy_score_reason', 'action_ids_used_in_judgement', 'final_accuracy_score'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}}, 'extra_json': {'provider': {'require_parameters': True}}}

Studies have shown that blue mussels can absorb waste from salmon farms, and scallops demonstrate greater growth when positioned near fish farms, suggesting these organisms can help reduce waste pollution by converting it into biomass (Action ID: 932). Additionally, enhanced algal growth has been observed when placed adjacent to fish farms, indicating that algae may also serve as natural biofilters for fish farm waste (Action ID: 932). Another strategy involves improving fish food and pellets to reduce aquaculture waste production at the source, though no studies have yet evaluated this intervention's effectiveness (Action ID: 2192). Water quality regulations for aquaculture systems could also be introduced and enforced to control pollution levels, although research on this approach is still lacking (Action ID: 3581). Some facilities may implement wastewater cleaning systems before discharge into the environment, which has shown some success in other contexts for reducing nutrient pollution (Action ID: 1778). Finally, artificial reefs can be strategically located near aquaculture systems to benefit from nutrient runoffs and potentially reduce the environmental impact of waste dispersal (Action ID: 2260).\n    Evaluate this answer.\n    "}], 'model': 'google/gemini-2.5-pro', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'Evaluation', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'accuracy_score_reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'A brief justification for the accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'action_ids_used_in_judgement': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'description': 'List of action IDs used in the reasoning for the score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'final_accuracy_score': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The final accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}}, 'required': ['accuracy_score_reason', 'action_ids_used_in_judgement', 'final_accuracy_score'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}}, 'extra_json': {'provider': {'require_parameters': True}}}

Cleaning wastewater through primary, secondary, and tertiary treatments (Action ID 1778)including methods like filtration or wetland-based nutrient strippingremoves harmful pollutants like heavy metals or excess nutrients before environmental release, limiting contamination of water bodies. Establishing fallowing periods (Action ID 1027) involves periodically ceasing fish farming operations at sites for weeks to months, enabling natural dilution of accumulated waste such as organic matter and sediments, which supports sediment recovery and maintains biodiversity. Combining these strategies addresses direct waste by-products while reinforcing ecological balance in aquaculture zones. By tailoring treatments to specific pollutants and monitoring recovery during rest phases, pollution impacts from salmon farms can be substantially reduced.\n    Evaluate this answer.\n    '}], 'model': 'google/gemini-2.5-pro', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'Evaluation', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'accuracy_score_reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'A brief justification for the accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'action_ids_used_in_judgement': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'description': 'List of action IDs used in the reasoning for the score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'final_accuracy_score': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The final accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}}, 'required': ['accuracy_score_reason', 'action_ids_used_in_judgement', 'final_accuracy_score'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}}, 'extra_json': {'provider': {'require_parameters': True}}}

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done.

Amending soil with chemical compounds such as nitrogen or phosphorus fertilizers also often raises soil organic matter or carbon levels, with evidence from several replicated and controlled studies, particularly when combined with organic material inputs; however, manure tends to be even more effective than chemical compounds alone (action_id: 909). Changing tillage practicesespecially shifting to no-tillage or reduced tillageconsistently increases soil organic carbon compared to conventional ploughing, as demonstrated in multiple large and well-designed studies. However, this method comes with trade-offs such as potential increases in soil compaction or mixed effects on drought resistance, nutrient retention, and yields (action_id: 906). Together, evidence supports that grazing reduction and careful management of nutrient amendments and tillage are key strategies for increasing soil organic carbon in loamy soils. \n\nReferences: action_id: 901, action_id: 909, action_id: 906.\n    Evaluate this answer.\n    '}], 'model': 'google/gemini-2.5-pro', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'Evaluation', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'accuracy_score_reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'A brief justification for the accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'action_ids_used_in_judgement': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'description': 'List of action IDs used in the reasoning for the score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'final_accuracy_score': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The final accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}}, 'required': ['accuracy_score_reason', 'action_ids_used_in_judgement', 'final_accuracy_score'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}}, 'extra_json': {'provider': {'require_parameters': True}}}

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing.

Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done.

Studies found increased soil carbon levels under cover crops, with further increases when legumes were included in the cover crop mix. Implementing reduced tillage or no-tillage practices significantly enhances soil organic carbon accumulation (Action 906). Twelve studies comparing no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems found consistently higher soil organic carbon in soils under reduced tillage systems, and the effectiveness is further enhanced when combined with cover cropping and manure application. Using crop rotation, especially when legumes are included, also proves beneficial (Action 857). Four studies found increased soil organic carbon under crop rotations, particularly when legumes were incorporated into the system. Applying mixed organic and inorganic amendments provides another effective approach (Action 902). Four controlled trials found more organic carbon in soils treated with mixed fertilizers compared to inorganic fertilizers alone. Additionally, applying manures and agricultural composts can increase soil carbon levels (Action 911), though this method requires careful consideration of potential trade-offs. Finally, formulated chemical compounds like nitrogen or phosphorus fertilizers can also contribute to soil organic matter increases (Action 909), with five of six studies showing increased soil organic matter when these compounds were applied to various soil types including loam.\n    Evaluate this answer.\n    '}], 'model': 'google/gemini-2.5-pro', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'Evaluation', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'accuracy_score_reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'A brief justification for the accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'action_ids_used_in_judgement': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'description': 'List of action IDs used in the reasoning for the score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'final_accuracy_score': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The final accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}}, 'required': ['accuracy_score_reason', 'action_ids_used_in_judgement', 'final_accuracy_score'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}}, 'extra_json': {'provider': {'require_parameters': True}}}

Crop rotation (Action ID: 857) significantly boosts soil organic carbon through diverse crop sequences, particularly when legumes are included, as evidenced by four studies from Australia, Canada, and Denmark showing improved carbon levels in loamy soils (857). Cover cropping (Action ID: 898) enhances carbon sequestration by maintaining living roots and residue, with research from Denmark and Japan confirming higher soil carbon levels under cover crops, especially when legumes are incorporated (898). Reduced tillage (Action ID: 906) also increases soil organic carbon in loamy soils according to twelve global studies, though it carries trade-offs like potential yield impacts or erosion risks under certain conditions (906). Chemical amendments (Action ID: 909) show mixed results, with some trials reporting carbon gains from fertilizers but others indicating manure outperforms synthetic compounds (909). Organic farming (Action ID: 895) demonstrates inconsistent carbon benefits, and reduced grazing intensity (Action ID: 901) has limited evidence specific to loamy soils (901, 895). Prioritizing crop rotation and cover crops aligns with the strongest evidence for loamy soil carbon enhancement without significant drawbacks.\n    Evaluate this answer.\n    "}], 'model': 'google/gemini-2.5-pro', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'Evaluation', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'accuracy_score_reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'A brief justification for the accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'action_ids_used_in_judgement': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'description': 'List of action IDs used in the reasoning for the score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'final_accuracy_score': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The final accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}}, 'required': ['accuracy_score_reason', 'action_ids_used_in_judgement', 'final_accuracy_score'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}}, 'extra_json': {'provider': {'require_parameters': True}}}

Preventing bears from accessing anthropogenic food sources like garbage, crops, and pet food through bear-proof containers or exclusion methods is also likely beneficial for conflict reduction (ref: 2346). Conditioned taste aversion, which involves adding illness-inducing agents to problem foods at non-residential sites like orchards or campsites, shows promise in creating food aversions (ref: 2384). Enforcement measures for bear-proof garbage disposal demonstrate unknown effectiveness due to limited evidence (ref: 2345). Translocation of habituated bears is less recommended because it often leads to trade-offs - bears may return to conflict sites or re-offend after relocation (ref: 2341).\n    Evaluate this answer.\n    '}], 'model': 'qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-thinking-2507', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'Evaluation', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'accuracy_score_reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'A brief justification for the accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'action_ids_used_in_judgement': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'description': 'List of action IDs used in the reasoning for the score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'final_accuracy_score': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The final accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}}, 'required': ['accuracy_score_reason', 'action_ids_used_in_judgement', 'final_accuracy_score'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}}, 'extra_json': {'provider': {'require_parameters': True}}}

Preventing bears from accessing anthropogenic food sources like garbage, crops, and pet food through bear-proof containers or exclusion methods is also likely beneficial for conflict reduction (ref: 2346). Conditioned taste aversion, which involves adding illness-inducing agents to problem foods at non-residential sites like orchards or campsites, shows promise in creating food aversions (ref: 2384). Enforcement measures for bear-proof garbage disposal demonstrate unknown effectiveness due to limited evidence (ref: 2345). Translocation of habituated bears is less recommended because it often leads to trade-offs - bears may return to conflict sites or re-offend after relocation (ref: 2341).\n    Evaluate this answer.\n    '}], 'model': 'qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-thinking-2507', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'Evaluation', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'accuracy_score_reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'A brief justification for the accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'action_ids_used_in_judgement': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'description': 'List of action IDs used in the reasoning for the score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'final_accuracy_score': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The final accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}}, 'required': ['accuracy_score_reason', 'action_ids_used_in_judgement', 'final_accuracy_score'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}}, 'extra_json': {'provider': {'order': ['deepinfra/fp8'], 'allow_fallbacks': False}}}

Preventing bears from accessing anthropogenic food sources like garbage, crops, and pet food through bear-proof containers or exclusion methods is also likely beneficial for conflict reduction (ref: 2346). Conditioned taste aversion, which involves adding illness-inducing agents to problem foods at non-residential sites like orchards or campsites, shows promise in creating food aversions (ref: 2384). Enforcement measures for bear-proof garbage disposal demonstrate unknown effectiveness due to limited evidence (ref: 2345). Translocation of habituated bears is less recommended because it often leads to trade-offs - bears may return to conflict sites or re-offend after relocation (ref: 2341).\n    Evaluate this answer.\n    '}], 'model': 'qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-thinking-2507', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'Evaluation', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'accuracy_score_reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'A brief justification for the accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'action_ids_used_in_judgement': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'description': 'List of action IDs used in the reasoning for the score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'final_accuracy_score': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The final accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}}, 'required': ['accuracy_score_reason', 'action_ids_used_in_judgement', 'final_accuracy_score'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}}, 'extra_json': {'provider': {'order': ['deepinfra/fp8'], 'allow_fallbacks': False}}}

Preventing bears from accessing anthropogenic food sources like garbage, crops, and pet food through bear-proof containers or exclusion methods is also likely beneficial for conflict reduction (ref: 2346). Conditioned taste aversion, which involves adding illness-inducing agents to problem foods at non-residential sites like orchards or campsites, shows promise in creating food aversions (ref: 2384). Enforcement measures for bear-proof garbage disposal demonstrate unknown effectiveness due to limited evidence (ref: 2345). Translocation of habituated bears is less recommended because it often leads to trade-offs - bears may return to conflict sites or re-offend after relocation (ref: 2341).\n    Evaluate this answer.\n    '}], 'model': 'qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-thinking-2507', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'Evaluation', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'accuracy_score_reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'A brief justification for the accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'action_ids_used_in_judgement': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'description': 'List of action IDs used in the reasoning for the score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'final_accuracy_score': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The final accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}}, 'required': ['accuracy_score_reason', 'action_ids_used_in_judgement', 'final_accuracy_score'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}}, 'extra_json': {'provider': {'order': ['deepinfra/fp8'], 'allow_fallbacks': False}}}

In two of the studies, most returned to their capture area and one black bear returned six times following translocation. A before-and-after study in India found that leopards translocated away from human-dominated areas, attacked more humans and livestock than before-translocation. A controlled study in Romania found that translocated brown bears occurred less frequently inside high potential conflict areas than outside, the opposite to bears that had not been translocated.\n\n\nSynopsis Details:\nTitle: Terrestrial Mammal Conservation\nDescription: Terrestrial Mammal Conservation\n\n\n    Above is a document containing conservation actions, their effectiveness and key messages.

Preventing bears from accessing anthropogenic food sources like garbage, crops, and pet food through bear-proof containers or exclusion methods is also likely beneficial for conflict reduction (ref: 2346). Conditioned taste aversion, which involves adding illness-inducing agents to problem foods at non-residential sites like orchards or campsites, shows promise in creating food aversions (ref: 2384). Enforcement measures for bear-proof garbage disposal demonstrate unknown effectiveness due to limited evidence (ref: 2345). Translocation of habituated bears is less recommended because it often leads to trade-offs - bears may return to conflict sites or re-offend after relocation (ref: 2341).\n    Evaluate this answer.\n    '}], 'model': 'qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-thinking-2507', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'Evaluation', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'accuracy_score_reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'A brief justification for the accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'action_ids_used_in_judgement': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'description': 'List of action IDs used in the reasoning for the score assigned to the potential answer.'}, 'final_accuracy_score': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The final accuracy score assigned to the potential answer.'}}, 'required': ['accuracy_score_reason', 'action_ids_used_in_judgement', 'final_accuracy_score'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}}, 'extra_json': {'provider': {'order': ['deepinfra/fp8'], 'allow_fallbacks': False}}}

Two of three studies (two\xa0controlled), in the USA, found that after translocation away from urban sites, white-tailed deer survival was lower than that of non-translocated deer. The third study found that short-term survival was lower but long-term survival was higher than that of non-translocated deer. A study in Russia found that most Amur tigers translocated after attacking dogs or people did not survive for a year after release.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (6 STUDIES)\n\nHuman-wildlife conflict (6 studies): Five studies (including one controlled and two replicated studies), in the USA and Canada, of brown/grizzly or black bears translocated away from residential areas or human-related facilities, found that at least some returned to their original capture location and/or continued to cause nuisance. In two of the studies, most returned to their capture area and one black bear returned six times following translocation. A before-and-after study in India found that leopards translocated away from human-dominated areas, attacked more humans and livestock than before-translocation. A controlled study in Romania found that translocated brown bears occurred less frequently inside high potential conflict areas than outside, the opposite to bears that had not been translocated.\n\n\nSynopsis Details:\nTitle: Terrestrial Mammal Conservation\nDescription: Terrestrial Mammal Conservation\n\n\n2346: Prevent mammals accessing potential wildlife food sources or denning sites to reduce nuisance behaviour and human-wildlife conflict\nEffectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial\nKey Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects of preventing mammals accessing potential wildlife food sources or denning sites to reduce nuisance behaviour and human-wildlife conflict.

The other two studies found that such actions did deter them from seeking food at human-occupied sites. Two of three studies, in the USA and Canada, found that chasing nuisance black bears with dogs and chasing elk with people or dogs caused them to stay away longer or remain further from human occupied areas. The other study found that attempts to scare coyotes did not cause them to avoid human occupied areas. A before-and-after study in Canada found that an electric fence prevented polar bear entry to a compound. A study in Canada found that chemical and acoustic repellents did not deter polar bears from baits in most cases. A replicated study in Tanzania found that drones caused African savanna elephants to quickly leave residential areas.\n\n\nSynopsis Details:\nTitle: Terrestrial Mammal Conservation\nDescription: Terrestrial Mammal Conservation\n\n\n2384: Use conditioned taste aversion to reduce human-wildlife conflict in non-residential sites\nEffectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial\nKey Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects on mammals of using conditioned taste aversion to reduce human-wildlife conflict in non-residential sites.
