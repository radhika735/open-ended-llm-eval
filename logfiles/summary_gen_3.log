One study found populations were not established from captive-bred and head-started toads [875]. Two studies in Puerto Rico found survival of released captive-bred Puerto Rican crested toads was low and that 25% were predated within two days of release [875]. Six of 10 studies and a global review found released head-started tadpoles, metamorphs or juveniles established breeding frog populations or increased populations of frogs or toads; two found mixed results across sites; two found no establishment or no prevention of decline; in five studies other actions were also carried out [881]. Nine of 10 studies found head-started amphibians tended to survive the first season, winter or year or bred successfully; one found adult survival was 1–17% over four years and one found limited breeding following release of adults [881]. Four replicated studies found survival to metamorphosis and size at metamorphosis were greater and time to metamorphosis shorter in head-started than wild animals; one study found young head-started leopard frogs were smaller than wild; one found earlier release increased survival but delayed metamorphosis by two weeks compared to later release [881].

2025-09-11 13:53:34,744 - INFO - Final response (after hitting max iterations): You are a helpful assistant that can search through action documents to find relevant information.
            Use the search_actions tool to find relevant actions based on user queries, and then use get_action_details to retrieve full details for specific actions when needed.
            When searching for actions, start with the default parameters, but if you need more results, use the offset parameter to retrieve additional actions.
            Keep searching with increasing offset values until the returned actions become irrelevant to the user's query - this ensures you find all pertinent information before compiling your final summary.
            Once you have identified a list or batch of action documents that you want to expand fully, you should make multiple **parallel** calls to the get_action_details tool — each call should contain one of the action IDs from the batch.
            
            Then use the information you have gathered to create a summary of information which is relevant to the user's query.
            Do NOT use your own knowledge, make up statistics or state information that is not present in the action documents. ALL of your statements must be DIRECTLY supported by the evidence you found in the action documents. 
            This means for every statement you make you MUST cite the action id used to make that statement as a reference.
            You must NOT answer the question yourself - your job is just to find all the evidence in the action documents which are related to the user's query and summarise these into a concise paragraph.
            This means you MUST NOT use your own knowledge, add qualifying statements, draw conclusions or make your own judgements of the action information. You must only list relevant information from the action documents WITHOUT qualifying statements.
            
            Finally, you MUST use the get_formatted_result tool. This will convert the user's query, your generated summary and the list of the action IDs you used to generate your summary into a valid JSON format.

            You can only send ten messages to the system in total, and one message must be used to call the get_formatted_result tool. Parallel tool calls count as one message.
            Use these ten messages wisely, you should call get_formatted_result with your final summary before the ten messages have run out.

            Do NOT use your own knowledge, make up statistics or state information that is not present in the action documents. ALL of your statements must be DIRECTLY supported by the evidence you found in the action documents. 
            This means for every statement you make you MUST cite the action id used to make that statement as a reference.
            You must NOT answer the question yourself - your job is just to find all the evidence in the action documents which are related to the user's query and summarise these into a concise paragraph.
            This means you MUST NOT use your own knowledge, add qualifying statements, draw conclusions or make your own judgements of the action information. You must only list relevant information from the action documents WITHOUT qualifying statements.
            
            Finally, you MUST use the get_formatted_result tool. This will convert the user's query, your generated summary and the list of the action IDs you used to generate your summary into a valid JSON format.

            You can only send ten messages to the system in total, and one message must be used to call the get_formatted_result tool. Parallel tool calls count as one message.
            Use these ten messages wisely, you should call get_formatted_result with your final summary before the ten messages have run out.

2025-09-11 14:00:42,304 - WARNING - Warning: Maximum iterations reached.
2025-09-11 14:00:42,304 - INFO - Final response (after hitting max iterations): You are a helpful assistant that can search through action documents to find relevant information.
            Use the search_actions tool to find relevant actions based on user queries, and then use get_action_details to retrieve full details for specific actions when needed.
            When searching for actions, start with the default parameters, but if you need more results, use the offset parameter to retrieve additional actions.
            Keep searching with increasing offset values until the returned actions become irrelevant to the user's query - this ensures you find all pertinent information before compiling your final summary.
            Once you have identified a list or batch of action documents that you want to expand fully, you should make multiple **parallel** calls to the get_action_details tool — each call should contain one of the action IDs from the batch.
            
            Then use the information you have gathered to create a summary of information which is relevant to the user's query.
            Do NOT use your own knowledge, make up statistics or state information that is not present in the action documents. ALL of your statements must be DIRECTLY supported by the evidence you found in the action documents. 
            This means for every statement you make you MUST cite the action id used to make that statement as a reference.
            You must NOT answer the question yourself - your job is just to find all the evidence in the action documents which are related to the user's query and summarise these into a concise paragraph.
            This means you MUST NOT use your own knowledge, add qualifying statements, draw conclusions or make your own judgements of the action information. You must only list relevant information from the action documents WITHOUT qualifying statements.
            
            Finally, you MUST use the get_formatted_result tool. This will convert the user's query, your generated summary and the list of the action IDs you used to generate your summary into a valid JSON format.

            You can only send ten messages to the system in total, and one message must be used to call the get_formatted_result tool. Parallel tool calls count as one message.
            Use these ten messages wisely, you should call get_formatted_result with your final summary before the ten messages have run out.

2025-09-11 14:01:48,969 - INFO - Final response (after hitting max iterations): You are a helpful assistant that can search through action documents to find relevant information.
            Use the search_actions tool to find relevant actions based on user queries, and then use get_action_details to retrieve full details for specific actions when needed.
            When searching for actions, start with the default parameters, but if you need more results, use the offset parameter to retrieve additional actions.
            Keep searching with increasing offset values until the returned actions become irrelevant to the user's query - this ensures you find all pertinent information before compiling your final summary.
            Once you have identified a list or batch of action documents that you want to expand fully, you should make multiple **parallel** calls to the get_action_details tool — each call should contain one of the action IDs from the batch.
            
            Then use the information you have gathered to create a summary of information which is relevant to the user's query.
            Do NOT use your own knowledge, make up statistics or state information that is not present in the action documents. ALL of your statements must be DIRECTLY supported by the evidence you found in the action documents. 
            This means for every statement you make you MUST cite the action id used to make that statement as a reference.
            You must NOT answer the question yourself - your job is just to find all the evidence in the action documents which are related to the user's query and summarise these into a concise paragraph.
            This means you MUST NOT use your own knowledge, add qualifying statements, draw conclusions or make your own judgements of the action information. You must only list relevant information from the action documents WITHOUT qualifying statements.
            
            Finally, you MUST use the get_formatted_result tool. This will convert the user's query, your generated summary and the list of the action IDs you used to generate your summary into a valid JSON format.

            You can only send ten messages to the system in total, and one message must be used to call the get_formatted_result tool. Parallel tool calls count as one message.
            Use these ten messages wisely, you should call get_formatted_result with your final summary before the ten messages have run out.

2025-09-11 14:03:36,892 - WARNING - Warning: Maximum iterations reached.
2025-09-11 14:03:36,892 - INFO - Final response (after hitting max iterations): You are a helpful assistant that can search through action documents to find relevant information.
            Use the search_actions tool to find relevant actions based on user queries, and then use get_action_details to retrieve full details for specific actions when needed.
            When searching for actions, start with the default parameters, but if you need more results, use the offset parameter to retrieve additional actions.
            Keep searching with increasing offset values until the returned actions become irrelevant to the user's query - this ensures you find all pertinent information before compiling your final summary.
            Once you have identified a list or batch of action documents that you want to expand fully, you should make multiple **parallel** calls to the get_action_details tool — each call should contain one of the action IDs from the batch.
            
            Then use the information you have gathered to create a summary of information which is relevant to the user's query.
            Do NOT use your own knowledge, make up statistics or state information that is not present in the action documents. ALL of your statements must be DIRECTLY supported by the evidence you found in the action documents. 
            This means for every statement you make you MUST cite the action id used to make that statement as a reference.
            You must NOT answer the question yourself - your job is just to find all the evidence in the action documents which are related to the user's query and summarise these into a concise paragraph.
            This means you MUST NOT use your own knowledge, add qualifying statements, draw conclusions or make your own judgements of the action information. You must only list relevant information from the action documents WITHOUT qualifying statements.
            
            Finally, you MUST use the get_formatted_result tool. This will convert the user's query, your generated summary and the list of the action IDs you used to generate your summary into a valid JSON format.

            You can only send ten messages to the system in total, and one message must be used to call the get_formatted_result tool. Parallel tool calls count as one message.
            Use these ten messages wisely, you should call get_formatted_result with your final summary before the ten messages have run out.

2025-09-11 14:05:29,476 - WARNING - Warning: Maximum iterations reached.
2025-09-11 14:05:29,476 - INFO - Final response (after hitting max iterations): You are a helpful assistant that can search through action documents to find relevant information.
            Use the search_actions tool to find relevant actions based on user queries, and then use get_action_details to retrieve full details for specific actions when needed.
            When searching for actions, start with the default parameters, but if you need more results, use the offset parameter to retrieve additional actions.
            Keep searching with increasing offset values until the returned actions become irrelevant to the user's query - this ensures you find all pertinent information before compiling your final summary.
            Once you have identified a list or batch of action documents that you want to expand fully, you should make multiple **parallel** calls to the get_action_details tool — each call should contain one of the action IDs from the batch.
            
            Then use the information you have gathered to create a summary of information which is relevant to the user's query.
            Do NOT use your own knowledge, make up statistics or state information that is not present in the action documents. ALL of your statements must be DIRECTLY supported by the evidence you found in the action documents. 
            This means for every statement you make you MUST cite the action id used to make that statement as a reference.
            You must NOT answer the question yourself - your job is just to find all the evidence in the action documents which are related to the user's query and summarise these into a concise paragraph.
            This means you MUST NOT use your own knowledge, add qualifying statements, draw conclusions or make your own judgements of the action information. You must only list relevant information from the action documents WITHOUT qualifying statements.
            
            Finally, you MUST use the get_formatted_result tool. This will convert the user's query, your generated summary and the list of the action IDs you used to generate your summary into a valid JSON format.

            You can only send ten messages to the system in total, and one message must be used to call the get_formatted_result tool. Parallel tool calls count as one message.
            Use these ten messages wisely, you should call get_formatted_result with your final summary before the ten messages have run out.

Four replicated trials in Europe demonstrated enhanced diversity and/or abundance of foraging wild bees on land managed under various European agri-environment schemes, relative to conventionally-managed fields or field margins (action 24).

For grazing cessation, six of nine studies found that grasslands ungrazed for >5 years had similar butterfly and moth species richness to grazed grasslands, with one study showing that grasslands abandoned for 5-15 years had greater species richness than sheep-grazed areas (Action 3956).\n\n**Effects on Abundance:**\nCeasing mowing produced variable results: four studies found grasslands abandoned for >1-20 years had lower butterfly abundance than mowed areas, while four other studies found abandoned grasslands had higher abundance than managed areas (Action 3957). For grazing cessation, six of 20 studies found grasslands abandoned for 1-25 years had higher butterfly abundance than grazed areas, while four studies found lower abundance in abandoned areas compared to grazed grasslands (Action 3956).\n\n**Species-Specific Effects:**\nBoth types of management cessation led to community shifts toward generalist species and species with fewer generations per year over 6 years (Actions 3956, 3957). Woodland and hedgerow butterfly species increased in abandoned grasslands, while grassland specialist species decreased (Actions 3956, 3957). Some specialist species like large blue and silver-studded blue went extinct in abandoned meadows (Action 3956).\n\n**Timing Effects:**\nThe timing since abandonment matters significantly - intermediate periods (2-9 years post-abandonment) often showed higher butterfly density than either currently managed or long-abandoned (>10 years) grasslands (Action 3956).', 'action_ids': ['3957', '3956']}

Studies found that coppiced woodland supported different communities of moths and butterflies compared to mature forest, with some studies showing greater species richness of butterflies than unmanaged woodland. Coppiced woodland had higher abundance of butterflies generally and specific species like heath fritillary compared to unmanaged woodland. Multiple studies found that woodland coppiced 2-15 years ago had higher abundance of butterflies and moths than woodland coppiced over 15 years ago.\n\n**Clearing or opening patches in forests** (Action 3938) creates forest openings that benefit butterflies and moths. Studies found that cleared patches in forests had greater species richness of butterflies but lower species richness of moths than closed canopy forest. Larger cleared patches supported higher species richness and abundance of butterflies than undisturbed forest. Cleared patches managed with coppicing and grazing had higher abundance of butterflies generally and specific species like chequered blue, woodland brown, high brown fritillary and small pearl-bordered fritillary than unmanaged areas.\n\n**Thinning trees within forests** (Action 3940) involves selective removal of trees to reduce forest density. Studies found that coniferous woodland thinned along with prescribed burning, mulching or nearby felling had greater species richness and abundance of butterflies than unmanaged woodland. Partially-cleared forest plots had higher butterfly species richness than closed-canopy forest plots.\n\n**Selective or reduced impact logging** (Action 3867) provides an alternative to conventional logging. Studies found that selectively logged forests had higher abundance of exposed moth caterpillars than clearcut forests and similar abundance of all moth caterpillars to undisturbed forests. Forests managed by reduced impact logging had similar or higher abundance of butterflies compared to primary forest.\n\n**Group tree harvesting or thinning instead of clearcutting** (Action 3868) showed that forests harvested by thinning had higher species richness of macro-moths than forests managed by patch-cutting or clearcutting, with richness similar to unharvested forest.\n\n**Rough grazing** (Action 3944) in semi-natural habitats can be applied to forest edges and openings.

Eight studies found that lower stocking densities resulted in greater abundance of butterflies, moths, burnet moths and their caterpillars.\n\n**Seasonal Removal of Livestock (Action 3960):** Three controlled studies found that grasslands where cattle or mixed cattle and sheep were removed in summer, or sheep removed in winter, had higher abundance of butterflies and caterpillars than grasslands grazed throughout the season. One study found greater species richness when cattle were removed in summer.\n\n**Multiple Low-Intensity Interventions (Action 3958):** Six of ten studies found that less intensively managed grasslands had higher species richness of butterflies and moths than conventionally managed grasslands. Three of four studies showed higher abundance of butterflies, micro-moths and declining macro-moths in low-input or unfertilized, ungrazed grassland managed with a single cut.\n\n**Rotational Grazing (Action 3965):** Two of four studies found that rotationally grazed grasslands had greater species richness of butterflies and burnet moths than continuously grazed grassland. Two studies showed higher abundance of butterflies, burnet moths and caterpillars in rotationally grazed compared to continuously grazed grasslands.\n\n**Delayed Grazing/Cutting Dates (Action 3967):** Three of four studies found that grassland cut in July or September had greater abundance of butterflies, burnet moths and caterpillars than grassland cut in May or June. One study found meadows where grazing commenced after 15 June had higher abundance of clouded Apollo butterflies.\n\n**Reduced Cutting Frequency (Action 3961):** Two of three studies found that meadows cut once per year had higher species richness of butterflies and moths than meadows cut multiple times per year. Two studies showed higher abundance in occasionally cut or once-yearly cut grasslands.\n\n**Livestock Type Changes (Action 3963):** Two studies found that grasslands grazed by cattle or horses had greater species richness and abundance of butterflies and burnet moths compared to sheep-grazed grasslands.\n\n**Complete Grazing Cessation (Action 3956):** Results varied with time since abandonment, with some studies showing benefits in early succession stages (2-9 years post-cessation) but mixed results for longer abandonment periods.', 'action_ids': ['3959', '3960', '3958', '3965', '3967', '3961', '3963', '3956']}

2025-09-11 14:57:44,003 - INFO - Final response (after hitting max iterations): You are a helpful assistant that can search through action documents to find relevant information.
            Use the search_actions tool to find relevant actions based on user queries, and then use get_action_details to retrieve full details for specific actions when needed.
            When searching for actions, start with the default parameters, but if you need more results, use the offset parameter to retrieve additional actions.
            Keep searching with increasing offset values until the returned actions become irrelevant to the user's query - this ensures you find all pertinent information before compiling your final summary.
            Once you have identified a list or batch of action documents that you want to expand fully, you should make multiple **parallel** calls to the get_action_details tool — each call should contain one of the action IDs from the batch.
            
            Then use the information you have gathered to create a summary of information which is relevant to the user's query.
            Do NOT use your own knowledge, make up statistics or state information that is not present in the action documents. ALL of your statements must be DIRECTLY supported by the evidence you found in the action documents. 
            This means for every statement you make you MUST cite the action id used to make that statement as a reference.
            You must NOT answer the question yourself - your job is just to find all the evidence in the action documents which are related to the user's query and summarise these into a concise paragraph.
            This means you MUST NOT use your own knowledge, add qualifying statements, draw conclusions or make your own judgements of the action information. You must only list relevant information from the action documents WITHOUT qualifying statements.
            
            Finally, you MUST use the get_formatted_result tool. This will convert the user's query, your generated summary and the list of the action IDs you used to generate your summary into a valid JSON format.

            You can only send ten messages to the system in total, and one message must be used to call the get_formatted_result tool. Parallel tool calls count as one message.
            Use these ten messages wisely, you should call get_formatted_result with your final summary before the ten messages have run out.

2025-09-11 14:58:42,448 - INFO - Final response (after hitting max iterations): You are a helpful assistant that can search through action documents to find relevant information.
            Use the search_actions tool to find relevant actions based on user queries, and then use get_action_details to retrieve full details for specific actions when needed.
            When searching for actions, start with the default parameters, but if you need more results, use the offset parameter to retrieve additional actions.
            Keep searching with increasing offset values until the returned actions become irrelevant to the user's query - this ensures you find all pertinent information before compiling your final summary.
            Once you have identified a list or batch of action documents that you want to expand fully, you should make multiple **parallel** calls to the get_action_details tool — each call should contain one of the action IDs from the batch.
            
            Then use the information you have gathered to create a summary of information which is relevant to the user's query.
            Do NOT use your own knowledge, make up statistics or state information that is not present in the action documents. ALL of your statements must be DIRECTLY supported by the evidence you found in the action documents. 
            This means for every statement you make you MUST cite the action id used to make that statement as a reference.
            You must NOT answer the question yourself - your job is just to find all the evidence in the action documents which are related to the user's query and summarise these into a concise paragraph.
            This means you MUST NOT use your own knowledge, add qualifying statements, draw conclusions or make your own judgements of the action information. You must only list relevant information from the action documents WITHOUT qualifying statements.
            
            Finally, you MUST use the get_formatted_result tool. This will convert the user's query, your generated summary and the list of the action IDs you used to generate your summary into a valid JSON format.

2025-09-11 15:00:11,217 - WARNING - Warning: Maximum iterations reached.
2025-09-11 15:00:11,218 - INFO - Final response (after hitting max iterations): You are a helpful assistant that can search through action documents to find relevant information.
            Use the search_actions tool to find relevant actions based on user queries, and then use get_action_details to retrieve full details for specific actions when needed.
            When searching for actions, start with the default parameters, but if you need more results, use the offset parameter to retrieve additional actions.
            Keep searching with increasing offset values until the returned actions become irrelevant to the user's query - this ensures you find all pertinent information before compiling your final summary.
            Once you have identified a list or batch of action documents that you want to expand fully, you should make multiple **parallel** calls to the get_action_details tool — each call should contain one of the action IDs from the batch.
            
            Then use the information you have gathered to create a summary of information which is relevant to the user's query.
            Do NOT use your own knowledge, make up statistics or state information that is not present in the action documents. ALL of your statements must be DIRECTLY supported by the evidence you found in the action documents. 
            This means for every statement you make you MUST cite the action id used to make that statement as a reference.
            You must NOT answer the question yourself - your job is just to find all the evidence in the action documents which are related to the user's query and summarise these into a concise paragraph.
            This means you MUST NOT use your own knowledge, add qualifying statements, draw conclusions or make your own judgements of the action information. You must only list relevant information from the action documents WITHOUT qualifying statements.
            
            Finally, you MUST use the get_formatted_result tool. This will convert the user's query, your generated summary and the list of the action IDs you used to generate your summary into a valid JSON format.

            You can only send ten messages to the system in total, and one message must be used to call the get_formatted_result tool. Parallel tool calls count as one message.
            Use these ten messages wisely, you should call get_formatted_result with your final summary before the ten messages have run out.

These benefits include increased species richness of plants and bumblebees, increased species richness and abundance of spiders, increased abundance of ground-dwelling invertebrates and ground beetles, increased stone curlew breeding population size, increased northern lapwing hatching success, and increased Eurasian skylark nesting success (Action 562). The margins also support establishment, abundance or species richness of rare arable plant species, with lapwing plots supporting breeding of northern lapwing, Eurasian skylark, grey partridge and yellow wagtail (Action 562). Studies found that nesting success of birds was higher in fallow fields or lapwing plots than in crops (Action 213). Uncropped field margins support higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees than cropped field edges (Actions 19, 20). Skylark plots showed positive effects on skylark population size, breeding density, duration or success, and lower likelihood of territory abandonment (Action 540). Farms with agri-environment schemes including uncropped cultivated margins had higher abundance of butterflies and micro-moths compared to conventionally managed farms (Action 3923).\n\nDRAWBACKS: Studies identified several negative effects. Two studies found that leaving uncropped margins had no effect on 11 out of 12 farmland bird species or ground beetles (Action 562). One study found fewer seed-eating birds on fallow plots for ground-nesting birds in two out of three regions (Action 562). Evidence showed that pernicious weeds were more commonly found on uncropped cultivated margins than conservation or conventional headlands (Action 562). The proportion of young grey partridges in the population was lower in areas with high proportion of uncropped cultivated margins and plots (Action 562). Grey partridge productivity was not related to lapwing plot amounts, and fewer birds used plots than cropland in two out of three UK regions (Action 213).

In contrast, using organic farming instead of conventional farming—an approach that reduces synthetic chemical inputs—has been evaluated in 12 studies across Europe, the USA, Canada and Chile: most studies found no difference or higher bat species richness on organic farms compared to non-organic, and mixed results for bat activity with several studies reporting higher overall or species-specific activity on organic farms (961).', 'action_ids': ['2016', '2015', '961']}

Three studies found that bats used black bat boxes more than grey, white or wooden boxes (Action 1024). One of two studies found higher occupancy rates in larger bat boxes (Action 1024). Studies found varied results for materials: bats used both resin and wood cylindrical boxes, but resin boxes became occupied more quickly than wood boxes in one study, while another found higher occupancy rates in concrete than wooden boxes (Action 1024). Indiana bats used rocket boxes more than wooden boxes or bark-mimic roosts (Action 1024). Internal structure matters as more bats occupied boxes with two compartments than one compartment in the breeding season, bat breeding colonies occupied standard and four/five chamber boxes, and individuals occupied flat boxes (Action 1024). Bat boxes simulating tree trunks were used by 100% of bats in group sizes similar to natural roosts (Action 1024).\n\nPlacement factors include orientation, height, mounting location, and surrounding habitat. Three studies found that bat box orientation and/or the amount of exposure to sunlight affected bat occupancy, though one study found orientation did not have a significant effect (Action 1024). Two studies found that bat box height affected occupancy, while two other studies found no effect of height (Action 1024). Two studies found higher occupancy of bat boxes on buildings than on trees (Action 1024). Habitat influences occupancy as bat boxes were occupied more often in farm forestry sites than in native forest, higher occupancy occurred in pine relative to mixed deciduous stands, and higher occupancy was found in forest fragments than in pasture (Action 1024). Higher occupancy rates occurred in areas where bats were known to roost prior to installing bat boxes, and bat boxes were more likely to be occupied when a greater number were installed across a site (Action 1024). Temperature management also affects success, as one study found more bats in artificial roosts after they were modified to reduce internal roost temperatures (Action 2052).', 'action_ids': ['1024', '2052']}

Parasitism and mortality rates are significant concerns, with eleven replicated trials recording solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators (Action 47). Mortality rates range from 13% for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany to 56% mortality overall for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India (Action 47). Competition from introduced species is another problem, as two replicated trials in California showed that introduced European earwigs and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes, with these introduced species more commonly occupying the boxes than native bees in one trial (Action 47). Nest box design significantly affects success, with plastic-lined holes or plastic/paper tubes being much less productive due to parasitism or mould compared to other materials (Action 47). Very low uptake rates are documented for bumblebee nest boxes, with three trials since 1989 in the UK showing 0-2.5% uptake rates for various designs not including underground boxes (Action 48). For certain bee species, complete failure to use nest boxes occurs, as one trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes, and a small trial with soil-filled nest boxes for mining bee Andrena flavipes in the UK found they were not occupied (Action 47).', 'action_ids': ['47', '48']}

Burning typically had neutral effects on species richness, with prairies and grasslands showing similar richness compared to unburned areas (action 3882). A European review found occasional burning benefitted 10 out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern (action 3882).\n\nRotational burning provided more consistent benefits than single burns, with prairies burned more than one to four years ago showing higher species richness and abundance of butterflies than recently burned areas (action 3883). Similarly, rotational grazing showed advantages over continuous grazing, with rotationally grazed grasslands having greater species richness and higher abundance of butterflies and burnet moths than continuously grazed areas (action 3965). Leaving unburned patches during prescribed burning increased abundance of six out of nine specialist butterfly species compared to sites without unburned areas (action 3879).", 'action_ids': ['3944', '3882', '3883', '3965', '3879']}

Itraconazole was effective at curing in six of eight studies; one study reported reduced infection levels and one mixed effects. Six studies found specific fungicides caused death or other negative side effects [882].\n- Adding antifungal skin bacteria did not reduce infection rate or death in three of four randomized, replicated, controlled studies; one study found prevention of infection and death.

Captive rearing methods also mattered, with one trial finding that queens gradually decreased in weight over four years of artificial rearing (Action ID 50), and laboratory rearing showed variable success for different North American bumblebee species, with some species like B. fervidus laying eggs but experiencing larval mortality before reaching adulthood (Action ID 50).', 'action_ids': ['52', '50']}

Similarly, no studies were found that evaluated the effects of controlling or removing non-native or nuisance species on subtidal artificial structures on the biodiversity of those structures (Action 3441). Related interventions also lack evidence, including no studies on using biological control to manage non-native, invasive or other problematic species populations (Action 2172), using biocides or other chemicals to control non-native, invasive or other problematic species (Action 2171), cleaning anthropogenic platforms, structures or equipment (Action 2167), or using antifouling coatings on the surfaces of vessels and anthropogenic structures (Action 2168).

Small-scale habitat modifications (1-50mm) were extensively tested, with mixed results on community response and biodiversity outcomes.\n\nFor small ridges/ledges (Action 3464): Two replicated, randomized, controlled studies in Singapore found that creating small ridges did not alter combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition or increase species richness on structure surfaces. However, when combined with other microhabitats (Action 3474), creating grooves and small ridges had mixed effects on community composition depending on the site and habitat arrangement, and increased species richness in some cases.\n\nFor pit habitats (Action 3475): Studies in Singapore found that pits altered macroalgae and invertebrate community composition, increased species richness and diversity in most cases, and supported species that were absent from surfaces without pits. When combined with grooves (Action 3473), these features also altered fish community composition and increased both fish species richness and abundance.\n\nFor groove habitats alone (Action 3473): Studies showed that grooves increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate abundance, increased fish species richness and abundance, and altered fish community composition and behavior (increased fish bites on surfaces).\n\nFor environmentally-sensitive materials (Action 3469): Studies in Singapore found that using alternative materials (like ECOncreTE) altered community composition, increased species richness and diversity, and supported species absent from standard concrete surfaces. However, material effects were mixed - limestone-cement had site-dependent effects on richness.\n\nFor organism transplantation (Action 3472): Studies in Singapore found that macroalgae transplanted onto structures had variable survival depending on shore level (higher survival at mid- and highshore), while corals and sponges showed species-dependent growth patterns. Transplanted organisms showed variable survival and growth depending on species, site, and microhabitat features.", 'action_ids': ['3464', '3474', '3475', '3473', '3469', '3472']}

Wildflower strips had higher butterfly species richness than cropped fields, unsown margins, and conventional grassland, with 8 of 13 studies showing greater species richness and diversity of butterflies and moths. Ten studies found higher abundance of all butterflies, generalist butterflies and specialist butterflies in sown wildflower strips compared to conventional field margins, unsown margins, cropped fields and conventional grassland. \n\nIn comparison, uncultivated margins showed more variable results. Two of five studies found that uncultivated margins had lower species richness of butterflies than margins sown with wildflowers, while two studies found similar species richness between uncultivated and sown margins. For abundance, six of seven studies found that butterfly abundance was lower in uncultivated margins than in margins sown with wildflowers or grasses, with only one study showing higher abundance in uncultivated margins. Grass margins also showed positive effects, with three of four studies finding higher butterfly abundance than cropped field edges, and floristically enhanced grass buffers or wildflower strips having greater species richness than standard grass margins. However, wildflower strips consistently outperformed both standard grass margins and uncultivated margins for butterfly conservation.', 'action_ids': ['3932', '3981', '3982', '442']}

Two studies found that sites where invasive plants were removed by weeding or cutting and applying herbicide had greater species richness of butterflies than untreated sites (Action 3890). Four of six studies found that sites where trees and shrubs were removed or invasive plants were cut had greater abundance of Apollo butterflies, higher density of Fender's blue eggs, or higher total abundance of butterflies compared to untreated sites (Action 3890). Two studies found that sites where invasive plants were removed were used more by Fender's blue and frosted elfin butterflies than untreated sites (Action 3890). Additionally, removal of invasive plants allowed adults from two previously separated populations of Apollo butterflies to mix (Action 3890).\n\nExcluding vertebrate herbivores also benefits butterfly and moth populations. Two of four studies found that forest plots fenced to exclude non-native pigs and deer had greater species richness of butterflies and macro-moths than unfenced plots (Action 3891).

(2) Population persistence often required continued interventions such as captive-rearing of wild-laid caterpillars or supplementation by further releases (3914). (3) Survival and persistence varied with source and approach: translocated large copper caterpillars had higher survival than released, captive-bred caterpillars (3909), and released captive-bred large copper caterpillars had lower survival than captive, wild or translocated caterpillars (3914). (4) Life stage and context of release varied (eggs, caterpillars, pupae, adults), with reports of populations persisting 2–28 years in some cases, while others died out within 0–12 years or required further releases (3914; 3909). (5) Captive-rearing conditions affected survival and condition, including lower density improving survival, temperature (20 °C higher survival than 25 °C), ant colony context for myrmecophilous species (higher survival without queens or with winged females present), differences among ant species and among host plant species, and the origin of ants (from sites where parasitic butterfly species occur) influencing survival (3916). (6) Overwintering method during captive rearing influenced survival (lower in refrigerators than in environmental chambers or outside) (3916). (7) Diet and symbiont availability during captive rearing affected development and adult condition, including plant species provided and access to appropriate ant colonies (3916). (8) Long-term captivity influenced traits, with captive lines showing differences in body size and wing size, and differences in fecundity relative to more recently captive lines (3916). (9) Placement of parasitic blue butterflies into specific ant nests without queens improved caterpillar survival during translocation (3909). (10) Genetic considerations were noted, with a translocated population showing similar genetic diversity to its source after 19 years (3909).

Species richness frequently remained similar to managed grasslands, sometimes increased after 4–10 years of abandonment or when meadows were left uncut for a summer, but was often lower after longer periods (e.g., >10–20 years or >50 years) or compared to traditional rotational mowing and burning [3956][3957]. Abundance responses were mixed: in some cases abandonment (from weeks to 25 years) increased total butterflies, day\u2011flying or nocturnal moths, Scotch argus, caterpillars, and small insects, and uncut or temporarily abandoned meadows had higher abundances than annually or frequently mown sites [3956][3957]. In other cases, abandonment for 1–20 years reduced overall butterflies or some species and caterpillars relative to mowing once or twice per year, with some time\u2011since\u2011abandonment effects (e.g., higher densities 2–9 years after cessation than >10 years or currently grazed) and species\u2011specific mixed responses [3956][3957]. Abandonment tended to increase woodland and hedgerow butterflies and burnet moths, but decrease grassland or farmland species, and extinctions of large blue and silver\u2011studded blue occurred in some abandoned meadows; heath fritillary abundance was similar around six years post\u2011abandonment but lower with no caterpillars after >25 years [3956][3957].

For clearing operations, one study found that butterfly species richness and abundance declined over the first three years after clearing (action 3938). Another study found that cleared patches had greater abundance of heath fritillary when assessed 2-4 years after clearance compared to patches cleared 7-11 years ago or patches in their first year after clearance (action 3938). A translocated baton blue butterfly population increased in number over two years following selective clearance of pines (action 3938).\n\nFor coppicing interventions, the timeframes show different patterns depending on species and management age. Studies found higher butterfly abundance in woodland coppiced 2-4 years ago compared to woodland coppiced 5-11 years or >15 years ago (action 3939). Heath fritillary abundance was higher in woodland coppiced 2, 5-7, or 12-15 years ago than in woodland coppiced >15 years ago (action 3939). Pearl-bordered fritillary and small pearl-bordered fritillary populations were more likely to persist for up to 20 years in coppiced woodland than in mature conifer woodland (action 3939).

Studies were conducted across multiple regions: ten studies in estuaries in Australia, the UK and eastern USA; five on open coastlines in the UK, Ireland and southeast Spain; two in straits in the UK and Malaysia; and one in a marina in Australia (Action 3476).\n\nLocation-specific outcomes include: In Ireland, shore level and wave-exposure affected community composition, with wave-sheltered pools filling with sediment within two years (Action 3476). In Australia, the effectiveness varied by pool depth, shore level and site, with mixed effects on community composition depending on these factors (Action 3476). Studies in Australia, the UK, Spain and Malaysia found that rock pools generally supported macroalgae, mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate and/or fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without pools (Action 3476).\n\nThe studies showed that nine of 12 replicated, controlled studies in Australia, the UK, Spain and Malaysia found rock pools supported higher combined macroalgae, invertebrate and/or fish species diversity and/or richness than structure surfaces without pools, though three studies reported similar species richness between pools and structure surfaces (Action 3476). Location also influenced functional outcomes, with one study finding that functional richness was lower in high-shore pools than mid-shore pools (Action 3476).\n\nPool characteristics interacted differently with environmental conditions across locations - two studies found pool depth did not affect community composition, while wave exposure and shore level had varying effects depending on the specific site location (Action 3476). The effectiveness of rock pools in supporting biodiversity appears to be influenced by local environmental conditions including wave exposure, shore level, and site-specific factors that vary by geographical region.', 'action_ids': ['3476']}

One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK found that creating groove habitats and small protrusions on subtidal artificial structures had mixed effects on the combined macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate abundance, depending on the orientation of structure surfaces (3452). Another replicated study in Spain reported that groove habitats and small protrusions created on subtidal artificial structures were colonized by macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrates (3452). One controlled study in Japan reported that creating small protrusions on a subtidal artificial structure had mixed effects on the macroalgal abundance on structure surfaces, depending on the species (3453).

Regarding field size, four replicated site comparison studies found that arable and mixed farms and landscapes with smaller fields had a higher abundance of butterflies and burnet moths than areas with larger fields (Action 3974). Two of four studies found that arable farms in more diverse landscapes and landscapes with smaller fields had higher species richness of butterflies and burnet moths than areas with larger fields, while the other two found similar species richness between smaller and larger fields (Action 3974). One before-and-after study found that reducing field size by increasing the length of field edges on a farm, along with increasing meadow and field margin areas, increased the species richness of butterflies and burnet moths (Action 3974).\n\nFor margin width effects, five replicated site comparison studies found that wider grass margins up to 6 meters wide had greater species richness or diversity of butterflies, macro-moths and micro-moths than narrower or conventional width margins, although one study found similar species richness of macro-moths in wide and conventional grass margins (Action 3982).

In contrast, a replicated, randomized, controlled study in Italy discovered that creating natural rocky reef topography on subtidal artificial structures did not increase the abundance of juvenile canopy macroalgae that settled onto the structure's surfaces (3446)."}
