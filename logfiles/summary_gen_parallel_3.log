One study found that numbers of mature male sperm whales did not differ significantly before or 31 years after hunting was prohibited.', 'action_ids': ['2780', '2838', '2925']}

For soil biota and structure, microbial biomass was often higher in some comparisons, while other soil organisms (bacteria, nematodes, mites) were sometimes fewer or showed inconsistent differences; soil aggregation was sometimes greater, though some studies found no difference [1366]. For greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide emissions were sometimes higher or similar; soils sometimes absorbed more methane or showed similar methane absorption; nitrous oxide emissions were sometimes similar or lower with organic fertilizer, with lower emissions reported particularly with solid organic fertilizers compared to inorganic, while liquid organic fertilizers did not show this reduction; compost increased organic matter, nutrients, and microbial biomass compared to manure in one Italian study; slurry applications were associated with methane absorption while manure applications emitted methane in one Spanish study [1366].","action_ids":["1350","1366"]}

For soil health, organic fertilizer generally increases soil organic matter (8 of 13 studies), nitrogen levels (4 of 9 studies), phosphorus (3 of 5 studies), and potassium (3 of 6 studies), while also enhancing microbial biomass in 4 of 4 studies and improving soil aggregation in 3 of 5 studies. However, some Mediterranean studies found similar nutrient levels between organic and inorganic fertilizers, and organic fertilizer can lead to higher carbon dioxide emissions (4 of 5 studies) while having variable effects on nitrous oxide emissions. For crop production, the evidence shows mixed results: 4 studies found higher yields with organic fertilizer in some comparisons, while 3 studies found lower yields, and 3 studies found similar yields compared to inorganic fertilizer. The type of organic fertilizer matters significantly, with compost showing better results than manure for increasing organic matter, nutrients, and microbial biomass.

Eight studies from Italy and Spain found higher crop yields with no tillage compared to conventional tillage in some or all comparisons, while seven studies from Italy, Lebanon, Spain, and the USA found lower crop yields with no tillage in some or all comparisons. Four studies from Italy and Spain found inconsistent differences (sometimes higher, sometimes lower yields), and three studies from Italy, Portugal, and Spain found similar yields between systems (Action 1355).\n\n**Soil Health**: No-tillage generally improves soil health indicators. One meta-analysis of studies from Mediterranean countries found more organic matter in no-tillage soils compared to tilled soils. Fourteen studies from Italy, Spain, and the USA found more organic matter with no-tillage in some or all comparisons. Seven studies from Spain and the USA found that no-tillage soils were more stable than tilled soils in some or all comparisons. Five studies from Italy and Spain found more microbial biomass in no-tillage soils, and two studies from the USA found more earthworms in no-tillage soils (Action 1369).\n\n**Water Availability**: No-tillage predominantly improves water availability. Nine controlled studies from Spain and the USA found more water in no-tillage soils compared to tilled soils in some or all comparisons. Only one study from Lebanon found less water in no-tillage soils in some comparisons. One study from Spain found that barley used water more efficiently in no-tillage plots compared to tilled plots in some comparisons (Action 1384).\n\n**Pest Numbers**: No-tillage effects on pest numbers are mixed, with weeds being the primary concern.

However, evidence for amphibians is limited, with one replicated, controlled study in the USA finding that planting buffer strips along streams did not increase amphibian abundance, numbers of species, or the ratio of adults to tadpoles (Action 819).\n\nCreating or restoring waterways showed some positive results. One site comparison study in the USA found that restored and pristine streams had similar turtle community composition and abundance (Action 3754). For wetland creation or restoration, studies from the USA found that created wetlands were used by various reptile species for reproduction and habitat use, though species richness and diversity results were mixed when comparing restored to undisturbed wetlands (Action 3755).\n\nLimited evidence exists for bat populations, with one study in the UK finding that pipistrelle activity did not differ along waterways with vegetation buffers on agri-environment scheme farms compared to conventional farms (Action 2284).\n\nNo studies were found evaluating the effects of preventing agricultural pollution from entering watercourses on biodiversity populations (Action 2015, 2882).', 'action_ids': ['120', '463', '819', '1388', '2015', '2882', '2284', '3754', '3755']}

Biological control methods included successful use of flea beetles against water primrose, with a replicated field study in the USA finding significant reduction in large-flower primrose-willow abundance after beetle introduction (Action 1135). Ground cover management beneath perennial crops showed mixed results in Canadian studies, with natural enemies on the ground varying between different natural enemy groups (Action 720).', 'action_ids': ['728', '717', '721', '1394', '722', '1396', '1135', '720']}

The primary approach involves cutting or removing forest plantations combined with rewetting the peat (Action ID 1732). This combined intervention has been shown to increase cover of wetland-characteristic plants and Sphagnum moss in some cases, increase herb cover including cottongrasses and sedges, and increase plant species richness in certain contexts. Tree removal alone (Action ID 1731) can increase cover of some herb species like cottongrasses and sedges while reducing cover of forest-characteristic mosses. For hydrological restoration, filling or blocking drainage ditches (Action ID 1805) allows colonization by herbs and bryophytes, with vegetation cover potentially reaching natural levels within 2-3 years. Surface disturbance techniques (Action ID 1811) can encourage colonization by wetland-characteristic plant species. After planting desired species, covering the peatland with materials like plastic mesh (Action ID 1829) can increase survival and cover of planted mosses.

Primates with limited free-ranging experience showed mixed results: their diet overlapped with wild lemurs, but most reintroduced black-and-white ruffed lemurs with limited free-ranging experience died over five years. Most reintroduced western lowland gorillas with limited free-ranging experience survived over periods between nine months and four years (Action 1595). For non-primate mammals, black-footed ferrets reared in outdoor pens had higher post-release survival rates than ferrets raised indoors, while captive-bred ferrets raised in large enclosures dispersed shorter distances post-release than those raised in small enclosures (Action 2507). Rehabilitation programs showed variable success across species: most reintroduced golden lion tamarins did not survive over seven years despite rehabilitation, while most reintroduced vervet monkeys and chimpanzees survived over six months to five years after rehabilitation (Action 1597).", 'action_ids': ['1594', '1595', '1596', '1597', '2507']}

For relocating primates to non-residential areas specifically, the action documents found no evidence for effects on primate populations (Action 1423). When examining broader mammal relocation studies, including primates, several key findings emerge:\n\nPotential benefits from successful cases show that some primate species do survive and remain at release sites. A replicated study in Belize found the majority of black howler monkeys survived for at least 10 months after translocation from abundant population areas to an uninhabited site (Action 1559). A before-and-after study in India found that rhesus monkeys remained at their release sites following translocation from development areas (Action 1558). Additionally, a replicated, before-and-after study in India found that 'problem' rhesus monkeys that were translocated survived and remained at the release sites for at least four years (Action 1422).\n\nHowever, significant drawbacks are evident from studies of other mammal species. Translocation studies across multiple species show serious survival issues, with one replicated study in the USA finding that fewer than half of black bears translocated from conflict situations survived after one year (Action 2336). A controlled study in the USA found that grizzly bears translocated away from conflict situations had lower survival rates than non-translocated bears (Action 2336). Return behavior is another major drawback - studies found that many animals return to their original capture locations and continue to cause nuisance, with some black bears returning up to six times following translocation (Action 2336). Furthermore, a before-and-after study in India found that leopards translocated away from human-dominated areas attacked more humans and livestock than before translocation, potentially making conflicts worse (Action 2336).", 'action_ids': ['1423', '2336', '1559', '1558', '1422']}

Acoustic devices on fishing gear appear most effective, with five of six controlled studies showing reduced damage to fish catches and/or fishing nets caused by marine mammals (action 2808). These devices also reduced entanglements, with nine studies finding fewer collisions or entanglements of various whale and dolphin species when acoustic devices were used on fishing nets and cod traps (action 2808). Acoustic devices on moorings showed limited evidence for reducing human-wildlife conflict, with only one randomized controlled study finding that deployment on moorings reduced harbour seals feeding on migrating juvenile salmon (action 2816). However, moorings-based devices effectively modified marine mammal behavior, with studies showing reduced numbers of seals and reduced activity of various dolphin and porpoise species (action 2816). Acoustic devices on fishing vessels showed the least effectiveness for human-wildlife conflict reduction, with one randomized controlled study finding no reduction in predation of squid catches by dolphins when acoustic devices were used on vessels (action 2815). However, vessel-based devices did modify dolphin behavior, causing avoidance and reduced foraging activity (action 2815).

No-tillage practices help maintain soil aggregate structure by minimizing mechanical disturbance.\n\n**Cover Crops and Living Mulches**: Studies from Spain showed that growing cover crops beneath main crops or between crop rows increased soil stability and reduced erosion (Action 897). Cover crops provide continuous soil coverage that protects and stabilizes soil structure.\n\n**Ground Cover in Orchards and Vineyards**: Studies from Chile, Spain, and other Mediterranean regions found that soil aggregates were more water-stable in plots with seeded cover crops compared to tilled or bare soils (Action 1367). Ground cover systems consistently improved soil aggregation in perennial crop systems.\n\n**Mulching**: Studies from various locations including Spain found that adding mulch (whether straw, paper, or compost) increased soil stability and improved soil structure (Action 887). Mulch materials protect soil surface and enhance aggregate formation.\n\n**Crop Rotations**: One study from Syria found higher water-stability in soils with crop rotations compared to continuous crops, though results varied across different Mediterranean studies (Action 1368). Crop rotations can contribute to soil structural improvements through diverse root systems and reduced soil disturbance patterns.\n\n**Tillage Speed Management**: One study from Egypt found that tilling at slower tractor speeds resulted in less soil loss in runoff water (Action 1371), indicating that how tillage is performed affects soil stability.\n\nThese practices work by reducing soil disturbance, maintaining continuous soil cover, enhancing biological activity, and promoting the formation and preservation of stable soil aggregates through root activity and organic matter inputs.', 'action_ids': ['1371', '1358', '1385', '897', '1367', '887', '1368']}

Cover crops grown beneath main crops or between crop rows can increase soil stability, with studies from Spain and the USA showing reduced erosion and highest soil stability under grass cover (Action 897). Reduced tillage practices significantly improve soil aggregation, with multiple studies from Mediterranean countries showing higher water-stability of soil aggregates in reduced tillage systems compared to conventional tillage, and some studies finding more large aggregates (Action 1371). No-tillage systems also enhance soil stability, with studies from Spain and the USA demonstrating that soils without tillage were more stable than tilled soils in multiple comparisons (Action 1369). Crop rotation can contribute to soil stability improvement, with studies from Syria showing increased water infiltration and higher water-stability in rotated soils compared to continuous crops, particularly when legumes are included (Actions 857, 1368). Adding mulch to crops increases soil stability and reduces erosion according to studies from multiple countries including France and the UK (Action 887). Reducing grazing intensity helps prevent soil compaction and aids recovery, with studies from Australia showing compacted soils recovered when sheep were excluded for 2.5 years, and trials from Syria finding less sediment erosion when grazing time was reduced (Action 901).', 'action_ids': ['897', '1371', '1369', '857', '1368', '887', '901']}

For general grazing management, multiple studies show varied outcomes: two replicated studies in grasslands in the USA and Spain found more invertebrates in sheep-, goat-, or cattle-grazed plots compared to ungrazed plots in some or all comparisons, while one before-and-after study found that a threatened, endemic butterfly species did not recolonize a site after grazing was reintroduced (action 1419). Studies on grazer exclusion found that two replicated studies in wetlands and grasslands in the USA found more species or families of invertebrates in areas with cattle excluded compared to grazed areas for some or all groups, though one study found fewer aquatic invertebrate species in areas with cattle excluded in some comparisons (action 1417). Regarding grazing intensity, one replicated, randomized, controlled study in wet grasslands in the USA found more families of insects in streams in areas grazed by cattle at lower compared to higher intensities (action 1418).

For plant-based attractants, four studies from China, Germany, India and Kenya found that growing non-crop plants that produce chemicals attractive to natural enemies resulted in higher numbers of natural enemies in three studies, while one study found no effect on parasitism when the plant used was not found to be attractive to natural enemies in lab studies (Action 724). All four studies found decreased pest populations or pest damage, and one replicated, randomised, controlled study found increased crop yield (Action 724).

However, one broader review of programmes in the USA and Canada found that education was not sufficient to change behaviour on its own, although it was necessary as a catalytic factor for economic incentives and law enforcement (Action 162).", 'action_ids': ['1049', '1060', '1603', '1075', '1086', '1311', '1148', '1122', '162']}

Fourteen studies found that areas treated with organic rather than mineral fertilizers supported higher plant diversity and cover or species richness, increased earthworm abundance or diversity, biomass and density, and increased abundance and/or species richness of some or all invertebrates investigated (Action 134). A literature review found organic fertilizers without pesticides produced highest earthworm biomass (Action 134). A small trial in Belgium found more predatory beetles on an arable field two years after organic fertilizer application than on a control plot (Action 134). However, some studies showed mixed results: one randomized, replicated, controlled trial in the UK found that using organic rather than mineral fertilizers did not affect the abundance of three weed species (Action 134). A replicated study from Ireland found that the application of farmyard manure had no long-term effect on invertebrates, whilst two studies from the UK found the increase in arthropod predators and springtails was only seen at a local not a field scale (Action 134). One study from Italy found more plants and plant biomass, but similar numbers of plant species, in plots with organic fertilizer compared to plots with inorganic fertilizer (Action 1412).

2025-09-11 18:15:45,046 - INFO - Final response (after hitting max iterations): You are a helpful assistant that can search through action documents to find relevant information.
            Use the search_actions tool to find relevant actions based on user queries, and then use get_action_details to retrieve full details for specific actions when needed.
            When searching for actions, start with the default parameters, but if you need more results, use the offset parameter to retrieve additional actions.
            Keep searching with increasing offset values until the returned actions become irrelevant to the user's query - this ensures you find all pertinent information before compiling your final summary.
            Once you have identified a list or batch of action documents that you want to expand fully, you should make multiple **parallel** calls to the get_action_details tool — each call should contain one of the action IDs from the batch.
            
            Then use the information you have gathered to create a summary of information which is relevant to the user's query.
            Do NOT use your own knowledge, make up statistics or state information that is not present in the action documents. ALL of your statements must be DIRECTLY supported by the evidence you found in the action documents. 
            This means for every statement you make you MUST cite the action id used to make that statement as a reference.
            You must NOT answer the question yourself - your job is just to find all the evidence in the action documents which are related to the user's query and summarise these into a concise paragraph.
            This means you MUST NOT use your own knowledge, add qualifying statements, draw conclusions or make your own judgements of the action information. You must only list relevant information from the action documents WITHOUT qualifying statements.
            
            Finally, you MUST use the get_formatted_result tool. This will convert the user's query, your generated summary and the list of the action IDs you used to generate your summary into a valid JSON format.

            You can only send ten messages to the system in total, and one message must be used to call the get_formatted_result tool. Parallel tool calls count as one message.
            Use these ten messages wisely, you should call get_formatted_result with your final summary before the ten messages have run out.

2025-09-11 18:17:39,323 - INFO - Final response (after hitting max iterations): You are a helpful assistant that can search through action documents to find relevant information.
            Use the search_actions tool to find relevant actions based on user queries, and then use get_action_details to retrieve full details for specific actions when needed.
            When searching for actions, start with the default parameters, but if you need more results, use the offset parameter to retrieve additional actions.
            Keep searching with increasing offset values until the returned actions become irrelevant to the user's query - this ensures you find all pertinent information before compiling your final summary.
            Once you have identified a list or batch of action documents that you want to expand fully, you should make multiple **parallel** calls to the get_action_details tool — each call should contain one of the action IDs from the batch.
            
            Then use the information you have gathered to create a summary of information which is relevant to the user's query.
            Do NOT use your own knowledge, make up statistics or state information that is not present in the action documents. ALL of your statements must be DIRECTLY supported by the evidence you found in the action documents. 
            This means for every statement you make you MUST cite the action id used to make that statement as a reference.
            You must NOT answer the question yourself - your job is just to find all the evidence in the action documents which are related to the user's query and summarise these into a concise paragraph.
            This means you MUST NOT use your own knowledge, add qualifying statements, draw conclusions or make your own judgements of the action information. You must only list relevant information from the action documents WITHOUT qualifying statements.
            
            Finally, you MUST use the get_formatted_result tool. This will convert the user's query, your generated summary and the list of the action IDs you used to generate your summary into a valid JSON format.

            You can only send ten messages to the system in total, and one message must be used to call the get_formatted_result tool. Parallel tool calls count as one message.
            Use these ten messages wisely, you should call get_formatted_result with your final summary before the ten messages have run out.

Nest box design affects use, productivity and usurpation rates, with thirteen studies finding that these varied with different designs (action 498).

Tree sparrows showed a preference for nest boxes in wetland habitat compared to those in farmland sites (action 155). Nest box maintenance affects occupancy, as five studies found that various songbirds preferentially nested in cleaned nest boxes compared to used ones, though some studies found birds showed preference for uncleaned boxes and there were no differences in success or parasitism levels between cleaned and uncleaned boxes (action 499). Predation is a significant factor, with predation rates being lower for relocated nest boxes compared to controls (action 420), and nest boxes or nesting 'tubs' showing lower predation or higher nesting success than natural nests (action 402). Predator deterrents such as metal cones with 7.6 cm overhang and increased distance between entrance hole and roof from 30 to 60 cm can prevent raccoons from entering nest boxes (action 402).

Organic matter amendments demonstrate several benefits including increased microbial biomass and activity (902), higher soil organic carbon levels (902), and increased soil nutrients (902). However, in wetland environments, high amounts of compost can negatively impact plant community composition by favoring species characteristic of drier conditions and reducing plant species richness and diversity (3310), though it can increase individual tree size (3310). Manure applications show mixed effects on tree survival and growth depending on species and dose (3311).\n\nLime applications reveal predominantly negative or neutral effects. Studies found lime application decreased pine seedling survival (1259), typically reduced survival of planted fen herbs (1825), and reduced growth rates for most peat swamp tree seedlings (1825).

For female amphibians, hormone treatment has had mixed results, with some studies showing that it stimulated egg production or successful breeding, while others found it did not (883). In addition to hormone treatment, environmental manipulations have also been found to be effective. The reproductive success of frogs in captivity has been found to depend on temperature or a simulated wet and dry season (835). Furthermore, providing a variety of substrates, such as rotting logs and hollow bamboo pipes, has been shown to promote egg-laying in frogs (1874). One Australian study also found success by temporarily flooding enclosures, manipulating sex ratios, and playing recorded mating calls (1874).', 'action_ids': ['883', '835', '1874']}

Another Australian study increased breeding success by providing a pre-breeding cooling period combined with weight gain for females, sex separation during non-breeding periods, mate choice, and recorded mating calls (Action 1864). Artificial rainfall simulation is particularly effective, with two replicated studies in Germany and Austria finding that simulating wet and dry seasons successfully stimulated breeding and egg deposition (Action 1872). Enclosure modifications also play a role, as an Austrian study found captive frogs began breeding when housed in enclosures with more calling, perching and laying sites along with simulated wet and dry seasons (Action 1876), while a Fiji study showed that adding rotting logs, hollow bamboo pipes and substrate variety promoted egg laying (Action 1876). Lighting variation is another option, though one UK study found UV boosts resulted in greater fungal loads without improving clutch size (Action 1865). Other potential actions include varying enclosure humidity using humidifiers, foggers or misters (Action 1863), allowing dormancy periods for species from highly seasonal environments (Action 1869), and permitting temperate amphibians to hibernate (Action 1868), though these lack current evidence for effectiveness.', 'action_ids': ['1864', '1872', '1876', '1865', '1863', '1869', '1868']}

However, another UK study found that while 2,4-D amine was successful in eradicating skunk cabbage, glyphosate was unsuccessful, with only a limited reduction in plant growth (1102)."}

A repeat treatment of 3 seconds after 11 days proved fatal to the plant (1131). In Western Australia, a combination of cutting followed by glyphosate chemical treatment was successful in removing floating pennywort (1128). Several studies in the UK on Crassula helmsii found that applying glyphosate reduced the plant. A combination of glyphosate and diquat reduced C. helmsii by 98%, and covering the plant with a carpet before glyphosate treatment resulted in an 80% reduction (1279). Applying diquat or diquat alginate was found to reduce or eradicate submerged C. helmsii (1279).
