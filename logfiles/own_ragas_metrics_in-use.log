Evidence on other herbicides was mixed: diquat or diquat alginate reduced cover or eradicated submerged plants in three of four studies, with one small trial finding no effect; dichlobenil and terbutryne only partially reduced biomass in some trials, and one small field study found no effect of dichlobenil; asulam, 2,4\u2011D amine and dalapon reduced emergent plants in one replicated, controlled study [1279].

Seed-eating birds were more abundant on uncut and ungrazed plots than on uncut and grazed plots (224). A replicated, controlled, randomized UK study found no difference in ground beetle abundance and diversity between cut and uncut headlands in the first two years, but higher species diversity in uncut plots in the third year; no studies were found assessing effects on mammals (132, 2400). Raising mowing/cutting height: A replicated, controlled study and a review from the UK found raised mowing heights benefited Eurasian skylark, including increased productivity, and a review reported raised cutting heights were less damaging to amphibians and invertebrates (138). However, a randomized, replicated, controlled UK trial found no effect of raised mowing height on numbers of foraging birds or invertebrates, and one replicated controlled study found no difference in invertebrate abundance (138). A UK review found raised mowing height may have increased skylark productivity but not enough to maintain the local population (222). On intensively managed UK grassland, plots cut to 10 cm had similar butterfly species richness and abundance to plots cut to 5 cm (3968).\nStatements:'}], 'model': 'google/gemini-2.5-pro', 'max_tokens': 15000}, 'extra_json': {'require_parameters': True, 'reasoning': {'enabled': True, 'effort': 'high'}}}

One of these studies found that whilst seed-eating birds preferred rye grass cut once only, birds that fed on different food resources such as insect-eaters showed more variable results with some preferring plots cut two or more times.\nOne replicated controlled randomized study from the UK found no difference in ground beetle abundance and diversity between cut and uncut silage field headlands in the first two years of the experiment, but higher species diversity in uncut plots in the third year.\n\n138: Raise mowing height on grasslands to benefit farmland wildlife\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nA replicated controlled study and a review from the UK found that raised mowing heights provided benefits to Eurasian skylark including increased productivity. A review found raised cutting heights were less damaging to amphibians and invertebrates.\nA randomized, replicated, controlled trial from the UK found that raising mowing height on grasslands had no effect on numbers of foraging birds or invertebrates. One replicated controlled study found no difference in invertebrate abundance.\nOne replicated study from the UK found that northern lapwing and common starling chicks had greater foraging success in shorter grass.\n\n698: Use mowing techniques to reduce mortality\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nEight studies investigated the effects of different mowing techniques on wildlife. Seven studies (including four replicated trials of which one randomized, and one controlled and three reviews) from Germany, Ireland, Switzerland and the UK found that using specific mowing techniques can reduce mortality or injury in birds, mammals, amphibians or invertebrates. A review found the UK corncrake population increased around the same period that Corncrake Friendly Mowing schemes were introduced.\nOne replicated trial found that changing the mowing pattern reduced the number of corncrake chicks killed. Sixty-eight percent of chicks escaped mowing when fields were mown from the centre outwards, compared to 45% during conventional mowing from the field edge inwards.\nSix studies looked at the effects of using different mowing machinery. Two studies (one review, one randomized, replicated trial) found bar mowers and one report found double chop mowers caused less damage or lower mortality among amphibians and/or invertebrates than other types of mowing machinery. A review found evidence that twice as many small mammals were killed by rotary disc mowers with conditioners compared to double blade mowers. Two studies found that using a mechanical processor or conditioner killed or injured more invertebrates than without a conditioner, however one replicated controlled study found mower-conditioners resulted in higher Eurasian skylark nest survival than using a tedder. A review of studies found that skylark chick survival was four times higher when wider mowing machinery was used, whilst a replicated controlled trial found skylark nest survival was highest when swather mowers and forage harvesters were used.\n\n131: Delay mowing or first grazing date on pasture or grassland\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nEight studies from the Netherlands, Sweden and the UK (three replicated and controlled of which one also randomized and one European systematic review) found that delaying mowing or grazing dates resulted in benefits to some or all plants, invertebrates or birds studied. These benefits included: higher plant species richness, higher densities of two rare arable weeds, more insect species and individuals visiting flowers, greater abundance of some spiders and ground beetles, increased breeding wading bird densities, and increased Eurasian skylark productivity.\nThree reviews found the UK corncrake population increased after measures including delaying mowing dates were introduced.\nSix studies from Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK (including three replicated controlled trials of which one was also randomized and a European systematic review) found that delaying mowing or grazing dates on grassland had no clear effect on plant species richness, ground beetle communities, abundance of some insects and spiders, or population trends of wading bird species.\n\n132: Leave uncut strips of rye grass on silage fields\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nTwo reviews and two replicated controlled trials from the UK found that leaving uncut strips of rye grass on silage fields resulted in benefits to birds including increased numbers. One of these studies found that whilst seed-eating birds preferred rye grass cut once only, birds that fed on different food resources such as insect-eaters showed more variable results with some preferring plots cut two or more times.\nOne replicated controlled randomized study from the UK found no difference in ground beetle abundance and diversity between cut and uncut silage field headlands in the first two years of the experiment, but higher species diversity in uncut plots in the third year.\n\n224: Leave uncut rye grass in silage fields for birds\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nTwo reviews from the UK found that leaving rye grass uncut, or with only a single cut, benefited seed-eating birds and two replicated, controlled studies from the UK found that seed-eating birds were more abundant on uncut plots.\nTwo replicated and controlled studies and a review, all from the UK, found that seed-eating birds were more abundant on uncut and ungrazed plots than on uncut and grazed plots. \nA replicated, controlled study from the UK found that the responses of non-seed-eating birds were less certain than seed-eaters, with some species avoiding uncut rye grass.\n\n2400: Leave areas of uncut ryegrass in silage field\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on mammals of leaving areas of uncut ryegrass in silage field.\n\nWe found no studies' means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.\n\n138: Raise mowing height on grasslands to benefit farmland wildlife\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nA replicated controlled study and a review from the UK found that raised mowing heights provided benefits to Eurasian skylark including increased productivity.

Seed-eating birds were more abundant on uncut and ungrazed plots than on uncut and grazed plots (224). A replicated, controlled, randomized UK study found no difference in ground beetle abundance and diversity between cut and uncut headlands in the first two years, but higher species diversity in uncut plots in the third year; no studies were found assessing effects on mammals (132, 2400). Raising mowing/cutting height: A replicated, controlled study and a review from the UK found raised mowing heights benefited Eurasian skylark, including increased productivity, and a review reported raised cutting heights were less damaging to amphibians and invertebrates (138). However, a randomized, replicated, controlled UK trial found no effect of raised mowing height on numbers of foraging birds or invertebrates, and one replicated controlled study found no difference in invertebrate abundance (138). A UK review found raised mowing height may have increased skylark productivity but not enough to maintain the local population (222). On intensively managed UK grassland, plots cut to 10 cm had similar butterfly species richness and abundance to plots cut to 5 cm (3968).\nStatements: [\'Leaving uncut or once-cut strips of rye grass was reported in UK trials to benefit birds, particularly seed-eating species, by increasing their numbers.\', \'The responses of non-seed-eating, insectivorous birds to uncut rye grass were more variable.\', \'Some non-seed-eating, insectivorous bird species avoided uncut rye grass.\', \'Seed-eating birds were more abundant on uncut and ungrazed plots than on uncut and grazed plots.\', \'In the first two years of a UK study, there was no difference in ground beetle abundance and diversity between cut and uncut headlands.\', \'In the third year of a UK study, uncut plots had higher ground beetle species diversity than cut headlands.\', \'No studies were found assessing the effects of leaving uncut strips of rye grass on mammals.\', "Raised mowing heights in the UK were found to benefit the Eurasian skylark, including by increasing the bird\'s productivity.", \'One review reported that raised cutting heights were less damaging to amphibians and invertebrates.\', \'A UK trial found no effect of a raised mowing height on the numbers of foraging birds or invertebrates.\', \'One replicated controlled study found no difference in invertebrate abundance when mowing height was raised.\', \'A UK review found a raised mowing height may have increased skylark productivity.\', \'The increased skylark productivity from a raised mowing height may not have been enough to maintain the local population.\', \'On intensively managed UK grassland, plots cut to 10 cm had similar butterfly species richness and abundance to plots cut to 5 cm.\']'}], 'model': 'google/gemini-2.5-pro', 'max_tokens': 15000, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'ListOfCitedStatements', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'properties': {'statement': {'title': 'Statement', 'type': 'string'}, 'citations': {'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'title': 'Citations', 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['statement', 'citations'], 'title': 'CitedStatement', 'type': 'object'}}}}}, 'extra_json': {'require_parameters': True, 'reasoning': {'enabled': True, 'effort': 'high'}}}

These benefits included: higher plant species richness, higher densities of two rare arable weeds, more insect species and individuals visiting flowers, greater abundance of some spiders and ground beetles, increased breeding wading bird densities, and increased Eurasian skylark productivity.\nThree reviews found the UK corncrake population increased after measures including delaying mowing dates were introduced.\nSix studies from Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK (including three replicated controlled trials of which one was also randomized and a European systematic review) found that delaying mowing or grazing dates on grassland had no clear effect on plant species richness, ground beetle communities, abundance of some insects and spiders, or population trends of wading bird species.\n\n132: Leave uncut strips of rye grass on silage fields\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nTwo reviews and two replicated controlled trials from the UK found that leaving uncut strips of rye grass on silage fields resulted in benefits to birds including increased numbers. One of these studies found that whilst seed-eating birds preferred rye grass cut once only, birds that fed on different food resources such as insect-eaters showed more variable results with some preferring plots cut two or more times.\nOne replicated controlled randomized study from the UK found no difference in ground beetle abundance and diversity between cut and uncut silage field headlands in the first two years of the experiment, but higher species diversity in uncut plots in the third year.\n\n224: Leave uncut rye grass in silage fields for birds\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nTwo reviews from the UK found that leaving rye grass uncut, or with only a single cut, benefited seed-eating birds and two replicated, controlled studies from the UK found that seed-eating birds were more abundant on uncut plots.\nTwo replicated and controlled studies and a review, all from the UK, found that seed-eating birds were more abundant on uncut and ungrazed plots than on uncut and grazed plots. \nA replicated, controlled study from the UK found that the responses of non-seed-eating birds were less certain than seed-eaters, with some species avoiding uncut rye grass.\n\n2400: Leave areas of uncut ryegrass in silage field\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on mammals of leaving areas of uncut ryegrass in silage field.\n\nWe found no studies' means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.\n\n138: Raise mowing height on grasslands to benefit farmland wildlife\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nA replicated controlled study and a review from the UK found that raised mowing heights provided benefits to Eurasian skylark including increased productivity. A review found raised cutting heights were less damaging to amphibians and invertebrates.\nA randomized, replicated, controlled trial from the UK found that raising mowing height on grasslands had no effect on numbers of foraging birds or invertebrates. One replicated controlled study found no difference in invertebrate abundance.\nOne replicated study from the UK found that northern lapwing and common starling chicks had greater foraging success in shorter grass.\n\n222: Raise mowing height on grasslands to benefit birds\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nA review from the UK  found that raising mowing height may have increased productivity of Eurasian skylarks, but not sufficiently to maintain the local population.\nA randomised, replicated and controlled study from the UK found that no more foraging birds were attracted to plots with raised mowing heights, compared to plots with shorter grass.\n\n3968: Raise cutting height on grasslands\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of raising cutting height on grasslands. One study was in each of the UK\xa0and Switzerland.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nRichness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK\xa0found that intensively managed grassland plots cut to 10 cm in May and July had a similar species richness of butterflies to plots cut to 5 cm.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK\xa0found that intensively managed grassland plots cut to 10 cm in May and July had a similar abundance of butterflies and caterpillars to plots cut to 5 cm.\nSurvival (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in Switzerland\xa0found that the survival of large white caterpillars in grassland plots cut to 9 cm was similar to in plots cut to 6 cm2.\nCondition (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in Switzerland\xa0found that a similar proportion of wax model caterpillars were damaged when meadows were cut to 9 cm or 6 cm.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nStatements: [Statement 1: Leaving uncut or once-cut strips of rye grass was reported in UK trials to benefit birds, particularly seed-eating species, by increasing their numbers.\nCitations for statement 1: 132, 224]\n[Statement 2: The responses of non-seed-eating, insectivorous birds to uncut rye grass were more variable.\nCitations for statement 2: 132, 224]\n[Statement 3: Some non-seed-eating, insectivorous bird species avoided uncut rye grass.\nCitations for statement 3: 132, 224]\n[Statement 4: Seed-eating birds were more abundant on uncut and ungrazed plots than on uncut and grazed plots.\nCitations for statement 4: 224]\n[Statement 5: In the first two years of a UK study, there was no difference in ground beetle abundance and diversity between cut and uncut headlands.\nCitations for statement 5: 132, 2400]\n[Statement 6: In the third year of a UK study, uncut plots had higher ground beetle species diversity than cut headlands.\nCitations for statement 6: 132, 2400]\n[Statement 7: No studies were found assessing the effects of leaving uncut strips of rye grass on mammals.\nCitations for statement 7: 132, 2400]\n[Statement 8: Raised mowing heights in the UK were found to benefit the Eurasian skylark, including by increasing the bird's productivity.\nCitations for statement 8: 138]\n[Statement 9: One review reported that raised cutting heights were less damaging to amphibians and invertebrates.\nCitations for statement 9: 138]\n[Statement 10: A UK trial found no effect of a raised mowing height on the numbers of foraging birds or invertebrates.\nCitations for statement 10: 138]\n[Statement 11: One replicated controlled study found no difference in invertebrate abundance when mowing height was raised.\nCitations for statement 11: 138]\n[Statement 12: A UK review found a raised mowing height may have increased skylark productivity.\nCitations for statement 12: 222]\n[Statement 13: The increased skylark productivity from a raised mowing height may not have been enough to maintain the local population.\nCitations for statement 13: 222]\n[Statement 14: On intensively managed UK grassland, plots cut to 10 cm had similar butterfly species richness and abundance to plots cut to 5 cm.\nCitations for statement 14: 3968]\nResponse:"}], 'model': 'google/gemini-2.5-pro', 'max_tokens': 15000, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'Statements, Citations, Verdicts and Reasonings', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'properties': {'statement': {'description': 'A given statement.', 'title': 'Statement', 'type': 'string'}, 'citations': {'description': 'The list of citations for the statement (list).', 'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'title': 'Citations', 'type': 'array'}, 'reasoning': {'description': 'The reasoning behind the verdict.', 'title': 'Reasoning', 'type': 'string'}, 'verdict': {'description': "The verdict for the statement (i.e., 'Yes' or 'No').", 'title': 'Verdict', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['statement', 'citations', 'reasoning', 'verdict'], 'title': 'CitedStatementVerdict', 'type': 'object'}}}}}, 'extra_json': {'require_parameters': True, 'reasoning': {'enabled': True, 'effort': 'high'}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: For large captive carnivores like felids and bears, what are the most effective food-based enrichment strategies to reduce stereotypic behaviours?\nanswer: Evidence indicates several food-based approaches have reduced stereotypic or abnormal behaviours in large captive carnivores. Presenting food frozen in ice decreased abnormal/stereotypic behaviours and increased activity in bears and felids (1923). Hiding food around enclosures decreased stereotypical pacing in leopard cats and a black bear, and increased exploring/foraging (1915). Providing bones, hides or partial carcasses decreased stereotypic behaviours in lions and tigers (and Arctic foxes) and increased activity/manipulation time in felids (1902). Presenting food inside objects (e.g., Boomer balls) decreased stereotypic behaviours and increased exploratory/foraging in sloth and spectacled bears, though one case reported decreased exploring/foraging in a sloth bear (1924). Devices that simulate live prey had mixed effects: pacing decreased and walking increased in cougars, but pacing initially increased in tigers when a carcass was provided on a bungee (1927). Providing live vertebrate prey increased hunting and reduced sleeping in a fishing cat, but did not change stereotypical behaviours in tigers (1925). Allocating fast days was associated with more frequent pacing on non-feeding days in large felids (1906).\nStatements:'}], 'model': 'google/gemini-2.5-pro', 'max_tokens': 15000}, 'extra_json': {'require_parameters': True, 'reasoning': {'enabled': True, 'effort': 'high'}}}

Presenting food frozen in ice decreased abnormal/stereotypic behaviours and increased activity in bears and felids (1923). Hiding food around enclosures decreased stereotypical pacing in leopard cats and a black bear, and increased exploring/foraging (1915). Providing bones, hides or partial carcasses decreased stereotypic behaviours in lions and tigers (and Arctic foxes) and increased activity/manipulation time in felids (1902). Presenting food inside objects (e.g., Boomer balls) decreased stereotypic behaviours and increased exploratory/foraging in sloth and spectacled bears, though one case reported decreased exploring/foraging in a sloth bear (1924). Devices that simulate live prey had mixed effects: pacing decreased and walking increased in cougars, but pacing initially increased in tigers when a carcass was provided on a bungee (1927). Providing live vertebrate prey increased hunting and reduced sleeping in a fishing cat, but did not change stereotypical behaviours in tigers (1925). Allocating fast days was associated with more frequent pacing on non-feeding days in large felids (1906).\nStatements: ['Evidence indicates several food-based approaches have reduced stereotypic or abnormal behaviours in large captive carnivores.', 'Presenting food frozen in ice decreased abnormal or stereotypic behaviours in bears and felids.', 'Presenting food frozen in ice increased activity in bears and felids.', 'Hiding food around enclosures decreased stereotypical pacing in leopard cats and a black bear.', 'Hiding food around enclosures increased exploring and foraging in leopard cats and a black bear.', 'Providing bones, hides, or partial carcasses decreased stereotypic behaviours in lions, tigers, and Arctic foxes.', 'Providing bones, hides, or partial carcasses increased activity and manipulation time in felids.', 'Presenting food inside objects, such as Boomer balls, decreased stereotypic behaviours in sloth and spectacled bears.', 'Presenting food inside objects, such as Boomer balls, increased exploratory and foraging behavior in sloth and spectacled bears.', 'In one case, presenting food inside objects decreased exploring and foraging in a sloth bear.', 'Devices that simulate live prey had mixed effects on the behavior of large captive carnivores.', 'For cougars, devices that simulate live prey decreased pacing and increased walking.', 'Providing a carcass on a bungee initially increased pacing in tigers.', 'Providing live vertebrate prey increased hunting in a fishing cat.', 'Providing live vertebrate prey reduced sleeping in a fishing cat.', 'Providing live vertebrate prey did not change stereotypical behaviours in tigers.', 'Allocating fast days was associated with more frequent pacing on non-feeding days in large felids.']"}], 'model': 'google/gemini-2.5-pro', 'max_tokens': 15000, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'ListOfCitedStatements', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'properties': {'statement': {'title': 'Statement', 'type': 'string'}, 'citations': {'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'title': 'Citations', 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['statement', 'citations'], 'title': 'CitedStatement', 'type': 'object'}}}}}, 'extra_json': {'require_parameters': True, 'reasoning': {'enabled': True, 'effort': 'high'}}}

One study was in each of the Norwegian Sea (Norway), the North Sea (UK), the Gulf of Maine\xa0(USA), the Bismark Sea (Papua New Guinea) and the Kattegat\xa0(Sweden/Denmark).\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (4 STUDIES)\n\nCondition (2 studies): One replicated, before-and-after study in the Norwegian Sea found that in the five years after the long-term closure of a commercial coastal fishery, the weights of young salmon returning to rivers were higher than before, and weights of older salmon were similar or lower. One site comparison study in the Gulf of Maine found that there were smaller, but similar condition monkfish inside an area closed year-round to groundfish fishing for six to seven years than an area open to all fishing.\nAbundance (4 studies): Two site comparison studies in the Gulf of Maine and Bismark Sea found a higher abundance of only one of seven fish species and lower abundance of monkfish in areas closed to groundfish (bottom-dwelling) fisheries for six to eight years, compared to open areas. One of two replicated, before-and-after studies (one controlled) in the Norwegian Sea and North Sea found that there were more young salmon and similar numbers of older salmon returning to rivers than before, in the five years after the long-term closure of a commercial coastal fishery. The other study found that lesser sandeel biomass and density peaked but there was no overall increase in the three years after a long-term fishery closure compared to before.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nBehaviour change (1 study): One site comparison study in the Bismark Sea found that in an area closed to customary fishing for eight years, six of seven fish species had a lower flight response distance compared to an area open to customary fishing, making them more vulnerable to capture with spear guns.\n\nOTHER (3 STUDIES)\n\nReduction of unwanted catch (1 study): One replicated, before-and-after study in the Kattegat\xa0found that a combination of long-term fishery closures and areas limited to specific gears reduced unwanted catch of cod compared to before.\nReduction of fishing effort (1 study): One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the North Sea found that long-term closure of a commercial fishery reduced overall fishing effort for lesser sandeel.\nCommercial catch abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the North Sea found that annual sandeel catch rates were varied after the indefinite closure of the commercial fishery in an area.\n\n2664: Establish temporary fishery closures\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nFive studies examined the effects of establishing temporary fishery closures on marine fish populations. Two studies were in the North Atlantic Ocean (Canada, UK) and one study was in each of the North Sea (UK), the Philippine Sea\xa0(Palau) and the Mediterranean Sea (Spain).\n\n\xa0COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): One before-and-after, site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean found no increase in the biomass of the spawning stock of cod following a temporary fishery closure compared to fished areas over nine years.\nSurvival (1 study): One before-and-after, site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean found no change in the survival of cod following a temporary fishery closure compared to fished areas over nine years.\nCondition (1 study): One before-and-after, site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean found no change in the length composition of cod following a temporary fishery closure, compared to fished areas over nine years.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nUse (1 study): A study in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean reported that over five years tagged adult cod spent nearly a third of time inside a seasonally closed cod spawning area during implementation, and were thus given increased protection from any gears targeting bottom-dwelling fish during the spawning period.\n\nOTHER (4 STUDIES)\n\nReduction of fishing effort (1 study): One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the North Sea found that fixed temporary closures had little effect on fishing effort for cod, but real-time area closures reduced the annual amount of cod caught (retained and discarded).\nCommercial catch abundance (3 studies): One of two replicated (one controlled, one before-and-after) studies in the Philippine Sea and Mediterranean Sea found that during a temporary closure of a grouper fishery, spear fisher catch numbers of other fish groups (herbivores) increased, indicating they were being targeted more compared to the open season. The other study found that in targeted fisheries over 10 years, catch rates of red mullet and total catch (fish and invertebrates combined), but not European hake, increased after temporary closures, compared to before. One before-and-after, site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean found no change over nine years in cod catches following a temporary fishery closure compared to fished areas.\n\n2664: Establish temporary fishery closures\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nFive studies examined the effects of establishing temporary fishery closures on marine fish populations.

One study was in each of the Norwegian Sea (Norway), the North Sea (UK), the Gulf of Maine\xa0(USA), the Bismark Sea (Papua New Guinea) and the Kattegat\xa0(Sweden/Denmark).\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (4 STUDIES)\n\nCondition (2 studies): One replicated, before-and-after study in the Norwegian Sea found that in the five years after the long-term closure of a commercial coastal fishery, the weights of young salmon returning to rivers were higher than before, and weights of older salmon were similar or lower. One site comparison study in the Gulf of Maine found that there were smaller, but similar condition monkfish inside an area closed year-round to groundfish fishing for six to seven years than an area open to all fishing.\nAbundance (4 studies): Two site comparison studies in the Gulf of Maine and Bismark Sea found a higher abundance of only one of seven fish species and lower abundance of monkfish in areas closed to groundfish (bottom-dwelling) fisheries for six to eight years, compared to open areas. One of two replicated, before-and-after studies (one controlled) in the Norwegian Sea and North Sea found that there were more young salmon and similar numbers of older salmon returning to rivers than before, in the five years after the long-term closure of a commercial coastal fishery. The other study found that lesser sandeel biomass and density peaked but there was no overall increase in the three years after a long-term fishery closure compared to before.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nBehaviour change (1 study): One site comparison study in the Bismark Sea found that in an area closed to customary fishing for eight years, six of seven fish species had a lower flight response distance compared to an area open to customary fishing, making them more vulnerable to capture with spear guns.\n\nOTHER (3 STUDIES)\n\nReduction of unwanted catch (1 study): One replicated, before-and-after study in the Kattegat\xa0found that a combination of long-term fishery closures and areas limited to specific gears reduced unwanted catch of cod compared to before.\nReduction of fishing effort (1 study): One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the North Sea found that long-term closure of a commercial fishery reduced overall fishing effort for lesser sandeel.\nCommercial catch abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the North Sea found that annual sandeel catch rates were varied after the indefinite closure of the commercial fishery in an area.\n\n2664: Establish temporary fishery closures\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nFive studies examined the effects of establishing temporary fishery closures on marine fish populations. Two studies were in the North Atlantic Ocean (Canada, UK) and one study was in each of the North Sea (UK), the Philippine Sea\xa0(Palau) and the Mediterranean Sea (Spain).\n\n\xa0COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): One before-and-after, site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean found no increase in the biomass of the spawning stock of cod following a temporary fishery closure compared to fished areas over nine years.\nSurvival (1 study): One before-and-after, site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean found no change in the survival of cod following a temporary fishery closure compared to fished areas over nine years.\nCondition (1 study): One before-and-after, site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean found no change in the length composition of cod following a temporary fishery closure, compared to fished areas over nine years.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nUse (1 study): A study in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean reported that over five years tagged adult cod spent nearly a third of time inside a seasonally closed cod spawning area during implementation, and were thus given increased protection from any gears targeting bottom-dwelling fish during the spawning period.\n\nOTHER (4 STUDIES)\n\nReduction of fishing effort (1 study): One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the North Sea found that fixed temporary closures had little effect on fishing effort for cod, but real-time area closures reduced the annual amount of cod caught (retained and discarded).\nCommercial catch abundance (3 studies): One of two replicated (one controlled, one before-and-after) studies in the Philippine Sea and Mediterranean Sea found that during a temporary closure of a grouper fishery, spear fisher catch numbers of other fish groups (herbivores) increased, indicating they were being targeted more compared to the open season. The other study found that in targeted fisheries over 10 years, catch rates of red mullet and total catch (fish and invertebrates combined), but not European hake, increased after temporary closures, compared to before. One before-and-after, site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean found no change over nine years in cod catches following a temporary fishery closure compared to fished areas.\n\n2664: Establish temporary fishery closures\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nFive studies examined the effects of establishing temporary fishery closures on marine fish populations.

On fishing gear, six studies focused on humanwildlife conflict reported that five found reduced damage to fish catches and/or nets caused by common bottlenose dolphins and seals, while one found no reduction in damage to swordfish catches by California sea lions [2808]. The evidence base is larger overall for fishing gear (33 studies total on marine mammals, with six addressing conflict outcomes) than for aquaculture systems (six studies total), with mixed outcomes in both contexts [2808, 2775].\nStatements:'}], 'model': 'google/gemini-2.5-pro', 'max_tokens': 15000}, 'extra_json': {'require_parameters': True, 'reasoning': {'enabled': True, 'effort': 'high'}}}

The two other studies found that using acoustic devices did not reduce harbour seal predation at salmon farms, or reduce the presence, approach distances, groups sizes or time spent around fin-fish farms by common bottlenose dolphins.\n\n2808: Use acoustic devices on fishing gear\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nThirty-three studies evaluated the effects on marine mammals of using acoustic devices on fishing gear. Eight studies were in the North Atlantic Ocean\xa0(Canada, USA, UK), four studies were in each of the North Pacific Ocean\xa0(USA) and the North Sea\xa0(Germany, Denmark, UK), three studies were in the Mediterranean Sea (Spain, Italy), two studies were in each of the Fortune Channel\xa0(Canada), the South Atlantic Ocean\xa0(Argentina, Brazil) and the Baltic Sea\xa0(Denmark, Germany, Sweden), and one study was in each of Moreton Bay\xa0(Australia), the Black Sea\xa0(Turkey), the Celtic Sea\xa0(UK), the South Pacific Ocean\xa0(Peru), the Rainbow Channel\xa0(Australia), the UK\xa0(water body not stated), the Great Belt\xa0(Denmark), Omura Bay\xa0(Japan), and the Indian Ocean\xa0(Australia).\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (16 STUDIES)\n\nBehaviour change (16 studies):\xa0Twelve of 16 controlled studies (including three replicated studies) in the North Atlantic Ocean, the Fortune Channel, the South Atlantic Ocean, Moreton Bay, the Mediterranean Sea, the Celtic Sea, the Rainbow Channel, a coastal site in the UK, the Great Belt, the North Sea, Omura Bay\xa0and the Indian Ocean\xa0found that using acoustic devices on fishing nets, float lines\xa0or simulated fishing nets\xa0resulted in harbour porpoises, common bottlenose dolphins, tuxuci dolphins, finless porpoises\xa0and seals\xa0approaching nets or lines less closely, having fewer encounters or interactions with nets, or activity\xa0and sightings\xa0were reduced in the surrounding area. The other four studies found that using acoustic devices on trawl nets, float lines\xa0or simulated fishing nets\xa0did not have a significant effect on the behaviour of common bottlenose dolphins, harbour porpoises, Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins\xa0or dugongs.\n\nOTHER (19 STUDIES)\n\nReduction in entanglements/unwanted catch (14 studies): Nine studies (including seven controlled studies and two before-and after studies) in the North Atlantic Ocean, the North Sea, the South Atlantic Ocean, the North Pacific Ocean, the Black Sea, and the South Pacific Ocean\xa0found that using acoustic devices on cod traps\xa0or fishing nets\xa0resulted in fewer collisions of humpback whales\xa0or entanglements of harbour porpoises, Franciscana dolphins, beaked whales\xa0and small cetaceans. Three studies (including two controlled studies and one before-and-after study) in the North Pacific Ocean\xa0found that using acoustic devices on fishing nets resulted in fewer entanglements of some species but not others. One controlled study in the North Atlantic Ocean\xa0found that fishing nets with a complete set of acoustic devices had fewer entanglements of harbour porpoises, but those with an incomplete set did not. One replicated, controlled study in the North Sea and Baltic Sea\xa0found that using acoustic devices on fishing nets reduced harbour porpoise entanglements in one fishing area but not the other.\nHuman-wildlife conflict (6 studies): Five of six studies (including six controlled studies, one of which was replicated) in the Baltic Sea, the Mediterranean Sea, the North Pacific Ocean, a coastal site in the UK\xa0and the North Sea\xa0found that using acoustic devices reduced damage to fish catches and/or fishing nets caused by common bottlenose dolphins\xa0and seals. The other study\xa0found that acoustic devices did not reduce damage to swordfish catches by California sea lions.\n\n2815: Use acoustic devices on fishing vessels\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nFive studies evaluated the effects on marine mammals of using acoustic devices on vessels. One study was in each of the Shannon Estuary (Ireland), the Rainbow Channel\xa0(Australia), Keppel Bay\xa0(Australia), the North Atlantic Ocean\xa0(Azores) and the Indian Ocean\xa0(Crozet Islands).\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (4 STUDIES)\n\nBehaviour change (4 studies): One controlled study in the Shannon Estuary\xa0found that common bottlenose dolphins avoided a boat more frequently when acoustic devices of two types were deployed alongside it. One controlled study in the Indian Ocean\xa0found that killer whales were recorded further from a fishing vessel when an acoustic device was used during hauls, but distances decreased after the first exposure to the device. Two before-and-after studies in the Rainbow Channel\xa0and Keppel Bay\xa0found that an acoustic device deployed alongside a vessel reduced surfacing and echolocation rates\xa0and time spent foraging\xa0or socializing\xa0of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins\xa0and Australian snubfin dolphins\xa0but there was no effect on 810 other types of behaviour (e.g. vocalizing, diving, travelling etc.).\n\nOTHER (1 STUDY)\n\nHuman-wildlife conflict (1 study): One randomized, controlled study in the North Atlantic Ocean\xa0found that using acoustic devices of two types did not reduce predation of squid catches by Rissos dolphins.\n\n2816: Use acoustic devices on moorings\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nEight studies evaluated the effects on marine and freshwater mammals of using acoustic devices on moorings. Two studies were in the South Pacific Ocean\xa0and one study was in each of the Puntledge River\xa0(Canada), the Bay of Fundy\xa0(Canada), the Shannon Estuary\xa0(Ireland), the Rivers Conon and Esk\xa0(UK), the Kyle of Sutherland estuary\xa0(UK) and the North Atlantic Ocean\xa0(UK).\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (7 STUDIES)\n\nBehaviour change (7 studies): Two of four controlled studies in the South Pacific Ocean, the Kyle of Sutherland estuary\xa0and the North Atlantic Ocean\xa0found that deploying acoustic devices on moorings reduced numbers of grey and harbour seals, and the activity of harbour porpoises, short-beaked common dolphins and common bottlenose dolphins. The two other studies found that using an acoustic device on a mooring did not have a significant effect on the number, direction of movement, speed, or dive durations\xa0of migrating humpback whales. One controlled study in the Bay of Fundy\xa0found that using an acoustic device on a mooring reduced harbour porpoise echolocation activity, but the probability of porpoises approaching within 125 m of the device increased over 1011 days. One controlled study in the Shannon Estuary\xa0found that one of two types of acoustic device reduced the activity of common bottlenose dolphins.

Two studies were in the South Pacific Ocean\xa0and one study was in each of the Puntledge River\xa0(Canada), the Bay of Fundy\xa0(Canada), the Shannon Estuary\xa0(Ireland), the Rivers Conon and Esk\xa0(UK), the Kyle of Sutherland estuary\xa0(UK) and the North Atlantic Ocean\xa0(UK).\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (7 STUDIES)\n\nBehaviour change (7 studies): Two of four controlled studies in the South Pacific Ocean, the Kyle of Sutherland estuary\xa0and the North Atlantic Ocean\xa0found that deploying acoustic devices on moorings reduced numbers of grey and harbour seals, and the activity of harbour porpoises, short-beaked common dolphins and common bottlenose dolphins. The two other studies found that using an acoustic device on a mooring did not have a significant effect on the number, direction of movement, speed, or dive durations\xa0of migrating humpback whales. One controlled study in the Bay of Fundy\xa0found that using an acoustic device on a mooring reduced harbour porpoise echolocation activity, but the probability of porpoises approaching within 125 m of the device increased over 1011 days. One controlled study in the Shannon Estuary\xa0found that one of two types of acoustic device reduced the activity of common bottlenose dolphins. One replicated, controlled study in the Rivers Conon and Esk\xa0found that using acoustic devices reduced the number of grey and harbour seals upstream of the device but did not reduce seal numbers overall.\n\nOTHER (1 STUDY)\n\nHuman-wildlife conflict (1 study): One randomized controlled study in the Puntledge River\xa0found that deploying an acoustic device on a mooring reduced the number of harbour seals feeding on migrating juvenile salmon.\n\n2896: Use acoustic devices to deter marine and freshwater mammals from an area to reduce noise exposure\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nFour studies evaluated the effects of using acoustic devices to deter marine and freshwater mammals from an area to reduce noise exposure. Two studies were in the North Sea\xa0(Germany), one study was in the Great Belt\xa0(Denmark) and one was in Faxafli Bay\xa0(Iceland).\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (4 STUDIES)\n\nBehaviour change (4 studies): Three studies (including two controlled and one before-and-after study) in the North Sea\xa0and the Great Belt\xa0found that using acoustic devices to deter mammals from an area at a wind farm construction site\xa0or pelagic sites\xa0reduced the activity and sightings of harbour porpoises at distances of 118 km from the devices. One before-and-after study in Faxafli Bay\xa0found that when an acoustic device was deployed from a boat, minke whales swam away from the device, increased their swimming speed, and swam more directly.\n\n2775: Use acoustic devices at aquaculture systems\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nSix studies evaluated the effects on marine and freshwater mammals of using acoustic devices at aquaculture systems. Four studies were in the North Atlantic Ocean\xa0(USA, UK), one was in the Reloncav fjord\xa0(Chile) and one in the Mediterranean Sea\xa0(Italy).\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (6 STUDIES)\n\nHuman-wildlife conflict (6 studies): Four of six studies (including five before-and-after and/or site comparison studies and one controlled study) in the North Atlantic Ocean, the Reloncav fjord\xa0and the Mediterranean Sea\xa0found that using acoustic devices at salmon farms reduced predation on caged salmon by grey seals, harbour seals\xa0and South American sea lions, or reduced the number of harbour seals approaching a fish cage. The two other studies found that using acoustic devices did not reduce harbour seal predation at salmon farms, or reduce the presence, approach distances, groups sizes or time spent around fin-fish farms by common bottlenose dolphins.\n\n2808: Use acoustic devices on fishing gear\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nThirty-three studies evaluated the effects on marine mammals of using acoustic devices on fishing gear. Eight studies were in the North Atlantic Ocean\xa0(Canada, USA, UK), four studies were in each of the North Pacific Ocean\xa0(USA) and the North Sea\xa0(Germany, Denmark, UK), three studies were in the Mediterranean Sea (Spain, Italy), two studies were in each of the Fortune Channel\xa0(Canada), the South Atlantic Ocean\xa0(Argentina, Brazil) and the Baltic Sea\xa0(Denmark, Germany, Sweden), and one study was in each of Moreton Bay\xa0(Australia), the Black Sea\xa0(Turkey), the Celtic Sea\xa0(UK), the South Pacific Ocean\xa0(Peru), the Rainbow Channel\xa0(Australia), the UK\xa0(water body not stated), the Great Belt\xa0(Denmark), Omura Bay\xa0(Japan), and the Indian Ocean\xa0(Australia).\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (16 STUDIES)\n\nBehaviour change (16 studies):\xa0Twelve of 16 controlled studies (including three replicated studies) in the North Atlantic Ocean, the Fortune Channel, the South Atlantic Ocean, Moreton Bay, the Mediterranean Sea, the Celtic Sea, the Rainbow Channel, a coastal site in the UK, the Great Belt, the North Sea, Omura Bay\xa0and the Indian Ocean\xa0found that using acoustic devices on fishing nets, float lines\xa0or simulated fishing nets\xa0resulted in harbour porpoises, common bottlenose dolphins, tuxuci dolphins, finless porpoises\xa0and seals\xa0approaching nets or lines less closely, having fewer encounters or interactions with nets, or activity\xa0and sightings\xa0were reduced in the surrounding area. The other four studies found that using acoustic devices on trawl nets, float lines\xa0or simulated fishing nets\xa0did not have a significant effect on the behaviour of common bottlenose dolphins, harbour porpoises, Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins\xa0or dugongs.\n\nOTHER (19 STUDIES)\n\nReduction in entanglements/unwanted catch (14 studies): Nine studies (including seven controlled studies and two before-and after studies) in the North Atlantic Ocean, the North Sea, the South Atlantic Ocean, the North Pacific Ocean, the Black Sea, and the South Pacific Ocean\xa0found that using acoustic devices on cod traps\xa0or fishing nets\xa0resulted in fewer collisions of humpback whales\xa0or entanglements of harbour porpoises, Franciscana dolphins, beaked whales\xa0and small cetaceans. Three studies (including two controlled studies and one before-and-after study) in the North Pacific Ocean\xa0found that using acoustic devices on fishing nets resulted in fewer entanglements of some species but not others. One controlled study in the North Atlantic Ocean\xa0found that fishing nets with a complete set of acoustic devices had fewer entanglements of harbour porpoises, but those with an incomplete set did not. One replicated, controlled study in the North Sea and Baltic Sea\xa0found that using acoustic devices on fishing nets reduced harbour porpoise entanglements in one fishing area but not the other.\nHuman-wildlife conflict (6 studies): Five of six studies (including six controlled studies, one of which was replicated) in the Baltic Sea, the Mediterranean Sea, the North Pacific Ocean, a coastal site in the UK\xa0and the North Sea\xa0found that using acoustic devices reduced damage to fish catches and/or fishing nets caused by common bottlenose dolphins\xa0and seals. The other study\xa0found that acoustic devices did not reduce damage to swordfish catches by California sea lions.\nStatements: [Statement 1: Four of six studies at aquaculture systems reported reduced predation on caged salmon by grey seals, harbour seals, and South American sea lions.\nCitations for statement 1: 2775]\n[Statement 2: Four of six studies at aquaculture systems reported fewer harbour seals approaching cages.\nCitations for statement 2: 2775]\n[Statement 3: Two studies at aquaculture systems found no reductions for harbour seals or common bottlenose dolphins around fin-fish farms.\nCitations for statement 3: 2775]\n[Statement 4: Out of six studies on fishing gear focused on human-wildlife conflict, five found reduced damage to fish catches and/or nets caused by common bottlenose dolphins and seals.\nCitations for statement 4: 2808]\n[Statement 5: One study on fishing gear focused on human-wildlife conflict found no reduction in damage to swordfish catches by California sea lions.\nCitations for statement 5: 2808]\n[Statement 6: The overall evidence base is larger for fishing gear than for aquaculture systems.\nCitations for statement 6: 2808, 2775]\n[Statement 7: The evidence base for fishing gear includes 33 total studies on marine mammals, with six of those studies addressing conflict outcomes.\nCitations for statement 7: 2808]\n[Statement 8: The evidence base for aquaculture systems includes six total studies.\nCitations for statement 8: 2808, 2775]\n[Statement 9: Outcomes have been mixed in both the aquaculture system and fishing gear contexts.\nCitations for statement 9: 2808, 2775]\nResponse:"}], 'model': 'google/gemini-2.5-pro', 'max_tokens': 15000, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'Statements, Citations, Verdicts and Reasonings', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'properties': {'statement': {'description': 'A given statement.', 'title': 'Statement', 'type': 'string'}, 'citations': {'description': 'The list of citations for the statement (list).', 'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'title': 'Citations', 'type': 'array'}, 'reasoning': {'description': 'The reasoning behind the verdict.', 'title': 'Reasoning', 'type': 'string'}, 'verdict': {'description': "The verdict for the statement (i.e., 'Yes' or 'No').", 'title': 'Verdict', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['statement', 'citations', 'reasoning', 'verdict'], 'title': 'CitedStatementVerdict', 'type': 'object'}}}}}, 'extra_json': {'require_parameters': True, 'reasoning': {'enabled': True, 'effort': 'high'}}}

Permanent ground cover had higher organic matter than temporary cover in one of three comparisons in France [1367]. Incorporating cover crops into the soil increased organic matter in a Spanish vineyard study [1367]. Use organic fertilizer instead of inorganic: eight replicated studies, including a meta-analysis from Mediterranean countries, found higher soil organic matter with organic fertilizers in some comparisons [1366]. An Italian study reported more organic matter with compost than with manure [1366].\nStatements:'}], 'model': 'google/gemini-2.5-pro', 'max_tokens': 15000}, 'extra_json': {'require_parameters': True, 'reasoning': {'enabled': True, 'effort': 'high'}}}

Additional studies report that delaying mowing/grazing increased some natural enemy groups (greater abundance of some spiders and ground beetles) and more insect species/individuals visiting flowers in some cases, while other studies found no clear effect on some insects and spiders (ID: 131). Using grazing instead of cutting also shows mixed outcomes: effects on natural enemies varied by species/date with one study finding no effect; among five studies on pests/diseases, one found more pests, two found effects varied by pest group/date, and two found no effect; one study found no effect on disease when grazing was used in addition to cutting (ID: 885).\nStatements:'}], 'model': 'google/gemini-2.5-pro', 'max_tokens': 15000}, 'extra_json': {'require_parameters': True, 'reasoning': {'enabled': True, 'effort': 'high'}}}

Three studies from the UK (two of them replicated, randomised and controlled) found no change in insect predator numbers and one replicated study from Sweden found mixed effects between different predator groups. Natural enemy diversity: One replicated study from Sweden found a decrease in ant diversity with delayed cutting and one replicated, randomised, controlled study from the UK found no effect on spider and beetle diversity. Pests: One of two replicated, randomised, controlled studies from the UK and USA found more pest insects in late-cut plots and one found no effect. Insects in general: Four replicated, randomised, controlled studies measured the abundance of insect groups without classifying them as pests or natural enemies. One UK study found lower numbers in late-cut plots, while two found effects varied between groups. Two\xa0studies from the UK and USA found no effect on insect numbers.\nCrops studied were barley, birds-foot trefoil, clovers, fescues, rapeseed, ryegrass, other grasses and wheat.\n\n885: Use grazing instead of cutting for pasture or grassland management\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\nNatural enemies: Two studies (one before-and-after and one replicated trial) from Australia and the UK found grazing instead of cutting had mixed effects on natural enemies, with some species and groups affected on some dates but not others. One replicated study from New Zealand found no effect. Pests and diseases: One of five studies (including three replicated trials) from Australia, New Zealand, the UK and the USA found more pests, and two studies found effects varied between pest groups and sampling dates. Two studies found no effect on pests. One study found no effect on disease when grazing was used in addition to cutting. Pasture damage and plant survival: One randomised study found more ryegrass shoots were attacked by pests. One study found lower survival of alfalfa plants but another found no effect. Yield: One of four randomised, replicated studies (one also controlled) found lower yields and two found no effect. One study found lower ryegrass and higher clover yields, but no difference between clover varieties. Another randomised study found more ryegrass shoots.\nCrops studied were alfalfa, cocks-foot, perennial ryegrass, other grasses and white clover.\n\n727: Delay mowing or first grazing date on pasture or grassland\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\nNatural enemy abundance: One replicated, randomised, controlled study found fewer predatory spiders with delayed cutting.

Natural enemy diversity: One replicated study from Sweden found a decrease in ant diversity with delayed cutting and one replicated, randomised, controlled study from the UK found no effect on spider and beetle diversity. Pests: One of two replicated, randomised, controlled studies from the UK and USA found more pest insects in late-cut plots and one found no effect. Insects in general: Four replicated, randomised, controlled studies measured the abundance of insect groups without classifying them as pests or natural enemies. One UK study found lower numbers in late-cut plots, while two found effects varied between groups. Two\xa0studies from the UK and USA found no effect on insect numbers.\nCrops studied were barley, birds-foot trefoil, clovers, fescues, rapeseed, ryegrass, other grasses and wheat.\n\n885: Use grazing instead of cutting for pasture or grassland management\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\nNatural enemies: Two studies (one before-and-after and one replicated trial) from Australia and the UK found grazing instead of cutting had mixed effects on natural enemies, with some species and groups affected on some dates but not others. One replicated study from New Zealand found no effect. Pests and diseases: One of five studies (including three replicated trials) from Australia, New Zealand, the UK and the USA found more pests, and two studies found effects varied between pest groups and sampling dates. Two studies found no effect on pests. One study found no effect on disease when grazing was used in addition to cutting. Pasture damage and plant survival: One randomised study found more ryegrass shoots were attacked by pests. One study found lower survival of alfalfa plants but another found no effect. Yield: One of four randomised, replicated studies (one also controlled) found lower yields and two found no effect. One study found lower ryegrass and higher clover yields, but no difference between clover varieties. Another randomised study found more ryegrass shoots.\nCrops studied were alfalfa, cocks-foot, perennial ryegrass, other grasses and white clover.\n\n727: Delay mowing or first grazing date on pasture or grassland\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\nNatural enemy abundance: One replicated, randomised, controlled study found fewer predatory spiders with delayed cutting.

These benefits included: higher plant species richness, higher densities of two rare arable weeds, more insect species and individuals visiting flowers, greater abundance of some spiders and ground beetles, increased breeding wading bird densities, and increased Eurasian skylark productivity.\nThree reviews found the UK corncrake population increased after measures including delaying mowing dates were introduced.\nSix studies from Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK (including three replicated controlled trials of which one was also randomized and a European systematic review) found that delaying mowing or grazing dates on grassland had no clear effect on plant species richness, ground beetle communities, abundance of some insects and spiders, or population trends of wading bird species.\n\n885: Use grazing instead of cutting for pasture or grassland management\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\nNatural enemies: Two studies (one before-and-after and one replicated trial) from Australia and the UK found grazing instead of cutting had mixed effects on natural enemies, with some species and groups affected on some dates but not others.

A replicated, paired, controlled study reported reduced cover of forest\u2011characteristic mosses [1731]. In a drained rich fen, Sphagnum cover decreased over three years after tree removal, whereas in partly rewetted rich fens Sphagnum increased over eight years following tree removal [1731]. Two replicated, paired, controlled studies in rich fens reported increased total plant species richness, with one study noting a much smaller effect of tree removal in rewetted plots than in drained plots [1731]. Cutting/removing plantations and rewetting: Site\u2011comparison studies in bogs and fens found plant community composition changed and became less like drained, forested sites; some replicated fen studies found no or only small effects on overall composition [1732]. Two before\u2011and\u2011after studies reported increased abundance of wetland\u2011characteristic plants [1732]. For mosses, two replicated, paired studies found increased Sphagnum cover, one replicated before\u2011after site\u2011comparison found no effect, two before\u2011and\u2011after studies found mixed effects by site or species, and three studies reported reduced cover of non\u2011Sphagnum or forest\u2011characteristic mosses; one study found no effect on forest mosses when thinning/rewetting [1732]. Seven studies reported increased cover of at least one herb group (including cottongrasses and sedges), with one study reporting loss of cottongrass where it was rare and reduced purple moor grass [1732]. One study found increased ground vegetation height; another found no effect on canopy height after eight years; thinning reduced the number of tall trees for 13 years but not to natural levels [1732]. Two replicated, paired, controlled studies in rich fens reported increased plant species richness, while two replicated Finnish studies found no effect on total richness or diversity [1732].\nStatements:'}], 'model': 'google/gemini-2.5-pro', 'max_tokens': 15000}, 'extra_json': {'require_parameters': True, 'reasoning': {'enabled': True, 'effort': 'high'}}}

The studies in the fens\xa0were all based, at least in part, on the same experimental set-up.\nHerb cover (3 studies): Three replicated studies (two also paired and controlled) in bogs in the UK\xa0and fens in Sweden\xa0reported that tree removal increased cover of some herb species including cottongrasses\xa0and sedges. One of the studies\xa0reported no effect of tree removal on other herb species.\nMoss cover (3 studies): One replicated, paired, controlled study in bogs in the UK\xa0reported that tree removal reduced cover of forest-characteristic mosses. One replicated before-and-after study in a drained rich fen in Sweden\xa0reported that Sphagnum moss cover decreased over three years following tree removal. However, one replicated, paired, controlled study in partly rewetted rich fens reported that Sphagnum cover increased over eight years following tree removal.\nOverall plant richness/diversity (2 studies): Two replicated, paired, controlled studies in rich fens in Sweden\xa0reported that tree removal increased total plant species richness. However,\xa0one of these studies reported a much smaller effect of tree removal in rewetted plots than in drained plots.\n\n1732: Cut/remove/thin forest plantations and rewet peat\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nEleven studies evaluated the effects of cutting/removing trees and rewetting peat (in combination): six in fens, two in bogs, and three in both fens and bogs. In four of the studies,\xa0the peatlands naturally contained some trees. Three studies\xa0were based on one experimental set-up, and two studies\xa0were based on another.\nPlant community composition (5 studies): Of three replicated studies in fens, two in Finland\xa0found that removing trees/rewetting had no effect on the overall plant community composition whilst one in Sweden\xa0reported only a small effect.\xa0Two site comparison studies in bogs and fens in Finland\xa0found that removing trees/rewetting changed the overall plant community composition. It became less like sites that remained drained and forested.\nCharacteristic plants (2 studies): Two before-and-after studies (one site comparison, one controlled) in bogs and fens in Finland\xa0and Sweden\xa0reported that removing trees/rewetting increased the abundance of wetland-characteristic plants.\nMoss cover (6 studies): Of five studies that examined the effect of removing trees/rewetting on Sphagnum moss, two replicated, paired studies in bogs and fens in Sweden\xa0and Finland\xa0found that the intervention increased Sphagnum cover.\xa0One replicated, before-and-after, site comparison study in forested fens in Finland\xa0found no effect. Two before-and-after studies in a bog in Finland\xa0and a fen in Sweden\xa0found mixed effects depending on site\xa0or species. Additionally, three studies (two replicated and paired) in peatlands in the UK\xa0and Finland\xa0found that removing trees/rewetting reduced cover of non-Sphagnum or forest-characteristic mosses. However, one replicated, before-and-after, site comparison study in forested fens in Finland\xa0found no effect of thinning trees/rewetting on forest mosses.\nHerb cover (7 studies): Seven studies (including two replicated, paired, controlled) in bogs and fens in the UK, Finland\xa0and Sweden\xa0reported that removing trees/rewetting increased cover of at least one group of herbs, including cottongrasses\xa0and sedges. However, one of these studies\xa0reported loss of cottongrass from a fen where it was rare before intervention, along with reduced purple moor grass cover.\nVegetation structure (4 studies): One replicated site comparison study in a bog in the UK\xa0found that removing trees/rewetting increased ground vegetation height. One replicated, paired, controlled study in a fen in Sweden\xa0reported that removing trees/rewetting had no effect on canopy height after eight years. Two replicated, paired, site comparison studies in bogs and fens in Finland\xa0found that thinning trees/rewetting reduced the number of tall trees present for 13 years (although not to the level of natural peatlands).\nOverall plant richness/diversity (4 studies): Two replicated, paired, controlled studies in rich fens in Sweden\xa0reported that removing trees/rewetting increased plant species richness.

A replicated, paired, controlled study reported reduced cover of forest\u2011characteristic mosses [1731]. In a drained rich fen, Sphagnum cover decreased over three years after tree removal, whereas in partly rewetted rich fens Sphagnum increased over eight years following tree removal [1731]. Two replicated, paired, controlled studies in rich fens reported increased total plant species richness, with one study noting a much smaller effect of tree removal in rewetted plots than in drained plots [1731]. Cutting/removing plantations and rewetting: Site\u2011comparison studies in bogs and fens found plant community composition changed and became less like drained, forested sites; some replicated fen studies found no or only small effects on overall composition [1732]. Two before\u2011and\u2011after studies reported increased abundance of wetland\u2011characteristic plants [1732]. For mosses, two replicated, paired studies found increased Sphagnum cover, one replicated before\u2011after site\u2011comparison found no effect, two before\u2011and\u2011after studies found mixed effects by site or species, and three studies reported reduced cover of non\u2011Sphagnum or forest\u2011characteristic mosses; one study found no effect on forest mosses when thinning/rewetting [1732]. Seven studies reported increased cover of at least one herb group (including cottongrasses and sedges), with one study reporting loss of cottongrass where it was rare and reduced purple moor grass [1732]. One study found increased ground vegetation height; another found no effect on canopy height after eight years; thinning reduced the number of tall trees for 13 years but not to natural levels [1732]. Two replicated, paired, controlled studies in rich fens reported increased plant species richness, while two replicated Finnish studies found no effect on total richness or diversity [1732].\nStatements: ['Cutting or removing forest plantations alone was reported to increase the cover of some herb species, including cottongrasses and sedges.', 'One study reported that cutting or removing forest plantations alone had no effect on other herbs.', 'A study reported that just cutting or removing forest plantations reduced the cover of forest-characteristic mosses.', 'In a drained rich fen, Sphagnum cover decreased over three years after tree removal.', 'In partly rewetted rich fens, Sphagnum increased over eight years following tree removal.', 'Two studies in rich fens reported that cutting or removing forest plantations alone increased total plant species richness.', 'One study noted a much smaller effect of tree removal on plant species richness in rewetted plots than in drained plots.', 'After cutting or removing plantations and rewetting, studies in bogs and fens found that plant community composition changed and became less like drained, forested sites.', 'Some replicated fen studies found that cutting or removing plantations and rewetting had no or only small effects on overall plant composition.', 'After cutting or removing plantations and rewetting, two studies reported an increased abundance of wetland-characteristic plants.', 'For mosses, two studies found that cutting or removing plantations and rewetting increased Sphagnum cover.', 'For mosses, one study with rewetting found no effect on Sphagnum cover.', 'For mosses, two studies with rewetting found mixed effects depending on the site or species.', 'Three studies reported that cutting or removing plantations and rewetting reduced the cover of non-Sphagnum or forest-characteristic mosses.', 'One study found no effect on forest mosses when thinning trees and rewetting the peatland.', 'Seven studies reported that cutting or removing plantations and rewetting increased the cover of at least one herb group, including cottongrasses and sedges.', 'After cutting or removing plantations and rewetting, one study reported a loss of cottongrass where the plant was rare.', 'After cutting or removing plantations and rewetting, one study reported a reduction in purple moor grass.', 'After cutting or removing plantations and rewetting, one study found an increased ground vegetation height.', 'After cutting or removing plantations and rewetting, another study found no effect on canopy height after eight years.', 'Thinning trees reduced the number of tall trees for one to three years, but not to natural levels.', 'After cutting or removing plantations and rewetting, two studies in rich fens reported increased plant species richness.', 'After cutting or removing plantations and rewetting, two Finnish studies found no effect on total plant richness or diversity.']"}], 'model': 'google/gemini-2.5-pro', 'max_tokens': 15000, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'ListOfCitedStatements', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'properties': {'statement': {'title': 'Statement', 'type': 'string'}, 'citations': {'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'title': 'Citations', 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['statement', 'citations'], 'title': 'CitedStatement', 'type': 'object'}}}}}, 'extra_json': {'require_parameters': True, 'reasoning': {'enabled': True, 'effort': 'high'}}}

The studies in the fens\xa0were all based, at least in part, on the same experimental set-up.\nHerb cover (3 studies): Three replicated studies (two also paired and controlled) in bogs in the UK\xa0and fens in Sweden\xa0reported that tree removal increased cover of some herb species including cottongrasses\xa0and sedges. One of the studies\xa0reported no effect of tree removal on other herb species.\nMoss cover (3 studies): One replicated, paired, controlled study in bogs in the UK\xa0reported that tree removal reduced cover of forest-characteristic mosses. One replicated before-and-after study in a drained rich fen in Sweden\xa0reported that Sphagnum moss cover decreased over three years following tree removal. However, one replicated, paired, controlled study in partly rewetted rich fens reported that Sphagnum cover increased over eight years following tree removal.\nOverall plant richness/diversity (2 studies): Two replicated, paired, controlled studies in rich fens in Sweden\xa0reported that tree removal increased total plant species richness. However,\xa0one of these studies reported a much smaller effect of tree removal in rewetted plots than in drained plots.\n\n1732: Cut/remove/thin forest plantations and rewet peat\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nEleven studies evaluated the effects of cutting/removing trees and rewetting peat (in combination): six in fens, two in bogs, and three in both fens and bogs. In four of the studies,\xa0the peatlands naturally contained some trees. Three studies\xa0were based on one experimental set-up, and two studies\xa0were based on another.\nPlant community composition (5 studies): Of three replicated studies in fens, two in Finland\xa0found that removing trees/rewetting had no effect on the overall plant community composition whilst one in Sweden\xa0reported only a small effect.\xa0Two site comparison studies in bogs and fens in Finland\xa0found that removing trees/rewetting changed the overall plant community composition. It became less like sites that remained drained and forested.\nCharacteristic plants (2 studies): Two before-and-after studies (one site comparison, one controlled) in bogs and fens in Finland\xa0and Sweden\xa0reported that removing trees/rewetting increased the abundance of wetland-characteristic plants.\nMoss cover (6 studies): Of five studies that examined the effect of removing trees/rewetting on Sphagnum moss, two replicated, paired studies in bogs and fens in Sweden\xa0and Finland\xa0found that the intervention increased Sphagnum cover.\xa0One replicated, before-and-after, site comparison study in forested fens in Finland\xa0found no effect. Two before-and-after studies in a bog in Finland\xa0and a fen in Sweden\xa0found mixed effects depending on site\xa0or species. Additionally, three studies (two replicated and paired) in peatlands in the UK\xa0and Finland\xa0found that removing trees/rewetting reduced cover of non-Sphagnum or forest-characteristic mosses. However, one replicated, before-and-after, site comparison study in forested fens in Finland\xa0found no effect of thinning trees/rewetting on forest mosses.\nHerb cover (7 studies): Seven studies (including two replicated, paired, controlled) in bogs and fens in the UK, Finland\xa0and Sweden\xa0reported that removing trees/rewetting increased cover of at least one group of herbs, including cottongrasses\xa0and sedges. However, one of these studies\xa0reported loss of cottongrass from a fen where it was rare before intervention, along with reduced purple moor grass cover.\nVegetation structure (4 studies): One replicated site comparison study in a bog in the UK\xa0found that removing trees/rewetting increased ground vegetation height. One replicated, paired, controlled study in a fen in Sweden\xa0reported that removing trees/rewetting had no effect on canopy height after eight years. Two replicated, paired, site comparison studies in bogs and fens in Finland\xa0found that thinning trees/rewetting reduced the number of tall trees present for 13 years (although not to the level of natural peatlands).\nOverall plant richness/diversity (4 studies): Two replicated, paired, controlled studies in rich fens in Sweden\xa0reported that removing trees/rewetting increased plant species richness. However, two replicated studies in fens in Finland\xa0found that removing trees/rewetting had no effect on total plant species richness or diversity.\n\n1731: Cut/remove/thin forest plantations\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nFour studies evaluated the effect on peatland vegetation of cutting/removing forest plantations: one in bogs\xa0and three in fens.

Cutting alone reduced bracken cover or biomass in some UK studies, showed mixed effects in a paired study, and did not reduce bracken in one controlled study; it did not increase heather cover or seedling abundance in two UK studies; species responses varied, with one study reporting increased heathland plant species richness and another reporting no change in richness but increased diversity; cover of wavy hair-grass and sheeps fescue increased, while gorse and common cow-wheat did not increase [1653]. Combining cutting with herbicide reduced bracken biomass or cover; one UK study reported no change in heather biomass, another UK study found no significant effect on the cover of seven plant species, and a replicated UK study found higher plant species richness when cutting was followed by herbicide compared to the reverse sequence [1654].\nStatements:'}], 'model': 'google/gemini-2.5-pro', 'max_tokens': 15000}, 'extra_json': {'require_parameters': True, 'reasoning': {'enabled': True, 'effort': 'high'}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the documented benefits and harms of adopting reduced tillage systems on European farms?\nanswer: Across multiple European countries, reduced or non-inversion tillage has been associated with: increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms; greater abundance of some non-earthworm invertebrates; more weeds and/or weed species; higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying, shorter foraging distances; and greater abundance of some birds (including skylark, seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds) in late winter; a review also reported that no-till systems had more invertebrate bird food resources (all from Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Switzerland and the UK) [126]. Other documented outcomes include more soil microbes, more earthworm species, and higher microbial activity under reduced tillage in some trials, with other trials finding mixed or no effects on microbes, earthworms or other soil fauna [906]. Soil outcomes reported include reduced compaction and runoff under controlled traffic and reduced tillage in some studies, but higher compaction under reduced tillage in others [906]; reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage in several trials, but increased soil loss under no-till when there was no crop cover [906]; generally higher soil organic carbon under no/reduced tillage across many studies, alongside a randomized replicated trial from Spain finding greater soil organic carbon under conventional tillage and another trial finding no effect [906]; maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure, and higher nutrient retention in several studies, with mixed effects on soil nitrogen and one trial reporting less carbon and nitrate in no-till soil though conventionally tilled soil lost more of both [906]. Reported harms or neutral effects include negative, no, or inconsistent effects on some invertebrates (including earthworms), plant seed species numbers, some weed species, mammals, and some birds; one study found bird preferences for conservation tillage fields decreased over time; long-term earthworm responses were mixed across two 10-year studies; weed responses varied by crop type [126]. Yield effects reported include no yield difference in a randomized, replicated study from Portugal, while other non-European trials reported both lower and higher yields under different conditions [906].\nStatements:'}], 'model': 'google/gemini-2.5-pro', 'max_tokens': 15000}, 'extra_json': {'require_parameters': True, 'reasoning': {'enabled': True, 'effort': 'high'}}}

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done. One randomized, replicated study from Portugal found no effect of tillage treatment on yield.\n\xa0\nSOIL TYPES COVERED: anthrosol, calcareous silt loam, chalky, clay, clay loam, fine sandy loam, loam, loamy-clay, loam - sandy loam, loam  silt-loam, loamy sand, loamy silt, non-chalky clay, sandy, sandy clay loam, sandy loam, sandy silt-loam, silt loam, silty, silty-clay, silty clay loam, silty loam.\n\n126: Reduce tillage\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nA total of 42 individual studies (including seven replicated, controlled and randomized studies and six reviews) from Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Switzerland and the UK investigated the effects of reducing tillage on farmland wildlife. Thirty-four studies (of which 21 were replicated and controlled and seven also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found some positive effects on earthworms, some invertebrates (other than earthworms), weeds or farmland birds, of reducing tillage compared to conventional management. Positive effects included increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms, greater abundance of some invertebrates other than earthworms, increased numbers of some weeds and/or weed species, higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying date and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields, and greater abundance of some birds - including Eurasian skylark, seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in late winter on non-inversion or conservation tillage. A review found tillage had negative effects on invertebrate numbers and no-till systems had more invertebrate bird food resources.\nTwenty-six studies (of which 13 replicated and controlled and three also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found reducing tillage had either negative, no effect or no consistent effects on abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates (other than earthworms), earthworm abundance, biomass, or species richness, number of different plant species found as seeds, number of some weed species, mammal abundance, some bird species, and one study found bird preferences for conservation tillage fields decreased over time. Two studies found that crop type affected the number of weeds under different tillage regimes.\nOne small replicated trial in the UK compared bird numbers under two different forms of reduced tillage, and found more birds from species that make up the Farmland Bird Index on broadcast than non-inversion tillage fields.\nTwo studies looked at the long-term effects of reduced tillage on earthworms (after ten years). One study found higher earthworm biomass under reduced tillage, the other study found earthworm abundance was the same between conventional and reduced tillage plots.\nThree of the studies mentioned above did not distinguish between the effects of reducing tillage and reduced pesticide and/or fertilizer inputs.\n\n906: Change tillage practices\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\nBiodiversity loss: Eleven studies from Canada, Europe, Mexico, or the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil animals or microbes.

Other documented outcomes include more soil microbes, more earthworm species, and higher microbial activity under reduced tillage in some trials, with other trials finding mixed or no effects on microbes, earthworms or other soil fauna [906]. Soil outcomes reported include reduced compaction and runoff under controlled traffic and reduced tillage in some studies, but higher compaction under reduced tillage in others [906]; reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage in several trials, but increased soil loss under no-till when there was no crop cover [906]; generally higher soil organic carbon under no/reduced tillage across many studies, alongside a randomized replicated trial from Spain finding greater soil organic carbon under conventional tillage and another trial finding no effect [906]; maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure, and higher nutrient retention in several studies, with mixed effects on soil nitrogen and one trial reporting less carbon and nitrate in no-till soil though conventionally tilled soil lost more of both [906]. Reported harms or neutral effects include negative, no, or inconsistent effects on some invertebrates (including earthworms), plant seed species numbers, some weed species, mammals, and some birds; one study found bird preferences for conservation tillage fields decreased over time; long-term earthworm responses were mixed across two 10-year studies; weed responses varied by crop type [126]. Yield effects reported include no yield difference in a randomized, replicated study from Portugal, while other non-European trials reported both lower and higher yields under different conditions [906].\nStatements: ['Across multiple European countries, reduced or non-inversion tillage has been associated with increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms.', 'Reduced or non-inversion tillage has been associated with a greater abundance of some non-earthworm invertebrates.', 'Reduced or non-inversion tillage has been associated with more weeds and/or weed species.', 'Reduced or non-inversion tillage has been associated with higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying, and shorter foraging distances.', 'Reduced or non-inversion tillage has been associated with a greater abundance of some birds, including skylarks, seed-eating songbirds, and gamebirds, in late winter.', 'A review reported that no-till systems had more invertebrate bird food resources.', 'Some trials show more soil microbes, more earthworm species, and higher microbial activity under reduced tillage.', 'Other trials found that reduced tillage had mixed or no effects on microbes, earthworms, or other soil fauna.', 'Some studies reported reduced soil compaction and runoff when using controlled traffic and reduced tillage.', 'Other studies reported higher soil compaction under reduced tillage.', 'Several trials showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage systems.', 'Increased soil loss was observed under no-till systems when there was no crop cover.', 'Many studies found that soil organic carbon was generally higher under no-till or reduced tillage.', 'A randomized replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon under conventional tillage.', 'Another trial found no effect on soil organic carbon from different tillage systems.', 'Several studies found that reduced tillage maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure.', 'Several studies found higher nutrient retention with reduced tillage.', 'Effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen have been mixed.', 'One trial reported less carbon and nitrate in no-till soil, although conventionally tilled soil lost more of both.', 'Reduced tillage systems have shown negative, no, or inconsistent effects on some invertebrates, including earthworms.', 'Reduced tillage systems have shown negative, no, or inconsistent effects on plant seed species numbers, some weed species, mammals, and some birds.', 'One study found that bird preferences for conservation tillage fields decreased over time.', 'The long-term responses of earthworms to reduced tillage were mixed across two 10-year studies.', 'Weed responses to reduced tillage varied by crop type.', 'A randomized, replicated study from Portugal found no yield difference between tillage systems.', 'Non-European trials have reported both lower and higher crop yields under different conditions with reduced tillage.']"}], 'model': 'google/gemini-2.5-pro', 'max_tokens': 15000, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'ListOfCitedStatements', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'properties': {'statement': {'title': 'Statement', 'type': 'string'}, 'citations': {'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'title': 'Citations', 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['statement', 'citations'], 'title': 'CitedStatement', 'type': 'object'}}}}}, 'extra_json': {'require_parameters': True, 'reasoning': {'enabled': True, 'effort': 'high'}}}

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done. One randomized, replicated study from Portugal found no effect of tillage treatment on yield.\n\xa0\nSOIL TYPES COVERED: anthrosol, calcareous silt loam, chalky, clay, clay loam, fine sandy loam, loam, loamy-clay, loam - sandy loam, loam  silt-loam, loamy sand, loamy silt, non-chalky clay, sandy, sandy clay loam, sandy loam, sandy silt-loam, silt loam, silty, silty-clay, silty clay loam, silty loam.\n\n126: Reduce tillage\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nA total of 42 individual studies (including seven replicated, controlled and randomized studies and six reviews) from Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Switzerland and the UK investigated the effects of reducing tillage on farmland wildlife. Thirty-four studies (of which 21 were replicated and controlled and seven also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found some positive effects on earthworms, some invertebrates (other than earthworms), weeds or farmland birds, of reducing tillage compared to conventional management. Positive effects included increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms, greater abundance of some invertebrates other than earthworms, increased numbers of some weeds and/or weed species, higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying date and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields, and greater abundance of some birds - including Eurasian skylark, seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in late winter on non-inversion or conservation tillage. A review found tillage had negative effects on invertebrate numbers and no-till systems had more invertebrate bird food resources.\nTwenty-six studies (of which 13 replicated and controlled and three also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found reducing tillage had either negative, no effect or no consistent effects on abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates (other than earthworms), earthworm abundance, biomass, or species richness, number of different plant species found as seeds, number of some weed species, mammal abundance, some bird species, and one study found bird preferences for conservation tillage fields decreased over time. Two studies found that crop type affected the number of weeds under different tillage regimes.\nOne small replicated trial in the UK compared bird numbers under two different forms of reduced tillage, and found more birds from species that make up the Farmland Bird Index on broadcast than non-inversion tillage fields.\nTwo studies looked at the long-term effects of reduced tillage on earthworms (after ten years). One study found higher earthworm biomass under reduced tillage, the other study found earthworm abundance was the same between conventional and reduced tillage plots.\nThree of the studies mentioned above did not distinguish between the effects of reducing tillage and reduced pesticide and/or fertilizer inputs.\n\n906: Change tillage practices\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\nBiodiversity loss: Eleven studies from Canada, Europe, Mexico, or the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil animals or microbes.

Dietary and immune-based approaches include probiotics that increased survival after exposure to four bacterial pathogens, and diets with 28% plant protein that reduced lice infections by 28% with an additional 28% reduction when beta-glucans were added; mannan oligosaccharides improved gut function by preventing soybean-induced enteritis (732). Operational fallowing reduced lice numbers in one Scottish study, though an Australian study found no difference in Amoebic Gill Disease mortality (1026). Selective breeding for disease resistance increased survival against infectious pancreatic necrosis (735). Aerobic training increased survival against infectious pancreatic necrosis, with interval training outperforming continuous training (740). Freshwater bathing to manage amoebic gill disease showed mixed results, with one study reporting reduced amoebae for up to 10 days and another finding no difference (739).\nStatements:'}], 'model': 'google/gemini-2.5-pro', 'max_tokens': 15000}, 'extra_json': {'require_parameters': True, 'reasoning': {'enabled': True, 'effort': 'high'}}}

Dietary and immune-based approaches include probiotics that increased survival after exposure to four bacterial pathogens, and diets with 28% plant protein that reduced lice infections by 28% with an additional 28% reduction when beta-glucans were added; mannan oligosaccharides improved gut function by preventing soybean-induced enteritis (732). Operational fallowing reduced lice numbers in one Scottish study, though an Australian study found no difference in Amoebic Gill Disease mortality (1026). Selective breeding for disease resistance increased survival against infectious pancreatic necrosis (735). Aerobic training increased survival against infectious pancreatic necrosis, with interval training outperforming continuous training (740). Freshwater bathing to manage amoebic gill disease showed mixed results, with one study reporting reduced amoebae for up to 10 days and another finding no difference (739).\nStatements: ['Using natural control agents such as cleaner wrasse shows mixed effects on sea lice.', 'In one controlled study, corkwing and goldsinny wrasse were as effective as chemical treatments.', 'Rockcook wrasse were ineffective in a replicated, controlled study.', 'Probiotics increased survival of Atlantic salmon after exposure to four bacterial pathogens.', 'Diets with 28% plant protein reduced lice infections by 28%.', 'An additional 28% reduction in lice infections occurred when beta-glucans were added to diets with 28% plant protein.', 'Mannan oligosaccharides improved gut function by preventing soybean-induced enteritis.', 'Operational fallowing reduced lice numbers in one Scottish study.', 'An Australian study found no difference in Amoebic Gill Disease mortality as a result of operational fallowing.', 'Selective breeding for disease resistance increased survival against infectious pancreatic necrosis.', 'Aerobic training increased survival of Atlantic salmon against infectious pancreatic necrosis.', 'Interval training outperformed continuous training for increasing survival against infectious pancreatic necrosis.', 'Freshwater bathing to manage amoebic gill disease showed mixed results.', 'One study reported that freshwater bathing reduced amoebae for up to 10 days.', 'Another study found no difference in amoebae levels after freshwater bathing.']"}], 'model': 'google/gemini-2.5-pro', 'max_tokens': 15000, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'ListOfCitedStatements', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'properties': {'statement': {'title': 'Statement', 'type': 'string'}, 'citations': {'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'title': 'Citations', 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['statement', 'citations'], 'title': 'CitedStatement', 'type': 'object'}}}}}, 'extra_json': {'require_parameters': True, 'reasoning': {'enabled': True, 'effort': 'high'}}}

Evidence on other herbicides was mixed: diquat or diquat alginate reduced cover or eradicated submerged plants in three of four studies, with one small trial finding no effect; dichlobenil and terbutryne only partially reduced biomass in some trials, and one small field study found no effect of dichlobenil; asulam, 2,4\u2011D amine and dalapon reduced emergent plants in one replicated, controlled study [1279]. Physical (lightproof barriers): Five before\u2011and\u2011after UK studies found black sheeting or carpet strips eradicated or severely reduced cover, though two sites later had progressive recolonization after initial eradication [1294]. Physical (salt water): Two replicated, controlled container trials and two before\u2011and\u2011after field trials in the UK found seawater eradicated C. helmsii [1288].\nStatements:'}], 'model': 'google/gemini-2.5-flash', 'max_tokens': 15000}, 'extra_json': {'require_parameters': True, 'reasoning': {'enabled': True, 'effort': 'high'}}}

Seed-eating birds were more abundant on uncut and ungrazed plots than on uncut and grazed plots (224). A replicated, controlled, randomized UK study found no difference in ground beetle abundance and diversity between cut and uncut headlands in the first two years, but higher species diversity in uncut plots in the third year; no studies were found assessing effects on mammals (132, 2400). Raising mowing/cutting height: A replicated, controlled study and a review from the UK found raised mowing heights benefited Eurasian skylark, including increased productivity, and a review reported raised cutting heights were less damaging to amphibians and invertebrates (138). However, a randomized, replicated, controlled UK trial found no effect of raised mowing height on numbers of foraging birds or invertebrates, and one replicated controlled study found no difference in invertebrate abundance (138). A UK review found raised mowing height may have increased skylark productivity but not enough to maintain the local population (222). On intensively managed UK grassland, plots cut to 10 cm had similar butterfly species richness and abundance to plots cut to 5 cm (3968).\nStatements:'}], 'model': 'google/gemini-2.5-flash', 'max_tokens': 15000}, 'extra_json': {'require_parameters': True, 'reasoning': {'enabled': True, 'effort': 'high'}}}

One of these studies found that whilst seed-eating birds preferred rye grass cut once only, birds that fed on different food resources such as insect-eaters showed more variable results with some preferring plots cut two or more times.\nOne replicated controlled randomized study from the UK found no difference in ground beetle abundance and diversity between cut and uncut silage field headlands in the first two years of the experiment, but higher species diversity in uncut plots in the third year.\n\n138: Raise mowing height on grasslands to benefit farmland wildlife\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nA replicated controlled study and a review from the UK found that raised mowing heights provided benefits to Eurasian skylark including increased productivity. A review found raised cutting heights were less damaging to amphibians and invertebrates.\nA randomized, replicated, controlled trial from the UK found that raising mowing height on grasslands had no effect on numbers of foraging birds or invertebrates. One replicated controlled study found no difference in invertebrate abundance.\nOne replicated study from the UK found that northern lapwing and common starling chicks had greater foraging success in shorter grass.\n\n698: Use mowing techniques to reduce mortality\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nEight studies investigated the effects of different mowing techniques on wildlife. Seven studies (including four replicated trials of which one randomized, and one controlled and three reviews) from Germany, Ireland, Switzerland and the UK found that using specific mowing techniques can reduce mortality or injury in birds, mammals, amphibians or invertebrates. A review found the UK corncrake population increased around the same period that Corncrake Friendly Mowing schemes were introduced.\nOne replicated trial found that changing the mowing pattern reduced the number of corncrake chicks killed. Sixty-eight percent of chicks escaped mowing when fields were mown from the centre outwards, compared to 45% during conventional mowing from the field edge inwards.\nSix studies looked at the effects of using different mowing machinery. Two studies (one review, one randomized, replicated trial) found bar mowers and one report found double chop mowers caused less damage or lower mortality among amphibians and/or invertebrates than other types of mowing machinery. A review found evidence that twice as many small mammals were killed by rotary disc mowers with conditioners compared to double blade mowers. Two studies found that using a mechanical processor or conditioner killed or injured more invertebrates than without a conditioner, however one replicated controlled study found mower-conditioners resulted in higher Eurasian skylark nest survival than using a tedder. A review of studies found that skylark chick survival was four times higher when wider mowing machinery was used, whilst a replicated controlled trial found skylark nest survival was highest when swather mowers and forage harvesters were used.\n\n131: Delay mowing or first grazing date on pasture or grassland\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nEight studies from the Netherlands, Sweden and the UK (three replicated and controlled of which one also randomized and one European systematic review) found that delaying mowing or grazing dates resulted in benefits to some or all plants, invertebrates or birds studied. These benefits included: higher plant species richness, higher densities of two rare arable weeds, more insect species and individuals visiting flowers, greater abundance of some spiders and ground beetles, increased breeding wading bird densities, and increased Eurasian skylark productivity.\nThree reviews found the UK corncrake population increased after measures including delaying mowing dates were introduced.\nSix studies from Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK (including three replicated controlled trials of which one was also randomized and a European systematic review) found that delaying mowing or grazing dates on grassland had no clear effect on plant species richness, ground beetle communities, abundance of some insects and spiders, or population trends of wading bird species.\n\n132: Leave uncut strips of rye grass on silage fields\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nTwo reviews and two replicated controlled trials from the UK found that leaving uncut strips of rye grass on silage fields resulted in benefits to birds including increased numbers. One of these studies found that whilst seed-eating birds preferred rye grass cut once only, birds that fed on different food resources such as insect-eaters showed more variable results with some preferring plots cut two or more times.\nOne replicated controlled randomized study from the UK found no difference in ground beetle abundance and diversity between cut and uncut silage field headlands in the first two years of the experiment, but higher species diversity in uncut plots in the third year.\n\n224: Leave uncut rye grass in silage fields for birds\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nTwo reviews from the UK found that leaving rye grass uncut, or with only a single cut, benefited seed-eating birds and two replicated, controlled studies from the UK found that seed-eating birds were more abundant on uncut plots.\nTwo replicated and controlled studies and a review, all from the UK, found that seed-eating birds were more abundant on uncut and ungrazed plots than on uncut and grazed plots. \nA replicated, controlled study from the UK found that the responses of non-seed-eating birds were less certain than seed-eaters, with some species avoiding uncut rye grass.\n\n2400: Leave areas of uncut ryegrass in silage field\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on mammals of leaving areas of uncut ryegrass in silage field.\n\nWe found no studies' means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.\n\n138: Raise mowing height on grasslands to benefit farmland wildlife\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nA replicated controlled study and a review from the UK found that raised mowing heights provided benefits to Eurasian skylark including increased productivity. A review found raised cutting heights were less damaging to amphibians and invertebrates.\nA randomized, replicated, controlled trial from the UK found that raising mowing height on grasslands had no effect on numbers of foraging birds or invertebrates. One replicated controlled study found no difference in invertebrate abundance.\nOne replicated study from the UK found that northern lapwing and common starling chicks had greater foraging success in shorter grass.\n\n222: Raise mowing height on grasslands to benefit birds\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nA review from the UK  found that raising mowing height may have increased productivity of Eurasian skylarks, but not sufficiently to maintain the local population.\nA randomised, replicated and controlled study from the UK found that no more foraging birds were attracted to plots with raised mowing heights, compared to plots with shorter grass.\n\n3968: Raise cutting height on grasslands\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of raising cutting height on grasslands.

Seed-eating birds were more abundant on uncut and ungrazed plots than on uncut and grazed plots (224). A replicated, controlled, randomized UK study found no difference in ground beetle abundance and diversity between cut and uncut headlands in the first two years, but higher species diversity in uncut plots in the third year; no studies were found assessing effects on mammals (132, 2400). Raising mowing/cutting height: A replicated, controlled study and a review from the UK found raised mowing heights benefited Eurasian skylark, including increased productivity, and a review reported raised cutting heights were less damaging to amphibians and invertebrates (138). However, a randomized, replicated, controlled UK trial found no effect of raised mowing height on numbers of foraging birds or invertebrates, and one replicated controlled study found no difference in invertebrate abundance (138). A UK review found raised mowing height may have increased skylark productivity but not enough to maintain the local population (222). On intensively managed UK grassland, plots cut to 10 cm had similar butterfly species richness and abundance to plots cut to 5 cm (3968).\nStatements: ['Two reviews and two replicated, controlled UK trials reported benefits to birds when leaving uncut strips of rye grass.', 'Benefits to birds included increased numbers of birds on uncut or once-cut plots when leaving uncut strips of rye grass.', 'Increased numbers of birds on uncut or once-cut plots were particularly noted for seed-eating bird species.', 'Responses of non-seed-eating, insectivorous birds to uncut rye grass were more variable.', 'Some non-seed-eating, insectivorous bird species avoided uncut rye grass.', 'Seed-eating birds were more abundant on uncut and ungrazed plots.', 'Seed-eating birds were less abundant on uncut and grazed plots compared to uncut and ungrazed plots.', 'A replicated, controlled, randomized UK study found no difference in ground beetle abundance between cut and uncut headlands in the first two years.', 'A replicated, controlled, randomized UK study found no difference in ground beetle diversity between cut and uncut headlands in the first two years.', 'The same replicated, controlled, randomized UK study found higher ground beetle species diversity in uncut plots in the third year.', 'No studies were found assessing the effects of leaving uncut strips of rye grass on mammals.', 'A replicated, controlled study and a review from the UK found raised mowing heights benefited Eurasian skylark.', 'The benefits to Eurasian skylark from raised mowing heights included increased productivity.', 'A review reported that raised cutting heights were less damaging to amphibians.', 'A review reported that raised cutting heights were less damaging to invertebrates.', 'A randomized, replicated, controlled UK trial found no effect of raised mowing height on numbers of foraging birds.', 'A randomized, replicated, controlled UK trial found no effect of raised mowing height on numbers of invertebrates.', 'One replicated controlled study found no difference in invertebrate abundance when raising mowing height.', 'A UK review found that raised mowing height may have increased skylark productivity.', 'The increased skylark productivity from raised mowing height was not enough to maintain the local skylark population.', 'On intensively managed UK grassland, plots cut to 10 cm had similar butterfly species richness to plots cut to 5 cm.', 'On intensively managed UK grassland, plots cut to 10 cm had similar butterfly abundance to plots cut to 5 cm.']"}], 'model': 'google/gemini-2.5-flash', 'max_tokens': 15000, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'ListOfCitedStatements', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'properties': {'statement': {'title': 'Statement', 'type': 'string'}, 'citations': {'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'title': 'Citations', 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['statement', 'citations'], 'title': 'CitedStatement', 'type': 'object'}}}}}, 'extra_json': {'require_parameters': True, 'reasoning': {'enabled': True, 'effort': 'high'}}}

One of these studies found that whilst seed-eating birds preferred rye grass cut once only, birds that fed on different food resources such as insect-eaters showed more variable results with some preferring plots cut two or more times.\nOne replicated controlled randomized study from the UK found no difference in ground beetle abundance and diversity between cut and uncut silage field headlands in the first two years of the experiment, but higher species diversity in uncut plots in the third year.\n\n138: Raise mowing height on grasslands to benefit farmland wildlife\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nA replicated controlled study and a review from the UK found that raised mowing heights provided benefits to Eurasian skylark including increased productivity. A review found raised cutting heights were less damaging to amphibians and invertebrates.\nA randomized, replicated, controlled trial from the UK found that raising mowing height on grasslands had no effect on numbers of foraging birds or invertebrates. One replicated controlled study found no difference in invertebrate abundance.\nOne replicated study from the UK found that northern lapwing and common starling chicks had greater foraging success in shorter grass.\n\n698: Use mowing techniques to reduce mortality\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nEight studies investigated the effects of different mowing techniques on wildlife. Seven studies (including four replicated trials of which one randomized, and one controlled and three reviews) from Germany, Ireland, Switzerland and the UK found that using specific mowing techniques can reduce mortality or injury in birds, mammals, amphibians or invertebrates. A review found the UK corncrake population increased around the same period that Corncrake Friendly Mowing schemes were introduced.\nOne replicated trial found that changing the mowing pattern reduced the number of corncrake chicks killed. Sixty-eight percent of chicks escaped mowing when fields were mown from the centre outwards, compared to 45% during conventional mowing from the field edge inwards.\nSix studies looked at the effects of using different mowing machinery. Two studies (one review, one randomized, replicated trial) found bar mowers and one report found double chop mowers caused less damage or lower mortality among amphibians and/or invertebrates than other types of mowing machinery. A review found evidence that twice as many small mammals were killed by rotary disc mowers with conditioners compared to double blade mowers. Two studies found that using a mechanical processor or conditioner killed or injured more invertebrates than without a conditioner, however one replicated controlled study found mower-conditioners resulted in higher Eurasian skylark nest survival than using a tedder. A review of studies found that skylark chick survival was four times higher when wider mowing machinery was used, whilst a replicated controlled trial found skylark nest survival was highest when swather mowers and forage harvesters were used.\n\n131: Delay mowing or first grazing date on pasture or grassland\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nEight studies from the Netherlands, Sweden and the UK (three replicated and controlled of which one also randomized and one European systematic review) found that delaying mowing or grazing dates resulted in benefits to some or all plants, invertebrates or birds studied. These benefits included: higher plant species richness, higher densities of two rare arable weeds, more insect species and individuals visiting flowers, greater abundance of some spiders and ground beetles, increased breeding wading bird densities, and increased Eurasian skylark productivity.\nThree reviews found the UK corncrake population increased after measures including delaying mowing dates were introduced.\nSix studies from Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK (including three replicated controlled trials of which one was also randomized and a European systematic review) found that delaying mowing or grazing dates on grassland had no clear effect on plant species richness, ground beetle communities, abundance of some insects and spiders, or population trends of wading bird species.\n\n132: Leave uncut strips of rye grass on silage fields\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nTwo reviews and two replicated controlled trials from the UK found that leaving uncut strips of rye grass on silage fields resulted in benefits to birds including increased numbers. One of these studies found that whilst seed-eating birds preferred rye grass cut once only, birds that fed on different food resources such as insect-eaters showed more variable results with some preferring plots cut two or more times.\nOne replicated controlled randomized study from the UK found no difference in ground beetle abundance and diversity between cut and uncut silage field headlands in the first two years of the experiment, but higher species diversity in uncut plots in the third year.\n\n224: Leave uncut rye grass in silage fields for birds\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nTwo reviews from the UK found that leaving rye grass uncut, or with only a single cut, benefited seed-eating birds and two replicated, controlled studies from the UK found that seed-eating birds were more abundant on uncut plots.\nTwo replicated and controlled studies and a review, all from the UK, found that seed-eating birds were more abundant on uncut and ungrazed plots than on uncut and grazed plots. \nA replicated, controlled study from the UK found that the responses of non-seed-eating birds were less certain than seed-eaters, with some species avoiding uncut rye grass.\n\n2400: Leave areas of uncut ryegrass in silage field\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on mammals of leaving areas of uncut ryegrass in silage field.\n\nWe found no studies' means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.\n\n138: Raise mowing height on grasslands to benefit farmland wildlife\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nA replicated controlled study and a review from the UK found that raised mowing heights provided benefits to Eurasian skylark including increased productivity. A review found raised cutting heights were less damaging to amphibians and invertebrates.\nA randomized, replicated, controlled trial from the UK found that raising mowing height on grasslands had no effect on numbers of foraging birds or invertebrates. One replicated controlled study found no difference in invertebrate abundance.\nOne replicated study from the UK found that northern lapwing and common starling chicks had greater foraging success in shorter grass.\n\n222: Raise mowing height on grasslands to benefit birds\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nA review from the UK  found that raising mowing height may have increased productivity of Eurasian skylarks, but not sufficiently to maintain the local population.\nA randomised, replicated and controlled study from the UK found that no more foraging birds were attracted to plots with raised mowing heights, compared to plots with shorter grass.\n\n3968: Raise cutting height on grasslands\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of raising cutting height on grasslands. One study was in each of the UK\xa0and Switzerland.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nRichness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK\xa0found that intensively managed grassland plots cut to 10 cm in May and July had a similar species richness of butterflies to plots cut to 5 cm.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK\xa0found that intensively managed grassland plots cut to 10 cm in May and July had a similar abundance of butterflies and caterpillars to plots cut to 5 cm.\nSurvival (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in Switzerland\xa0found that the survival of large white caterpillars in grassland plots cut to 9 cm was similar to in plots cut to 6 cm2.\nCondition (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in Switzerland\xa0found that a similar proportion of wax model caterpillars were damaged when meadows were cut to 9 cm or 6 cm.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nStatements: [Statement 1: Two reviews and two replicated, controlled UK trials reported benefits to birds when leaving uncut strips of rye

In contrast, removing topsoil or turf before seeding/planting increased overall plant species richness and made communities more similar to intact reference steppe in a replicated study, increased richness of sown species, and, in a direct comparison, increased grass and forb species richness in most cases compared to disturbing the soil; overall vegetation cover did not change, but planted species cover was higher, common knapweed cover was lower, and seedling/plant survival of target grasses increased in two studies [3415].\nStatements:'}], 'model': 'google/gemini-2.5-flash', 'max_tokens': 15000}, 'extra_json': {'require_parameters': True, 'reasoning': {'enabled': True, 'effort': 'high'}}}

In contrast, removing topsoil or turf before seeding/planting increased overall plant species richness and made communities more similar to intact reference steppe in a replicated study, increased richness of sown species, and, in a direct comparison, increased grass and forb species richness in most cases compared to disturbing the soil; overall vegetation cover did not change, but planted species cover was higher, common knapweed cover was lower, and seedling/plant survival of target grasses increased in two studies [3415].\nStatements: ['Disturbing the soil before seeding produced mixed effects on plant richness and diversity across studies.', 'Disturbing the soil before seeding led to increases in plant richness and diversity in one of two studies.', 'Disturbing the soil before seeding showed no change in plant richness and diversity in the other study.', 'Disturbing the soil before seeding did not change total plant biomass.', 'Disturbing the soil before seeding increased forb cover in one study.', 'Disturbing the soil before seeding often improved plant emergence.', 'Plant survival increased in one of two studies when the soil was disturbed before seeding.', 'Seedling growth showed no effect when the soil was disturbed before seeding.', 'Removing topsoil or turf before seeding or planting increased overall plant species richness.', 'Removing topsoil or turf before seeding or planting made communities more similar to intact reference steppe in a replicated study.', 'Removing topsoil or turf before seeding or planting increased the richness of sown species.', 'In a direct comparison, removing topsoil or turf before seeding or planting increased grass and forb species richness in most cases compared to disturbing the soil.', 'Overall vegetation cover did not change after removing topsoil or turf before seeding or planting.', 'Planted species cover was higher after removing topsoil or turf before seeding or planting.', 'Common knapweed cover was lower after removing topsoil or turf before seeding or planting.', 'Seedling and plant survival of target grasses increased in two studies after removing topsoil or turf before seeding or planting.']"}], 'model': 'google/gemini-2.5-flash', 'max_tokens': 15000, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'ListOfCitedStatements', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'properties': {'statement': {'title': 'Statement', 'type': 'string'}, 'citations': {'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'title': 'Citations', 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['statement', 'citations'], 'title': 'CitedStatement', 'type': 'object'}}}}}, 'extra_json': {'require_parameters': True, 'reasoning': {'enabled': True, 'effort': 'high'}}}

Presenting food frozen in ice decreased abnormal/stereotypic behaviours and increased activity in bears and felids (1923). Hiding food around enclosures decreased stereotypical pacing in leopard cats and a black bear, and increased exploring/foraging (1915). Providing bones, hides or partial carcasses decreased stereotypic behaviours in lions and tigers (and Arctic foxes) and increased activity/manipulation time in felids (1902). Presenting food inside objects (e.g., Boomer balls) decreased stereotypic behaviours and increased exploratory/foraging in sloth and spectacled bears, though one case reported decreased exploring/foraging in a sloth bear (1924). Devices that simulate live prey had mixed effects: pacing decreased and walking increased in cougars, but pacing initially increased in tigers when a carcass was provided on a bungee (1927). Providing live vertebrate prey increased hunting and reduced sleeping in a fishing cat, but did not change stereotypical behaviours in tigers (1925). Allocating fast days was associated with more frequent pacing on non-feeding days in large felids (1906).\nStatements:'}], 'model': 'google/gemini-2.5-flash', 'max_tokens': 15000}, 'extra_json': {'require_parameters': True, 'reasoning': {'enabled': True, 'effort': 'high'}}}

Presenting food frozen in ice decreased abnormal/stereotypic behaviours and increased activity in bears and felids (1923). Hiding food around enclosures decreased stereotypical pacing in leopard cats and a black bear, and increased exploring/foraging (1915). Providing bones, hides or partial carcasses decreased stereotypic behaviours in lions and tigers (and Arctic foxes) and increased activity/manipulation time in felids (1902). Presenting food inside objects (e.g., Boomer balls) decreased stereotypic behaviours and increased exploratory/foraging in sloth and spectacled bears, though one case reported decreased exploring/foraging in a sloth bear (1924). Devices that simulate live prey had mixed effects: pacing decreased and walking increased in cougars, but pacing initially increased in tigers when a carcass was provided on a bungee (1927). Providing live vertebrate prey increased hunting and reduced sleeping in a fishing cat, but did not change stereotypical behaviours in tigers (1925). Allocating fast days was associated with more frequent pacing on non-feeding days in large felids (1906).\nStatements: ['Evidence suggests that various food-based methods have effectively lowered stereotypic or abnormal behaviors in large captive carnivores.', 'Presenting food frozen in ice led to a decrease in abnormal and stereotypic behaviors in bears and felids.', 'Presenting food frozen in ice led to an increase in activity in bears and felids.', 'Hiding food around enclosures decreased stereotypical pacing in leopard cats.', 'Hiding food around enclosures decreased stereotypical pacing in a black bear.', 'Hiding food around enclosures increased exploring and foraging behaviors.', 'Providing bones, hides, or partial carcasses decreased stereotypic behaviors in lions, tigers, and Arctic foxes.', 'Providing bones, hides, or partial carcasses increased activity and manipulation time in felids.', 'Presenting food inside objects, such as Boomer balls, decreased stereotypic behaviors in sloth and spectacled bears.', 'Presenting food inside objects, such as Boomer balls, increased exploratory and foraging behaviors in sloth and spectacled bears.', 'One particular case reported that presenting food inside objects decreased exploring and foraging in a sloth bear.', 'Devices designed to simulate live prey had mixed effects on large captive carnivores.', 'Pacing decreased and walking increased in cougars when devices simulating live prey were used.', 'Pacing initially increased in tigers when a carcass was provided on a bungee.', 'Providing live vertebrate prey increased hunting behavior in a fishing cat.', 'Providing live vertebrate prey reduced sleeping in a fishing cat.', 'Providing live vertebrate prey did not change stereotypical behaviors in tigers.', 'Allocating fast days was associated with more frequent pacing on non-feeding days in large felids.']"}], 'model': 'google/gemini-2.5-flash', 'max_tokens': 15000, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'ListOfCitedStatements', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'properties': {'statement': {'title': 'Statement', 'type': 'string'}, 'citations': {'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'title': 'Citations', 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['statement', 'citations'], 'title': 'CitedStatement', 'type': 'object'}}}}}, 'extra_json': {'require_parameters': True, 'reasoning': {'enabled': True, 'effort': 'high'}}}

One study was in each of the Norwegian Sea (Norway), the North Sea (UK), the Gulf of Maine\xa0(USA), the Bismark Sea (Papua New Guinea) and the Kattegat\xa0(Sweden/Denmark).\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (4 STUDIES)\n\nCondition (2 studies): One replicated, before-and-after study in the Norwegian Sea found that in the five years after the long-term closure of a commercial coastal fishery, the weights of young salmon returning to rivers were higher than before, and weights of older salmon were similar or lower. One site comparison study in the Gulf of Maine found that there were smaller, but similar condition monkfish inside an area closed year-round to groundfish fishing for six to seven years than an area open to all fishing.\nAbundance (4 studies): Two site comparison studies in the Gulf of Maine and Bismark Sea found a higher abundance of only one of seven fish species and lower abundance of monkfish in areas closed to groundfish (bottom-dwelling) fisheries for six to eight years, compared to open areas.

One study was in each of the Norwegian Sea (Norway), the North Sea (UK), the Gulf of Maine\xa0(USA), the Bismark Sea (Papua New Guinea) and the Kattegat\xa0(Sweden/Denmark).\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (4 STUDIES)\n\nCondition (2 studies): One replicated, before-and-after study in the Norwegian Sea found that in the five years after the long-term closure of a commercial coastal fishery, the weights of young salmon returning to rivers were higher than before, and weights of older salmon were similar or lower. One site comparison study in the Gulf of Maine found that there were smaller, but similar condition monkfish inside an area closed year-round to groundfish fishing for six to seven years than an area open to all fishing.\nAbundance (4 studies): Two site comparison studies in the Gulf of Maine and Bismark Sea found a higher abundance of only one of seven fish species and lower abundance of monkfish in areas closed to groundfish (bottom-dwelling) fisheries for six to eight years, compared to open areas. One of two replicated, before-and-after studies (one controlled) in the Norwegian Sea and North Sea found that there were more young salmon and similar numbers of older salmon returning to rivers than before, in the five years after the long-term closure of a commercial coastal fishery. The other study found that lesser sandeel biomass and density peaked but there was no overall increase in the three years after a long-term fishery closure compared to before.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nBehaviour change (1 study): One site comparison study in the Bismark Sea found that in an area closed to customary fishing for eight years, six of seven fish species had a lower flight response distance compared to an area open to customary fishing, making them more vulnerable to capture with spear guns.\n\nOTHER (3 STUDIES)\n\nReduction of unwanted catch (1 study): One replicated, before-and-after study in the Kattegat\xa0found that a combination of long-term fishery closures and areas limited to specific gears reduced unwanted catch of cod compared to before.\nReduction of fishing effort (1 study): One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the North Sea found that long-term closure of a commercial fishery reduced overall fishing effort for lesser sandeel.\nCommercial catch abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the North Sea found that annual sandeel catch rates were varied after the indefinite closure of the commercial fishery in an area.\nStatements: [Statement 1: A before-and-after, site comparison study reported no increase in the spawning stock biomass of cod following a temporary fishery closure over nine years, compared to fished areas.\nCitations for statement 1: 2664]\n[Statement 2: Evidence on long-term fishery closures reported mixed abundance outcomes.\nCitations for statement 2: 2655]\n[Statement 3: Two site comparison studies found a higher abundance of only one of seven fish species in areas closed to groundfish fisheries for six to eight years compared to open areas.\nCitations for statement 3: 2655]\n[Statement 4: Two site comparison studies found a lower abundance of monkfish in areas closed to groundfish fisheries for six to eight years compared to open areas.\nCitations for statement 4: 2655]\n[Statement 5: One replicated, before-and-after study found more young salmon returning to rivers in the five years after a long-term coastal fishery closure.\nCitations for statement 5: 2655]\n[Statement 6: One replicated, before-and-after study found similar numbers of older salmon returning to rivers in the five years after a long-term coastal fishery closure.\nCitations for statement 6: 2655]\n[Statement 7: Another replicated, before-and-after study found that lesser sandeel biomass peaked over three years after a long-term fishery closure.\nCitations for statement 7: 2655]\n[Statement 8: Another replicated, before-and-after study found that lesser sandeel density peaked over three years after a long-term fishery closure.\nCitations for statement 8: 2655]\n[Statement 9: Another replicated, before-and-after study found no overall increase in lesser sandeel biomass or density over three years after a long-term fishery closure.\nCitations for statement 9: 2655]\nResponse:"}], 'model': 'google/gemini-2.5-flash', 'max_tokens': 15000, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'Statements, Citations, Verdicts and Reasonings', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'properties': {'statement': {'description': 'A given statement.', 'title': 'Statement', 'type': 'string'}, 'citations': {'description': 'The list of citations for the statement (list).', 'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'title': 'Citations', 'type': 'array'}, 'reasoning': {'description': 'The reasoning behind the verdict.', 'title': 'Reasoning', 'type': 'string'}, 'verdict': {'description': "The verdict for the statement (i.e., 'Yes' or 'No').", 'title': 'Verdict', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['statement', 'citations', 'reasoning', 'verdict'], 'title': 'CitedStatementVerdict', 'type': 'object'}}}}}, 'extra_json': {'require_parameters': True, 'reasoning': {'enabled': True, 'effort': 'high'}}}

On fishing gear, six studies focused on humanwildlife conflict reported that five found reduced damage to fish catches and/or nets caused by common bottlenose dolphins and seals, while one found no reduction in damage to swordfish catches by California sea lions [2808].

Eight studies were in the North Atlantic Ocean\xa0(Canada, USA, UK), four studies were in each of the North Pacific Ocean\xa0(USA) and the North Sea\xa0(Germany, Denmark, UK), three studies were in the Mediterranean Sea (Spain, Italy), two studies were in each of the Fortune Channel\xa0(Canada), the South Atlantic Ocean\xa0(Argentina, Brazil) and the Baltic Sea\xa0(Denmark, Germany, Sweden), and one study was in each of Moreton Bay\xa0(Australia), the Black Sea\xa0(Turkey), the Celtic Sea\xa0(UK), the South Pacific Ocean\xa0(Peru), the Rainbow Channel\xa0(Australia), the UK\xa0(water body not stated), the Great Belt\xa0(Denmark), Omura Bay\xa0(Japan), and the Indian Ocean\xa0(Australia).\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (16 STUDIES)\n\nBehaviour change (16 studies):\xa0Twelve of 16 controlled studies (including three replicated studies) in the North Atlantic Ocean, the Fortune Channel, the South Atlantic Ocean, Moreton Bay, the Mediterranean Sea, the Celtic Sea, the Rainbow Channel, a coastal site in the UK, the Great Belt, the North Sea, Omura Bay\xa0and the Indian Ocean\xa0found that using acoustic devices on fishing nets, float lines\xa0or simulated fishing nets\xa0resulted in harbour porpoises, common bottlenose dolphins, tuxuci dolphins, finless porpoises\xa0and seals\xa0approaching nets or lines less closely, having fewer encounters or interactions with nets, or activity\xa0and sightings\xa0were reduced in the surrounding area. The other four studies found that using acoustic devices on trawl nets, float lines\xa0or simulated fishing nets\xa0did not have a significant effect on the behaviour of common bottlenose dolphins, harbour porpoises, Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins\xa0or dugongs.\n\nOTHER (19 STUDIES)\n\nReduction in entanglements/unwanted catch (14 studies): Nine studies (including seven controlled studies and two before-and after studies) in the North Atlantic Ocean, the North Sea, the South Atlantic Ocean, the North Pacific Ocean, the Black Sea, and the South Pacific Ocean\xa0found that using acoustic devices on cod traps\xa0or fishing nets\xa0resulted in fewer collisions of humpback whales\xa0or entanglements of harbour porpoises, Franciscana dolphins, beaked whales\xa0and small cetaceans. Three studies (including two controlled studies and one before-and-after study) in the North Pacific Ocean\xa0found that using acoustic devices on fishing nets resulted in fewer entanglements of some species but not others. One controlled study in the North Atlantic Ocean\xa0found that fishing nets with a complete set of acoustic devices had fewer entanglements of harbour porpoises, but those with an incomplete set did not.

The other study\xa0found that acoustic devices did not reduce damage to swordfish catches by California sea lions.\n\n2815: Use acoustic devices on fishing vessels\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nFive studies evaluated the effects on marine mammals of using acoustic devices on vessels. One study was in each of the Shannon Estuary (Ireland), the Rainbow Channel\xa0(Australia), Keppel Bay\xa0(Australia), the North Atlantic Ocean\xa0(Azores) and the Indian Ocean\xa0(Crozet Islands).\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (4 STUDIES)\n\nBehaviour change (4 studies): One controlled study in the Shannon Estuary\xa0found that common bottlenose dolphins avoided a boat more frequently when acoustic devices of two types were deployed alongside it. One controlled study in the Indian Ocean\xa0found that killer whales were recorded further from a fishing vessel when an acoustic device was used during hauls, but distances decreased after the first exposure to the device. Two before-and-after studies in the Rainbow Channel\xa0and Keppel Bay\xa0found that an acoustic device deployed alongside a vessel reduced surfacing and echolocation rates\xa0and time spent foraging\xa0or socializing\xa0of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins\xa0and Australian snubfin dolphins\xa0but there was no effect on 810 other types of behaviour (e.g. vocalizing, diving, travelling etc.).\n\nOTHER (1 STUDY)\n\nHuman-wildlife conflict (1 study): One randomized, controlled study in the North Atlantic Ocean\xa0found that using acoustic devices of two types did not reduce predation of squid catches by Rissos dolphins.\n\n2816: Use acoustic devices on moorings\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nEight studies evaluated the effects on marine and freshwater mammals of using acoustic devices on moorings. Two studies were in the South Pacific Ocean\xa0and one study was in each of the Puntledge River\xa0(Canada), the Bay of Fundy\xa0(Canada), the Shannon Estuary\xa0(Ireland), the Rivers Conon and Esk\xa0(UK), the Kyle of Sutherland estuary\xa0(UK) and the North Atlantic Ocean\xa0(UK).\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (7 STUDIES)\n\nBehaviour change (7 studies): Two of four controlled studies in the South Pacific Ocean, the Kyle of Sutherland estuary\xa0and the North Atlantic Ocean\xa0found that deploying acoustic devices on moorings reduced numbers of grey and harbour seals, and the activity of harbour porpoises, short-beaked common dolphins and common bottlenose dolphins. The two other studies found that using an acoustic device on a mooring did not have a significant effect on the number, direction of movement, speed, or dive durations\xa0of migrating humpback whales. One controlled study in the Bay of Fundy\xa0found that using an acoustic device on a mooring reduced harbour porpoise echolocation activity, but the probability of porpoises approaching within 125 m of the device increased over 1011 days. One controlled study in the Shannon Estuary\xa0found that one of two types of acoustic device reduced the activity of common bottlenose dolphins. One replicated, controlled study in the Rivers Conon and Esk\xa0found that using acoustic devices reduced the number of grey and harbour seals upstream of the device but did not reduce seal numbers overall.\n\nOTHER (1 STUDY)\n\nHuman-wildlife conflict (1 study): One randomized controlled study in the Puntledge River\xa0found that deploying an acoustic device on a mooring reduced the number of harbour seals feeding on migrating juvenile salmon.\n\n2896: Use acoustic devices to deter marine and freshwater mammals from an area to reduce noise exposure\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nFour studies evaluated the effects of using acoustic devices to deter marine and freshwater mammals from an area to reduce noise exposure.

Four studies were in the North Atlantic Ocean\xa0(USA, UK), one was in the Reloncav fjord\xa0(Chile) and one in the Mediterranean Sea\xa0(Italy).\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (6 STUDIES)\n\nHuman-wildlife conflict (6 studies): Four of six studies (including five before-and-after and/or site comparison studies and one controlled study) in the North Atlantic Ocean, the Reloncav fjord\xa0and the Mediterranean Sea\xa0found that using acoustic devices at salmon farms reduced predation on caged salmon by grey seals, harbour seals\xa0and South American sea lions, or reduced the number of harbour seals approaching a fish cage. The two other studies found that using acoustic devices did not reduce harbour seal predation at salmon farms, or reduce the presence, approach distances, groups sizes or time spent around fin-fish farms by common bottlenose dolphins.\n\n2808: Use acoustic devices on fishing gear\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nThirty-three studies evaluated the effects on marine mammals of using acoustic devices on fishing gear. Eight studies were in the North Atlantic Ocean\xa0(Canada, USA, UK), four studies were in each of the North Pacific Ocean\xa0(USA) and the North Sea\xa0(Germany, Denmark, UK), three studies were in the Mediterranean Sea (Spain, Italy), two studies were in each of the Fortune Channel\xa0(Canada), the South Atlantic Ocean\xa0(Argentina, Brazil) and the Baltic Sea\xa0(Denmark, Germany, Sweden), and one study was in each of Moreton Bay\xa0(Australia), the Black Sea\xa0(Turkey), the Celtic Sea\xa0(UK), the South Pacific Ocean\xa0(Peru), the Rainbow Channel\xa0(Australia), the UK\xa0(water body not stated), the Great Belt\xa0(Denmark), Omura Bay\xa0(Japan), and the Indian Ocean\xa0(Australia).\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (16 STUDIES)\n\nBehaviour change (16 studies):\xa0Twelve of 16 controlled studies (including three replicated studies) in the North Atlantic Ocean, the Fortune Channel, the South Atlantic Ocean, Moreton Bay, the Mediterranean Sea, the Celtic Sea, the Rainbow Channel, a coastal site in the UK, the Great Belt, the North Sea, Omura Bay\xa0and the Indian Ocean\xa0found that using acoustic devices on fishing nets, float lines\xa0or simulated fishing nets\xa0resulted in harbour porpoises, common bottlenose dolphins, tuxuci dolphins, finless porpoises\xa0and seals\xa0approaching nets or lines less closely, having fewer encounters or interactions with nets, or activity\xa0and sightings\xa0were reduced in the surrounding area. The other four studies found that using acoustic devices on trawl nets, float lines\xa0or simulated fishing nets\xa0did not have a significant effect on the behaviour of common bottlenose dolphins, harbour porpoises, Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins\xa0or dugongs.\n\nOTHER (19 STUDIES)\n\nReduction in entanglements/unwanted catch (14 studies): Nine studies (including seven controlled studies and two before-and after studies) in the North Atlantic Ocean, the North Sea, the South Atlantic Ocean, the North Pacific Ocean, the Black Sea, and the South Pacific Ocean\xa0found that using acoustic devices on cod traps\xa0or fishing nets\xa0resulted in fewer collisions of humpback whales\xa0or entanglements of harbour porpoises, Franciscana dolphins, beaked whales\xa0and small cetaceans. Three studies (including two controlled studies and one before-and-after study) in the North Pacific Ocean\xa0found that using acoustic devices on fishing nets resulted in fewer entanglements of some species but not others. One controlled study in the North Atlantic Ocean\xa0found that fishing nets with a complete set of acoustic devices had fewer entanglements of harbour porpoises, but those with an incomplete set did not. One replicated, controlled study in the North Sea and Baltic Sea\xa0found that using acoustic devices on fishing nets reduced harbour porpoise entanglements in one fishing area but not the other.\nHuman-wildlife conflict (6 studies): Five of six studies (including six controlled studies, one of which was replicated) in the Baltic Sea, the Mediterranean Sea, the North Pacific Ocean, a coastal site in the UK\xa0and the North Sea\xa0found that using acoustic devices reduced damage to fish catches and/or fishing nets caused by common bottlenose dolphins\xa0and seals. The other study\xa0found that acoustic devices did not reduce damage to swordfish catches by California sea lions.\n\n2815: Use acoustic devices on fishing vessels\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nFive studies evaluated the effects on marine mammals of using acoustic devices on vessels. One study was in each of the Shannon Estuary (Ireland), the Rainbow Channel\xa0(Australia), Keppel Bay\xa0(Australia), the North Atlantic Ocean\xa0(Azores) and the Indian Ocean\xa0(Crozet Islands).\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (4 STUDIES)\n\nBehaviour change (4 studies): One controlled study in the Shannon Estuary\xa0found that common bottlenose dolphins avoided a boat more frequently when acoustic devices of two types were deployed alongside it. One controlled study in the Indian Ocean\xa0found that killer whales were recorded further from a fishing vessel when an acoustic device was used during hauls, but distances decreased after the first exposure to the device. Two before-and-after studies in the Rainbow Channel\xa0and Keppel Bay\xa0found that an acoustic device deployed alongside a vessel reduced surfacing and echolocation rates\xa0and time spent foraging\xa0or socializing\xa0of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins\xa0and Australian snubfin dolphins\xa0but there was no effect on 810 other types of behaviour (e.g. vocalizing, diving, travelling etc.).\n\nOTHER (1 STUDY)\n\nHuman-wildlife conflict (1 study): One randomized, controlled study in the North Atlantic Ocean\xa0found that using acoustic devices of two types did not reduce predation of squid catches by Rissos dolphins.\n\n2816: Use acoustic devices on moorings\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nEight studies evaluated the effects on marine and freshwater mammals of using acoustic devices on moorings. Two studies were in the South Pacific Ocean\xa0and one study was in each of the Puntledge River\xa0(Canada), the Bay of Fundy\xa0(Canada), the Shannon Estuary\xa0(Ireland), the Rivers Conon and Esk\xa0(UK), the Kyle of Sutherland estuary\xa0(UK) and the North Atlantic Ocean\xa0(UK).\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (7 STUDIES)\n\nBehaviour change (7 studies): Two of four controlled studies in the South Pacific Ocean, the Kyle of Sutherland estuary\xa0and the North Atlantic Ocean\xa0found that deploying acoustic devices on moorings reduced numbers of grey and harbour seals, and the activity of harbour porpoises, short-beaked common dolphins and common bottlenose dolphins. The two other studies found that using an acoustic device on a mooring did not have a significant effect on the number, direction of movement, speed, or dive durations\xa0of migrating humpback whales. One controlled study in the Bay of Fundy\xa0found that using an acoustic device on a mooring reduced harbour porpoise echolocation activity, but the probability of porpoises approaching within 125 m of the device increased over 1011 days. One controlled study in the Shannon Estuary\xa0found that one of two types of acoustic device reduced the activity of common bottlenose dolphins. One replicated, controlled study in the Rivers Conon and Esk\xa0found that using acoustic devices reduced the number of grey and harbour seals upstream of the device but did not reduce seal numbers overall.\n\nOTHER (1 STUDY)\n\nHuman-wildlife conflict (1 study): One randomized controlled study in the Puntledge River\xa0found that deploying an acoustic device on a mooring reduced the number of harbour seals feeding on migrating juvenile salmon.\n\n2896: Use acoustic devices to deter marine and freshwater mammals from an area to reduce noise exposure\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nFour studies evaluated the effects of using acoustic devices to deter marine and freshwater mammals from an area to reduce noise exposure. Two studies were in the North Sea\xa0(Germany), one study was in the Great Belt\xa0(Denmark) and one was in Faxafli Bay\xa0(Iceland).\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (4 STUDIES)\n\nBehaviour change (4 studies): Three studies (including two controlled and one before-and-after study) in the North Sea\xa0and the Great Belt\xa0found that using acoustic devices to deter mammals from an area at a wind farm construction site\xa0or pelagic sites\xa0reduced the activity and sightings of harbour porpoises at distances of 118 km from the devices. One before-and-after study in Faxafli Bay\xa0found that when an acoustic device was deployed from a boat, minke whales swam away from the device, increased their swimming speed, and swam more directly.\n\n2775: Use acoustic devices at aquaculture systems\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nSix studies evaluated the effects on marine and freshwater mammals of using acoustic devices at aquaculture systems.

Permanent ground cover had higher organic matter than temporary cover in one of three comparisons in France [1367]. Incorporating cover crops into the soil increased organic matter in a Spanish vineyard study [1367]. Use organic fertilizer instead of inorganic: eight replicated studies, including a meta-analysis from Mediterranean countries, found higher soil organic matter with organic fertilizers in some comparisons [1366]. An Italian study reported more organic matter with compost than with manure [1366].\nStatements:'}], 'model': 'google/gemini-2.5-flash', 'max_tokens': 15000}, 'extra_json': {'require_parameters': True, 'reasoning': {'enabled': True, 'effort': 'high'}}}

Three studies from the UK (two of them replicated, randomised and controlled) found no change in insect predator numbers and one replicated study from Sweden found mixed effects between different predator groups. Natural enemy diversity: One replicated study from Sweden found a decrease in ant diversity with delayed cutting and one replicated, randomised, controlled study from the UK found no effect on spider and beetle diversity. Pests: One of two replicated, randomised, controlled studies from the UK and USA found more pest insects in late-cut plots and one found no effect. Insects in general: Four replicated, randomised, controlled studies measured the abundance of insect groups without classifying them as pests or natural enemies. One UK study found lower numbers in late-cut plots, while two found effects varied between groups. Two\xa0studies from the UK and USA found no effect on insect numbers.\nCrops studied were barley, birds-foot trefoil, clovers, fescues, rapeseed, ryegrass, other grasses and wheat.\n\n885: Use grazing instead of cutting for pasture or grassland management\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\nNatural enemies: Two studies (one before-and-after and one replicated trial) from Australia and the UK found grazing instead of cutting had mixed effects on natural enemies, with some species and groups affected on some dates but not others. One replicated study from New Zealand found no effect. Pests and diseases: One of five studies (including three replicated trials) from Australia, New Zealand, the UK and the USA found more pests, and two studies found effects varied between pest groups and sampling dates. Two studies found no effect on pests. One study found no effect on disease when grazing was used in addition to cutting. Pasture damage and plant survival: One randomised study found more ryegrass shoots were attacked by pests. One study found lower survival of alfalfa plants but another found no effect. Yield: One of four randomised, replicated studies (one also controlled) found lower yields and two found no effect. One study found lower ryegrass and higher clover yields, but no difference between clover varieties. Another randomised study found more ryegrass shoots.\nCrops studied were alfalfa, cocks-foot, perennial ryegrass, other grasses and white clover.\n\n727: Delay mowing or first grazing date on pasture or grassland\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\nNatural enemy abundance: One replicated, randomised, controlled study found fewer predatory spiders with delayed cutting.

Three studies from the UK (two of them replicated, randomised and controlled) found no change in insect predator numbers and one replicated study from Sweden found mixed effects between different predator groups. Natural enemy diversity: One replicated study from Sweden found a decrease in ant diversity with delayed cutting and one replicated, randomised, controlled study from the UK found no effect on spider and beetle diversity. Pests: One of two replicated, randomised, controlled studies from the UK and USA found more pest insects in late-cut plots and one found no effect. Insects in general: Four replicated, randomised, controlled studies measured the abundance of insect groups without classifying them as pests or natural enemies. One UK study found lower numbers in late-cut plots, while two found effects varied between groups. Two\xa0studies from the UK and USA found no effect on insect numbers.\nCrops studied were barley, birds-foot trefoil, clovers, fescues, rapeseed, ryegrass, other grasses and wheat.\n\n885: Use grazing instead of cutting for pasture or grassland management\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\nNatural enemies: Two studies (one before-and-after and one replicated trial) from Australia and the UK found grazing instead of cutting had mixed effects on natural enemies, with some species and groups affected on some dates but not others. One replicated study from New Zealand found no effect. Pests and diseases: One of five studies (including three replicated trials) from Australia, New Zealand, the UK and the USA found more pests, and two studies found effects varied between pest groups and sampling dates. Two studies found no effect on pests. One study found no effect on disease when grazing was used in addition to cutting. Pasture damage and plant survival: One randomised study found more ryegrass shoots were attacked by pests. One study found lower survival of alfalfa plants but another found no effect. Yield: One of four randomised, replicated studies (one also controlled) found lower yields and two found no effect. One study found lower ryegrass and higher clover yields, but no difference between clover varieties. Another randomised study found more ryegrass shoots.\nCrops studied were alfalfa, cocks-foot, perennial ryegrass, other grasses and white clover.\n\n727: Delay mowing or first grazing date on pasture or grassland\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\nNatural enemy abundance: One replicated, randomised, controlled study found fewer predatory spiders with delayed cutting.

These benefits included: higher plant species richness, higher densities of two rare arable weeds, more insect species and individuals visiting flowers, greater abundance of some spiders and ground beetles, increased breeding wading bird densities, and increased Eurasian skylark productivity.\nThree reviews found the UK corncrake population increased after measures including delaying mowing dates were introduced.\nSix studies from Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK (including three replicated controlled trials of which one was also randomized and a European systematic review) found that delaying mowing or grazing dates on grassland had no clear effect on plant species richness, ground beetle communities, abundance of some insects and spiders, or population trends of wading bird species.\n\n885: Use grazing instead of cutting for pasture or grassland management\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\nNatural enemies: Two studies (one before-and-after and one replicated trial) from Australia and the UK found grazing instead of cutting had mixed effects on natural enemies, with some species and groups affected on some dates but not others.

A replicated, paired, controlled study reported reduced cover of forest\u2011characteristic mosses [1731]. In a drained rich fen, Sphagnum cover decreased over three years after tree removal, whereas in partly rewetted rich fens Sphagnum increased over eight years following tree removal [1731]. Two replicated, paired, controlled studies in rich fens reported increased total plant species richness, with one study noting a much smaller effect of tree removal in rewetted plots than in drained plots [1731]. Cutting/removing plantations and rewetting: Site\u2011comparison studies in bogs and fens found plant community composition changed and became less like drained, forested sites; some replicated fen studies found no or only small effects on overall composition [1732]. Two before\u2011and\u2011after studies reported increased abundance of wetland\u2011characteristic plants [1732]. For mosses, two replicated, paired studies found increased Sphagnum cover, one replicated before\u2011after site\u2011comparison found no effect, two before\u2011and\u2011after studies found mixed effects by site or species, and three studies reported reduced cover of non\u2011Sphagnum or forest\u2011characteristic mosses; one study found no effect on forest mosses when thinning/rewetting [1732]. Seven studies reported increased cover of at least one herb group (including cottongrasses and sedges), with one study reporting loss of cottongrass where it was rare and reduced purple moor grass [1732]. One study found increased ground vegetation height; another found no effect on canopy height after eight years; thinning reduced the number of tall trees for 13 years but not to natural levels [1732]. Two replicated, paired, controlled studies in rich fens reported increased plant species richness, while two replicated Finnish studies found no effect on total richness or diversity [1732].\nStatements:'}], 'model': 'google/gemini-2.5-flash', 'max_tokens': 15000}, 'extra_json': {'require_parameters': True, 'reasoning': {'enabled': True, 'effort': 'high'}}}

A replicated, paired, controlled study reported reduced cover of forest\u2011characteristic mosses [1731]. In a drained rich fen, Sphagnum cover decreased over three years after tree removal, whereas in partly rewetted rich fens Sphagnum increased over eight years following tree removal [1731]. Two replicated, paired, controlled studies in rich fens reported increased total plant species richness, with one study noting a much smaller effect of tree removal in rewetted plots than in drained plots [1731]. Cutting/removing plantations and rewetting: Site\u2011comparison studies in bogs and fens found plant community composition changed and became less like drained, forested sites; some replicated fen studies found no or only small effects on overall composition [1732]. Two before\u2011and\u2011after studies reported increased abundance of wetland\u2011characteristic plants [1732]. For mosses, two replicated, paired studies found increased Sphagnum cover, one replicated before\u2011after site\u2011comparison found no effect, two before\u2011and\u2011after studies found mixed effects by site or species, and three studies reported reduced cover of non\u2011Sphagnum or forest\u2011characteristic mosses; one study found no effect on forest mosses when thinning/rewetting [1732]. Seven studies reported increased cover of at least one herb group (including cottongrasses and sedges), with one study reporting loss of cottongrass where it was rare and reduced purple moor grass [1732]. One study found increased ground vegetation height; another found no effect on canopy height after eight years; thinning reduced the number of tall trees for 13 years but not to natural levels [1732]. Two replicated, paired, controlled studies in rich fens reported increased plant species richness, while two replicated Finnish studies found no effect on total richness or diversity [1732].\nStatements: ['Three replicated studies reported increased cover of some herb species including cottongrasses and sedges after cutting/removing forest plantations alone.', 'Two of these replicated studies were also paired and controlled.', 'One study reported no effect on other herbs after cutting/removing forest plantations alone.', 'A replicated, paired, controlled study reported reduced cover of forest-characteristic mosses after cutting/removing forest plantations alone.', 'In a drained rich fen, Sphagnum cover decreased over three years after tree removal.', 'In partly rewetted rich fens, Sphagnum increased over eight years following tree removal.', 'Two replicated, paired, controlled studies in rich fens reported increased total plant species richness after cutting/removing forest plantations alone.', 'One study noted a much smaller effect of tree removal in rewetted plots than in drained plots when cutting/removing forest plantations alone.', 'Site-comparison studies in bogs and fens found plant community composition changed and became less like drained, forested sites after cutting/removing plantations and rewetting.', 'Some replicated fen studies found no or only small effects on overall composition after cutting/removing plantations and rewetting.', 'Two before-and-after studies reported increased abundance of wetland-characteristic plants after cutting/removing plantations and rewetting.', 'For mosses, two replicated, paired studies found increased Sphagnum cover after cutting/removing plantations and rewetting.', 'One replicated before-and-after site-comparison study found no effect on mosses after cutting/removing plantations and rewetting.', 'Two before-and-after studies found mixed effects by site or species on mosses after cutting/removing plantations and rewetting.', 'Three studies reported reduced cover of non-Sphagnum or forest-characteristic mosses after cutting/removing plantations and rewetting.', 'One study found no effect on forest mosses when thinning/rewetting.', 'Seven studies reported increased cover of at least one herb group (including cottongrasses and sedges) after cutting/removing plantations and rewetting.', 'One study reported loss of cottongrass where cottongrass was rare after cutting/removing plantations and rewetting.', 'One study reported reduced purple moor grass after cutting/removing plantations and rewetting.', 'One study found increased ground vegetation height after cutting/removing plantations and rewetting.', 'Another study found no effect on canopy height after eight years after cutting/removing plantations and rewetting.', 'Thinning reduced the number of tall trees for 13 years but not to natural levels.', 'Two replicated, paired, controlled studies in rich fens reported increased plant species richness after cutting/removing plantations and rewetting.', 'Two replicated Finnish studies found no effect on total richness or diversity after cutting/removing plantations and rewetting.']"}], 'model': 'google/gemini-2.5-flash', 'max_tokens': 15000, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'ListOfCitedStatements', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'properties': {'statement': {'title': 'Statement', 'type': 'string'}, 'citations': {'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'title': 'Citations', 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['statement', 'citations'], 'title': 'CitedStatement', 'type': 'object'}}}}}, 'extra_json': {'require_parameters': True, 'reasoning': {'enabled': True, 'effort': 'high'}}}

Cutting alone reduced bracken cover or biomass in some UK studies, showed mixed effects in a paired study, and did not reduce bracken in one controlled study; it did not increase heather cover or seedling abundance in two UK studies; species responses varied, with one study reporting increased heathland plant species richness and another reporting no change in richness but increased diversity; cover of wavy hair-grass and sheeps fescue increased, while gorse and common cow-wheat did not increase [1653]. Combining cutting with herbicide reduced bracken biomass or cover; one UK study reported no change in heather biomass, another UK study found no significant effect on the cover of seven plant species, and a replicated UK study found higher plant species richness when cutting was followed by herbicide compared to the reverse sequence [1654].\nStatements:'}], 'model': 'google/gemini-2.5-flash', 'max_tokens': 15000}, 'extra_json': {'require_parameters': True, 'reasoning': {'enabled': True, 'effort': 'high'}}}

Cutting alone reduced bracken cover or biomass in some UK studies, showed mixed effects in a paired study, and did not reduce bracken in one controlled study; it did not increase heather cover or seedling abundance in two UK studies; species responses varied, with one study reporting increased heathland plant species richness and another reporting no change in richness but increased diversity; cover of wavy hair-grass and sheeps fescue increased, while gorse and common cow-wheat did not increase [1653]. Combining cutting with herbicide reduced bracken biomass or cover; one UK study reported no change in heather biomass, another UK study found no significant effect on the cover of seven plant species, and a replicated UK study found higher plant species richness when cutting was followed by herbicide compared to the reverse sequence [1654].\nStatements: ['Herbicide alone generally reduced bracken biomass or cover in UK heathland studies.', 'One controlled study found no change in bracken biomass or cover when using herbicide alone.', 'Herbicide alone increased heather biomass in one study.', 'Two studies found no increase in heather cover when using herbicide alone.', 'Herbicide alone increased heather seedling numbers in one before-and-after trial.', 'Plant species richness showed mixed responses after applying herbicide alone.', 'One study found increased plant species richness after applying herbicide alone.', 'Another study found no effect on plant species richness or diversity after applying herbicide alone.', 'The cover of wavy hair-grass increased after herbicide alone application.', 'The cover of sheeps fescue increased after herbicide alone application.', 'Increases were reported for gorse after herbicide alone application.', 'Increases were reported for common cow-wheat after herbicide alone application.', 'Silver birch seedlings increased following herbicide application.', 'Cutting alone reduced bracken cover or biomass in some UK studies.', 'Cutting alone showed mixed effects on bracken in a paired study.', 'Cutting alone did not reduce bracken in one controlled study.', 'Cutting alone did not increase heather cover in two UK studies.', 'Cutting alone did not increase heather seedling abundance in two UK studies.', 'Species responses varied after cutting alone.', 'One study reported increased heathland plant species richness after cutting alone.', 'Another study reported no change in species richness after cutting alone.', 'Another study reported increased diversity after cutting alone.', 'The cover of wavy hair-grass increased after cutting alone.', 'The cover of sheeps fescue increased after cutting alone.', 'Gorse did not increase after cutting alone.', 'Common cow-wheat did not increase after cutting alone.', 'Combining cutting with herbicide reduced bracken biomass or cover.', 'One UK study reported no change in heather biomass when combining cutting with herbicide.', 'Another UK study found no significant effect on the cover of seven plant species when combining cutting with herbicide.', 'A replicated UK study found higher plant species richness when cutting was followed by herbicide compared to the reverse sequence.', 'Plant species richness was higher when cutting followed by herbicide was used, compared to herbicide followed by cutting.']"}], 'model': 'google/gemini-2.5-flash', 'max_tokens': 15000, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'ListOfCitedStatements', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'properties': {'statement': {'title': 'Statement', 'type': 'string'}, 'citations': {'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'title': 'Citations', 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['statement', 'citations'], 'title': 'CitedStatement', 'type': 'object'}}}}}, 'extra_json': {'require_parameters': True, 'reasoning': {'enabled': True, 'effort': 'high'}}}

One randomized, controlled, before-and-after trial in Norway\xa0found that cutting and applying herbicide increased heather cover. One\xa0randomized, replicated, controlled, paired study in the UK found that cutting and using herbicide had no significant effect on the cover of seven plant species.\nOne replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK\xa0found that cutting bracken followed by applying herbicide increased plant species richness when compared with applying herbicide followed by cutting.\nThree randomized, controlled studies (one also a before-and-after trial, and one of which was a paired study) in the UK\xa0and Norway\xa0found that cutting and applying herbicide reduced bracken biomass\xa0or cover.\nStatements: [Statement 1: Herbicide alone generally reduced bracken biomass or cover in UK heathland studies.\nCitations for statement 1: 1652]\n[Statement 2: One controlled study found no

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the documented benefits and harms of adopting reduced tillage systems on European farms?\nanswer: Across multiple European countries, reduced or non-inversion tillage has been associated with: increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms; greater abundance of some non-earthworm invertebrates; more weeds and/or weed species; higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying, shorter foraging distances; and greater abundance of some birds (including skylark, seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds) in late winter; a review also reported that no-till systems had more invertebrate bird food resources (all from Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Switzerland and the UK) [126]. Other documented outcomes include more soil microbes, more earthworm species, and higher microbial activity under reduced tillage in some trials, with other trials finding mixed or no effects on microbes, earthworms or other soil fauna [906]. Soil outcomes reported include reduced compaction and runoff under controlled traffic and reduced tillage in some studies, but higher compaction under reduced tillage in others [906]; reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage in several trials, but increased soil loss under no-till when there was no crop cover [906]; generally higher soil organic carbon under no/reduced tillage across many studies, alongside a randomized replicated trial from Spain finding greater soil organic carbon under conventional tillage and another trial finding no effect [906]; maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure, and higher nutrient retention in several studies, with mixed effects on soil nitrogen and one trial reporting less carbon and nitrate in no-till soil though conventionally tilled soil lost more of both [906]. Reported harms or neutral effects include negative, no, or inconsistent effects on some invertebrates (including earthworms), plant seed species numbers, some weed species, mammals, and some birds; one study found bird preferences for conservation tillage fields decreased over time; long-term earthworm responses were mixed across two 10-year studies; weed responses varied by crop type [126]. Yield effects reported include no yield difference in a randomized, replicated study from Portugal, while other non-European trials reported both lower and higher yields under different conditions [906].\nStatements:'}], 'model': 'google/gemini-2.5-flash', 'max_tokens': 15000}, 'extra_json': {'require_parameters': True, 'reasoning': {'enabled': True, 'effort': 'high'}}}

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done. One randomized, replicated study from Portugal found no effect of tillage treatment on yield.\n\xa0\nSOIL TYPES COVERED: anthrosol, calcareous silt loam, chalky, clay, clay loam, fine sandy loam, loam, loamy-clay, loam - sandy loam, loam  silt-loam, loamy sand, loamy silt, non-chalky clay, sandy, sandy clay loam, sandy loam, sandy silt-loam, silt loam, silty, silty-clay, silty clay loam, silty loam.\n\n126: Reduce tillage\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nA total of 42 individual studies (including seven replicated, controlled and randomized studies and six reviews) from Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Switzerland and the UK investigated the effects of reducing tillage on farmland wildlife. Thirty-four studies (of which 21 were replicated and controlled and seven also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found some positive effects on earthworms, some invertebrates (other than earthworms), weeds or farmland birds, of reducing tillage compared to conventional management. Positive effects included increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms, greater abundance of some invertebrates other than earthworms, increased numbers of some weeds and/or weed species, higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying date and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields, and greater abundance of some birds - including Eurasian skylark, seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in late winter on non-inversion or conservation tillage. A review found tillage had negative effects on invertebrate numbers and no-till systems had more invertebrate bird food resources.\nTwenty-six studies (of which 13 replicated and controlled and three also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found reducing tillage had either negative, no effect or no consistent effects on abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates (other than earthworms), earthworm abundance, biomass, or species richness, number of different plant species found as seeds, number of some weed species, mammal abundance, some bird species, and one study found bird preferences for conservation tillage fields decreased over time. Two studies found that crop type affected the number of weeds under different tillage regimes.\nOne small replicated trial in the UK compared bird numbers under two different forms of reduced tillage, and found more birds from species that make up the Farmland Bird Index on broadcast than non-inversion tillage fields.\nTwo studies looked at the long-term effects of reduced tillage on earthworms (after ten years). One study found higher earthworm biomass under reduced tillage, the other study found earthworm abundance was the same between conventional and reduced tillage plots.\nThree of the studies mentioned above did not distinguish between the effects of reducing tillage and reduced pesticide and/or fertilizer inputs.\n\n906: Change tillage practices\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\nBiodiversity loss: Eleven studies from Canada, Europe, Mexico, or the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil animals or microbes.

Other documented outcomes include more soil microbes, more earthworm species, and higher microbial activity under reduced tillage in some trials, with other trials finding mixed or no effects on microbes, earthworms or other soil fauna [906]. Soil outcomes reported include reduced compaction and runoff under controlled traffic and reduced tillage in some studies, but higher compaction under reduced tillage in others [906]; reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage in several trials, but increased soil loss under no-till when there was no crop cover [906]; generally higher soil organic carbon under no/reduced tillage across many studies, alongside a randomized replicated trial from Spain finding greater soil organic carbon under conventional tillage and another trial finding no effect [906]; maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure, and higher nutrient retention in several studies, with mixed effects on soil nitrogen and one trial reporting less carbon and nitrate in no-till soil though conventionally tilled soil lost more of both [906]. Reported harms or neutral effects include negative, no, or inconsistent effects on some invertebrates (including earthworms), plant seed species numbers, some weed species, mammals, and some birds; one study found bird preferences for conservation tillage fields decreased over time; long-term earthworm responses were mixed across two 10-year studies; weed responses varied by crop type [126]. Yield effects reported include no yield difference in a randomized, replicated study from Portugal, while other non-European trials reported both lower and higher yields under different conditions [906].\nStatements: ['Reduced or non-inversion tillage increases the biomass of earthworms.', 'Reduced or non-inversion tillage increases the species richness or abundance of earthworms.', 'Reduced or non-inversion tillage increases the abundance of some non-earthworm invertebrates.', 'Reduced or non-inversion tillage can be associated with more weeds.', 'Reduced or non-inversion tillage can be associated with more weed species.', 'Reduced or non-inversion tillage increases Eurasian skylark nest density.', 'Reduced or non-inversion tillage leads to earlier laying for Eurasian skylarks.', 'Reduced or non-inversion tillage results in shorter foraging distances for Eurasian skylarks.', 'Reduced or non-inversion tillage increases the abundance of some birds (including skylarks, seed-eating songbirds, and gamebirds) in late winter.', 'No-till systems have more invertebrate bird food resources, as reported by a review.', 'Some trials show more soil microbes under reduced tillage.', 'Some trials show more earthworm species under reduced tillage.', 'Some trials show higher microbial activity under reduced tillage.', 'Other trials demonstrate mixed or no effects on soil microbes under reduced tillage.', 'Other trials demonstrate mixed or no effects on earthworms under reduced tillage.', 'Other trials demonstrate mixed or no effects on other soil fauna under reduced tillage.', 'Some studies report reduced soil compaction under controlled traffic and reduced tillage.', 'Some studies report reduced runoff under controlled traffic and reduced tillage.', 'Other studies report higher compaction under reduced tillage.', 'Several trials show reduced soil loss under reduced tillage.', 'Several trials show reduced runoff under reduced tillage.', 'No-till can lead to increased soil loss when there is no crop cover.', 'Many studies generally show higher soil organic carbon under no-tillage or reduced tillage.', 'A randomized replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon under conventional tillage.', 'Another trial found no effect on soil organic carbon.', 'Several studies report maintained or increased soil organic matter.', 'Several studies report improved soil structure.', 'Several studies report higher nutrient retention.', 'Reduced tillage has mixed effects on soil nitrogen.', 'One trial reported less carbon in no-till soil.', 'One trial reported less nitrate in no-till soil.', 'Conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon than no-till soil, as reported by one trial.', 'Conventionally tilled soil lost more nitrate than no-till soil, as reported by one trial.', 'Negative, no, or inconsistent effects on some invertebrates (including earthworms) have been reported.', 'Negative, no, or inconsistent effects on plant seed species numbers have been reported.', 'Negative, no, or inconsistent effects on some weed species have been reported.', 'Negative, no, or inconsistent effects on mammals have been reported.', 'Negative, no, or inconsistent effects on some birds have been reported.', 'One study found bird preferences for conservation tillage fields decreased over time.', 'Long-term earthworm responses were mixed across two 10-year studies.', 'Weed responses varied by crop type.', 'A randomized, replicated study from Portugal reported no yield difference from reduced tillage.', 'Other non-European trials reported lower yields under different conditions.', 'Other non-European trials reported higher yields under different conditions.']"}], 'model': 'google/gemini-2.5-flash', 'max_tokens': 15000, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'ListOfCitedStatements', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'properties': {'statement': {'title': 'Statement', 'type': 'string'}, 'citations': {'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'title': 'Citations', 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['statement', 'citations'], 'title': 'CitedStatement', 'type': 'object'}}}}}, 'extra_json': {'require_parameters': True, 'reasoning': {'enabled': True, 'effort': 'high'}}}

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done. One randomized, replicated study from Portugal found no effect of tillage treatment on yield.\n\xa0\nSOIL TYPES COVERED: anthrosol, calcareous silt loam, chalky, clay, clay loam, fine sandy loam, loam, loamy-clay, loam - sandy loam, loam  silt-loam, loamy sand, loamy silt, non-chalky clay, sandy, sandy clay loam, sandy loam, sandy silt-loam, silt loam, silty, silty-clay, silty clay loam, silty loam.\n\n126: Reduce tillage\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\n\nA total of 42 individual studies (including seven replicated, controlled and randomized studies and six reviews) from Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Switzerland and the UK investigated the effects of reducing tillage on farmland wildlife. Thirty-four studies (of which 21 were replicated and controlled and seven also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found some positive effects on earthworms, some invertebrates (other than earthworms), weeds or farmland birds, of reducing tillage compared to conventional management. Positive effects included increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms, greater abundance of some invertebrates other than earthworms, increased numbers of some weeds and/or weed species, higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying date and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields, and greater abundance of some birds - including Eurasian skylark, seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in late winter on non-inversion or conservation tillage. A review found tillage had negative effects on invertebrate numbers and no-till systems had more invertebrate bird food resources.\nTwenty-six studies (of which 13 replicated and controlled and three also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found reducing tillage had either negative, no effect or no consistent effects on abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates (other than earthworms), earthworm abundance, biomass, or species richness, number of different plant species found as seeds, number of some weed species, mammal abundance, some bird species, and one study found bird preferences for conservation tillage fields decreased over time. Two studies found that crop type affected the number of weeds under different tillage regimes.\nOne small replicated trial in the UK compared bird numbers under two different forms of reduced tillage, and found more birds from species that make up the Farmland Bird Index on broadcast than non-inversion tillage fields.\nTwo studies looked at the long-term effects of reduced tillage on earthworms (after ten years). One study found higher earthworm biomass under reduced tillage, the other study found earthworm abundance was the same between conventional and reduced tillage plots.\nThree of the studies mentioned above did not distinguish between the effects of reducing tillage and reduced pesticide and/or fertilizer inputs.\n\n906: Change tillage practices\nKey Messages: Key Messages:\nBiodiversity loss: Eleven studies from Canada, Europe, Mexico, or the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil animals or microbes.

Dietary and immune-based approaches include probiotics that increased survival after exposure to four bacterial pathogens, and diets with 28% plant protein that reduced lice infections by 28% with an additional 28% reduction when beta-glucans were added; mannan oligosaccharides improved gut function by preventing soybean-induced enteritis (732). Operational fallowing reduced lice numbers in one Scottish study, though an Australian study found no difference in Amoebic Gill Disease mortality (1026). Selective breeding for disease resistance increased survival against infectious pancreatic necrosis (735). Aerobic training increased survival against infectious pancreatic necrosis, with interval training outperforming continuous training (740). Freshwater bathing to manage amoebic gill disease showed mixed results, with one study reporting reduced amoebae for up to 10 days and another finding no difference (739).\nStatements:'}], 'model': 'google/gemini-2.5-flash', 'max_tokens': 15000}, 'extra_json': {'require_parameters': True, 'reasoning': {'enabled': True, 'effort': 'high'}}}

Dietary and immune-based approaches include probiotics that increased survival after exposure to four bacterial pathogens, and diets with 28% plant protein that reduced lice infections by 28% with an additional 28% reduction when beta-glucans were added; mannan oligosaccharides improved gut function by preventing soybean-induced enteritis (732). Operational fallowing reduced lice numbers in one Scottish study, though an Australian study found no difference in Amoebic Gill Disease mortality (1026). Selective breeding for disease resistance increased survival against infectious pancreatic necrosis (735). Aerobic training increased survival against infectious pancreatic necrosis, with interval training outperforming continuous training (740). Freshwater bathing to manage amoebic gill disease showed mixed results, with one study reporting reduced amoebae for up to 10 days and another finding no difference (739).\nStatements: ['The use of natural control agents, including cleaner wrasse, demonstrates mixed effects on sea lice.', 'In one controlled study, corkwing wrasse and goldsinny wrasse were as effective as chemical treatments against sea lice.', 'Rockcook wrasse were found to be ineffective in a replicated, controlled study for controlling sea lice.', 'Probiotics increased survival after exposure to four bacterial pathogens.', 'Diets containing 28% plant protein reduced lice infections by 28%.', 'Adding beta-glucans to diets with 28% plant protein resulted in an additional 28% reduction in lice infections.', 'Mannan oligosaccharides improved gut function by preventing soybean-induced enteritis.', 'Operational fallowing reduced lice numbers in one Scottish study.', 'An Australian study found no difference in Amoebic Gill Disease mortality with operational fallowing.', 'Selective breeding for disease resistance increased survival against infectious pancreatic necrosis.', 'Aerobic training increased survival against infectious pancreatic necrosis.', 'Interval training outperformed continuous training regarding increased survival against infectious pancreatic necrosis.', 'Freshwater bathing to manage amoebic gill disease showed mixed results.', 'One study reported that freshwater bathing reduced amoebae for up to 10 days.', 'Another study found no difference with freshwater bathing for managing amoebic gill disease.']"}], 'model': 'google/gemini-2.5-flash', 'max_tokens': 15000, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'ListOfCitedStatements', 'strict': True, 'schema': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'properties': {'statement': {'title': 'Statement', 'type': 'string'}, 'citations': {'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'title': 'Citations', 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['statement', 'citations'], 'title': 'CitedStatement', 'type': 'object'}}}}}, 'extra_json': {'require_parameters': True, 'reasoning': {'enabled': True, 'effort': 'high'}}}

  {
    "statement": "Several practices for preventing disease in aquaculture have been documented.",
    "reasoning": "This statement is relevant because it establishes the context for the question. The question asks for best practices in tilapia farming, which is a specific type of aquaculture. By confirming that disease prevention practices in aquaculture are documented, the statement provides a foundational premise for identifying specific practices applicable to tilapia.",
    "verdict": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "statement": "Establishing fallowing systems can reduce parasites and disease.",
    "reasoning": "This statement is relevant as it proposes a specific practice, 'fallowing systems,' aimed at reducing parasites and disease. Fallowing, which involves leaving a farm site empty between production cycles, is a general biosecurity measure in aquaculture that breaks the life cycles of pathogens. This practice is applicable to various forms of aquaculture, including tilapia farming in ponds or cages, and directly addresses the question of what practices can be used for disease prevention.",
    "verdict": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "statement": "A study in Scotland recorded lower lice numbers on Atlantic salmon in cages that used a fallowing system.",
    "reasoning": "This statement is not relevant. While it provides an example of fallowing being effective, the context is specific to Atlantic salmon and sea lice. Sea lice are a major issue in marine salmon farming but are not a significant pathogen for tilapia, which are primarily farmed in freshwater environments. The specificity of the example to a different fish species and a non-relevant parasite makes it irrelevant to disease prevention in tilapia farming.",
    "verdict": "No"
  },
  {
    "statement": "Breeding for resistance traits has been shown to be effective.",
    "reasoning": "This statement is relevant because it identifies a key genetic strategy for disease prevention. Selective breeding to enhance the natural disease resistance of fish is a well-established best practice in aquaculture. This proactive approach is directly applicable to tilapia, with active breeding programs in place globally to develop strains that are more resistant to common diseases like Streptococcosis and Tilapia Lake Virus (TiLV).",
    "verdict": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "statement": "A study in Norway found that a salmon family bred for high resistance to infectious pancreatic necrosis had increased survival levels compared to a family bred for low resistance.",
    "reasoning": "This statement is not relevant. Although it supports the general principle of breeding for resistance mentioned in Statement 4, the specific example concerns salmon and a disease (infectious pancreatic necrosis) that primarily affects salmonids. The question is about tilapia, so an example involving a different fish species and a disease not found in tilapia is not directly useful or applicable.",
    "verdict": "No"
  },
  {
    "statement": "The practice of leaving fallow periods during fish farming has been studied.",
    "reasoning": "This statement is relevant because it adds weight and credibility to the practice of fallowing (introduced in Statement 2) as a method for disease prevention. By indicating that the practice has been a subject of scientific study, it suggests it is a recognized and potentially evidence-based management tool in fish farming, which broadly includes tilapia farming. This supports its consideration as a 'best practice'.",
    "verdict": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "statement": "Three studies examined the effects of fallow periods on invertebrate populations.",
    "reasoning": "This statement is not relevant. It describes an outcome of fallowing related to its effect on general invertebrate populations, which is an environmental or ecological consideration. It does not connect this effect to disease prevention. While some invertebrates can be intermediate hosts for parasites, the statement itself does not make this link and instead focuses on biodiversity, which is outside the scope of the question.",
    "verdict": "No"
  },
  {
    "statement": "Fallow periods allow invertebrate community composition to become more similar to pre-farming conditions.",
    "reasoning": "This statement is not relevant. Similar to the previous statement, it describes an ecological benefit of fallowing (environmental remediation) rather than a disease prevention benefit. The focus is on the restoration of the natural invertebrate community, not on the reduction of pathogens or disease vectors. Therefore, it does not directly answer the question about disease prevention practices.",
    "verdict": "No"

    "statement": "Sourcing spat and juveniles from areas or hatcheries not infested with diseases or non-native or problematic species is a recommended practice.",
    "reasoning": "This statement is highly relevant. It describes a fundamental biosecurity principle known as 'sourcing clean stock.' Starting a production cycle with healthy, disease-free fish (fingerlings in the case of tilapia) is one of the most critical steps in preventing the introduction and subsequent outbreak of diseases on a farm. This is a core best practice for any type of aquaculture, including tilapia farming.",
    "verdict": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "statement": "Reducing aquaculture stocking densities is a recommended practice.",
    "reasoning": "This statement is relevant. High stocking densities can cause chronic stress to fish, weakening their immune systems and making them more susceptible to disease. It also facilitates the rapid transmission of pathogens between fish. Therefore, managing and reducing stocking densities to appropriate levels is a key best practice for maintaining fish health and preventing disease outbreaks in tilapia farming systems.",
    "verdict": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "statement": "Locating aquaculture systems in areas with fast currents is a recommended practice.",
    "reasoning": "This statement is relevant. Site selection is an important aspect of disease prevention, particularly for open systems like cages. Fast currents improve water exchange, which helps to flush away fish waste and waterborne pathogens, thereby reducing the pathogen load in the immediate vicinity of the farm. For tilapia cage farming in lakes or rivers, this is a valid practice to help prevent disease by maintaining better water quality.",

    "reasoning": "This statement is relevant because it provides a crucial nuance to the evidence for the first intervention ('leaving uncut strips'). It shows that the benefits are not universal across all wildlife and that some species may even prefer more intensively managed areas. This type of conflicting or variable evidence is essential for a thorough comparative assessment.",
