One study found that numbers of mature male sperm whales did not differ significantly before or 31 years after hunting was prohibited.', 'action_ids': ['2780', '2838', '2925']}

For soil biota and structure, microbial biomass was often higher in some comparisons, while other soil organisms (bacteria, nematodes, mites) were sometimes fewer or showed inconsistent differences; soil aggregation was sometimes greater, though some studies found no difference [1366]. For greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide emissions were sometimes higher or similar; soils sometimes absorbed more methane or showed similar methane absorption; nitrous oxide emissions were sometimes similar or lower with organic fertilizer, with lower emissions reported particularly with solid organic fertilizers compared to inorganic, while liquid organic fertilizers did not show this reduction; compost increased organic matter, nutrients, and microbial biomass compared to manure in one Italian study; slurry applications were associated with methane absorption while manure applications emitted methane in one Spanish study [1366].","action_ids":["1350","1366"]}

For soil health, organic fertilizer generally increases soil organic matter (8 of 13 studies), nitrogen levels (4 of 9 studies), phosphorus (3 of 5 studies), and potassium (3 of 6 studies), while also enhancing microbial biomass in 4 of 4 studies and improving soil aggregation in 3 of 5 studies. However, some Mediterranean studies found similar nutrient levels between organic and inorganic fertilizers, and organic fertilizer can lead to higher carbon dioxide emissions (4 of 5 studies) while having variable effects on nitrous oxide emissions. For crop production, the evidence shows mixed results: 4 studies found higher yields with organic fertilizer in some comparisons, while 3 studies found lower yields, and 3 studies found similar yields compared to inorganic fertilizer. The type of organic fertilizer matters significantly, with compost showing better results than manure for increasing organic matter, nutrients, and microbial biomass.

Eight studies from Italy and Spain found higher crop yields with no tillage compared to conventional tillage in some or all comparisons, while seven studies from Italy, Lebanon, Spain, and the USA found lower crop yields with no tillage in some or all comparisons. Four studies from Italy and Spain found inconsistent differences (sometimes higher, sometimes lower yields), and three studies from Italy, Portugal, and Spain found similar yields between systems (Action 1355).\n\n**Soil Health**: No-tillage generally improves soil health indicators. One meta-analysis of studies from Mediterranean countries found more organic matter in no-tillage soils compared to tilled soils. Fourteen studies from Italy, Spain, and the USA found more organic matter with no-tillage in some or all comparisons. Seven studies from Spain and the USA found that no-tillage soils were more stable than tilled soils in some or all comparisons. Five studies from Italy and Spain found more microbial biomass in no-tillage soils, and two studies from the USA found more earthworms in no-tillage soils (Action 1369).\n\n**Water Availability**: No-tillage predominantly improves water availability. Nine controlled studies from Spain and the USA found more water in no-tillage soils compared to tilled soils in some or all comparisons. Only one study from Lebanon found less water in no-tillage soils in some comparisons. One study from Spain found that barley used water more efficiently in no-tillage plots compared to tilled plots in some comparisons (Action 1384).\n\n**Pest Numbers**: No-tillage effects on pest numbers are mixed, with weeds being the primary concern.

However, evidence for amphibians is limited, with one replicated, controlled study in the USA finding that planting buffer strips along streams did not increase amphibian abundance, numbers of species, or the ratio of adults to tadpoles (Action 819).\n\nCreating or restoring waterways showed some positive results. One site comparison study in the USA found that restored and pristine streams had similar turtle community composition and abundance (Action 3754). For wetland creation or restoration, studies from the USA found that created wetlands were used by various reptile species for reproduction and habitat use, though species richness and diversity results were mixed when comparing restored to undisturbed wetlands (Action 3755).\n\nLimited evidence exists for bat populations, with one study in the UK finding that pipistrelle activity did not differ along waterways with vegetation buffers on agri-environment scheme farms compared to conventional farms (Action 2284).\n\nNo studies were found evaluating the effects of preventing agricultural pollution from entering watercourses on biodiversity populations (Action 2015, 2882).', 'action_ids': ['120', '463', '819', '1388', '2015', '2882', '2284', '3754', '3755']}

Biological control methods included successful use of flea beetles against water primrose, with a replicated field study in the USA finding significant reduction in large-flower primrose-willow abundance after beetle introduction (Action 1135). Ground cover management beneath perennial crops showed mixed results in Canadian studies, with natural enemies on the ground varying between different natural enemy groups (Action 720).', 'action_ids': ['728', '717', '721', '1394', '722', '1396', '1135', '720']}

The primary approach involves cutting or removing forest plantations combined with rewetting the peat (Action ID 1732). This combined intervention has been shown to increase cover of wetland-characteristic plants and Sphagnum moss in some cases, increase herb cover including cottongrasses and sedges, and increase plant species richness in certain contexts. Tree removal alone (Action ID 1731) can increase cover of some herb species like cottongrasses and sedges while reducing cover of forest-characteristic mosses. For hydrological restoration, filling or blocking drainage ditches (Action ID 1805) allows colonization by herbs and bryophytes, with vegetation cover potentially reaching natural levels within 2-3 years. Surface disturbance techniques (Action ID 1811) can encourage colonization by wetland-characteristic plant species. After planting desired species, covering the peatland with materials like plastic mesh (Action ID 1829) can increase survival and cover of planted mosses.

Primates with limited free-ranging experience showed mixed results: their diet overlapped with wild lemurs, but most reintroduced black-and-white ruffed lemurs with limited free-ranging experience died over five years. Most reintroduced western lowland gorillas with limited free-ranging experience survived over periods between nine months and four years (Action 1595). For non-primate mammals, black-footed ferrets reared in outdoor pens had higher post-release survival rates than ferrets raised indoors, while captive-bred ferrets raised in large enclosures dispersed shorter distances post-release than those raised in small enclosures (Action 2507). Rehabilitation programs showed variable success across species: most reintroduced golden lion tamarins did not survive over seven years despite rehabilitation, while most reintroduced vervet monkeys and chimpanzees survived over six months to five years after rehabilitation (Action 1597).", 'action_ids': ['1594', '1595', '1596', '1597', '2507']}

For relocating primates to non-residential areas specifically, the action documents found no evidence for effects on primate populations (Action 1423). When examining broader mammal relocation studies, including primates, several key findings emerge:\n\nPotential benefits from successful cases show that some primate species do survive and remain at release sites. A replicated study in Belize found the majority of black howler monkeys survived for at least 10 months after translocation from abundant population areas to an uninhabited site (Action 1559). A before-and-after study in India found that rhesus monkeys remained at their release sites following translocation from development areas (Action 1558). Additionally, a replicated, before-and-after study in India found that 'problem' rhesus monkeys that were translocated survived and remained at the release sites for at least four years (Action 1422).\n\nHowever, significant drawbacks are evident from studies of other mammal species. Translocation studies across multiple species show serious survival issues, with one replicated study in the USA finding that fewer than half of black bears translocated from conflict situations survived after one year (Action 2336). A controlled study in the USA found that grizzly bears translocated away from conflict situations had lower survival rates than non-translocated bears (Action 2336). Return behavior is another major drawback - studies found that many animals return to their original capture locations and continue to cause nuisance, with some black bears returning up to six times following translocation (Action 2336). Furthermore, a before-and-after study in India found that leopards translocated away from human-dominated areas attacked more humans and livestock than before translocation, potentially making conflicts worse (Action 2336).", 'action_ids': ['1423', '2336', '1559', '1558', '1422']}

Acoustic devices on fishing gear appear most effective, with five of six controlled studies showing reduced damage to fish catches and/or fishing nets caused by marine mammals (action 2808). These devices also reduced entanglements, with nine studies finding fewer collisions or entanglements of various whale and dolphin species when acoustic devices were used on fishing nets and cod traps (action 2808). Acoustic devices on moorings showed limited evidence for reducing human-wildlife conflict, with only one randomized controlled study finding that deployment on moorings reduced harbour seals feeding on migrating juvenile salmon (action 2816). However, moorings-based devices effectively modified marine mammal behavior, with studies showing reduced numbers of seals and reduced activity of various dolphin and porpoise species (action 2816). Acoustic devices on fishing vessels showed the least effectiveness for human-wildlife conflict reduction, with one randomized controlled study finding no reduction in predation of squid catches by dolphins when acoustic devices were used on vessels (action 2815). However, vessel-based devices did modify dolphin behavior, causing avoidance and reduced foraging activity (action 2815).

No-tillage practices help maintain soil aggregate structure by minimizing mechanical disturbance.\n\n**Cover Crops and Living Mulches**: Studies from Spain showed that growing cover crops beneath main crops or between crop rows increased soil stability and reduced erosion (Action 897). Cover crops provide continuous soil coverage that protects and stabilizes soil structure.\n\n**Ground Cover in Orchards and Vineyards**: Studies from Chile, Spain, and other Mediterranean regions found that soil aggregates were more water-stable in plots with seeded cover crops compared to tilled or bare soils (Action 1367). Ground cover systems consistently improved soil aggregation in perennial crop systems.\n\n**Mulching**: Studies from various locations including Spain found that adding mulch (whether straw, paper, or compost) increased soil stability and improved soil structure (Action 887). Mulch materials protect soil surface and enhance aggregate formation.\n\n**Crop Rotations**: One study from Syria found higher water-stability in soils with crop rotations compared to continuous crops, though results varied across different Mediterranean studies (Action 1368). Crop rotations can contribute to soil structural improvements through diverse root systems and reduced soil disturbance patterns.\n\n**Tillage Speed Management**: One study from Egypt found that tilling at slower tractor speeds resulted in less soil loss in runoff water (Action 1371), indicating that how tillage is performed affects soil stability.\n\nThese practices work by reducing soil disturbance, maintaining continuous soil cover, enhancing biological activity, and promoting the formation and preservation of stable soil aggregates through root activity and organic matter inputs.', 'action_ids': ['1371', '1358', '1385', '897', '1367', '887', '1368']}
