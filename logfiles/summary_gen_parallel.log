Another replicated, site comparison study in the US found that six out of nine specialist butterfly species were more abundant in pine barrens and prairies with unburned patches compared to sites without them (3879).\n\nUnder rotational burning management in US prairies, four replicated studies found that the abundance of prairie specialist, grassland, and all butterflies was higher on prairies burned more than one, two, or four years prior compared to more recently burned areas (3883). Another US study found butterfly abundance was highest in the third year after burning (3883). However, other replicated studies in the US showed mixed effects.

Double fyke nets have been shown to be effective for catching bullfrog tadpoles in small shallow ponds (Action ID: 1046). For adults, catchability using one double fyke net for 24 hours was found to be very low, though adults can be captured overnight in single traps floating on the water surface (Action ID: 1045). A before-and-after study in France found significant reduction in both adults and juveniles following removal of juveniles by trapping when carried out as part of combination treatment (Action ID: 1046), and another study showed reduction following shooting of metamorphosed individuals before reproduction as part of combination treatment (Action ID: 1045). However, one study noted that bullfrog populations rapidly rebound following intensive removal of adults (Action ID: 1045).

Benefits include increased butterfly species richness and abundance in burned coniferous forests compared to unburned forest (action 3877), and higher bird species richness in sites with prescribed burning combined with tree thinning and understory control (action 318). Pine forests with prescribed burning showed higher densities of red-cockaded woodpeckers and some open habitat bird species (action 318). However, negative impacts include adverse effects on closed-forest bird species and ground nesters (action 318), with ten studies finding bird densities were the same or lower in burned sites compared to controls (action 318). For amphibians, eight of fourteen studies found no effect of prescribed forest fires on abundance or species numbers, while results were mixed across the remaining studies (action 877). Timing of burns appears to have minimal effect on outcomes, with one study finding burn season did not affect the impacts of prescribed burning (action 318), though another found northern brown bandicoot survival declined less in forests burned early versus late in the dry season (action 2416).', 'action_ids': ['3877', '877', '318', '317', '2416']}

For attaching acoustically reflective objects, only two studies were available, showing no significant benefits. One controlled study found that attaching metallic bead chains to fishing nets did not reduce dolphin entanglements, while another controlled study found that attaching acrylic beads next to fishing hooks did not reduce predation on fish catches by sperm whales. The evidence base is considerably larger and more promising for acoustically reflective materials compared to attached objects.', 'action_ids': ['2807', '2806']}

In terms of abundance, one global review indicated that out of 11 studies, 10 found higher fish abundance within marine reserves where fishing was restricted (2680). Another study in the Indian Ocean noted higher survival rates for blackspot snapper in a park with fishing restrictions (2680). Conversely, a study in the Pacific Ocean observed similar abundance levels of copper rockfish, quillback rockfish, china rockfish, and lingcod in both 'no-take' reserves and areas open to fishing (2681). Similarly, a Caribbean Sea study found comparable total fish biomass but lower total fish density in areas where all fishing except for bait fishing was restricted (2681). However, a study in the Skagerrak showed an increase in cod survival within a marine protected area after fishing was almost entirely prohibited (2681). For fish diversity, one global review mentioned that one of 11 studies reported higher fish species richness inside reserves with restricted fishing (2680). In contrast, a study in the Caribbean Sea found lower total fish species richness in marine protected areas that had been closed to fishing for up to seven years (2681). Studies in the Tasman Sea and the Firth of Clyde reported similar combined species richness for algae, invertebrates, and fish between protected and fished areas (2224). Regarding fish condition, a study in the Indian Ocean found that blackspot snapper were larger and older inside a marine park with fishing restrictions (2680). A global review also reported that 5 out of 11 studies found larger fish inside reserves (2680).", 'action_ids': ['2680', '2681', '2224']}

There are also mixed results regarding soil erosion, with some studies showing increased soil loss under no-tillage systems if there is no crop cover (906). In terms of crop yield, some studies have reported lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional methods (906), and lower fruit, vegetable, and oilseed yields when comparing no-tillage to reduced tillage (1358). The effects on wildlife can also be inconsistent, with some studies showing negative or no effects on invertebrates, earthworms, mammals, and some bird species (126). Furthermore, bird preferences for conservation tillage fields have been observed to decrease over time (126).', 'action_ids': ['906', '126', '1358']}

Successful rearing has been demonstrated for several species including B. terrestris, B. vagans, B. terricola, B. rufocinctus, B. ruderatus, and B. atratus. However, complete rearing failures were documented for B. fervidus, B. pensylvanicus, and the rusty-patched bumblebee, where queens laid eggs but larvae died before reaching adulthood. Key reproductive challenges include the finding that B. terrestris queens gradually decreased in weight over four years of artificial rearing. Environmental factors proved critical, with pollen diet quality significantly influencing reproductive success - queens fed freshly frozen pollen were larger and survived better than those fed dried, frozen pollen, and higher protein pollen types increased worker offspring production. Optimal conditions included an eight-hour light regime and specific hibernation requirements (4-5�C for 45 days, wet weight >0.6 g, hibernation \u22644 months). Reintroduction outcomes varied considerably across seven trials - while some colonies produced good numbers of new queens, others had very low or zero queen production. A major documented challenge was social parasitism by cuckoo bees, with variable rates ranging from 0-79% across trials, though landscape management strategies showed potential for reducing parasitism rates.', 'action_ids': ['50', '52']}

However, transplanting oysters produced mixed effects on combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness/diversity depending on site and surface features. One study found transplanting oysters increased mobile invertebrate species richness, but two of three studies found no increase in fish species richness. Abundance outcomes varied with transplanting oysters showing mixed effects on combined macroalgae and invertebrate abundance, mobile invertebrate abundance, and fish abundance. Survival studies revealed varying results depending on species, site, and surface characteristics - oyster survival was higher when transplanted into grooves versus ridges, with survival rates varying by site. One study found transplanting oysters and coralline algae did not increase fish interaction time or bites taken from surfaces, though benthic fishes took more bites from oyster-only surfaces compared to combined algae and oyster surfaces.', 'action_ids': ['3472']}

For water primrose (Ludwigia species), no evidence was found for biological control using native herbivores (Action ID: 1136), but a controlled field study in China found that a flea beetle caused heavy feeding destruction on prostrate water primrose seedlings and showed specificity to this plant and Indian toothcup (Action ID: 1135), while a replicated field study in the USA found that introduction of flea beetles significantly reduced abundance of large-flower primrose-willow (Action ID: 1135).", 'action_ids': ['1124', '1599', '1136', '1135']}

However, one study found hatching success was lower on spring-sown crops than autumn-sown crops for northern lapwings (action 207).

However, a replicated site comparison from Australia found mixed effects on lantana fruit production, seedling mortality, and growth rates in forests burned every three years (action 912). Notably, no evidence was found for the effects of prescribed fire or grazing for general invasive plant removal (actions 1196, 1195), and no studies evaluated biological control for parrot's feather (action 1598).", 'action_ids': ['1228', '1229', '1314', '912', '1196', '1195', '1598']}

However, other studies showed more positive outcomes: awareness campaigns combined with other interventions increased amphibian pond creation in Estonia and the UK (Action ID: 831), and multimedia campaigns using theatre, film, print media, and discussions demonstrated effectiveness in multiple countries, with black howler monkey numbers increasing by 61-138% over 3-13 years in Belize (Action ID: 1571). Education programs targeting ranchers in South Africa successfully increased leopard density and reduced mortalities (Action ID: 2423). While specific evidence for forest conservation campaigns was notably absent from the documents searched, several studies found that awareness campaigns reached over 50,000 members of the public annually or trained over 1,000 people at conservation events, and one UK study reported increased purchase of peat-free compost following awareness-raising activities about peatlands (Action ID: 1844). However, multiple actions (IDs: 1718, 3864, 1717, 3847, 3389) specifically noted the absence of evaluation studies, indicating a significant gap in evidence for the effectiveness of education and awareness programs for various conservation contexts.', 'action_ids': ['162', '831', '1844', '1718', '3864', '1571', '2423', '1717', '3847', '3389']}

2025-09-10 22:09:20,834 - INFO - Final result: {'query': 'How do the effects of sowing parasitic plants differ across European countries for restoring grassland vegetation?', 'relevant_summary': 'Six studies examined the effects of sowing seeds of parasitic species on grassland vegetation across European countries, with four studies in the UK, one in Switzerland, and one in Belgium. The studies focused on three main parasitic plant species: yellow rattle (Rhinanthus minor), European yellow rattle, and marsh lousewort. Five of the six studies found that sowing parasitic plant seeds increased plant species richness and/or diversity, while one UK study found no change in plant species richness. In the UK, sowing yellow rattle seeds led to a decrease in total plant biomass in three of four studies, and helped other sown target meadow species to colonize with more plant species found when yellow rattle was present. In Switzerland, sowing European yellow rattle seeds led to a decrease in grass cover but did not alter the cover of forbs. In Belgium, sowing marsh lousewort seeds increased the abundance of six target plant species. These results demonstrate that while parasitic plant sowing generally shows positive effects on species richness across European countries, the specific impacts on vegetation abundance and structure vary by country and the particular parasitic species used.', 'action_ids': ['3404', '129']}

For fishing gear modifications, fitting size-sorting escape grids to trawl nets primarily targets fish bycatch reduction rather than cetacean bycatch, while topless trawls showed some effectiveness for reducing unwanted fish catches. Using stiffened materials in fishing nets did not reduce Franciscana dolphin entanglements in the South Atlantic Ocean. The evidence strongly supports acoustic deterrent devices as the primary intervention, with deployment across multiple Atlantic and North Sea fisheries demonstrating consistent reductions in cetacean bycatch.', 'action_ids': ['2808', '2807', '3554', '2721', '2712', '2801']}

However, two other studies found that attaching �umbrella� or �spider� devices on fishing hooks did not reduce predation and/or damage to fish catches by sperm whales or toothed whales (2821). Another study found that longliners using bird exclusion devices (BEDs) with two booms caught fewer seabirds compared to those with a single boom (302). No studies were found that evaluated the effects of using catch and hook protection devices on reptile populations (3582).\n\nFor modifying fishing pots, two controlled studies found that installing steel rods on lobster pots or metal frames on fishing pots reduced the number of Australian sea lion pups or grey seals and harbour seals that entered or became trapped in them (2822). Additionally, two controlled studies found that installing wire grids or steel bars on fishing trap-nets or bag-nets, along with other modifications, reduced damage to salmon catches by seals (2822). One controlled study found that securing crab pot doors with a bungee cord reduced the number of common bottlenose dolphin interactions (2822), and another found that wire grids on trap-nets led to higher catches of undamaged salmon due to reduced seal predation (2822). One study also found that few diamondback terrapins died in crab pots fitted with mesh chimneys (3622).'}

Mesh escape panels/windows fitted to trawl nets can reduce unwanted catches and improve size selectivity for cod and haddock, with 30 out of 36 studies showing reductions in unwanted catch, though effectiveness varies with panel design, position, and other factors.', 'action_ids': ['2711', '2712', '2713', '2716', '2720']}

Another study found similar abundance levels for certain rockfish and lingcod between �no-take� reserves and sites open to fishing (2681). \n\nOne study showed an increase in cod survival inside a marine protected area after most fishing was prohibited (2681). Studies also indicate that reef fish tend to stay within protected zones (2674), and certain shark species were frequently observed inside marine protected areas where fishing was largely prohibited, which reduces their likelihood of being caught (2681).', 'action_ids': ['2674', '2681']}

Another study from the USA focusing on alley cropping demonstrated reduced yields, while a study from the Philippines indicated comparable or diminished yields (718).\n\nWhen converting to organic farming, one study discovered that profits saw an increase if the produce was sold at a premium; otherwise, profits declined (717). Another study reported either a negative impact or no impact on profitability (717). In terms of yield, six studies showed varied results: one indicated a positive effect, one a negative effect, one a combination of effects, and three reported no or inconsistent effects (717). Another study in Canada also found lower yields in organically managed soils (895). However, two trials in the USA found that while fruit might be smaller, it was of a higher quality and showed more resistance to disease (895).', 'action_ids': ['718', '717', '895']}

Another study in Malaysia found that a majority of reintroduced orangutans survived, while a controlled study, also in Malaysia, found that a reintroduced population of orangutans had declined 33 years after reintroduction (1591). Separately, one study in Malaysia found that 98% of orangutans survived release (1589). Five studies in Brazil, French Guiana, Gabon, and South Africa found that a majority of primates survived for at least two months to one year (1591), while six other studies in Brazil, French Guiana, Indonesia, Madagascar, and South Africa found that a minority of primates survived for at least fifteen weeks to seven years (1591). Four studies in French Guiana, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam found that a minority of primates survived after between two months and one year (1589).\n\nIn terms of population changes, one study in Belize found that the primate population increased five years after reintroduction (1591), and a study in Tanzania also found an increase in a reintroduced chimpanzee population (1589). However, a study in Thailand found that the primate population declined post-reintroduction (1591), and two other studies in Brazil and Thailand also found declines in reintroduced primate populations (1589). A controlled study in Malaysia also found that a reintroduced orangutan population had declined in size (1589).\n\nRegarding behavior and integration, two controlled studies in Madagascar and Indonesia found that reintroduced primates had similar diets to wild populations (1591), and one controlled study in Indonesia found that they showed similar behaviour to wild individuals (1591). A study in Indonesia also found that Bornean agile gibbons had similar behaviour and diet to wild populations (1589). Some reintroduced individuals have been observed to rejoin wild groups, as seen in a study in Brazil where a reintroduced muriqui rejoined a wild group (1591). In Senegal, a reintroduced chimpanzee was reunited with its mother (1591), and in Brazil, an abandoned infant muriqui was also reunited with its mother (1589). However, in one case in Uganda, a reintroduced chimpanzee repeatedly returned to human settlements (1591).'}

Another study in Malaysia found that a majority of reintroduced orangutans survived, while a controlled study, also in Malaysia, found that a reintroduced population of orangutans had declined 33 years after reintroduction (1591). Separately, one study in Malaysia found that 98% of orangutans survived release (1589). Five studies in Brazil, French Guiana, Gabon, and South Africa found that a majority of primates survived for at least two months to one year (1591), while six other studies in Brazil, French Guiana, Indonesia, Madagascar, and South Africa found that a minority of primates survived for at least fifteen weeks to seven years (1591). Four studies in French Guiana, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam found that a minority of primates survived after between two months and one year (1589).\n\nIn terms of population changes, one study in Belize found that the primate population increased five years after reintroduction (1591), and a study in Tanzania also found an increase in a reintroduced chimpanzee population (1589). However, a study in Thailand found that the primate population declined post-reintroduction (1591), and two other studies in Brazil and Thailand also found declines in reintroduced primate populations (1589). A controlled study in Malaysia also found that a reintroduced orangutan population had declined in size (1589).\n\nRegarding behavior and integration, two controlled studies in Madagascar and Indonesia found that reintroduced primates had similar diets to wild populations (1591), and one controlled study in Indonesia found that they showed similar behaviour to wild individuals (1591). A study in Indonesia also found that Bornean agile gibbons had similar behaviour and diet to wild populations (1589). Some reintroduced individuals have been observed to rejoin wild groups, as seen in a study in Brazil where a reintroduced muriqui rejoined a wild group (1591). In Senegal, a reintroduced chimpanzee was reunited with its mother (1591), and in Brazil, an abandoned infant muriqui was also reunited with its mother (1589). However, in one case in Uganda, a reintroduced chimpanzee repeatedly returned to human settlements (1591)."}

Two studies directly compared these methods and found no significant differences in their effects on common heather growth or purple moor grass seedling numbers. Specifically, one randomized, replicated, controlled study showed that neither prescribed burning nor mowing altered heather shoot length or seedling density compared to each other. Similarly, a controlled study found that both treatments resulted in comparable heather cover and shoot length in heathlands affected by nitrogen pollution. Therefore, the current evidence suggests that both approaches have similar limited effectiveness for this specific conservation goal.', 'action_ids': ['1670', '1669']}

Two trials in Spain and Portugal found an increase in the cover of woody plant species, and a separate study in Spain showed that while the cover of woody plants increased, the number of woody plant species did not (1679). A study in South Africa reported an increase in the height of three protea species after recovery from fire (1679).\n\nHowever, the effects are not universally positive. One trial in the USA found no increase in shrub cover, and another in South Africa noted an increase in vegetation cover but not in the number of plant species (1679). In terms of other vegetation, two trials in the USA and UK observed a decrease in grass cover or biomass, while another study in the USA found an increase in the cover of a minority of grass species (1679). Other studies reported mixed effects on the cover of wavy hair grass and no increase in forb cover (1679).', 'action_ids': ['1679']}

Breeding for resistance traits proves effective, as demonstrated by a controlled study in Norway showing increased survival in salmon bred for high resistance to infectious pancreatic necrosis compared to those bred for low resistance. Aerobic training interventions, particularly interval training, resulted in higher survival rates for salmon exposed to infectious pancreatic necrosis in a Norwegian study. The use of probiotics and immunostimulants shows promise, with a Scottish study reporting increased survival in salmon fed probiotics before exposure to disease-causing bacteria, while a Norwegian study found beta-glucans reduced lice infection by 28% and mannan oligosaccharides improved gut function. Freshwater bathing provides mixed results for amoebic gill disease, with one Australian study showing temporary reduction in amoebae on gills persisting up to 10 days, while another found no significant difference between treated and untreated salmon.

Additionally, pit habitats increased fish species richness and macroalgal species richness (action ID 3475).

Under power lines, mechanical cutting increases butterfly species richness and abundance compared to unmanaged areas, with highest species richness occurring 2-4 years after scrub and trees are cleared (action 3855). The timing of management matters - butterfly abundance is higher in areas cleared \u22642 years ago compared to areas cut \u22654 years earlier, and areas cleared 2-4 years earlier have higher abundance than those cleared 1 year or 6-8 years earlier (action 3855).\n\nFor road verge mowing regimes, less frequent mowing or unmown areas show consistently positive effects. Less frequently mown or unmown urban greenspaces have higher species richness and diversity of butterflies and moths than more frequently mown areas (action 3841). Unmown road verges support higher abundance of all adult butterflies than regularly mown areas (action 3841). Road verges mown less frequently or later in summer have fewer dead butterflies killed by traffic than more frequently or earlier mown verges (action 3841, 3854).\n\nRotational mowing proves beneficial, with grasslands managed by mowing strips in alternate years or leaving rotational areas uncut showing higher abundance and species richness of butterflies and burnet moths than areas cut in full (action 3966). Twenty-nine out of 32 butterfly species preferred meadows that were half mown to those cut in full twice per year (action 3966).\n\nHerbicide cessation on road verges shows positive effects, with restored roadside prairies where herbicide application was restricted having greater species richness and abundance of butterflies than verges with unrestricted herbicide use (action 3899). Timing of management is crucial - delaying cutting until July or September results in greater abundance of butterflies compared to cutting in May or June, though effects vary by year (action 3967).

Reduced tillage also shows benefits for soil organisms, with studies from Europe finding more microbial biomass (action 1371) and increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage (action 906). For water management, reduced tillage can improve water use efficiency and increase water content in soils according to studies from European locations (action 1386). Soil aggregation benefits include higher water-stability of soil aggregates in plots with reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage (action 1371). However, there are notable drawbacks. Studies from Europe found higher compaction under reduced tillage in some cases (action 906). For drought conditions, three replicated trials from Europe found that conventional ploughing and sub-soiling increased the ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content compared to reduced tillage (action 906).

However, two studies found that created wetlands had fewer amphibian species or lower abundance and different communities compared to natural wetlands (Action 880). One global review and two site comparison studies in the USA combined created and restored wetlands and found that numbers of amphibian species and abundance was higher or similar, or higher in 54% of studies and similar in 35% of studies reviewed compared to natural wetlands (Action 880). Five studies in Kenya and the USA found that four to 15 amphibian species used or colonized created wetlands (Action 880).\n\nFor wetland restoration, ten site comparison studies in Canada and the USA compared amphibian numbers in restored and natural wetlands, with eight finding that amphibian abundance, numbers of species and species composition were similar (Action 879). Two found that the number of species or abundance was lower and species composition different in restored wetlands (Action 879). Seven of nine studies in Canada, Taiwan and the USA found that wetland restoration increased numbers of amphibian species, with breeding populations establishing in some cases (Action 879). One global review found that in 89% of cases, restored and created wetlands had similar or higher amphibian abundance or numbers of species to natural wetlands (Action 879).\n\nRegarding pond-specific interventions, nine site comparison studies in Australia, Canada, Spain, the UK and USA comparing created and natural ponds found that five studies showed numbers of species or breeding species were similar or higher in created ponds (Action 869).

Action 1571 provides evidence that multimedia campaigns using theatre, film, print media and discussions showed positive results, with studies in Belize finding black howler monkey numbers increased by 61-138% over 3-13 years after multimedia campaigns alongside other interventions, and studies in Brazil and Colombia finding that education programs improved attitudes towards and knowledge about species. Action 3681 found that community engagement in conservation activities showed positive results for reptile populations across six studies, with communities participating in monitoring and protection leading to reduced poaching and improved conservation outcomes. Action 1844 reported that following awareness-raising activities, the percentage of the public buying peat-free compost increased, demonstrating behaviour change from public awareness campaigns.", 'action_ids': ['1157', '162', '274', '1571', '3681', '1844']}

Three additional studies found that eliminating fish using rotenone increased numbers of amphibian species, abundance and recruitment or newt populations (Action ID: 828), and draining ponds to eliminate fish increased numbers of amphibian species (Action ID: 826). However, one before-and-after study in the UK found that fish control had no significant effect on great crested newt populations and fish remained or returned within a few years (Action ID: 827). For invasive bullfrogs, one replicated, before-and-after study in the USA found that removing American bullfrogs significantly increased a population of California red-legged frogs, and once bullfrogs had been removed, California red-legged frogs were found out in the open twice as frequently (Action ID: 825). A before-and-after study in the USA and Mexico found that eradicating bullfrogs from the area increased the range of leopard frogs (Action ID: 825). For mammalian predators, evidence is limited and mixed, with one controlled study in New Zealand finding that controlling rats had no significant effect on numbers of Hochstetter's frogs, though predator-proof enclosures showed significantly higher survival of Maud Island frogs compared to the wild (Action ID: 839).

Studies found that captive-bred toads released as tadpoles, juveniles or metamorphs established populations, with success rates varying by species and location - Mallorcan midwife toads established breeding populations at 38%, 80% or 100% of sites, while natterjack toads established populations at 70% of sites (action 875, 873). Head-starting programs showed positive outcomes, with six of 10 studies finding that released head-started tadpoles, metamorphs or juveniles established breeding frog populations or increased populations of frogs or toads (action 881). One global review found that 41% of release programmes of captive-bred or head-started amphibians showed evidence of breeding in the wild for multiple generations, while 29% showed some evidence of breeding and 12% showed evidence of survival following release (action 871). Head-started amphibians demonstrated advantages including greater survival to metamorphosis, larger size at metamorphosis, and shorter time to metamorphosis compared to wild animals (action 881).\n\nHowever, potential negative impacts are also documented. Survival of released captive-bred Puerto Rican crested toads was low with 25% predated within two days of release (action 875).

Created hibernacula were used by common frogs and smooth newts, but not great crested newts [759]. There was no evidence found for the effects of adding woody debris to ponds on amphibian populations [814].", 'action_ids': ['772', '759', '814']}

One randomized, replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that excluding cattle from ponds did not increase numbers of eggs or larval survival of Columbia spotted frogs. One before-and-after study in the UK found that pond restoration that included livestock exclusion increased pond use by breeding natterjack toads. One replicated, randomized, controlled study in wet grasslands in the USA found no difference in the abundance of Yosemite toads between areas with cattle excluded and grazed areas. A replicated, before-and-after study in the UK also found that pond restoration and terrestrial habitat management maintained or increased populations of natterjack toads.', 'action_ids': ['746', '2319', '878']}

In contrast, for mechanical methods, one randomized, replicated, controlled study in the USA found that numbers of amphibian species, but not abundance, were significantly higher in plots with mechanical understory reduction compared to those without (Action 781). This suggests that mechanical methods may support higher amphibian species diversity compared to herbicide methods, while herbicide methods show neutral to negative effects on amphibian abundance.', 'action_ids': ['778', '781']}

Studies have shown that wider culverts are used more frequently, while long culverts are often avoided (884). The presence of a natural substrate within the culvert is associated with higher usage by amphibians (884). However, the effects of lighting and the presence of water on culvert use are mixed (884). Certain designs have been found to be unsuitable; for instance, one-way tunnels with vertical entry chutes led to high mortality rates for common toads (884). Additionally, condensation from steel culverts was found to have very high concentrations of metal (884). In six out of seven studies, the installation of culverts or tunnels significantly reduced amphibian road deaths, with one study noting this was only the case when barrier fencing was also installed (884). However, one study found no effect on road deaths, and another reported that thousands of amphibians were still killed on the road even with the tunnels (884).', 'action_ids': ['884']}
