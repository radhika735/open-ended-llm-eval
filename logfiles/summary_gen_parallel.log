2025-09-11 22:09:45,603 - INFO - Final response (after hitting max iterations): You are a helpful assistant that can search through action documents to find relevant information.
            Use the search_actions tool to find relevant actions based on user queries, and then use get_action_details to retrieve full details for specific actions when needed.
            When searching for actions, start with the default parameters, but if you need more results, use the offset parameter to retrieve additional actions.
            Keep searching with increasing offset values until the returned actions become irrelevant to the user's query - this ensures you find all pertinent information before compiling your final summary.
            Once you have identified a list or batch of action documents that you want to expand fully, you should make multiple **parallel** calls to the get_action_details tool  each call should contain one of the action IDs from the batch.
            
            Then use the information you have gathered to create a summary of information which is relevant to the user's query.
            Do NOT use your own knowledge, make up statistics or state information that is not present in the action documents. ALL of your statements must be DIRECTLY supported by the evidence you found in the action documents. 
            This means for every statement you make you MUST cite the action id used to make that statement as a reference.
            You must NOT answer the question yourself - your job is just to find all the evidence in the action documents which are related to the user's query and summarise these into a concise paragraph.
            This means you MUST NOT use your own knowledge, add qualifying statements, draw conclusions or make your own judgements of the action information. You must only list relevant information from the action documents WITHOUT qualifying statements.
            
            Finally, you MUST use the get_formatted_result tool. This will convert the user's query, your generated summary and the list of the action IDs you used to generate your summary into a valid JSON format.

            You can only send ten messages to the system in total, and one message must be used to call the get_formatted_result tool. Parallel tool calls count as one message.
            Use these ten messages wisely, you should call get_formatted_result with your final summary before the ten messages have run out.

2025-09-11 22:11:18,163 - WARNING - Warning: Maximum iterations reached.
2025-09-11 22:11:18,163 - INFO - Final response (after hitting max iterations): You are a helpful assistant that can search through action documents to find relevant information.
            Use the search_actions tool to find relevant actions based on user queries, and then use get_action_details to retrieve full details for specific actions when needed.
            When searching for actions, start with the default parameters, but if you need more results, use the offset parameter to retrieve additional actions.
            Keep searching with increasing offset values until the returned actions become irrelevant to the user's query - this ensures you find all pertinent information before compiling your final summary.
            Once you have identified a list or batch of action documents that you want to expand fully, you should make multiple **parallel** calls to the get_action_details tool  each call should contain one of the action IDs from the batch.
            
            Then use the information you have gathered to create a summary of information which is relevant to the user's query.
            Do NOT use your own knowledge, make up statistics or state information that is not present in the action documents. ALL of your statements must be DIRECTLY supported by the evidence you found in the action documents. 
            This means for every statement you make you MUST cite the action id used to make that statement as a reference.
            You must NOT answer the question yourself - your job is just to find all the evidence in the action documents which are related to the user's query and summarise these into a concise paragraph.
            This means you MUST NOT use your own knowledge, add qualifying statements, draw conclusions or make your own judgements of the action information. You must only list relevant information from the action documents WITHOUT qualifying statements.
            
            Finally, you MUST use the get_formatted_result tool. This will convert the user's query, your generated summary and the list of the action IDs you used to generate your summary into a valid JSON format.

            You can only send ten messages to the system in total, and one message must be used to call the get_formatted_result tool. Parallel tool calls count as one message.
            Use these ten messages wisely, you should call get_formatted_result with your final summary before the ten messages have run out.

Action document 729 reports that six studies from Canada, the UK and USA (including soybean crops) found that predators increased in adjacent crops, but effects varied with time and one study found no effect. Two studies found small or slow movements of predators from banks to crops. Four studies found more invertebrate predators on beetle banks than in surrounding crops, though effects varied with time. Action document 651 indicates that five reports from two replicated studies found positive effects on invertebrate densities/numbers and higher ground beetle density in spring and summer, but six reports from three studies found that invertebrate numbers varied between grass species sown on beetle banks, and five studies found lower or no difference in invertebrate densities compared to other habitats. Economic benefits were demonstrated if beetle banks prevented pests from reaching spray thresholds or causing 5% yield loss. Design considerations were important, with certain grass species supporting higher numbers of predatory invertebrates than others.', 'action_ids': ['729', '651', '217', '2393', '3927']}

Disturbing soil before seeding/planting enhances establishment success, with studies showing increased forb species richness in most cases compared to harrowing and increased forb cover (Action 3413). Five studies found that disturbing soil before sowing seeds increased plant emergence in most cases compared to sowing alone. Applying herbicide before seeding can improve results, with one study finding increased sown species richness and improved cover of sown grass species (Action 3418). However, this method showed mixed effects on native forb species. Planting grassland plants (transplants) showed promising results with one study finding increased species richness of forbs in 83% of cases, though this method may be more labor-intensive than seeding (Action 3399).', 'action_ids': ['3432', '3405', '3413', '3418', '3399']}
