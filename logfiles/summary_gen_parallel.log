2025-09-11 22:09:45,603 - INFO - Final response (after hitting max iterations): You are a helpful assistant that can search through action documents to find relevant information.
            Use the search_actions tool to find relevant actions based on user queries, and then use get_action_details to retrieve full details for specific actions when needed.
            When searching for actions, start with the default parameters, but if you need more results, use the offset parameter to retrieve additional actions.
            Keep searching with increasing offset values until the returned actions become irrelevant to the user's query - this ensures you find all pertinent information before compiling your final summary.
            Once you have identified a list or batch of action documents that you want to expand fully, you should make multiple **parallel** calls to the get_action_details tool  each call should contain one of the action IDs from the batch.
            
            Then use the information you have gathered to create a summary of information which is relevant to the user's query.
            Do NOT use your own knowledge, make up statistics or state information that is not present in the action documents. ALL of your statements must be DIRECTLY supported by the evidence you found in the action documents. 
            This means for every statement you make you MUST cite the action id used to make that statement as a reference.
            You must NOT answer the question yourself - your job is just to find all the evidence in the action documents which are related to the user's query and summarise these into a concise paragraph.
            This means you MUST NOT use your own knowledge, add qualifying statements, draw conclusions or make your own judgements of the action information. You must only list relevant information from the action documents WITHOUT qualifying statements.
            
            Finally, you MUST use the get_formatted_result tool. This will convert the user's query, your generated summary and the list of the action IDs you used to generate your summary into a valid JSON format.

            You can only send ten messages to the system in total, and one message must be used to call the get_formatted_result tool. Parallel tool calls count as one message.
            Use these ten messages wisely, you should call get_formatted_result with your final summary before the ten messages have run out.

2025-09-11 22:11:18,163 - WARNING - Warning: Maximum iterations reached.
2025-09-11 22:11:18,163 - INFO - Final response (after hitting max iterations): You are a helpful assistant that can search through action documents to find relevant information.
            Use the search_actions tool to find relevant actions based on user queries, and then use get_action_details to retrieve full details for specific actions when needed.
            When searching for actions, start with the default parameters, but if you need more results, use the offset parameter to retrieve additional actions.
            Keep searching with increasing offset values until the returned actions become irrelevant to the user's query - this ensures you find all pertinent information before compiling your final summary.
            Once you have identified a list or batch of action documents that you want to expand fully, you should make multiple **parallel** calls to the get_action_details tool  each call should contain one of the action IDs from the batch.
            
            Then use the information you have gathered to create a summary of information which is relevant to the user's query.
            Do NOT use your own knowledge, make up statistics or state information that is not present in the action documents. ALL of your statements must be DIRECTLY supported by the evidence you found in the action documents. 
            This means for every statement you make you MUST cite the action id used to make that statement as a reference.
            You must NOT answer the question yourself - your job is just to find all the evidence in the action documents which are related to the user's query and summarise these into a concise paragraph.
            This means you MUST NOT use your own knowledge, add qualifying statements, draw conclusions or make your own judgements of the action information. You must only list relevant information from the action documents WITHOUT qualifying statements.
            
            Finally, you MUST use the get_formatted_result tool. This will convert the user's query, your generated summary and the list of the action IDs you used to generate your summary into a valid JSON format.

            You can only send ten messages to the system in total, and one message must be used to call the get_formatted_result tool. Parallel tool calls count as one message.
            Use these ten messages wisely, you should call get_formatted_result with your final summary before the ten messages have run out.

Action document 729 reports that six studies from Canada, the UK and USA (including soybean crops) found that predators increased in adjacent crops, but effects varied with time and one study found no effect. Two studies found small or slow movements of predators from banks to crops. Four studies found more invertebrate predators on beetle banks than in surrounding crops, though effects varied with time. Action document 651 indicates that five reports from two replicated studies found positive effects on invertebrate densities/numbers and higher ground beetle density in spring and summer, but six reports from three studies found that invertebrate numbers varied between grass species sown on beetle banks, and five studies found lower or no difference in invertebrate densities compared to other habitats. Economic benefits were demonstrated if beetle banks prevented pests from reaching spray thresholds or causing 5% yield loss. Design considerations were important, with certain grass species supporting higher numbers of predatory invertebrates than others.', 'action_ids': ['729', '651', '217', '2393', '3927']}

Applying herbicide before seeding can improve results, with one study finding increased sown species richness and improved cover of sown grass species (Action 3418). However, this method showed mixed effects on native forb species. Planting grassland plants (transplants) showed promising results with one study finding increased species richness of forbs in 83% of cases, though this method may be more labor-intensive than seeding (Action 3399).', 'action_ids': ['3432', '3405', '3413', '3418', '3399']}

2025-09-11 23:00:30,520 - WARNING - Warning: Maximum iterations reached.
2025-09-11 23:00:30,520 - INFO - Final response (after hitting max iterations): You are a helpful assistant that can search through action documents to find relevant information.
            Use the search_actions tool to find relevant actions based on user queries, and then use get_action_details to retrieve full details for specific actions when needed.
            When searching for actions, start with the default parameters, but if you need more results, use the offset parameter to retrieve additional actions.
            Keep searching with increasing offset values until the returned actions become irrelevant to the user's query - this ensures you find all pertinent information before compiling your final summary.
            Once you have identified a list or batch of action documents that you want to expand fully, you should make multiple **parallel** calls to the get_action_details tool  each call should contain one of the action IDs from the batch.
            
            Then use the information you have gathered to create a summary of information which is relevant to the user's query.
            Do NOT use your own knowledge, make up statistics or state information that is not present in the action documents. ALL of your statements must be DIRECTLY supported by the evidence you found in the action documents. 
            This means for every statement you make you MUST cite the action id used to make that statement as a reference.
            You must NOT answer the question yourself - your job is just to find all the evidence in the action documents which are related to the user's query and summarise these into a concise paragraph.
            This means you MUST NOT use your own knowledge, add qualifying statements, draw conclusions or make your own judgements of the action information. You must only list relevant information from the action documents WITHOUT qualifying statements.
            
            Finally, you MUST use the get_formatted_result tool. This will convert the user's query, your generated summary and the list of the action IDs you used to generate your summary into a valid JSON format.

            You can only send ten messages to the system in total, and one message must be used to call the get_formatted_result tool. Parallel tool calls count as one message.
            Use these ten messages wisely, you should call get_formatted_result with your final summary before the ten messages have run out.

            Once you have identified a list or batch of action documents that you want to expand fully, you should make multiple **parallel** calls to the get_action_details tool  each call should contain one of the action IDs from the batch.
            
            Then use the information you have gathered to create a summary of information which is relevant to the user's query.
            Do NOT use your own knowledge, make up statistics or state information that is not present in the action documents. ALL of your statements must be DIRECTLY supported by the evidence you found in the action documents. 
            This means for every statement you make you MUST cite the action id used to make that statement as a reference.
            You must NOT answer the question yourself - your job is just to find all the evidence in the action documents which are related to the user's query and summarise these into a concise paragraph.
            This means you MUST NOT use your own knowledge, add qualifying statements, draw conclusions or make your own judgements of the action information. You must only list relevant information from the action documents WITHOUT qualifying statements.
            
            Finally, you MUST use the get_formatted_result tool. This will convert the user's query, your generated summary and the list of the action IDs you used to generate your summary into a valid JSON format.

            You can only send ten messages to the system in total, and one message must be used to call the get_formatted_result tool. Parallel tool calls count as one message.
            Use these ten messages wisely, you should call get_formatted_result with your final summary before the ten messages have run out.

Perennial leguminous herbs in seed mixtures are particularly important forage sources for bumblebees, especially long-tongued species (Action 19). Agricultural nectar and pollen mixes sown on field margins also attract significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated, grassy, or cropped field margins (Action 18). However, margins sown with agricultural legume plants degrade in value to bumblebees and would need re-sowing every few years (Action 18). Leaving arable field margins uncropped with natural regeneration provides benefits, though the value is not consistent year to year and is often based on thistle species considered weeds (Action 20). Planting dedicated floral resources on farmland, particularly phacelia, supports substantial numbers of wild bees with 8 to 35 species recorded foraging (Action 17). Reducing the intensity of farmland meadow management through delayed first cuts and reduced agrochemical use enhances numbers and diversity of wild bees (Action 22).

Sowing uncropped arable field margins with native wild flower seed mixes supports higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees compared to cropped field edges, grassy margins, or naturally regenerated uncropped margins (Action 19). Perennial leguminous herbs in seed mixtures are particularly important forage sources for bumblebees, especially long-tongued species (Action 19). Agricultural nectar and pollen mixes sown on field margins also attract significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated, grassy, or cropped field margins (Action 18). However, margins sown with agricultural legume plants degrade in value to bumblebees and would need re-sowing every few years (Action 18). Leaving arable field margins uncropped with natural regeneration provides benefits, though the value is not consistent year to year and is often based on thistle species considered weeds (Action 20). Planting dedicated floral resources on farmland, particularly phacelia, supports substantial numbers of wild bees with 8 to 35 species recorded foraging (Action 17). Reducing the intensity of farmland meadow management through delayed first cuts and reduced agrochemical use enhances numbers and diversity of wild bees (Action 22). At a landscape scale, the abundance of long-tongued bumblebees on field margins is positively correlated with the number of pollen and nectar agri-environment agreements in the area (Action 362).', 'action_ids': ['16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '22', '24', '81', '362', '12', '1937']}

Twenty-two studies examined this intervention, showing that creating pit habitats increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness and/or diversity on structure surfaces in eight of 12 studies (Action ID 3475). The pit habitats supported macroalgae, invertebrate and fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without added habitats.

Scattering food throughout the enclosure (Action ID 1315) is particularly effective, with studies showing increased feeding and exploratory behaviors in rhesus macaques, reduced abnormal behaviors in chimpanzees, decreased aggression in lemurs, and increased foraging and activity levels in gorillas. Feeding primates in social groups (Action ID 1343) also proves beneficial, with monkeys completing enrichment tasks faster and eating more unfamiliar foods when with groupmates. Providing cut branches or browse (Action ID 1332) offers another cost-effective option, as gorillas demonstrated the ability to use natural processing skills when presented with stinging nettles. While puzzle feeders (Action ID 1318) can be effective at increasing feeding time and foraging behavior while reducing inactivity, they showed mixed results including increased aggression and decreased food sharing.', 'action_ids': ['1315', '1343', '1332', '1318']}

Ten replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Italy, Spain, and the USA found more nitrogen in soils with winter cover crops in some comparisons (Action 1345).

One study from Spain found higher soil quality in plots with long-term cover crops, compared to short-term (Action 1345).\n\nCompost addition also demonstrates soil fertility improvements: Twelve replicated, controlled studies from Italy, Spain, Syria, Turkey, and the USA found more organic matter in soils with added compost compared to soils without added compost in some or all comparisons (Action 1362).

Seven replicated trials monitored the success of laboratory-reared colonies introduced to the environment, with four trials allowing colonies to develop until new queens were produced or the founding queen died. In two of these trials (both in the UK), the numbers of queens per colony were very low or zero, while two trials produced good numbers of new queens (Action 52). High rates of social parasitism by cuckoo bees were observed in released colonies, with rates of 25-66% in Canada and 79% in the UK, though parasitism was reduced by placing colonies in landscapes with intermediate nectar and pollen availability and releasing them late in the season rather than early (Action 52). For captive rearing programs, studies show that declining North American species like B. vagans and B. terricola can successfully rear adults in captivity, though B. fervidus queens consistently laid eggs but larvae died before becoming adults across all trials (Action 50).', 'action_ids': ['51', '52', '50']}

Additionally, some studies in Europe found less organic matter in soils with crop rotations compared to continuous crops (1368), while a study in Syria found more (1368).\n\nThe effects of crop rotation on soil nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus were inconsistent across various studies (1368). Similarly, the impact on microbial biomass, and greenhouse gas emissions also varied, with some studies showing positive effects, some negative, and some no difference at all (1368). There were also mixed results regarding soil erosion and aggregation (1368). The pH levels in soils with or without crop rotations were found to be similar in two studies (1368).', 'action_ids': ['719', '857', '1368']}

Key factors affecting pond success include vegetation cover, water levels, surrounding habitat, distance to source ponds, and absence of fish [Action ID 869]. Seven amphibian species studies found that created wetlands had similar or higher numbers of species compared to natural wetlands when designed appropriately [Action ID 880].

Specifically, 65 studies reported effects on invertebrates, with 50 reporting positive effects and 41 studies finding evidence that flower strips had a positive influence on invertebrate numbers with increased abundance, species richness/diversity, or both.\n\nAction 3932 ("Plant nectar flower mixture/wildflower strips") found that 23 studies evaluated the effects of planting nectar flower mixtures on butterflies and moths, with multiple studies finding that sown wildflower strips had higher species richness and diversity of butterflies and moths than conventional field margins, unsown margins, cropped fields or conventional grassland.', 'action_ids': ['10', '6', '5', '19', '442', '3932']}

Fourteen studies examined this approach (action 3470). Six of 11 studies found that using shell-concrete or quarried rock in place of standard-concrete on subtidal artificial structures, or using ECOncrete in place of standard-concrete or fibreglass, along with creating texture, grooves, holes, pits and/or small ledges, altered the combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition on structure surfaces. Three studies found that ECOncrete surfaces with added habitats supported mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate and/or fish species that were absent from standard-concrete or fibreglass structure surfaces. Three studies found that using ECOncrete, along with creating texture, grooves, holes, pits and/or small ledges, did increase the species diversity and/or richness on and around structures. Additionally, managing or restricting harvesting showed some benefits with one study finding higher fish species richness around a subtidal artificial structure with harvesting restrictions compared with unrestricted structures (action 3457). Creating short flexible habitats (150 mm) had mixed effects on invertebrate communities depending on density, length and site (action 3450).

The document indicates that rock pools created on intertidal artificial structures supported various species including macroalgae, mobile invertebrates, non-mobile invertebrates, and fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without pools. One study mentioned that wave-sheltered pools filled with sediment within two years (Action 3476). Action 3469 discusses the use of environmentally-sensitive materials on intertidal artificial structures, including various concrete compositions and alternative materials like sandstone and limestone, but does not specifically address structural integrity concerns related to habitat modifications. The documents do not contain specific information about how the creation of rock pools affects material durability, erosion rates, structural stability, or other engineering performance parameters of seawalls over time.', 'action_ids': ['3476', '3467', '3469']}

2025-09-12 08:08:50,257 - INFO - Final response (after hitting max iterations): You are a helpful assistant that can search through action documents to find relevant information.
            Use the search_actions tool to find relevant actions based on user queries, and then use get_action_details to retrieve full details for specific actions when needed.
            When searching for actions, start with the default parameters, but if you need more results, use the offset parameter to retrieve additional actions.
            Keep searching with increasing offset values until the returned actions become irrelevant to the user's query - this ensures you find all pertinent information before compiling your final summary.
            Once you have identified a list or batch of action documents that you want to expand fully, you should make multiple **parallel** calls to the get_action_details tool  each call should contain one of the action IDs from the batch.
            
            Then use the information you have gathered to create a summary of information which is relevant to the user's query.
            Do NOT use your own knowledge, make up statistics or state information that is not present in the action documents. ALL of your statements must be DIRECTLY supported by the evidence you found in the action documents. 
            This means for every statement you make you MUST cite the action id used to make that statement as a reference.
            You must NOT answer the question yourself - your job is just to find all the evidence in the action documents which are related to the user's query and summarise these into a concise paragraph.
            This means you MUST NOT use your own knowledge, add qualifying statements, draw conclusions or make your own judgements of the action information. You must only list relevant information from the action documents WITHOUT qualifying statements.
            
            Finally, you MUST use the get_formatted_result tool. This will convert the user's query, your generated summary and the list of the action IDs you used to generate your summary into a valid JSON format.

            You can only send ten messages to the system in total, and one message must be used to call the get_formatted_result tool. Parallel tool calls count as one message.
            Use these ten messages wisely, you should call get_formatted_result with your final summary before the ten messages have run out.

Action ID 95 covers bat boxes, bat grilles, and roost improvements, though no specific cost data was captured. For more complex installations, action ID 2049 shows artificial caves/hibernacula were used by up to four bat species in UK and German studies, while action ID 949 indicates alternative roosts within developments had variable success rates (13-74% occupancy at development sites). The simpler bat box approach appears most cost-effective given the extensive evidence base and higher success rates compared to more elaborate artificial cave systems.', 'action_ids': ['1024', '95', '2049', '949']}

Creating uncultivated margins around intensive arable or pasture fields, where studies found these margins support more invertebrates than conventionally managed field margins or other field margin options, with increased abundance or biomass of species in naturally regenerated margins (action 63).

Conversely, two studies from the UK found that plots where fertilizer inputs were not reduced tended to have higher earthworm biomass or abundance (139). In permanent grasslands, six studies found that stopping fertilizer inputs resulted in a higher abundance or species richness of some or all invertebrates studied, and one review found that densities of some invertebrates were higher in unfertilized plots (694). However, another review found no clear effect of reducing fertilizer inputs on the density of soil-dwelling invertebrates, and one study found lower invertebrate abundance on plots with reduced fertilizer inputs, although the differences were not significant (694).\n\nWhen comparing fertilizer types, one study found fewer nematodes and another found fewer mites in plots with organic fertilizer compared to inorganic fertilizer (1366). However, the same study noted that organic fertilizer plots had more microbial biomass (1366).', 'action_ids': ['139', '694', '1366']}

Size-sorting mesh funnels (sieve nets) on prawn/shrimp trawls consistently reduced unwanted fish catches in North Sea studies (Action ID: 2722). Trawl gear modifications with size-sorting escape grids reduced unwanted catches in 6 of 16 studies, with effectiveness varying by fish species, light conditions, and net type (Action ID: 2728). Alternative fishing methods like traps showed mixed results, appearing to reduce unwanted catch but also reducing commercial catch in some cases (Action ID: 2142). Governance approaches showed promise: catch limits/quotas for non-commercial species reduced unwanted catch in 2 of 3 cases across Atlantic and Pacific Oceans (Action ID: 2693), and real-time catch information technology reduced unwanted catch in 2 of 3 cases in Pacific and Atlantic Oceans (Action ID: 3826). However, the documents lack specific cost-benefit analyses to determine which method is most economically efficient, focusing instead on biological effectiveness.', 'action_ids': ['2722', '2728', '2142', '2149', '2693', '3826']}
