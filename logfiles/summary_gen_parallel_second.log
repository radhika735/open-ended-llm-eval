One replicated, controlled study found that crop rotation increased profit (Action 719).\n- Soil health: Studies from Canada found that including legumes in crop rotations increased the number of microbes and diversity of different soil animals (Action 857). Four studies from Australia, Canada, and Denmark found increased soil organic carbon under crop rotation, particularly when some legumes were included (Action 857). Three out of five replicated trials from Canada, Portugal and Syria found increased soil organic matter, particularly when legumes were included in the rotation (Action 857).\n- Erosion control: One randomized, replicated trial from Canada found that including forage crops in crop rotations reduced rainwater runoff and soil loss (Action 857).\n- Water efficiency: One replicated, randomized, controlled study from Turkey found higher water-use efficiency in plots with crop rotations compared to continuous wheat in some comparisons (Action 1383).\n- Biodiversity: Studies from Belgium, Germany, Hungary and unspecified European countries reported higher ground beetle species richness and/or abundance and higher plant species richness in rotation fields compared to monoculture fields (Action 560).\n\nDrawbacks:\n- Inconsistent pest control: One paired study found pest populations increased in crop rotation, and four studies found increases and decreases in pest populations depending on rotation crops used and other treatments (Action 719).\n- Variable yields: Two studies from Canada and the USA found yield increases and decreases depending on rotation crops used (Action 719).

In the UK, a study found that mowing followed by rotovating increased the number of heathland plant species in one of two sites (1641).

Another study in the USA found that the survival of Texas horned lizards was higher in moderately grazed sites than in heavily grazed sites (3490).

Using cover crops or ground cover in perennial crops (2304) led to more microbial biomass, fungi, bacteria, and nematodes in multiple studies from France, USA, and Spain. Amendments using a mix of organic and inorganic materials (902) increased microbial diversity in trials from China and India. Excluding grazers from areas (2309) resulted in more diverse nematode communities in a controlled study from the USA.', 'action_ids': ['895', '904', '888', '887', '898', '2304', '902', '2309', '903']}

Applying organic processing wastes or their composts (e.g., high rates of cotton gin compost and poultry manure) improved soil structure and reduced soil loss in one trial (891).', 'action_ids': ['910', '901', '902', '887', '891']}

Green manures also proved effective, with two controlled, randomized, replicated studies from India and Pakistan finding increased grain yields when green manures were grown (Action 908). Fresh plant material and crop remains showed benefits in Asian contexts, with one trial from the Philippines finding higher grain yields when crop remains were incorporated earlier in the season, and one replicated trial finding higher barley yield when straw was incorporated (Action 910). The evidence indicates that these amendments also provide additional soil benefits including higher soil organic carbon levels, improved microbial biomass and activity, and better soil structure across various soil types including clay, clay loam, sandy-loam, silt clay loam, and silty-loam soils.', 'action_ids': ['902', '911', '908', '910', '891', '889']}

Fresh plant material or crop remains can be incorporated, with one study from India finding improved soil structure when straw was incorporated, and studies showing increased microbial biomass and larger soil aggregates (Action 910). Non-chemical minerals and mineral wastes can be used as soil amendments, with studies from Australia and New Zealand showing reduced nutrient loss and erosion when these materials are added (Action 892). Changing tillage practices offers another approach - reduced tillage and no-tillage systems have been shown to increase soil organic carbon and improve soil structure compared to conventional tillage, with multiple studies finding higher organic carbon in soils under reduced tillage systems (Action 906). Mixed organic and inorganic amendments can be effective, with controlled trials from China and India finding that combinations of manure and inorganic fertilizers were more effective at reducing soil cracking than inorganic fertilizers alone (Action 902).

Four replicated studies in Italy and Spain found higher yields with organic fertilizer compared to inorganic fertilizer in some comparisons, while three replicated, randomized, controlled studies in Spain and the USA found lower yields with organic fertilizer in some or all comparisons (1350). Three other replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Greece and Spain found similar yields between organic and inorganic fertilizer plots (1350). When crop residues were retained, a replicated study in Mexico found higher microbial biomass, and two randomized, replicated trials in Australia and China noted higher soil organic carbon and nitrogen (907). Four studies in Asia, Europe, and the USA found higher numbers, diversity, or activity of soil organisms under organic management (895).', 'action_ids': ['895', '1350', '907']}

Drawbacks include lower yields in organically managed soils found in studies from Canada (Action ID 895), and negative or no effect on profit in most cases unless premium prices were received (Action ID 717). More weeds were found in organically farmed fields in 3 studies from the USA, though effects varied between crops and years (Action ID 717). Two studies found more pests under organic farming, and several studies found mixed or no consistent effects on natural enemies, pests, diseases, and crop damage (Action ID 717).', 'action_ids': ['460', '717', '895', '1785', '2013']}

A meta-analysis from Mediterranean countries found more organic matter in soils with reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage (Action 1371). Eight studies from Europe found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage (Action 906).\n\nWhen comparing no-tillage to reduced tillage, studies from Spain found more large aggregates in soils with no tillage compared to reduced tillage in some comparisons, and higher water-stability in some comparisons (Action 1370).\n\nCover crops grown beneath main crops or between crop rows contribute to soil structure improvement, with studies from Europe showing that cover crops increased soil stability and reduced soil erosion (Action 897). Retaining crop residues also benefits soil structure, with reduced soil erosion and increased soil organic carbon and nitrogen content when residues were retained (Action 907).\n\nThese conservation agriculture practices work across various European soil types including clay, loam, sandy loam, silt loam, silty clay, and chalky soils (Actions 906, 1369, 1371, 897, 907).', 'action_ids': ['906', '1369', '1370', '1371', '897', '907']}

Reducing grazing intensity can help prevent soil erosion, with studies showing less sediment erosion when grazing time in forage crops was reduced (Action 901). \n\nPlanting or maintaining ground cover in orchards and vineyards is highly effective for erosion control, with six replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Chile, Italy, Spain, and the USA finding less erosion of soils with ground cover compared to bare or tilled soils, with one study from Italy showing the least erosion with permanent cover crops (Action 1367). Cover crops also improve soil aggregation, with four replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Chile and Spain finding that soil aggregates were more water-stable in plots with seeded cover crops compared to tilled or bare soils (Action 1367).\n\nReducing tillage is another important practice, with multiple studies showing positive effects on soil conservation. A total of 42 individual studies from nine European countries investigated the effects of reducing tillage, with 34 studies finding some positive effects on soil organisms including earthworms and invertebrates (Action 126). However, the effectiveness of no-tillage versus reduced tillage shows mixed results depending on crop type and conditions (Action 1358).\n\nBuffer strips alongside water courses provide additional erosion protection.
