One replicated, controlled study found that crop rotation increased profit (Action 719).\n- Soil health: Studies from Canada found that including legumes in crop rotations increased the number of microbes and diversity of different soil animals (Action 857). Four studies from Australia, Canada, and Denmark found increased soil organic carbon under crop rotation, particularly when some legumes were included (Action 857). Three out of five replicated trials from Canada, Portugal and Syria found increased soil organic matter, particularly when legumes were included in the rotation (Action 857).\n- Erosion control: One randomized, replicated trial from Canada found that including forage crops in crop rotations reduced rainwater runoff and soil loss (Action 857).\n- Water efficiency: One replicated, randomized, controlled study from Turkey found higher water-use efficiency in plots with crop rotations compared to continuous wheat in some comparisons (Action 1383).\n- Biodiversity: Studies from Belgium, Germany, Hungary and unspecified European countries reported higher ground beetle species richness and/or abundance and higher plant species richness in rotation fields compared to monoculture fields (Action 560).\n\nDrawbacks:\n- Inconsistent pest control: One paired study found pest populations increased in crop rotation, and four studies found increases and decreases in pest populations depending on rotation crops used and other treatments (Action 719).\n- Variable yields: Two studies from Canada and the USA found yield increases and decreases depending on rotation crops used (Action 719). Four replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Australia, Portugal, and Spain found similar crop yields in plots with or without rotations (Action 1354).\n- Soil organic matter reduction: Five replicated, controlled studies from Italy, Portugal, and Spain found less organic matter in soils with crop rotations compared to continuous crops in some comparisons (Action 1368).
