Using organic fertilizer instead of inorganic (Action 1350) has shown higher yields in plots from Italy and Spain in some comparisons, though results were mixed with some studies showing lower yields.\n\n**Soil Amendment:** Amending soil using a mix of organic and inorganic amendments (Action 902) has increased maize yield in studies from China with mixed manure and inorganic fertilizer amendments.\n\n**Crop Management Practices:** Using crop rotations (Action 1354) has resulted in higher crop yields in studies from Italy, Spain, and Turkey compared to monocultures in some comparisons. Growing cover crops in arable fields (Action 1351) showed mixed results, with some studies from Spain and the USA finding higher cash crop yields with winter cover crops in some comparisons, while others found lower yields.\n\n**Orchard and Vineyard Management:** Planting or maintaining ground cover in orchards or vineyards (Action 1367) provides soil benefits including increased organic matter and nitrogen in soils, which can support crop productivity, as evidenced by studies from Chile, France, Spain, and the USA.', 'action_ids': ['1359', '1355', '1346', '1350', '902', '1354', '1351', '1367']}

For crop yield improvements, several actions show promising results: Crop rotations (action 1354) showed higher crop yields in Italy, Spain, and Turkey studies, and one study from Italy found more protein in wheat grown in rotation compared to continuously-grown wheat. Adding slurry to soil (action 1349) demonstrated consistent positive effects, with six studies from Spain finding higher crop yields in plots with added pig slurry. Cover crops (action 1351) showed mixed but often positive results, with three studies from Italy and the USA finding higher cash crop yields with winter cover crops, though effectiveness varied by implementation with legume cover crops generally outperforming non-legumes.\n\nFor no-tillage practices, results were highly variable. No tillage in arable fields (action 1355) showed eight studies from Italy and Spain finding higher crop yields in some comparisons, but seven studies found lower yields, indicating inconsistent effectiveness. One study from Italy found less protein in wheat grains from no-tillage plots, while one Spanish study found heavier cereal grains. No tillage instead of reduced tillage (action 1358) showed mixed results with three Spanish studies finding higher cereal yields but three Italian studies finding lower fruit or vegetable yields.\n\nFertilization approaches showed moderate effectiveness. Using organic fertilizer instead of inorganic (action 1350) produced mixed results with four studies from Italy and Spain finding higher yields in some comparisons, but three studies finding lower yields. Adding compost (action 1346) showed three studies finding higher crop yields in some or all comparisons, but effectiveness was inconsistent. Adding manure (action 1347) showed limited evidence with only one Greek study finding higher maize yields in two of three comparisons.\n\nActions with limited effectiveness for crop quality included planting flowers (action 1360), which showed only two studies with positive yield effects but no specific crop quality improvements documented. Ground cover in orchards/vineyards (action 1352) showed mixed results for crop yields but provided some crop quality benefits, with studies finding similar sugar contents in grapes and some improvements in grape weight and chestnut size.', 'action_ids': ['1354', '1349', '1351', '1355', '1358', '1350', '1346', '1347', '1360', '1352']}

Cover crops (action 1351) showed mixed but often positive results, with three studies from Italy and the USA finding higher cash crop yields with winter cover crops, though effectiveness varied by implementation with legume cover crops generally outperforming non-legumes.\n\nFor no-tillage practices, results were highly variable. No tillage in arable fields (action 1355) showed eight studies from Italy and Spain finding higher crop yields in some comparisons, but seven studies found lower yields, indicating inconsistent effectiveness. One study from Italy found less protein in wheat grains from no-tillage plots, while one Spanish study found heavier cereal grains. No tillage instead of reduced tillage (action 1358) showed mixed results with three Spanish studies finding higher cereal yields but three Italian studies finding lower fruit or vegetable yields.\n\nFertilization approaches showed moderate effectiveness. Using organic fertilizer instead of inorganic (action 1350) produced mixed results with four studies from Italy and Spain finding higher yields in some comparisons, but three studies finding lower yields. Adding compost (action 1346) showed three studies finding higher crop yields in some or all comparisons, but effectiveness was inconsistent. Adding manure (action 1347) showed limited evidence with only one Greek study finding higher maize yields in two of three comparisons.\n\nActions with limited effectiveness for crop quality included planting flowers (action 1360), which showed only two studies with positive yield effects but no specific crop quality improvements documented.

Sewage sludge demonstrates positive yield effects but with limited data: one replicated, randomized, controlled study from Spain found higher barley yields in plots with added sewage sludge compared to plots without it, though implementation studies show that low amounts of sewage sludge increased barley yields but high amounts did not (Action 1348). For broader organic fertilizer comparisons in Mediterranean regions, four replicated studies from Italy and Spain found higher yields with organic fertilizer compared to inorganic fertilizer in some comparisons, while three studies from Spain and USA found lower yields, and three studies from Greece and Spain found similar yields (Action 1350).', 'action_ids': ['1349', '1347', '1348', '1350']}

Action 123 provides evidence for controlling weeds without damaging other plants in conservation areas, showing that specific management regimes can reduce pernicious weeds, with cutting and fungal pathogen infection being effective for controlling creeping thistle, and lenient grazing providing long-term control. Mixed pasture (Action 721) was found to reduce weeds in two studies from the USA, with both randomized, replicated trials showing reduced weeds compared to monoculture pasture. Delaying mowing or first grazing date on pasture or grassland (Action 131) resulted in benefits including higher plant species richness and higher densities of rare arable weeds according to studies from the Netherlands, Sweden and the UK. Reducing chemical inputs in permanent grassland management (Action 459) was tested as an approach, though the evidence showed no increase in foraging birds attracted to pasture plots with no fertiliser compared to controls. Additional vegetation management approaches include using prescribed fire to maintain or restore disturbance in grasslands (Action 3882) and managing vegetation using livestock grazing (Action 2545), though these were primarily studied for their effects on butterflies/moths and mammals respectively rather than specifically for weed control.', 'action_ids': ['123', '721', '131', '459', '3882', '2545']}

Action 1720 confirms that no studies have evaluated the effects on peatland vegetation of maintaining or creating habitat corridors in developed areas. The systematic searches conducted have not found any studies that directly evaluated these actions for peatland ecosystems, meaning the effectiveness or potential harmful impacts of habitat corridors for connecting fragmented peatlands remains unknown.', 'action_ids': ['1739', '1742', '1720']}

For instance, excluding sheep had no effect on plant community development in one study, while another found that it favored dry moorland plants in drier areas (1734). While seven studies found that excluding or removing livestock had no effect on the cover of key herb groups, one study reported an increase in rush cover after cattle were excluded (1734). Five studies found no effect on Sphagnum moss cover from excluding livestock, but one study noted that Sphagnum moss appeared after cattle were excluded and the area was rewetted (1734). The effect on shrub cover is also varied, with four studies finding no effect, while three others reported an increase in shrub cover (1734). In one study, excluding sheep led to an increase in total vegetation, shrub, and bryophyte biomass but had no effect on the biomass of grass-like herbs (1734).', 'action_ids': ['1734', '1733', '1786']}

Replacing blocks of vegetation after peat extraction showed mixed results, with one UK study reporting declining Sphagnum moss cover in translocated blocks, while a Canadian study found that replaced vegetation blocks retained similar Sphagnum cover to an undisturbed fen (Action 1738). Multiple restoration interventions increased Sphagnum moss cover in studies from the Czech Republic and Estonia, though one UK study reported no change in Sphagnum cover following intervention (Action 1803).', 'action_ids': ['1804', '1821', '1818', '1822', '1738', '1803']}

One controlled study reported that black-and-white ruffed lemur diets were similar to wild individuals after scarce-period feeding (Madagascar) [1527]. Limited-time feeding: One study reported a chimpanzee population increase after two months of post-reintroduction feeding (Tanzania). One before-and-after study reported a golden lion tamarin population declined after one year following supplementary feeding (Brazil). One study reported an abandoned infant muriqui was retrieved by its mother and rejoined the wild group after feeding (Brazil). Four studies reported that only a minority of reintroduced primates survived (Brazil; Madagascar; South Africa). One study reported the majority of introduced chimpanzees survived for at least 27 months (Guinea). Three studies reported a majority of primates survived reintroduction while being supplementary fed (Gabon; South Africa; Vietnam). Two studies reported the majority of lowland gorillas survived for at least nine months to four years (Gabon; Republic of Congo) [1528].', 'action_ids': ['1526', '1527', '1528']}
