[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What is the evidence for actions that can mitigate environmental pollution from salmon farming?\nanswer: Based on the action documents, several approaches show evidence for mitigating environmental pollution from salmon farming. Fallowing periods demonstrate effectiveness - a trial in Tasmania found sediment community structure under Atlantic salmon cages became more similar to non-impacted sites over two fallowing cycles (Action 1027). Three studies on leaving fallow periods during fish farming found that after fallowing, invertebrate community composition became similar to that before fish were added, and abundances of pollution-indicator polychaete worms decreased, though communities remained different from sites without fish farms (Action 2191). Integrated aquaculture systems show promise for waste management - a study in Canada found that blue mussels absorbed waste from a salmon farm, while studies in the USA and Scotland reported enhanced growth of scallops and algal growth when placed adjacent to fish farms (Action 932). Natural control methods for reducing chemical treatments include using cleaner wrasse for sea lice control - one controlled study in Ireland found corkwing and goldskinny cleaner wrasse were as effective at controlling lice infestation as chemical treatments (Action 738). Lighting modifications also show potential - a study in Norway reported lower numbers of lice on salmon kept in low intensity artificial light or natural lighting (Action 741). Non-chemical treatments like freshwater bathing provide mixed results for disease control - studies in Australia showed mixed evidence for reducing amoebic gill disease (Action 739). However, no studies were found evaluating the effects of improving fish food to reduce waste production, locating aquaculture systems in vegetated areas, or cleaning waste water before environmental release (Actions 2192, 2189, 3142).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What husbandry practices, beyond feed and chemical treatments, can be used on Atlantic salmon farms to improve fish health?\nanswer: Several husbandry practices beyond feed and chemical treatments can improve fish health on Atlantic salmon farms. Fallowing systems can reduce parasites and disease, with a study in Scotland recording lower lice numbers on Atlantic salmon in cages using fallowing (Action ID: 1026). Fallowing also helps reduce pollution, as a trial in Tasmania found sediment community structure under Atlantic salmon cages became more similar to non-impacted sites over two fallowing cycles (Action ID: 1027). Vaccination programs show effectiveness, with controlled studies from Iceland and Norway finding higher survival rates in vaccinated salmon compared to unvaccinated control groups when exposed to disease-causing bacteria (Action ID: 733). Infrastructure maintenance is important, as replacing anti-predator nets more frequently at salmon farms resulted in fewer salmon losses to harbor seal predation (Action ID: 2774). Selective breeding for disease resistance traits can improve health outcomes, with a study in Norway finding increased survival levels in salmon exposed to infectious pancreatic necrosis when the family was bred for high resistance compared to low resistance (Action ID: 735). The use of probiotics and immunostimulants also shows promise, with a study in Scotland finding increased survival in salmon fed probiotics before exposure to disease-causing bacteria, and a Norwegian study showing reduced lice infections when salmon were fed diets with beta-glucans (Action ID: 732).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly.

Cleaner wrasse (natural control agents) show mixed effectiveness, with one controlled study in Ireland finding that corkwing and goldskinny cleaner wrasse were as effective at controlling lice infestation as chemical treatments, while rockcook cleaner wrasse were ineffective at preventing lice outbreaks (Action 738). Lighting alteration appears consistently effective, with a replicated, controlled study in Norway reporting lower numbers of lice on salmon kept in low intensity artificial light or natural lighting, with higher intensity artificial light correlating with higher lice numbers (Action 741). Dietary interventions show promise, with a replicated, controlled study in Norway finding that salmon fed a diet composed of fish meal and 28% plant-based protein had 28% reduced lice infection levels, and adding beta-glucans to the diet decreased lice infection levels by a further 28% compared with controls (Action 732). Fallowing systems demonstrate effectiveness, with a study in Scotland recording lower lice numbers on Atlantic salmon in cages using a fallowing system (Action 1026). Additionally, probiotics show potential, with one replicated study in Scotland finding increased survival in salmon fed a probiotic before exposure to disease-causing bacteria (Action 732).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: Besides fallowing, what other methods can mitigate the impact of salmon farms on the surrounding benthic environment and local species?\nanswer: The action documents identify several potential methods to mitigate salmon farming impacts on benthic environments, though most lack direct scientific evaluation. These methods include: mooring aquaculture cages so they move in response to changing current direction (Action 2190), locating aquaculture systems in vegetated areas (Action 2189), reducing aquaculture stocking densities (Action 2186), improving fish food and pellets to reduce aquaculture waste production (Action 2192), introducing and enforcing water quality regulations for aquaculture systems (Action 2876), and using species from more than one level of a food web in aquaculture systems (Action 2195). However, no studies were found that evaluated the effects of these interventions on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations. The only action with evidence was ceasing or prohibiting aquaculture activity (Action 2185), where two Mediterranean Sea studies found that after ceasing aquaculture activity, invertebrate community composition remained different from unfarmed sites, overall invertebrate abundance became similar to unfarmed sites, abundance of health-indicating worms increased, and abundance of pollution-indicating worms decreased.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Fallowing represents a proven approach where sediment community structure under Atlantic salmon cages became more similar to non-impacted sites over two fallowing cycles (Action 1027). A fallow period during fish farming shows that invertebrate community composition becomes similar to that occurring before fish were added, and abundances of pollution-indicator polychaete worms decrease, though communities remain different from sites without fish farms (Action 2191). \n\nIntegrated aquaculture systems offer biological waste utilization where blue mussels absorbed waste from a salmon farm (Action 932), and enhanced algal growth occurred when placed adjacent to fish farms (Action 932). However, one study found no evidence that oysters and mussels were feeding on fish farm waste (Action 932). Greater growth of scallops was reported when grown next to fish farms (Action 932).\n\nSeveral strategies are identified but lack research evidence including: improving fish food and pellets to reduce aquaculture waste production (Action 2192), locating aquaculture systems in areas with fast currents (Action 2188), using other bioremediation methods in aquaculture (Action 2197), mooring aquaculture cages so they move in response to changing current direction (Action 2190), and co-locating aquaculture systems with other activities to maximize marine space use (Action 2079).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

One study from Canada found similar levels of feeding efficiency in salmon fed plant-based protein diets compared to fish meal diets (Action 924). Two replicated studies from Canada and Scotland found similar levels of feeding efficiency across both plant-based and fish meal diet types (Action 924).
