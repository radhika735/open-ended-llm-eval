Altering lighting reduced lice: a replicated, controlled study in Norway reported lower lice numbers under low-intensity artificial light or natural lighting, with higher lice counts under more intense artificial light [741]. Fallowing had variable outcomes: a study in Scotland recorded lower lice numbers on Atlantic salmon in cages using a fallowing system, while another study in Australia found no difference in mortality from Amoebic Gill Disease in cages where fallowing had been used [1026]. Probiotic/immunostimulant feeding reduced lice: a replicated, controlled study in Norway found lice infection was reduced by 28% with a diet including 28% plant-based protein, and adding beta-glucans decreased lice levels by a further 28% compared with controls; the same action also reports improved gut function with mannan oligosaccharides and increased survival after bacterial challenge in a separate Scottish study [732].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Integrated aquaculture systems (e.g., co-culturing bivalves/algae near fish farms) showed that scallops grew more adjacent to farms (USA), blue mussels absorbed salmon-farm waste (Canada), and algae growth was enhanced near farms (Scotland), though one study found oysters and mussels were not feeding on fish-farm waste (Spain) [932]. Additional proposed approaches\u2014improving fish food/pellets to reduce waste [2192], reducing aquaculture stocking densities [2186], reducing antibiotic use [2194], siting farms in areas with fast currents [2188], placing artificial reefs near farms to act as biofilters [2196], using other bioremediation methods [2197], and locating farms in vegetated areas [2189]\u2014had no studies identified that evaluated effects on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Adjusting lighting reduced lice burdens; a replicated, controlled study in Norway reported fewer lice under low-intensity artificial light or natural lighting, with higher artificial light intensity associated with more lice (ID 741). Implementing fallowing systems was associated with lower lice numbers on salmon cages in a study from Scotland (ID 1026).
