Two studies in the USA found that managing livestock water troughs as drinking resources increased bat use: removing livestock modifications increased drinking frequency and reduced the number of approaches before successful drinking, and larger, full tanks with sparse surrounding vegetation had more bats drinking than smaller, half-full tanks with no or dense surrounding vegetation [1951]. No studies were found that evaluated the effects on bats of changing effluent treatments used in agriculture and forestry [1016], or of managing ditches to benefit bats [1944].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
