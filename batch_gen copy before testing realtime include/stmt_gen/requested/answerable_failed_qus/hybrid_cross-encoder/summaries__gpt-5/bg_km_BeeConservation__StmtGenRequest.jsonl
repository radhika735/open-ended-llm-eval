Three replicated controlled trials on uncropped grassy field margins in the UK found mixed effects: 6 m margins enhanced abundance but not diversity at field boundaries in one trial; 6 m margins enhanced both abundance and diversity within the margin in another; and a smaller\u2011scale trial detected no increase in abundance or diversity on sown grassy margins versus cropped margins [14]. Fourteen trials in Europe and North America recorded substantial numbers of wild bees foraging on sown flowering plants; ten trials (eight replicated) using phacelia generally found substantial numbers of foraging wild bees (especially bumblebees), with one replicated trial in Greece finding phacelia not very attractive; six trials reported 8\u201335 foraging bee species; one replicated trial found planted perennial leguminous herbs were more attractive to bumblebees in more arable landscapes; and four replicated trials measured wider population responses, with one showing enhanced reproductive success of Osmia lignaria in orchards with lupine patches, one showing no increase in bee numbers or richness 50\u20131,500 m from planted patches, and two finding no or few solitary bees nesting on set\u2011aside fields sown with phacelia or clover [17]. For wild honey bees, there is no evidence on impacts of reduced honey\u2011hunting or improved harvesting on populations, but one trial in southern Vietnam reported >85% occupancy of artificial rafters by Apis dorsata when placed by a clearing >25 m in diameter [32].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the most effective interventions for providing nesting resources for different types of wild bees?\nanswer: - Solitary bees commonly occupy artificial nest sites: 29 of 30 replicated trials across multiple regions reported occupancy of artificial nests by solitary bees, including cut hollow stems/tubes and drilled wooden blocks; some endangered species and oil-collecting Centris spp. also used these nests (47). Occupancy of solitary bee nest boxes was readily observed across ten studies; reported occupancy rates where given were 1\u201326% of cavities, and 4.6\u201333 bee species were recorded using boxes (80). Repeated provision can increase use: occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a site, and fields with nest boxes saw increased estimated foraging Osmia numbers compared to fields without boxes (47). Local population size or emerging red mason bees increased when nest boxes were provided in two replicated studies (80). Effective designs/materials include cut stems/tubes and drilled wood; reed stems and grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees per nest than several other types, while plastic-lined holes or plastic/paper tubes were less productive due to parasitism or mould (47). A replicated study found highest production of red mason bees per nest from reed stems or wood (80). Placement near forage matters: four European species had foraging ranges of 150\u2013600 m, implying nests should be within this distance of forage (47), and one study recommended placing nest boxes 150\u2013600 m from forage (80). Management considerations: parasites and predators frequently attack nest occupants with mortality reported in multiple trials; introduced species and earwigs sometimes occupy boxes; soil-filled boxes for a ground-nesting Andrena were not used (47).\n- Bumblebees showed very low uptake of nest boxes: two replicated trials reported \u22642% occupancy (80).\n- Stingless bees showed no uptake of tested nest boxes: a replicated trial with Melipona quadrifasciata found no use of tree-placed nest boxes (49).\n- Stocking nest boxes with solitary bees has no captured evidence of effects on farmland wildlife; effectiveness is unknown based on available studies (81).\n- Excluding predators can improve nesting outcomes: excluding ants from solitary bee nests increased offspring production for Exonuera nigrescens in a replicated controlled trial (46).\n- Rearing/management experience indicates several Megachilidae species readily nest in drilled wooden blocks or stacked grooved boards (including polystyrene); under good conditions and with plentiful floral resources, local populations can increase up to six-fold in one year, though parasites and pathogens can be problematic (54).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What is the state of the evidence regarding the success of captive rearing and subsequent reintroduction of bumblebees into the wild?\nanswer: Evidence on captive rearing includes 22 trials from 13 countries using varied methods (queens alone, with workers, honey bee workers, male pupae, or CO2 anaesthesia), with one trial observing a gradual decrease in Bombus terrestris queen weight over four years [50]. Trials on North American declining species show mixed captive-rearing outcomes: B. vagans queens reared adults; B. terricola and B. rufocinctus queens reared adults in some attempts; B. fervidus queens laid eggs but larvae died before adulthood across three trials; similar larval mortality was reported for B. affinis (rusty-patched) and B. pensylvanicus; B. ruderatus was also successfully reared; and laboratory rearing was reported for the pocket-making B. atratus [50]. Captive-rearing performance is influenced by diet and husbandry: freshly frozen pollen increased queen size and subsequent colony performance versus dried frozen pollen, higher-protein pollen increased worker offspring production, an 8L:16D light regime shortened time to egg-laying, and specific hibernation regimes affected survival and colony formation (e.g., 4\u20135\u00b0C for 45 days enhanced egg-laying/colony formation but yielded smaller colonies; survival likelihood improved for queens >0.6 g and hibernated \u22644 months) [50]. For reintroduction of laboratory-reared colonies, seven replicated field trials report mixed success: in four trials (three UK, one Canada) colonies were monitored until new queens emerged or the founding queen died; two UK trials yielded very low or zero new queens per colony, whereas two other trials produced good numbers of new queens [52]. Social parasitism rates after release were variable: two replicated trials (Canada, UK) found high parasitism (25\u201366% and 79% respectively), and parasitism was reduced by placing colonies in landscapes with intermediate rather than very high floral resources and by releasing later in the season; five other trials reported no social parasites [52]. Supplementary feeding produced inconsistent benefits: one Canadian trial improved reproductive success without reducing parasite load, while a USA trial found no increase in productivity; a small Norwegian trial found released B. terrestris foraged mostly >100 m from nests [52].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: How do the impacts of planting floral resources for bees differ when implemented at a local patch scale versus a wider landscape scale?\nanswer: At the local patch scale, multiple trials report that sown flower patches on farmland attract substantial numbers of foraging wild bees, especially bumblebees, with observed species counts ranging from 8 to 35 on phacelia-rich patches, although attractiveness can vary by region (e.g., lower in Greece) [17]. Patch-scale interventions have shown mixed evidence for broader population responses: one trial found planted lupine patches in apple orchards significantly enhanced the reproductive success of Osmia lignaria, while another found bee numbers and species richness in farmland 50\u20131,500 m away from planted patches were not higher; two trials reported no or relatively few solitary bees nesting on set-aside fields sown with phacelia or clover [17]. Field margins sown with agricultural nectar and pollen mixes, particularly perennial leguminous plants, attract significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated, grassy, or cropped margins, though their value may degrade over time and require re-sowing every few years [18]. At the wider landscape scale, one large replicated controlled trial found that the average abundance of long-tongued bumblebees on field margins was positively correlated with the number of \u2018pollen and nectar\u2019 agri-environment agreements within a 10 km grid square [21, 362]. Additionally, the attractiveness of planted perennial leguminous herbs to bumblebees increased in landscapes with a greater proportion of arable farming, indicating landscape context can influence patch-level outcomes [17].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
