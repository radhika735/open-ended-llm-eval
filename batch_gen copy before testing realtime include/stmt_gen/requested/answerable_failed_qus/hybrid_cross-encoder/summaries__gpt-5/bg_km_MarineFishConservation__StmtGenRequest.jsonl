It has also been associated with larger sizes of European seabass in protected areas compared to fished areas over similar time frames [2672]. Comparisons between spearfished and non-spearfished areas 10\u201312 years after implementation reported differences in fish densities related to depth and/or fish size [2672]. Additionally, zones within a Mediterranean marine reserve that prohibited spearfishing saw higher commercial and recreational catches of targeted common dentex than zones allowing spearfishing and areas outside the reserve after one to three years [2672].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are some alternatives to setting catch quotas for controlling fishing mortality?\nanswer: Alternatives documented in the action evidence include: effort controls such as limiting the number of fishing days, which in one Mediterranean study was followed by higher biomass of thornback and brown rays (3804), and restricting fishing activity by vessel size/engine power, where excluding higher-power vessels for part of each year was followed by higher abundance of commercially targeted fish, with effects varying by fish size groups (3809); limiting fisher/vessel numbers via permits/licences is proposed but had no direct evaluation found (3817), as did limits on the number or length of static nets (3808) and limits on traps/pots per vessel (3807). Spatial\u2013temporal measures include temporary closures, which showed mixed outcomes: cod biomass, survival and length composition did not increase versus fished areas, tagged cod spent about a third of time inside a seasonal spawning closure, real-time closures reduced the annual amount of cod caught, and some targeted fisheries saw increased catch rates after closures (2664); other temporary closures affected non-fish taxa, including reduced lethal turtle strandings and fishery shutdowns when turtle bycatch limits were reached (3545), and for benthic invertebrates produced varied changes in abundance and condition when areas were temporarily closed or reopened (2098). Long-term closures showed mixed fish responses but included reductions in unwanted cod catch when combined with gear-limited areas and reduced overall fishing effort for sandeel (2655). Size-based regulations include minimum landing sizes, where evidence on recruitment and discards was mixed, with some reductions in catches of the youngest fish in one case and persistence of immature fish in landings in another (2735); size limits for recreational species lacked direct evaluations for invertebrates (2274). Gear selectivity modifications offer alternatives to reduce mortality of non-target or undersized fish, such as fitting trawl nets with escape panels/windows and size-sorting grids, which reduced unwanted catches and improved size-selectivity in multiple studies (2727, 2725, 2721).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Releasing captured fish alive resulted in the majority (76\u201392%) of several species surviving at least 1 h\u20135 days, though less than half of smooth skate survived; survival was reduced by injuries related to hooking/capture depth and by longer tow durations; nearly all yelloweye rockfish survived 4 days post-release while canary rockfish survival decreased with increasing capture depth; devilrays survived when brailed aboard from purse seines but not when brought aboard entangled (2691). Establishing handling and release protocols with minimal handling/air exposure led to faster returns to reef/seabed for reef fish, and tracked whale sharks released using an enhanced purse-seine protocol survived at least 21 days with normal movements (2692). Using different hook types reduced hook injuries associated with higher post-release mortality and reduced capture mortality for some unwanted sharks and rays and some non-target billfish, though other studies found no reduction in mortality; some studies reported reduced deep-hooking without mortality reduction (2698). Modifying longline configuration produced mixed survival outcomes for unwanted sharks: one global review reported higher survival on nylon hook attachments for two of three species and lower for one, while one field study found reduced survival on nylon compared to wire (2699). Using hook-and-line instead of other commercial gear produced greater vitality (an indicator of post-release survival) than other gear types (2732).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: How do the effects of prohibiting all commercial fishing on fish abundance vary across different ocean basins?\nanswer: Across multiple ocean basins, studies report varied effects of prohibiting all commercial fishing on fish abundance. In the Mediterranean Sea, site comparisons reported no increase in biomass for some targeted species 2\u201313 years after closure compared to a fished area, while other studies in this and additional basins recorded higher abundances for subsets of species (e.g., some commercially targeted and non-targeted groups) [2667]. In the Indian Ocean and Gulf of Mexico, among site comparison studies, some found higher abundances for parts of the fish community, while others reported mixed outcomes across species/groups [2667]. In the South Atlantic Ocean, one study found no change in fish species composition relative to fished areas, and among abundance-focused comparisons spanning this and other basins, responses ranged from higher abundances in some commercially exploited species to mixed effects depending on exploitation history [2667]. In the Tasman Sea, a before-and-after study found lower abundances for most species two years after closure in an estuary, while another study in a reserve zone closed to commercial trapping reported abundance patterns that varied over a decade and among fish groups [2667]. In the South China Sea, overall fish density in the wider region increased within five years after reserves limiting commercial fishing were created, alongside shifts in assemblage composition [2667]. Syntheses and multi-region studies of fully non-fished marine protected areas across the Indian, Atlantic, Mediterranean, Pacific, Tasman, Coral, Philippine, and Caribbean seas, as well as the Gulf of Mexico and Sulu Sea, frequently found higher total fish abundance/biomass and higher abundances of many targeted and non-targeted species compared to fished or partially fished areas, though several studies reported similar or species-dependent effects, with variability linked to species group, trophic position, fish size, depth, habitat, and protected area age/size [2682].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Using technology to communicate near real-time catch information to fishers was reported to reduce unwanted catch or discards in two of three cases in a review (3826). Setting catch limits or quotas for non-targeted commercial species reduced unwanted catch in two of three cases in a review, and a before-and-after study found catch limits reduced unwanted halibut whereas a previous individual transferable quota system did not (2693). Implementing a combination of long-term fishery closures and areas limited to specific gears reduced unwanted catch of cod in a replicated, before-and-after study (2655).

Establishing temporary fishery closures; one study found no increase in cod spawning stock biomass, survival, or length composition over nine years, but tagged cod spent nearly a third of time inside a closed spawning area during implementation, and real-time area closures reduced annual cod catch (retained and discarded) [2664]. Ceasing or prohibiting all fishing in marine protected areas (no-take zones); multiple studies found higher abundances and larger fish compared to fished areas, and one study found more eggs of four commercially targeted species inside a non-fished reserve than outside [2682]. Setting minimum landing sizes for commercially fished species; one review reported increased swordfish recruitment in one of five fisheries after recommended minimum sizes and catch limits, whereas a replicated study reported most fish landed were immature despite minimum sizes, and other studies showed mixed effects on unwanted catch [2735]. Setting maximum landing sizes for commercially fished species; no studies currently evaluate effects [2736]. Releasing fish that are carrying eggs or live young; no studies currently evaluate effects [2733].

Modifying longline configuration showed mixed effects: increasing lead weight or using nylon instead of wire reduced unwanted shark/ray catches in some fisheries or reviews, but one study found no reduction in undersized haddock; survival of unwanted sharks/rays at retrieval was higher on nylon than wire for some species in a review, whereas a field study found reduced survival on nylon vs wire [2699]. Changing bait type often reduced unwanted catches of undersized haddock, Atlantic cod and other non\u2011target fish in several replicated studies, but had no reduction for pelagic stingray or overall unwanted fish in others; two global reviews found no effect on unwanted shark/ray catches; using different bait did not reduce hooking injuries or increase survival of undersized snapper or sharks/rays, and one study reported increased size\u2011selectivity for Greenland halibut [2700]. Replacing J\u2011hooks with circle hooks generally reduced sea turtle bycatch in multiple studies and a review, with similar survival in some studies but fewer deep or swallowed hooks and, in one review, fewer turtle deaths in most of the assessed fisheries; effects varied among fisheries and with bait type [3559]. Evidence for seabird bycatch mitigation on longlines is variable: one Australian study found lower bycatch with bait throwers [291]; a North Pacific trial recorded higher bycatch with a line shooter while a Norwegian trial found no effect [290]; no intervention-based evidence was found for high\u2011visibility longlines or water cannons [294, 287].

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the documented ecological outcomes of managing small-scale traditional fisheries, either through prohibition or by making them the only permitted fishing type?\nanswer: - Allowing only small-scale traditional (artisanal) fishing in a marine protected area zone for three years was associated with higher overall commercial catch rates for five of seven species compared to openly fished areas (2678).\n- Prohibiting all fishing with limited exceptions in marine protected areas produced mixed fish community and population responses: lower total fish species richness in some areas compared to unprotected sites; similar biomass and lower total fish density when only bait fishing was allowed; similar abundance for several rockfish species and lingcod relative to fished sites; increased cod survival inside the protected area; and frequent, prolonged use of protected habitats by some shark species, reducing likelihood of fishing mortality (2681).\n- Closing areas to all non-towed (static) fishing gears was associated with higher overall shark abundance when sampled with longlines (but not with gillnets) and greater length for two of five shark species/groups compared to areas permitting commercial gillnets (2670).\n- Prohibiting commercial fishing was associated with different benthic invertebrate community composition relative to fished areas; no change in overall invertebrate species richness in one case; greater overall invertebrate abundance in closed areas in two cases, with biomass higher in one and similar in another; no difference in lobster abundance after up to two years; and greater biological production from invertebrates where trawling and dredging had been excluded for 28 years (2097).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
