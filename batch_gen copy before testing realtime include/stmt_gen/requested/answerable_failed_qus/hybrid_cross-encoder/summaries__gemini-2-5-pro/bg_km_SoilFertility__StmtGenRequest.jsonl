The addition of crop remains and straw has also been shown to increase microbial biomass (910). In terms of soil structure, mixed amendments were more effective at reducing the size of cracks in dry soil compared to inorganic fertilizers alone or no fertilizer (902). Incorporating straw has been found to improve soil structure, though it may not be effective in compacted, anaerobic soils (910). One study found that straw addition reduced soil loss, while another reported mixed effects depending on the soil type (910). Soils with mixed fertilizers and manure alone have been found to contain more organic carbon (902). Similarly, the incorporation of plant material into the soil has been shown to increase carbon levels and lead to larger soil aggregates (910). In terms of nutrients, soils with manure and inorganic fertilizers have been found to have more nutrients, although one study showed inconsistent effects (902). The application of compost or straw has been associated with higher soil nitrogen levels, but the effects of processed wastes have been mixed (910). Furthermore, the incorporation of straw has been shown to reduce nitrate leaching (910). In terms of crop yield, mixed manure and inorganic fertilizer amendments have been found to increase maize yield (902). The incorporation of straw has been linked to higher barley yield, and the incorporation of crop remains earlier in the season has been found to increase grain yields (910).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Additionally, changing tillage practices can have an impact on soil erosion. Seven trials showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing, while two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.

Three studies indicated that applying farmyard or poultry manure could reduce nutrient loss, with one study noting that applying it in winter rather than autumn was more effective (911). However, one study found that this practice could lead to higher nitrate leaching (911), and another trial reported increased nutrient loss with high rates of cotton gin compost and poultry manure (891). Conversely, the addition of molasses was found to improve nutrient retention in one trial (891).\n\nChanging tillage practices can also impact nutrient retention. Four trials found that reduced tillage led to higher nutrient retention, and one trial observed that conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate compared to no-till soil (906).\n\nFurthermore, managing grazing intensity can play a role.

The application of manure or compost has been found to increase microbial biomass, while poultry manure specifically has been shown to increase microbial respiration (911). In terms of soil structure and erosion, one study found that high rates of cotton gin compost and poultry manure improved soil structure and reduced soil loss (891). Another study noted lower soil loss and runoff when manure was used with other treatments (911), and a separate study linked manure and compost application to higher organic matter, larger soil aggregations, and improved physical properties (911).\n\nWhen it comes to nutrient management, three studies reported reduced nutrient loss and higher nitrogen levels with farmyard or poultry manure application (911). Conversely, one study found that high application rates of cotton gin compost and poultry manure increased nutrient loss (891), and another observed higher nitrate leaching (911). The timing of application can also be a factor, with one study finding that applying farmyard manure in winter instead of autumn led to lower nutrient loss (911).\n\nSoil organic carbon and matter can also be affected. Four studies found higher carbon levels after manure application (911). While one study reported increased organic matter from manure and compost (911), two other studies found no change in organic matter levels from manure application (911).

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are some of the most effective actions for reducing soil erosion on agricultural land?\nanswer: Several studies have found that planting or maintaining ground cover in orchards or vineyards can be effective for reducing soil erosion. Specifically, six replicated, randomized, controlled studies found less erosion in soils with ground cover compared to bare or tilled soils, and one study found that permanent cover crops resulted in the least erosion (1367). Another effective measure is adding mulch to crops, as five studies found that this increased soil stability and reduced soil erosion and runoff (887). Growing cover crops, either beneath the main crop or between crop rows, has also been shown to be effective, with two studies demonstrating reduced erosion and another showing the highest soil stability under a grass cover (897).\n\nActions with slightly less supporting evidence but still showing positive effects include:\n*   **Retaining crop residues**: One review found that this practice reduced water runoff and soil erosion (907).\n*   **Planting new hedges**: Three replicated studies found that planting new hedges led to reduced soil erosion (744).\n*   **Reducing grazing intensity**: One trial observed less sediment erosion when grazing time was reduced (901).\n*   **Amending the soil with non-chemical minerals and mineral wastes**: One study found this to reduce erosion (892).\n*   **Adding sewage sludge**: The evidence is mixed, with one study finding less erosion and another finding no difference in soil stability (1364).\n\nFinally, one study on planting hedgerows found no significant difference in soil particle sizes between soils with or without them, suggesting it may not be a primary method for erosion control (1373).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
