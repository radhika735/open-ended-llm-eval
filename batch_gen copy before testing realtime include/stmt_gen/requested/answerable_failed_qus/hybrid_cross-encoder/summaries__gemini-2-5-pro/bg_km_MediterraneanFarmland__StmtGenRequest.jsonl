[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: To improve soil fertility, how does adding compost compare to adding manure?\nanswer: One study in Turkey found that adding either compost or manure resulted in higher organic matter content and larger soil aggregations (911). Additionally, four studies in India, Spain, and Turkey reported higher crop yields with the application of either manure or compost (911). \n\nWhen focusing on manure, studies have shown varied outcomes. Five studies indicated an increase in soil organic matter with manure application, whereas three studies found no change (1363). Similarly, some studies reported an increase in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium levels, while others observed no significant differences (1363). In terms of soil structure, manure was found to improve soil stability in three studies and reduce erosion in one (1363). On the other hand, the application of manure was associated with higher emissions of carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide in two separate studies (1363). Furthermore, three controlled, replicated studies conducted in the UK and the USA revealed an increase in microbial biomass with the application of either manure or compost (911). A review, along with three other studies, indicated that the application of manure is associated with higher carbon levels in the soil (911).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the potential negative impacts of using no-tillage systems in arable fields in a Mediterranean climate?\nanswer: In a Mediterranean climate, some studies have found that no-tillage systems can have negative impacts on crop yields and the environment. For instance, in some comparisons, no-tillage has been associated with lower yields of cereals, fruits and vegetables, and sunflower seeds (1358). Additionally, reduced tillage has been found in some studies to result in less nitrogen in the soil, as well as reduced microbial biomass (1371). Other negative impacts observed in some studies include lower water-stability of soil aggregates, smaller soil aggregates, and increased emissions of carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide from the soil (1371). Furthermore, one study found that shallower tillage led to more soil erosion (1371). In one study in Spain, lower straw yields were found in plots with no tillage compared to reduced tillage (1358).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: For arable fields in the Mediterranean, how does a no-tillage system compare with a reduced tillage system for improving soil health?\nanswer: A meta-analysis covering multiple Mediterranean countries indicated that reduced tillage resulted in higher organic matter in soils when compared to conventional tillage [1371]. Further studies in Italy, Spain, Syria, and the USA also found increased organic matter in soils with reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage, though two studies found similar levels [1371]. In terms of soil organisms, eleven studies in Italy, Spain, and the USA observed more microbial biomass in soils with reduced tillage versus conventional tillage [1371]. The impact of reduced tillage on soil nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium showed mixed results, with some studies reporting increases, some decreases, and others no significant difference compared to conventional tillage [1371]. For no-tillage systems, nine controlled studies in Spain and the USA found a greater amount of water in the soil compared to tilled soils, and one study in Spain noted that barley used water more efficiently in no-tillage plots [1384]. However, there were no studies found concerning pathogens, pesticides, nutrients or sediments for no-tillage systems in the provided information [1384].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What does the evidence say about how adding different organic amendments to soil affects greenhouse gas emissions on Mediterranean farmland?\nanswer: When slurry is added to the soil, two studies in Spain found higher carbon dioxide emissions, while one study showed no difference (1365). One study in Spain indicated that less methane was absorbed by soils with added slurry, whereas three other studies found similar methane fluxes (1365). Additionally, five studies in Spain reported higher nitrous oxide emissions in soils with added slurry, compared to one study that found similar emissions (1365). When comparing digested and untreated slurry, a Spanish study found similar nitrous oxide emissions, and another study found similar carbon dioxide and methane emissions (1365).\n\nWhen comparing organic to inorganic fertilizers, four studies in Italy and Spain noted higher carbon dioxide emissions from plots with organic fertilizer, with one Spanish study finding similar emissions (1366). In terms of methane, two Spanish studies revealed that more methane was absorbed by soils with organic fertilizer, while two other studies showed similar absorption amounts (1366). For nitrous oxide, three studies, including a meta-analysis, reported lower emissions from plots with organic fertilizer, whereas five studies in Spain found similar emissions (1366). The meta-analysis also indicated lower nitrous oxide emissions after adding solid organic fertilizer, but not liquid organic fertilizer, compared to inorganic fertilizer (1366). Furthermore, one study in Spain found that plots with slurry absorbed methane, while plots with manure emitted it (1366).\n\nRegarding the exclusion of grazers, one study in Spain found more carbon dioxide in the soil of ungrazed plots compared to grazed plots, while a US study found similar amounts (1375).

Other actions include providing buffer strips alongside water courses, which can positively influence biodiversity (120), and growing cover crops, which can reduce weeds (1394). Additionally, taking field corners out of management has been linked to higher grey partridge survival (128), reducing field size can increase butterfly and burnet moth populations (3974), and converting to organic farming may boost the richness and abundance of butterflies and moths (3907).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Another replicated, site comparison study in the UK found that establishing hedgerows alongside arable land increased small mammal abundance (2383). However, a different study found that Irish hare numbers did not increase (2383). With regards to restoring watercourses, one replicated site comparison study in the USA found similar amounts of water in soils in restored and remnant riparian habitats (1388).

In contrast, adding slurry had mixed effects on soil organic matter. While one study in Spain noted an increase in organic matter with slurry application in some instances (1365), three other studies across Spain and multiple Mediterranean countries found no significant change (1365). In terms of nutrient content, the application of farmyard or poultry manure was found to decrease nutrient loss and increase nitrogen levels in three studies conducted in Canada, Spain, the UK, and the USA (911). One of these studies also indicated that applying farmyard manure in winter was more effective at reducing nutrient loss than applying poultry manure or slurry in autumn (911). However, another study showed that manure application could lead to higher nitrate leaching (911). The effects of slurry on soil nutrients were also varied. Two studies in Spain reported higher nitrate concentrations in soils with added slurry (1365), while two other studies in Portugal and Spain found no significant difference (1365). Additionally, one study in Spain found an increase in ammonium levels with slurry application, but another study did not observe the same effect (1365).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

One study found that after more than 30 years of exclusion, plant species richness was similar to grazed areas in a dry year but greater in a wet year (2966). In the same study, while the number of wetland-characteristic plant species was similar, their overall abundance was greater in the excluded areas (2966).
