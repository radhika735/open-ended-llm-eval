[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the most beneficial actions for creating field margins to support wildlife on arable farms?\nanswer: The most beneficial actions for creating field margins to support wildlife on arable farms include: Sowing uncropped margins with native wildflower seed mixes which support higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees compared to cropped edges, grassy margins, or naturally regenerated margins (Action 19). Sowing field margins with agricultural nectar and pollen seed mixes containing perennial leguminous flowering plants attracts significantly more foraging bumblebees than other margin types, though these mixes may need re-sowing every few years (Action 18). Creating uncultivated margins around intensive fields has shown benefits for invertebrates including bees, with 19 studies finding higher plant diversity and species richness compared to conventionally managed margins, though 6 studies found no difference (Action 63). Leaving uncropped, cultivated margins or plots provides benefits to farmland birds, plants, invertebrates and mammals including increased species richness of plants and bumblebees, abundance of spiders and ground beetles, and improved breeding success for birds like northern lapwing and Eurasian skylark (Action 562). Planting field margins with diverse plant species has been shown to increase activity of certain bat species like soprano pipistrelles and barbastelle bats (Action 1941).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Planting dedicated floral resources on farmland has shown substantial benefits for wild bees, with 14 trials recording substantial numbers of wild bees foraging on perennial or annual sown flowering plants. Phacelia was particularly effective, attracting 8-35 foraging bee species in trials.

Managing ditches to benefit wildlife showed that some farmland birds responded positively to the presence of ditches managed for wildlife, with bunded ditches visited by more birds than non-bunded ditches (Action 180). Maintaining traditional water meadows resulted in increased population sizes or territories of northern lapwing, common redshank and black-tailed godwit and increased plant species richness (Action 696).\n\nDrawbacks: Raising water levels resulted in a net loss of plant species in one study and did not affect lapwing foraging rate, while another study found common snipe declined on sites under management to maintain water meadows (Actions 121, 696). Some farmland bird species did not respond positively or responded negatively to ditch management (Action 180). Studies found that managing traditional water meadows by grazing had mixed impacts on wildlife and the productivity of northern lapwings was too low to sustain populations on three of the four water meadows managed for waders (Action 696).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Planting crops specifically to provide supplementary food has mixed results - it increases small mammal abundance in winter but not in summer (Action 2394). Set-aside areas showed mixed effectiveness, with some studies finding no enhancement of small mammal numbers relative to cropland, though wood mice use of uncut set-aside areas increased after crop harvesting (Action 2377).

Creating uncropped cultivated margins or plots (including specific 'lapwing plots') provides nesting habitat where northern lapwing, Eurasian skylark, grey partridge and yellow wagtail have been observed breeding. Spring planting of crops rather than autumn planting creates more suitable nesting conditions, with northern lapwings selecting spring-sown crops for nesting more than expected based on availability. Creating dedicated skylark plots specifically increases both Eurasian skylark population density and productivity compared to fields without plots.

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the effects of different mowing management strategies\u2014such as timing, height, and technique\u2014on farmland wildlife?\nanswer: Raising mowing height on grasslands has shown mixed effects on farmland wildlife. A UK replicated controlled study found it increased productivity of Eurasian skylark and reduced damage to amphibians and invertebrates, but other studies found no effects on foraging birds or invertebrates, and shorter grass actually improved foraging success of northern lapwing and common starling chicks.\n\nDifferent mowing techniques significantly affect wildlife mortality. Studies from Germany, Ireland, Switzerland and the UK found that specific techniques can reduce bird, mammal, amphibian and invertebrate mortality. Corncrake Friendly Mowing schemes increased the UK corncrake population, with 68% of chicks escaping when fields were mown from center outwards versus 45% with conventional edge-in mowing. Bar mowers caused less damage to amphibians and invertebrates than other types. Wider mowing machinery increased skylark chick survival fourfold, while mower-conditioners resulted in higher skylark nest survival than tedders.\n\nRotational mowing strategies benefit many butterfly and moth species. Ten studies found rotational mowing (mowing strips in alternate years, leaving some areas uncut) increased butterfly species richness and abundance compared to complete annual mowing. This benefited 27 out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern in Europe, with some heath fritillary populations surviving on rotationally mown grasslands while others went extinct on unmanaged sites.\n\nTiming of cutting significantly impacts butterfly and moth populations. Studies from seven countries found delayed cutting (July-September vs May-June) generally increased abundance and richness of butterflies, burnet moths and caterpillars, though results varied between years. Some species like short-tailed blue preferred late-mown meadows, while others such as marbled white and meadow brown preferred early-mown areas.\n\nSpecific wildlife protection techniques during mowing include marking nests and caterpillar locations. Marking northern lapwing nests reduced their destruction probability. Marking marsh fritillary caterpillar webs before mowing led to increased web numbers the following year.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

For invasive non-native plants such as Himalayan balsam and Japanese knotweed, control methods involve removing all flower heads at peak flowering time, which dramatically reduced seed production in giant hogweed according to studies in the Czech Republic. For bracken management specifically, multiple techniques are available: herbicide application using asulam can reduce bracken abundance if applied repeatedly, though cutting may be equally effective; cutting bracken alone has been shown to increase heather cover and biomass while reducing bracken cover; a combination of cutting followed by herbicide application can effectively reduce bracken biomass and cover; and cutting followed by rotovating is another option, though it showed no effect on total plant biomass. Additional actions include general removal or control of non-native or problematic plants, with studies showing that such removal can increase plant species richness and benefit butterfly populations. For managing overabundant native species more broadly, reducing numbers of large herbivores like red deer can increase cover and height of common heather, and removing feral livestock can shift vegetation composition from grass to shrub dominance.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
