For fencing, one controlled study found that deer exclusion fencing increased shrub height, and five studies in freshwater wetlands showed mixed results: fencing sometimes increased survival of planted tree seedlings depending on factors like planting season and site conditions, and increased tree seedling height in some cases but not others. One study found planted swamp gum seedlings had much higher survival rates over one year in mammal-excluded plots compared to open plots. For tree guards, one replicated, randomized, controlled study found that light-colored plastic tree shelters increased survival rates of planted tree seedlings, while one replicated, controlled study found tree guards increased tree height after 37 months but not after 44 months. One study in a nutria-invaded wetland found that plastic guards significantly increased both height and diameter growth rates of planted baldcypress seedlings over one growing season.

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the documented effects of removing competing understory vegetation on planted trees and overall forest biodiversity?\nanswer: Based on the available evidence, removing competing understory vegetation shows mixed effects on planted trees and forest biodiversity. Several studies found no significant effects on planted seedling emergence, survival, growth rate, or frost damage (Action 1256), though one study noted increased seedling biomass when competing herbs were removed, and another found that removing sheep laurel shrubs increased growth rate and height of planted black spruce seedlings. In freshwater wetlands, clearing vegetation before planting typically had no clear effect on seedling height, diameter, or survival, though it sometimes increased survival rates when specific competitive species like reed canarygrass were removed (Action 3334). However, vegetation removal can negatively impact overall forest biodiversity - applying herbicides after restoration planting was found to decrease plant species richness and diversity (Action 1241). Vegetation removal combined with mechanical soil disturbance increased cover and diversity of understory plants while decreasing understory shrub cover, and also increased density of young trees (Action 1274). Studies on mammal responses showed mixed results, with one finding increased use by American martens where competing vegetation was removed in clearcut areas, while other studies found mixed or no effects on moose and snowshoe hares (Action 2644).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Fertilizer application showed mixed results, with six of eight studies finding increases in plant cover, biomass, and tree size, though five studies also found no effects on various growth parameters (Action 1248). Ground preparation techniques including soil scarification, ploughing, and mounding increased planted tree survival and growth rates in six of seven studies (Action 1263, Action 1251). Mechanical soil disturbance combined with vegetation removal increased understory plant cover and diversity in two studies, and also increased density of young trees (Action 1274). Simple soil disturbance (excluding scarification or ploughing) decreased understory vegetation cover in two studies (Action 1252).

Several studies evaluating access restriction measures exist, but primarily for non-forest ecosystems. For forest-specific interventions, there is no evidence found for the effects of creating managed paths/signs to contain disturbance (Action ID: 1170) or providing paths to limit extent of disturbance to mammals (Action ID: 2337), meaning no studies have directly tested these interventions. Evidence from other ecosystems shows mixed results: six studies on using signs and access restrictions to reduce disturbance at nest sites (Action ID: 309) found increased numbers of breeders, higher reproductive success or lower levels of disturbance in waders and terns, while one small study found no effect on eagle reproductive success. Similarly, 11 studies on installing cave gates to restrict public access (Action ID: 999) showed mixed results for bat populations, with some finding more bats after gate installation and others finding negative behavioral effects.

Group-selection harvesting increases cover and diversity of understory plants and density of young trees (1224). Thinning trees by girdling increases understory plant species richness, diversity and cover (1226). Variable retention management supports higher densities of bird species compared to control stands (332). Patch retention harvesting contains more birds of more species than clearcut areas while maintaining similar numbers to unharvested areas (330). Thinning trees within forests increases the density, cover, species richness and diversity of understory plants (1211).

On mature trees, 11 of 12 studies found thinning decreased tree density and cover, while 5 of 6 studies showed increased tree size (action 1209). For young trees, 6 of 12 studies found thinning increased young tree density, though effects varied with one study showing decreased density and five showing no or mixed effects (action 1210). Understory plants showed consistent positive responses, with 17 of 25 studies finding increased density and cover, and 13 of 19 studies showing increased species richness and diversity, though some studies found no effects or mixed results (action 1211). Thinning by girdling specifically increased understory plant species richness, diversity and cover (action 1226). The combination of thinning followed by prescribed fire increased understory plant cover and abundance as well as deciduous tree density in 3 of 6 studies (action 1227). Beyond vegetation, thinning affected wildlife populations differently - amphibians showed mixed responses with population declines in some studies (action 852), while reptiles generally maintained similar abundance and species richness compared to unthinned areas (action 3627).

Studies from Sweden and the USA found that shelterwood harvesting resulted in higher plant diversity, lower grass cover, and higher density of tree species compared to clearcutting. Research across multiple countries including Australia, Iran, Nepal, and the USA found that shelterwood harvesting increased abundance, species richness and diversity of understory plants, as well as the growth and survival rate of young trees in six of seven studies, though one study found negative effects. For wildlife impacts, studies in the USA found that shelterwood harvesting and group harvesting resulted in smaller reductions in salamander populations compared to clearcutting, with shelterwood showing higher or initially higher salamander abundance. However, both shelterwood harvesting and group harvesting still decreased salamander abundance compared to unharvested forests in most cases. Research on butterflies and moths found that shelterwood harvesting maintained higher species richness and faster recovery of moth populations compared to clearcutting.

To reduce competition from other vegetation, selective thinning can be used after restoration planting, which has been shown to increase herbaceous species abundance while decreasing tree competition. Ground covering techniques such as plastic mats can decrease cover of competing herbaceous plants and grasses, while mulch application can increase total plant cover. For protection from animal damage, tree guards or shelters can increase survival rates of planted tree seedlings, with light-colored plastic shelters being more effective than dark-colored ones. Physical barriers like fences can be used to exclude wild herbivores from restoration areas.

Mulching with woodchips before planting native shrubs showed mixed results - it had no significant effect on overall shrub cover or swamp gum seedling height in Australian floodplain swamps, but reduced cover of problematic herb species in one of two tested swamps (3314). Covering plots with plastic or jute mats before planting reduced cover of two problematic herb species in Australian floodplain swamps (3318), while shading black mangrove seedlings with black mesh on a Mexican sandflat resulted in increased height growth over six months (3319). Prescribed burning can be used to control trees (1721) and problematic plants in freshwater swamps (3118), with one study finding that burning canarygrass-invaded vegetation after herbicide spraying increased overall plant diversity compared to spraying alone.
