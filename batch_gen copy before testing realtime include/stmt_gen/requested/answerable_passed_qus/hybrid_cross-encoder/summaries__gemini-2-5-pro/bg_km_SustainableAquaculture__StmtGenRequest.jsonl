Two controlled studies in Norway indicated that salmon fed diets with up to 25% bacterial protein had similar growth rates to those on a 100% fish meal diet, but growth rates were lower with a 50% bacterial protein diet (918). Conversely, another Norwegian study found that diets with 18% and 36% bacterial protein resulted in higher growth rates compared to a control group (918).\n\nFor plant-based proteins, six studies in Norway, Scotland, and the USA reported decreased growth rates in salmon, while three studies in Norway, Canada, and Scotland found similar growth rates to fish meal diets (924). Four controlled studies in Norway and Scotland noted reduced final body weights in salmon on plant-based diets, whereas two controlled studies in Norway found similar final body weights to those on fish meal diets (924). Additionally, two controlled studies in Norway observed lower feeding efficiency with plant-based diets, although one replicated study in Norway reported an increase (924).

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the documented effects of using plant-based proteins in salmon feed in aquaculture operations in Norway and Scotland?\nanswer: Several studies in Norway and Scotland have documented the effects of including plant-based proteins in salmon feed. Six studies, four of which were replicated and controlled, in Norway, Scotland, and the USA, indicated that this inclusion led to decreased growth rates in salmon. In contrast, three replicated and/or controlled studies from Norway, Canada, and Scotland found similar growth rates between salmon fed plant-based diets and those fed fish meal diets (924). Four replicated, controlled studies in Norway and Scotland, three of which were randomized, observed reduced final body weights in salmon on plant-based protein diets compared to those on fish meal-based diets. However, two controlled studies in Norway, one of which was replicated, found no difference in final body weights between the two diet types (924). Regarding feeding efficiency, two replicated, controlled studies in Norway, one of which was randomized, reported lower efficiency in salmon fed plant-based protein diets. Conversely, a replicated study in Norway noted an increase in feeding efficiency with these diets. Two other replicated studies, one of which was controlled, in Canada and Scotland, found similar feeding efficiency across both diet types (924). The digestibility of feed components was found to be lower in salmon on diets containing plant proteins in two replicated, controlled studies when compared to fish meal. On the other hand, two randomized, replicated, controlled studies in Scotland and Norway reported similar levels of digestibility for both diet types (924). Furthermore, two studies noted that survival rates and appetite were unaffected by either plant- or fish meal-based protein diets. However, the morphology of the distal intestine was altered in two randomized, replicated, controlled studies where salmon were fed diets with plant-based proteins. The condition of the salmon was found to be increased in one randomized, replicated, controlled study, but it was reduced in two other replicated studies (924). In addition to protein, the use of plant-based oils has also been studied. Three replicated studies in Norway, two of which were controlled, found similar growth rates in salmon fed diets with fish oil versus those with vegetable oil. One replicated study in Norway even reported higher growth rates in fish on diets with vegetable oil. Another replicated, controlled study found that salmon growth rates were both lower and higher in vegetable oil diets compared to fish oil diets, depending on the family genetics (926). Two replicated studies in Norway, one of which was controlled, found similar average final body weights between groups of salmon fed both fish oil and vegetable oil diets. Three studies in Norway and Scotland, two of which were replicated and one controlled, showed that the fatty acid profile of salmon flesh reflected the oil source in their diets. A study in Norway also indicated that the oil source in diets did not affect salmon broodstock fecundity, egg weights, fertility rates, or the weights and development of their fry (926). One replicated Norwegian study observed that salmon on vegetable oil diets had high liver lipid and low plasma lipoprotein compared to those on a fish oil diet. A replicated, controlled study found high levels of n-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids compared to diets containing rapeseed oil. In Scotland, a replicated, controlled study revealed that salmon on vegetable oil-based diets had lower concentrations of dioxin and polychlorinated biphenyls in their flesh compared to those on diets with fish oil. A replicated study in Norway also found that fresh, frozen, and smoked salmon flesh from fish fed both types of oil-based diets had similar levels of gaping, texture, and liquid holding capacity, although pigment concentration was lower in the vegetable oil diets (926).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

The number of aerobic bacteria in the hindgut of salmon fed krill meal was higher and the bacterial flora composition was different (916). For salmon fed plant-based proteins, some studies found reduced final body weights, while others found similar weights compared to fish meal diets (924). Feeding efficiency was reported to be lower in some studies, higher in one, and similar in others (924). Digestibility of feed components was found to be lower in two studies but similar in two other studies (924). Survival rates and appetite were not affected in two studies (924). However, the morphology of the distal intestine was altered in two studies of salmon fed plant-based proteins (924).

One controlled study found corkwing and goldskinny cleaner wrasse were as effective at controlling lice infestation as chemical treatments. One replicated, controlled study found rockcook cleaner wrasse were ineffective at preventing lice outbreaks (738). A replicated, controlled study in Norway reported lower numbers of lice on salmon kept in low intensity artificial light or natural lighting. The more intense the artificial light was, the higher the number of lice found on fish (741). A study in Scotland recorded lower lice numbers on Atlantic salmon in cages using a fallowing system.

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: In Norway, how do different plant-based feed alternatives, such as vegetable oils versus plant proteins, affect salmon growth and body composition?\nanswer: In Norway, studies on plant-based proteins showed varied effects on salmon growth, with some indicating decreased growth rates [924] while others found similar rates to fish meal diets [924]. Four studies in Norway and Scotland noted reduced final body weights with plant-protein diets, whereas two Norwegian studies found no difference [924]. Feeding efficiency was reported to be lower in two Norwegian studies, but another in the same country found it to be higher [924]. The morphology of the distal intestine was altered in salmon fed diets containing plant-based proteins in two studies [924].\n\nRegarding vegetable oils, three Norwegian studies found that salmon growth rates were similar when fed diets with either fish oil or vegetable oil [926]. Another study in Norway observed higher growth rates in salmon fed vegetable oil diets [926]. Final body weights were found to be similar in two Norwegian studies comparing vegetable oil and fish oil diets [926]. The fatty acid profile of salmon flesh was found to reflect the oil source in the diets in three studies in Norway and Scotland [926]. A Norwegian study found that salmon fed vegetable oil diets had high liver lipid and low plasma lipoprotein compared to those on a fish oil diet [926].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the documented effects, both positive and negative, of replacing fish meal with plant-based proteins in Atlantic salmon diets?\nanswer: Six studies (four replicated, controlled) in Norway, Scotland and the USA found that inclusion of plant-based proteins within feed led to decreased growth rates in salmon (924). Three replicated and/or controlled studies from Norway, Canada and Scotland found similar growth rates in salmon fed either plant-based or fish meal diets (924). Four replicated, controlled studies (three randomised) from Norway and Scotland found reduced final body weights in salmon fed plant-based protein diets compared to fish meal-based diets (924). Two controlled studies (one replicated) from Norway found similar final body weights in salmon fed either plant-based or fish meal diets (924). Two replicated, controlled studies (one randomised) from Norway found lowered levels of feeding efficiency, whereas a replicated study in Norway found increased levels of feeding efficiency in salmon fed plant-based protein diets compared to fish meal diets (924). Two replicated studies (one controlled) in Canada and Scotland study found similar levels of feeding efficiency across both diet types (924). Digestibility of feed components by salmon was found to be lower in two replicated, controlled studies when the diets contained plant proteins compared to fish meal (924). Similar levels of digestibility across both diet types were identified by two randomised, replicated, controlled studies in Scotland and Norway (924). Two of the studies found that survival rates and appetite were not affected by plant- or fish meal-based protein diets (924). However morphology of the distal intestine was altered in two randomised, replicated, controlled studies where salmon were fed diets containing plant-based proteins (924).

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What does the evidence say about using probiotics, immunostimulants, or specific training to improve salmon survival against diseases?\nanswer: A replicated study in Scotland found that salmon fed a probiotic before being exposed to four different disease-causing bacteria had increased survival over a 28-day period compared to controls (732). In a replicated, controlled study in Norway, the number of salmon infected with lice was reduced by 28% when they were fed a diet of fish meal and 28% plant-based protein. The addition of beta-glucans to this diet decreased lice infection levels by a further 28% compared to controls (732). The same study found that the addition of mannan oligosaccharides improved gut function by preventing the development of soybean-induced enteritis when compared to controls (732). A randomised, replicated, controlled study in Norway discovered higher survival rates in salmon that had been exposed to infectious pancreatic necrosis if they had undergone aerobic training.
