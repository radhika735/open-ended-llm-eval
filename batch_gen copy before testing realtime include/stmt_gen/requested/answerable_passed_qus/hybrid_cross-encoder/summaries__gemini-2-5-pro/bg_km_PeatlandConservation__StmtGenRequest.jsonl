In terms of benefits, studies have shown that burning can increase moss, lichen, and bare ground cover in the short term (1774). It can also increase cottongrass cover after 8-18 years and lead to a higher biomass of grass-like plants in frequently burned areas (1774). Prescribed fire can also be used to reduce the cover of heather and other shrubs or trees (1774, 1763). Some studies found it increased plant species richness and diversity (1763) and sedge/rush cover (1763). Additionally, leaving some areas unburned during prescribed burning was found to increase the abundance of Karner blue butterflies and other specialist butterfly species (3879).\n\nHowever, there are also negative impacts associated with this practice. Some studies found that burning reduced or limited plant species richness (1774) and resulted in lower total vegetation, shrub, and bryophyte biomass (1774). The effects on herbaceous plants can be mixed; burning was found to reduce purple moor grass and forb cover in some instances, while having varied effects on other grass-like plants (1774, 1763). In one study, burning had no effect on the cover of fen-characteristic mosses or herbs (1763). Another study reported that six out of nine specialist butterfly species were more abundant when unburned areas were left, suggesting a negative impact if the entire area is burned (3879).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

There is an increase in the abundance of wetland or peatland-characteristic plants and a decrease in upland plant cover (1756). Specifically, Sphagnum moss cover or abundance is reported to increase with rewetting, although some studies report mixed responses by species (1756). The effect on non-Sphagnum mosses is varied, with some studies reporting a reduction in cover and others no effect (1756). Rewetting is also reported to increase the cover of sedges, cottongrass, and reed/rush, while purple moor grass cover is typically reduced (1756). Tree and shrub cover generally decreases or is unaffected by rewetting (1756). The effect of rewetting on overall plant species richness or diversity is inconsistent across studies, with some reporting an increase, some no effect, and others a reduction (1756). One study found that rewetting increased Sphagnum moss growth to natural levels (1756).

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the known benefits and harms of adding lime or inorganic fertilizers to aid peatland vegetation establishment?\nanswer: Based on the available evidence, adding inorganic fertilizers to peatlands without planting can lead to an increase in total vegetation cover, plant species richness, and the growth rate of herbs and shrubs, with phosphorus being a key component for these effects (1812). When used in areas with existing peatland plants, inorganic fertilizers have shown mixed results for plant survival, with one study indicating increased survival for some tree species, while another found no effect or even reduced survival for others (1826). However, the use of inorganic fertilizers has been associated with increased growth of planted mosses, herbs, and trees, as well as an increase in vegetation cover in some cases (1826).\n\nLiming in peatlands without planting has been found to increase overall vegetation biomass, primarily of grass (1790). In planted areas, the effects of lime are varied. It has been reported to decrease the survival of fen herbs but increase the survival of fen mosses (1825). Similarly, while some studies have found that liming does not enhance the growth of planted vegetation and can even have a negative impact on certain moss and tree species, another study noted increased growth in planted fen mosses (1825). In terms of cover, liming has been shown to increase the cover of sown mosses in one study, but had no effect on overall vegetation cover in another (1825).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Another study in the same country found that grazed fen meadows had fewer plant species and characteristic fen species compared to mown meadows (1762), while a separate study noted that mown fen meadows had a vegetation structure similar to those that were grazed (1759). Eight studies found that mowing or cutting increased plant species richness when compared to no mowing, before mowing, or grazing (1759). One study in the UK found that plant species richness increased more in plots mown in the summer versus those mown in the spring or autumn (1771). \n\nIn terms of mowing's effects, six studies in various European countries showed that it altered the plant community composition (1759). Mowing was also found to increase the cover of plants characteristic of fens or wet meadows in four studies (1759), and increase moss or bryophyte cover in four out of six studies (1759). Additionally, six studies found that mowing reduced the cover of at least one group of herbs (1759). The impact of mowing on shrubs was inconsistent, with two studies reporting a reduction in shrub cover while one found no effect (1759). Removing shrubs, along with other interventions, was found in one study to make the plant community more similar to a target fen meadow (1761). \n\nRegarding grazing, two studies in the UK showed an increased cover of certain herb groups like cottongrasses and sedges (1762).

Six of these studies, which were controlled, found that Sphagnum cover or abundance was higher in sown than unsown plots (1821).

Another intervention is to directly plant peatland trees and shrubs. Eight studies reported that the majority of planted trees/shrubs survived over periods between 10 weeks and 13 years (1820). However, one study reported that most planted willow cuttings died within two years, and another reported <5% survival of planted trees after five months due to deep flooding (1820).

However, the effect on mosses is variable, with one study reporting a reduction in forest-characteristic mosses, another a decrease in Sphagnum moss cover, and a third an increase in Sphagnum cover (1731). Tree removal was also found to increase total plant species richness in rich fens in two studies (1731).\n\nCombining tree removal with rewetting the peat can change the plant community to be less like drained, forested sites (1732) and increase the abundance of wetland-characteristic plants (1732). This combined approach has also been found to increase Sphagnum moss cover in some studies (1732) and reduce the cover of non-Sphagnum or forest-characteristic mosses (1732). The cover of herbs like cottongrasses and sedges was reported to increase in seven studies (1732). The impact on overall plant species richness from this combined intervention is mixed, with some studies reporting an increase and others no effect (1732).\n\nDisturbing the peat surface without planting can also influence the plant community.

In Germany, one study found that grazed fen meadows had fewer plant species and characteristic fen plant species than mown meadows, and the overall plant community differed between the two management types (1762). However, studies in the UK showed that grazing could increase plant species richness and the cover of some herb groups, while reducing the cover of purple moor grass and shrubs (1762). Conversely, some UK studies also reported that grazing had no effect on species richness, shrub cover, or the cover of fen-characteristic mosses, and that it could reduce Sphagnum moss cover (1762). Mowing has been shown to alter the plant community composition in fens and fen meadows (1759). Multiple studies found that mowing increased plant species richness and the cover of fen- or wet meadow-characteristic plants and mosses (1759). Mowing also generally reduced the cover of herbs like reeds and purple moor grass, though one study found it had no effect on overall herb cover (1759). The effect of mowing on vegetation structure and biomass has shown mixed results (1759). A single mow was found, in some cases, to have no effect on plant richness or the cover of characteristic plants and mosses (1759).

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the documented effects of using different physical interventions like mowing, cutting, or complete removal to manage unwanted vegetation in fens?\nanswer: The effects of cutting and mowing on unwanted vegetation in fens vary depending on the specific goals and context. For controlling problematic herbaceous plants, mowing has shown mixed results on plant community composition, with some studies finding no significant effect and others noting the development of different plant communities (1770). One study found that mown plots contained more fen-characteristic plant species (1770). The impact on vegetation cover also varies, with one study reporting no effect on vascular plant or bryophyte cover, while another observed an increase in Sphagnum moss cover and a reduction in purple moor grass (1770).\n\nThe timing of mowing can also be a factor. While one study in a UK fen meadow found similar changes in plant community composition regardless of the season, a study in the Netherlands reported that summer and winter mowing resulted in different plant community types (1771). In terms of species richness, summer-mown plots showed a greater increase compared to those mown in spring or autumn in one UK study (1771).\n\nWhen used to maintain or restore disturbance in fens with a history of such practices, mowing has been found to alter the plant community composition in six studies (1759). It has also been shown to increase the cover of fen- or wet meadow-characteristic plants in four studies and increase moss or bryophyte cover in another four studies (1759). Mowing has been effective in reducing the cover of certain herbs like reeds and sedges in six studies, and a single mow was found to reduce shrub cover in two studies (1759). Furthermore, eight studies found that mowing or cutting increased plant species richness (1759).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the alternatives to completely removing livestock from degraded agricultural peatlands, and how do their effects compare?\nanswer: One alternative to removing livestock from degraded agricultural peatlands is to limit their density on nearby farmland, but no studies were found to evaluate the effects of this approach (1786). Similarly, no studies were found on the effects of using barriers to keep livestock off ungrazed peatlands (1733). Studies on completely excluding or removing livestock from degraded peatlands have shown varied effects. For instance, excluding sheep had no effect on plant community development in one study, while another found that it favored dry moorland plants in drier areas (1734). While seven studies found that excluding or removing livestock had no effect on the cover of key herb groups, one study reported an increase in rush cover after cattle were excluded (1734). Five studies found no effect on Sphagnum moss cover from excluding livestock, but one study noted that Sphagnum moss appeared after cattle were excluded and the area was rewetted (1734). The effect on shrub cover is also varied, with four studies finding no effect, while three others reported an increase in shrub cover (1734). In one study, excluding sheep led to an increase in total vegetation, shrub, and bryophyte biomass but had no effect on the biomass of grass-like herbs (1734).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: To restore a bog after peat extraction, which vegetation introduction techniques are most effective at establishing Sphagnum moss cover?\nanswer: Eleven studies conducted in bogs across the UK, Canada, Finland, and Germany have shown that Sphagnum moss can be successfully established by adding mosses or moss fragments to the peatland surface. In some cases, the Sphagnum cover reached over 90% after 1-4 growing seasons (1821). Six of these studies, which were controlled, demonstrated that the cover or abundance of Sphagnum was greater in areas that had been sown with moss compared to those that were not (1821). For sown Sphagnum to survive, mulching may be necessary, as indicated by one study where survival was only observed in mulched plots (1821). Another study found that mulching after planting increased Sphagnum moss cover (1828). \n\nCovering sown plots with plastic mesh has been shown to increase the number of Sphagnum moss shoots (1829). In a greenhouse setting, the growth of planted Sphagnum mosses was increased by covering them with either transparent plastic sheets or shading mesh (1829). Furthermore, shading plots with plastic mesh was found to increase the cover of planted mosses (1829). One study reported that shading with plastic mesh enhanced the survival of planted mosses (1829). In contrast, another study in a Canadian bog found that shading sown plots with plastic mesh did not affect the cover of Sphagnum moss (1829). Similarly, three studies in degraded Canadian bogs reported that mulching after planting had no impact on Sphagnum moss cover (1828).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
