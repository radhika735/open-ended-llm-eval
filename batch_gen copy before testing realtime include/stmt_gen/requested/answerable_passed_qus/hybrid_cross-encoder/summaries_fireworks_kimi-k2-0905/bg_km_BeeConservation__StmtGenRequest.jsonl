[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the most effective ways to manage uncropped field margins on European farmland to support bumblebees?\nanswer: Several management strategies for uncropped field margins have been shown to effectively support bumblebees on European farmland. Sowing uncropped margins with agricultural nectar and pollen mixes, particularly those containing perennial leguminous flowering plants, attracts significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated, grassy or cropped margins - though these mixes require re-sowing every few years as their value degrades over time. Native wildflower seed mixes also support higher abundance and species richness of bumblebees compared to cropped edges, with perennial leguminous herbs providing important forage sources, especially for long-tongued species. Naturally regenerated uncropped margins can support more bumblebees than cropped margins, though their value is often based on thistle species considered pernicious weeds and their benefits are not consistent year-to-year. Providing grass strips at field margins can enhance bumblebee abundance and diversity, with 6 m wide margins showing positive effects. Conservation headlands (unsprayed field margins within crops) do not attract more foraging bumblebees than conventional fields. Rough grassland areas in field margins also attract nest-searching queen bumblebees at higher densities than other habitat types during spring.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What actions can be taken to support wild bee populations in urban areas and along infrastructure corridors like roads and power lines?\nanswer: Several evidence-based actions can support wild bee populations in urban areas and along infrastructure corridors. For power line corridors, evidence from Maryland, USA shows that managing land under power lines as scrub habitat supports more bee species than equivalent areas of annually mown grassland (Action 31). Stopping herbicide use on pavements and road verges increases butterfly species richness and abundance, with evidence from restored roadside prairies in the USA showing greater butterfly species richness where herbicide application was restricted compared to verges dominated by non-native vegetation (Action 3899). Managing land under power lines for butterflies and moths through mechanical cutting increases species richness compared to unmanaged land, with optimal timing being 2-4 years after scrub and trees are cleared (Action 3855). Altering mowing regimes on greenspaces and road verges to reduce mowing frequency or stop mowing entirely increases butterfly and moth species richness and abundance, with evidence from Germany and the UK showing less frequently mown urban greenspaces had higher butterfly and moth species richness and diversity (Action 3841). Establishing green infrastructure in urban areas, such as green roofs, provides habitat though evidence from Taiwan shows green roofs had lower butterfly species richness than urban parks (Action 3837). Restoring or maintaining species-rich grassland along road verges by sowing with native wildflowers and butterfly larval food plants increases both butterfly species richness and abundance, with evidence from Germany, UK, USA and Finland showing roadside prairies sown with more butterfly species' larval food plants had greater butterfly and burnet moth abundance (Action 3854).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the documented outcomes and challenges of rearing bumblebees in captivity for reintroduction?\nanswer: From 22 trials across 13 countries, captive rearing of bumblebee colonies has been attempted using various methods including confining mated queens alone or with different groups. Three trials specifically focused on declining North American species, with some success in rearing yellow-banded bumblebees B. terricola and red-belted bumblebees B. rufocinctus, but consistent failure in rearing yellow bumblebees B. fervidus, rusty-patched bumblebees, and American bumblebees B. pensylvanicus due to larvae dying before reaching adulthood.\n\nSeven replicated trials monitored laboratory-reared colonies released to the wild, with four trials tracking colonies until new queen production or queen death. Two UK trials showed very low or zero queen production, while two trials achieved good queen numbers. Variable outcomes were observed regarding social parasitism by cuckoo bees Bombus [Psithyrus] spp., with two trials reporting high parasitism rates (25-66% and 79%), while five trials reported no social parasites.\n\nDiet quality significantly impacts reproductive success - colonies fed freshly frozen pollen produced larger, longer-surviving queens than those fed dried, frozen pollen, and higher protein pollen types increased worker offspring production. Artificial light regimes of 8 hours light and 16 hours darkness reduced egg-laying time compared to constant darkness. Hibernation at 4-5\u00b0C for 45 days enhanced egg-laying and colony formation but resulted in smaller colonies, with queens needing to weigh over 0.6 g and be hibernated for four months or less for good survival rates. However, one four-year study found B. terrestris queens gradually decreased in weight during artificial rearing.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What is the evidence for the effectiveness of different sown floral mixes on agricultural land for wild bees?\nanswer: Evidence from European studies shows that sown floral mixes on agricultural land can significantly enhance wild bee populations, particularly bumblebees. Agricultural nectar and pollen mixes containing perennial leguminous plants attract significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated, grassy or cropped field margins (action 18). However, these mixes degrade in their value over time and need to be re-sown every few years. Native wildflower mixes also support higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees compared to cropped edges, grassy margins or naturally regenerated areas (action 19), with perennial leguminous herbs being particularly important forage sources for long-tongued bumblebee species. Planting dedicated floral resources including phacelia has shown substantial foraging by wild bees, with trials recording 8-35 bee species visiting planted patches (action 17). Comparisons between mix types show that agricultural forage plant mixtures (including legumes) attract greater numbers of bumblebees than perennial wildflower mixes, at least in the first year after establishment. The evidence indicates that both agricultural and native wildflower mixes are effective, with agricultural mixes showing stronger initial attraction but requiring more frequent re-sowing to maintain effectiveness.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Four replicated trials in Europe found enhanced diversity and/or abundance of wild bees on meadows with reduced management intensity, specifically those with delayed first cutting and minimal agrochemical use (Action ID 22). Agri-environment schemes that include reduced management intensity have shown benefits for foraging wild bees in some European countries including Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Scotland (Action ID 24).\n\nRegarding specific management changes, reducing cutting frequency generally benefits pollinators including wild bees. Meadows cut once per year support higher species richness and abundance of butterflies and other pollinators compared to those cut two or more times per year (Action ID 3961). Delaying mowing or first grazing dates also provides benefits, with eight studies showing positive effects on invertebrates including increased insect visits to flowers (Action ID 131).\n\nHowever, the effects of completely ceasing management are more complex.

However, for interventions targeting natural habitat restoration and connectivity, no evidence was found demonstrating effects on bee diversity or abundance in neighboring farms (action 6) or effects on wild bee communities from connecting habitat patches (action 10). While butterfly and moth studies show increased species richness and abundance with greater proportions of semi-natural habitat in landscapes (action 3910), specific evidence for bees is lacking. One study found more wild bee species and individuals in planted flower strips compared to unplanted strips (action 1406), but this represents immediate site effects rather than landscape-scale spillover.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What unintended negative consequences or limitations have been identified when providing artificial nest boxes for bees?\nanswer: Several unintended negative consequences and limitations have been identified when providing artificial nest boxes for bees. High rates of parasitism and mortality have been documented, with mortality rates ranging from 2-56% across different studies. Parasitism rates reached 36% for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India, and overall mortality reached 56% for the same species. Nest boxes can facilitate the spread and establishment of introduced species, with European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species using boxes more commonly than native bees in California, USA. This led to the development of exclusion methods specifically targeting introduced earwigs. Certain nest box designs have proven problematic - plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive due to parasitism or mould. Some nest box types, particularly surface wooden boxes commonly marketed for wildlife gardening, show very low uptake rates (0-2.5% in recent UK trials), questioning their effectiveness. For bumblebees, wooden surface or above ground boxes are not the most effective design and show consistently low occupancy rates. Additionally, soil-filled nest boxes for mining bee Andrena flavipes in the UK were not occupied at all in a small trial, suggesting this approach is ineffective.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

This design significantly outperforms wooden surface or above-ground nest boxes, which showed very low occupancy rates of 0-1.5% in recent UK trials (Action 48).

Four replicated trials across Europe demonstrated enhanced diversity and/or abundance of foraging wild bees under agri-environment schemes compared to conventionally managed fields. These included the Swiss Ecological Compensation Areas, German organic arable farming, Dutch botanical and meadow bird agreements, and Scottish Rural Stewardship Scheme. However, four other replicated trials found that agri-environment schemes did not enhance bee numbers or species richness, including meadow bird agreements in Dutch wet grasslands, steppe bird protection measures in Spain, and grass field margin strips in England. At the landscape scale, two UK replicated trials found that bumblebee populations were not enhanced on farmland managed under agri-environment schemes, with one study comparing reproductive success of buff-tailed bumblebee colonies and another examining queen bumblebee numbers in spring.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: How does sowing agricultural forage plants on field margins compare to sowing native wildflower mixes in terms of benefits for bumblebees?\nanswer: Based on European trials, agricultural forage plant mixes (particularly those containing perennial leguminous flowering plants) attract significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated, grassy, or cropped field margins. Three replicated trials showed that agricultural forage plant mixes attracted greater numbers of bumblebees than perennial wildflower mixes, at least in the first year. However, these agricultural legume margins were found to degrade in their value to bumblebees over time and require re-sowing every few years. In contrast, native wildflower mixes support higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees compared to cropped field edges, grassy margins, or naturally regenerated margins. Perennial leguminous herbs in wildflower seed mixtures are particularly important forage sources for long-tongued bumblebee species. One trial showed that common long-tongued bumblebee species (Bombus pascuorum and B. hortorum) strongly preferred plots of perennial wildflower seed mix over annual forage plants.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What factors, such as diet and social parasitism, have been shown to affect the success of captive-rearing and reintroducing bumblebee colonies?\nanswer: Several factors affect the success of captive-rearing and reintroducing bumblebee colonies. Diet composition significantly influences reproductive success - colonies fed on freshly frozen pollen produced larger queens that survived better and produced larger colonies than those fed on dried, frozen pollen (Action ID 50). Two replicated trials showed that B. terrestris workers can produce more offspring when fed pollen with higher protein content (Action ID 50). Social parasitism by cuckoo bees (Bombus [Psithyrus] spp.) is another critical factor, with studies showing highly variable parasitism rates from 25-79% in released colonies (Action ID 52). One UK trial demonstrated that social parasitism could be reduced by placing colonies in landscapes with intermediate rather than very high nectar and pollen availability, and by releasing them later rather than earlier in the season (Action ID 52). Supplementary feeding showed mixed results - one Canadian trial found it improved reproductive success of captive-reared colonies but did not reduce parasite load, while a US trial found no increase in colony productivity from supplementary feeding (Action ID 52). Captive rearing methods also mattered, with one trial finding that queens gradually decreased in weight over four years of artificial rearing (Action ID 50), and laboratory rearing showed variable success for different North American bumblebee species, with some species like B. fervidus laying eggs but experiencing larval mortality before reaching adulthood (Action ID 50).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
