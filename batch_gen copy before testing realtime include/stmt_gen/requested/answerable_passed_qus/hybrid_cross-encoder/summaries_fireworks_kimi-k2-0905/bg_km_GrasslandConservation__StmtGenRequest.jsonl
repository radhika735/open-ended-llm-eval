[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: When restoring grasslands, how do the outcomes of simply disturbing the soil before seeding compare to removing the topsoil entirely?\nanswer: Evidence from multiple studies shows that both soil disturbance and complete topsoil removal can enhance grassland restoration outcomes, but topsoil removal appears to provide more consistent benefits. A replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the UK (action 3415) found that removing turf before sowing seeds increased both grass and forb species richness in most cases compared to simply disturbing the soil before sowing. Topsoil removal also showed additional benefits including increased plant community similarity to intact steppe, enhanced species richness of sown plants, and improved seedling survival rates (3415). However, soil disturbance alone also showed some positive effects, such as increased abundance or species richness of specialist and generalist plant species (1728) and increased heathland plant numbers when combined with spreading heathland plant clippings (1711). Both approaches can reduce unwanted species - topsoil removal reduced cover of perennial rye-grass (1711) and common knapweed (3415), while soil disturbance reduced wavy hair grass cover (1685). The choice between methods may depend on specific restoration goals and site conditions, with topsoil removal showing more consistent positive outcomes but potentially requiring more intensive management.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Conversely, removing topsoil before seeding increased plant species richness and community similarity to intact habitats, while also increasing the survival of seedlings and planted species (Actions 3415, 1711).

Across 13 different seeding and planting interventions examined, only 3 studies reported any effects on vegetation structure. For hydroseeding (spraying slurry of seed, mulch and water), one replicated, controlled study in Italy found that this intervention led to an increase in the height of herb species. For sowing grassland seeds from a local source, two replicated studies (one controlled and one site comparison) in the USA and Italy found that this intervention did not alter vegetation height compared to sowing non-native grass seeds or a commercial seed mix. No other vegetation structure measurements were reported for any of the other interventions including: adding topsoil before seeding/planting, removing vegetation before seeding/planting, sowing seeds in prepared gaps within vegetation, adding fertilizer to soil before or after seeding/planting, removing leaf litter before seeding/planting, adding woody debris to protect seeds/plants, using erosion blanket after seeding/planting, applying herbicide before seeding/planting, transferring plant material from intact grassland, and sowing seeds at a higher density. The vast majority of studies focused on vegetation community composition, abundance, and germination/survival outcomes rather than structural characteristics.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

In studies of sowing native grass and forbs (action 3432), three of four replicated, randomized, controlled studies in the Czech Republic and the USA found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased the cover or density of forb species. However, studies of sowing grass seeds alone (action 3397) showed negative impacts: two replicated studies in the USA and Canada found that sowing grass seeds reduced the abundance of native forb species in one study, while the other found no change in native forb density. For shrubs specifically, two replicated studies in the USA and Canada found that sowing grass seeds reduced the abundance of shrub species. Additionally, when examining sowing seeds at higher density (action 3405), one site comparison study in the USA found that sowing grass seeds at higher density reduced the cover of native grassland shrubs. These findings suggest that while sowing a mix of native grasses and forbs can benefit forb abundance, sowing grass seeds alone tends to have neutral to negative effects on native forb and shrub abundance in North American grasslands.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Across 50 studies from Europe, North America, and New Zealand, sowing native grass and forb seeds together consistently increased forb abundance, with three of four replicated studies finding increased forb cover or density when both grasses and forbs were sown together. In contrast, when only grass seeds were sown, evidence from 13 studies across North America, Europe, Canada, and South Africa showed that grass-only sowing reduced native forb abundance in one study and showed no change in forb density in another study. The comparison demonstrates that mixed grass and forb sowing is significantly more effective at establishing forb abundance than grass-only sowing across multiple continents.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the effects of post-seeding management, specifically mowing versus grazing, on grassland vegetation in the UK?\nanswer: Based on the evidence from action documents, several key findings emerge regarding post-seeding management effects on UK grassland vegetation. For mowing management, one UK study (action 3419) found that cutting vegetation yearly after sowing seeds increased plant species richness compared to grazing with livestock, and another UK study found that cutting sown plots each year and removing cut vegetation increased sown grass and forb species richness compared to not removing cut vegetation. Mowing after seeding also increased the richness and abundance of sown forb species in UK studies, with more frequent mowing increasing abundance of multiple sown forb species. For grazing management after seeding, one UK study (action 3423) found that grazing with livestock reduced plant species richness compared to cutting vegetation after sowing, but increased sown species richness when cattle were used instead of sheep. However, cattle grazing reduced the cover of sown species compared to sheep grazing. One UK study found that grazing with livestock after sowing seeds reduced plant species richness compared to cutting vegetation after sowing, while winter grazing resulted in higher survival of cut-leaved cranesbill seedlings. The comparison between mowing and grazing cessation shows that ceasing mowing (action 3957) and ceasing grazing (action 3956) leads to early succession changes, with abandoned grasslands showing different community composition and abundance patterns compared to managed areas.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
