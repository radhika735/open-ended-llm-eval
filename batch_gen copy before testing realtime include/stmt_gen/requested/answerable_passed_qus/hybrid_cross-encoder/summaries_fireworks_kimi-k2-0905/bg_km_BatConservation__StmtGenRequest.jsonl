Only probiotic bacterium treatment has been studied experimentally. Two randomized, controlled studies found that treating little brown bats with a probiotic bacterium increased survival in some contexts (within cages in a laboratory in Canada, and for free-flying bats in the USA), but had no significant effect on survival for caged bats in a mine. Disease symptoms were reduced when treatment occurred at the time of infection, but worsened when treatment was administered 21 days prior to infection. No studies were found evaluating the effectiveness of other commonly proposed strategies, including breeding bats in captivity to supplement populations, treating hibernacula environments to reduce pathogen reservoirs, decontaminating clothing and equipment to prevent pathogen spread, or culling infected bats - meaning their effectiveness remains unassessed.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Evidence shows that green bridges were used by 97% of bats crossing a road in one UK study (action ID 979). However, bat gantries may be less effective, with studies finding that fewer bats used bat gantries than crossed the road below at traffic height, and some gantries were not used at all (action ID 978). Overpasses showed mixed results with some bat species using them but many still crossing the road below at traffic height or other locations (action ID 977). Underpasses and culverts were used by bats in varying proportions across multiple studies, with species adapted to cluttered habitats using smaller culverts more than those adapted to open habitats (action ID 976).

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: To mitigate impacts from onshore wind farms, what are the most effective operational adjustments to turbines to reduce bat fatalities?\nanswer: Evidence from action documents shows several effective operational adjustments to reduce bat fatalities at onshore wind farms. Increasing the wind speed at which turbines become operational ('cut-in speed') was the most extensively studied approach, with 10 of 12 replicated studies in the USA and Canada finding this resulted in fewer bat fatalities (Action 1960). Preventing turbine blades from turning at low wind speeds through 'feathering' also proved effective, with five of six studies showing reduced bat fatalities (Action 970). Automatically reducing turbine blade rotation when bat activity is predicted to be high was effective in both German and US studies, significantly reducing fatalities for all bat species combined and for individual species (Action 971). Slowing turbine blade rotation at low wind speeds was found to reduce bat fatalities in a Canadian study (Action 2939). Ultrasonic deterrents showed mixed results, with some studies finding 21-51% fewer bat fatalities in the first year, but inconsistent results in subsequent years and across different bat species (Action 968).

Regarding general public awareness campaigns (action 162), a review of programs in the USA and Canada argued that education alone was not sufficient to change behavior, although it served as a necessary catalytic factor for economic incentives and law enforcement. While education campaigns for other wildlife groups (reptiles) have shown measurable conservation benefits including increased abundance (Philippine crocodiles), reduced poaching (leatherback turtle nests), and decreased human-caused mortality (Philippine crocodiles), similar evidence is lacking specifically for bat conservation initiatives.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: Besides avoiding illumination entirely, what alternative lighting strategies can be used to minimize disturbance to bats?\nanswer: Besides avoiding illumination entirely, several alternative lighting strategies can minimize disturbance to bats. Red lighting has shown promise, with studies finding that red lighting resulted in higher activity for some bat species compared to white or green lighting, and more soprano pipistrelles emerged from roosts when lit with red light compared to white light (action IDs: 2021). Using ultraviolet filters on lights can also be beneficial, with one study finding that hedges lit with ultraviolet filtered lights had higher soprano pipistrelle activity than those lit with unfiltered light (action ID: 1020). Low intensity lighting is another strategy, with one controlled study in caves finding that low intensity white lights or red lights resulted in fewer bat flights than full white lighting (action ID: 1994). Directing lighting away from bat access points or habitats is recommended as a strategy, though no studies have yet evaluated its effectiveness (action ID: 2019). Using 'warm white' LED lights rather than 'cool' LED lights has been suggested as a potential strategy, though no studies have evaluated this approach (action ID: 2020).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

However, another review found that while Yuma myotis and Mexican free-tailed bats recolonised most maintained roosts in similar numbers, pallid bats did not return after bridge replacement works (Action ID: 1966). Providing alternative roosts showed poor results - bat houses provided during bridge replacement were used by fewer bats than original roosts at one site and not used at all at three sites (Action ID: 2942).

Bat boxes showed variable occupancy rates across 44 studies, with 31 species using them as maternity roosts, though only 18 species used them commonly (action 1024). Design factors significantly influence success: black bat boxes were used more than grey, white, or wooden alternatives (action 1024), and bats showed preferences for specific designs including multi-compartment boxes and concrete versus wooden materials. Position matters - bat box orientation and sunlight exposure affected occupancy, with boxes on buildings having higher occupancy than those on trees (action 1024). Height effects varied between studies, while location type influenced success, with farm forestry sites showing higher occupancy than native forest (action 1024). Artificial caves and hibernacula demonstrated gradual adoption, with one study showing increasing bat numbers over nine years after construction (action 2049). Success was enhanced when artificial roosts were installed in areas where bats were known to roost previously (action 1024).

Placement factors include: orientation and sun exposure (affects occupancy with orientation and sunlight amount being important), height (studies show mixed results with some finding height affects occupancy while others found no effect), location type (higher occupancy on buildings than trees in some studies), habitat context (farm forestry sites vs native forest, pine vs mixed deciduous stands), and prior bat presence (higher occupancy in areas where bats were known to roost before installing boxes). Additional factors include the number of boxes installed (greater numbers across a site increase occupancy likelihood) and microclimate management (modifying roost temperatures can increase bat numbers).

Green bridges appear to be the most effective, with one study finding that a green bridge was used by 97% of bats crossing a road (Action ID 979). Underpasses and culverts have been studied most extensively, with eight studies showing that bats use them in varying proportions depending on factors such as underpass type, height, road width, and surrounding landscape features (Action ID 976). Bat species adapted to cluttered habitats used small culverts and underpasses more than species adapted to open or edge habitats. Overpasses show mixed results, with studies indicating that while some bat species use them, up to three-quarters of bats still cross the road below at traffic height or at other nearby locations - vegetated overpasses with planters were used by two-thirds of crossing bats, while unvegetated overpasses were not used at all (Action ID 977). Bat gantries or bat bridges appear to be the least effective, with studies finding that fewer bats used them than crossed the road below at traffic height, and some gantries were not used at all (Action ID 978). No studies were found evaluating the effectiveness of hop-overs for bats (Action ID 980).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: For arid regions, what is the evidence on the effectiveness of creating or managing water sources to support bat populations?\nanswer: Evidence from five studies shows that creating artificial water sources can be effective for supporting bat populations in arid regions. Five replicated studies across Israel, the USA, Germany, South Africa and Mexico found that bat activity (relative abundance) was similar or higher over reservoirs, waste water treatment pools, heliponds, drainage ditches, retention ponds and farm/cattle ponds compared to natural wetlands, vineyards, forest or grassland/crops (Action 959). For livestock water troughs specifically, two studies in the USA demonstrated that management matters - removing livestock modifications resulted in bats drinking more frequently and approaching troughs fewer times before successfully drinking (Action 1951). One study in Portugal found that small dam reservoirs created greater activity for four bat species than the streams feeding into them (Action 1997). However, no studies were found evaluating the effects of managing natural water bodies to prevent desiccation in arid areas (Action 2027), indicating a knowledge gap in this area.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: In agricultural landscapes, which farming systems are most beneficial for bat populations?\nanswer: Based on the evidence from action documents, organic farming systems (action ID 961) show mixed but generally positive effects on bat populations. Twelve studies found that organic farming resulted in higher bat activity and species richness compared to conventional farming in some cases, with five of nine studies showing higher overall bat activity on organic farms. Agroforestry systems that retain or plant native trees and shrubs amongst crops (action ID 963) showed varied results across eight studies, with some finding higher bat species diversity and abundance in plantations with varied shade cover. Reducing pesticide, herbicide and fertiliser use (action ID 2013) demonstrated positive effects in four studies, with farms using fewer chemicals showing higher bat activity and species diversity. Managing hedges specifically for bats (action ID 1943) showed limited but positive effects in two UK studies, with hedges trimmed less frequently having more bat species and higher activity. However, there is currently no evidence available for several potentially beneficial practices including increasing semi-natural habitat (action ID 1938), retaining remnant forest (action ID 1947), managing ditches for bats (action ID 1944), practicing integrated farm management (action ID 169), or planting in-field trees (action ID 1946).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the outcomes and success rates associated with ex-situ bat conservation actions like captive breeding and rehabilitation?\nanswer: Based on action documents, eight studies evaluated captive breeding effects, showing that 6-100% of female bats captured in the wild successfully conceived, gave birth and reared young in captivity across studies in the USA, UK, Italy and Brazil. Two studies found that two of five and two of three bats born in captivity successfully gave birth to live young. Seven studies found that 20-100% of bat pups born in captivity survived from 10 days to adulthood. However, no studies evaluated the effects of releasing captive-bred bats back to the wild. Four studies evaluated rehabilitation of injured/orphaned bats. One study in Brazil found two hand-reared orphaned greater spear-nosed bats survived over three months in captivity and reached normal species size after 60 days. Two studies in the UK and Italy found 70-90% of hand-reared pipistrelle bats survived 4-14 days after wild release, with six of 21 bats joining wild colonies. One UK study found 13% of ringed hand-reared pipistrelle bats were found alive in bat boxes 38 days to four years after release. Another UK study found bats that flew in large flight cages for longer periods survived longer and were more active after release. Importantly, no studies evaluated breeding bats specifically to supplement wild populations affected by white-nose syndrome.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
