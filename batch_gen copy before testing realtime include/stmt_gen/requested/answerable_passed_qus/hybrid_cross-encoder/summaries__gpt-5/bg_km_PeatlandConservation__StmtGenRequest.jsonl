Burning increased plant species richness or diversity in a fen (USA) and a bog (New Zealand) in replicated, controlled studies (1763), but other studies found plant species richness was reduced or limited in a bog (UK) and fens (USA; with other interventions) (1774), and typically unaffected in a fen (UK; with other interventions) (1763). In fens, burning reduced forb cover and increased sedge/rush cover with no effect on grass cover in one replicated, controlled study (USA), whereas another replicated before-and-after study (UK; with other interventions) reported reduced grass/sedge/rush cover (1763). In bogs, moss cover (including Sphagnum) was higher in plots burned more often in one UK bog, and burning increased moss/lichen/bare ground cover 2\u20137 months after burning in Germany (1774). For herbaceous plants in bogs, burning had no short-term effect on cottongrass in Germany, increased cottongrass after 8\u201318 years in the UK, and resulted in similar cottongrass cover when burned every 10 or 20 years in the same UK bog; burning reduced purple moor grass in Germany and had mixed effects on other grass-like plants and forbs across sites (1774). Vegetation structure responses included more biomass of grass-like plants but less total vegetation, shrub and bryophyte biomass in plots burned more frequently in a UK bog (1774).

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: To maintain disturbance in fens and fen meadows, how does the effect of cutting/mowing compare with using grazing?\nanswer: Across fens and fen meadows, cutting/mowing has been evaluated more extensively (14 studies) than grazing (4 studies) [1759][1762]. Mowing often altered overall plant community composition (six replicated studies) and increased cover of fen- or wet meadow\u2011characteristic plants (four studies); it frequently increased total moss/bryophyte cover (four of six studies), reduced cover/abundance of some herbs (e.g., bindweed, reeds, sedges, purple moor grass, grass\u2011like plants; six replicated studies), sometimes reduced shrub cover (two of three studies), and often increased overall plant species richness (eight studies) [1759]. One study reported that mown fen meadows had similar vegetation structure to grazed meadows [1759]. For grazing, a replicated, paired, site comparison found that overall plant community composition differed between grazed and mown fen meadows, and that grazed meadows contained fewer plant species and fewer fen\u2011characteristic species than mown meadows [1762].

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: To encourage natural revegetation on bare peat, what are the most effective physical and hydrological interventions?\nanswer: Across peatland restoration studies, raising water tables (rewetting) was associated with multiple vegetation gains: increased Sphagnum cover in many cases (12 of 19 studies), increased herbaceous groups such as sedges, cottongrass and rushes in most studies assessing them, reductions or no change in tree/shrub cover, and in some cases higher overall vegetation cover and plant richness, though results varied among sites [1756]. Programmes using multiple restoration interventions (excluding moss layer transfer) increased total moss/bryophyte cover, herb cover (including cottongrass and other graminoids), overall vegetation cover, and shifted communities toward those of natural bogs in some comparisons [1803]. Adding organic mulch after planting often improved outcomes, including higher survival of planted mosses or sedges, increased growth of transplanted sedges, greater vegetation cover (total, mosses/Sphagnum, or vascular plants) after 1\u20133 seasons, and higher germination for some species, though several studies reported no cover effects [1828]. Mulching without planting had limited effects on cover (no change in fen-characteristic plant cover or Sphagnum in two studies) but increased the number of fen-characteristic species present in one study [1813]. Disturbing the peat surface without planting altered community development, led to colonization by wetland/fen-characteristic species, but also promoted weedy species from the seed bank and did not lead to colonization by peat-forming species in one fen [1811].

Covers other than mulch applied after planting had mixed effects: fleece or fibre mats showed positive or no effects on germination depending on species; shading with plastic mesh increased survival of planted mosses and sometimes had no effect or increased survival for some peat swamp tree species; growth responses varied with increases for planted Sphagnum under transparent plastic or shade, reductions for planted fen mosses under shade, and shaded seedlings growing taller and thinner; cover of planted mosses often increased under shade, plastic mesh increased Sphagnum shoot numbers over transparent sheets, but shading sometimes had no effect on overall vegetation cover (1829). Adding inorganic fertilizer before/after planting sometimes increased survival of planted tree species but in other cases had no effect or reduced survival; fertilizer typically increased growth of planted mosses, herbs or trees but sometimes had no effect, and in a nursery it typically had no effect on peat swamp tree seedlings; vegetation cover often increased (total vegetation, vascular plants, bryophytes), though responses varied with increases in sedge but not total vegetation or Sphagnum in one study, and increases for a sown shrub and rush depending on fertilizer chemistry and peat preparation (1826). Liming before/after planting reduced survival of planted fen herbs but increased survival of planted fen mosses; growth often did not increase and was reduced for Sphagnum and many peat swamp tree seedlings, though growth of planted fen mosses increased in one study; cover of sown mosses increased in one study, but liming had no effect on total vegetation, vascular plant or bryophyte cover in another (1825). Adding fresh peat before planting increased cover of two sown plant species compared to tilled bog surface, but for one species this benefit was cancelled by fertilization (1837).

For birds, management to maintain traditional water meadows increased numbers or territories of some waders (northern lapwing, common redshank, black\u2011tailed godwit), but common snipe declined on managed sites, and productivity of northern lapwings on grazed meadows was too low to sustain populations in most sites studied (696).\n- For butterflies, species richness and abundance were similar between wet meadows managed by annual autumn mowing and by light cattle/horse grazing; starting cattle grazing reduced bog fritillary emergence and use in one case, while intermediate\u2011intensity cattle grazing had higher marsh fritillary caterpillar web abundance than low or high intensity, and occupancy by marsh fritillary caterpillars was similar across grazed, burned, and unmanaged fen meadows (3971).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Following removal, cover of wetland- or peatland\u2011characteristic plants often increased over 4\u201313 years, and fen\u2011characteristic plant richness increased in one replicated comparison [1809]. Rush, reed, or sedge cover commonly increased within 2\u20136 years, while purple moor grass cover decreased for 2\u20135 years in two controlled studies; one study found no effect on sedge or bentgrass cover after five years [1809]. Vegetation biomass was reduced for up to 18 years in two studies, though another study reported no effect after four years [1809]. Total plant species richness frequently increased over 2\u201318 years, though results were mixed across sites and studies, and richness increased over time after stripping in one study [1809]. Disturbing the peat surface (without planting) altered plant community development over 2\u20133 years; in one study, disturbance promoted greater cover of weedy seed\u2011bank species, and in another, disturbed and undisturbed communities diverged over time [1811]. Disturbed plots saw colonization by wetland/fen\u2011characteristic species in both studies, but peat\u2011forming species did not colonize in one fen [1811]. Reprofiling degraded bogs (without planting) produced plant communities different from nearby natural fens and resulted in lower Sphagnum, other moss, and vascular plant cover after five years [1807].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the documented effects of using different physical interventions like mowing, cutting, or complete removal to manage unwanted vegetation in fens?\nanswer: Across 14 studies in fens and fen meadows, mowing/cutting herbaceous plants altered plant community composition in most cases and often increased plant species richness; effects on characteristic fen plants and mosses were frequently positive, while single cuts typically showed little or no effect on richness, bryophytes, shrubs, or vegetation height; herb cover of several groups (e.g., reeds, sedges, purple moor grass) was often reduced, though one study reported sedge increases when combined with other interventions (1759). Changing the season of mowing in a fen meadow produced similar community shifts across spring, summer, and autumn in one study, but another study in a mixed peatland found different community types after summer vs. winter mowing; in the fen meadow, species richness increased more with summer mowing over two years (1771). Removing plant litter in a fen and a fen meadow did not change overall community composition; one fen study reported no effect on bryophyte or tall moor grass cover, while a fen meadow study reported increased species richness and diversity but another fen study found no change in vascular plant diversity (1760). Cutting/removing shrubs or trees in fens was associated with plant communities becoming more like target fen meadows and increases in fen meadow species abundance in a Polish fen; in a forested fen in the USA, cutting and removing trees increased herb cover but did not change shrub cover, and increased herb biomass and height in a peat swamp (1761). Where tree removal was combined with rewetting, studies in fens reported mixed or small changes in overall plant community composition, increases in wetland-characteristic plants, mixed effects on Sphagnum and other mosses, frequent increases in herb cover (including sedges and cottongrasses), increased ground vegetation height in one study, and mixed results for overall richness/diversity (1732).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the alternatives to completely removing livestock from degraded agricultural peatlands, and how do their effects compare?\nanswer: Identified alternatives to completely removing livestock include: reducing grazing intensity and changing the season/timing of grazing. Reducing grazing intensity: One replicated, paired, controlled study in UK bogs found greater total vegetation and shrub cover where grazing intensity was lower, with cottongrass cover greater for one species and unaffected for another, and higher vegetation biomass where grazing intensity was lower [1735]. Changing season/timing: No studies were found that evaluated effects on peatland vegetation of changing the season or timing of grazing [1737]. For comparison, excluding or removing livestock: Across ten studies (mostly in bogs, plus fens and an unspecified peatland), plant community composition showed no effect in one UK study and no effect in wetter areas but a shift toward dry moorland plants in drier areas in another UK study; herb cover typically showed no effect on key groups including cottongrasses (five of five studies) and sedges (two of two), with one poor fen in Spain reporting increased rush cover after cattle exclusion alongside other interventions and one Chilean site comparison reporting increased overall herb cover alongside other interventions; Sphagnum moss cover typically showed no effect in replicated studies in the UK and Australia, with one poor fen in Spain reporting Sphagnum appearing after exclusion and rewetting; shrub cover showed no effect in several replicated UK and Australian studies, increased heather cover in drier areas in one UK study, and increased shrub cover in three studies including UK bogs, USA fens, and a Chilean peatland; total vegetation, shrub, and bryophyte biomass increased while grass-like herb biomass did not change in one replicated, paired, controlled UK bog study [1734].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Specifically, no studies were found for reducing harvest frequency [1743]; using low impact harvesting techniques [1745]; using specialized low impact vehicles [1746]; implementing mosaic management during harvesting [1747]; providing new technologies (e.g., fuel\u2011efficient stoves) to reduce pressure on wild resources [1748]; restricting vehicle use on peatlands [1749]; and allowing sustainable use of peatlands [1801].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
