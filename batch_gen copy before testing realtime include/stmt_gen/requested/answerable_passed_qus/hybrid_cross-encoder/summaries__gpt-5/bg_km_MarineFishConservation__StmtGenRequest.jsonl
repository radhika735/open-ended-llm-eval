In MPAs with zonation, no-fishing/no-entry zones had higher species numbers than partially fished zones and unprotected areas after 10\u201315 years (2674), and greater fish biomass/abundance than fished zones and outside areas after 3\u201327 years, though effects varied by fish group, size, reef region, and protection level (2674).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What gear modifications are available to reduce the unwanted catch of cod and haddock in the North Sea?\nanswer: Evidence from North Sea studies indicates several trawl-gear modifications are available to reduce unwanted catches of cod and haddock. A separator trawl separated unwanted cod into a lower codend where a larger mesh allowed more smaller cod to escape (2711). Topless (coverless) trawls reduced unwanted Atlantic cod, and reduced unwanted larger haddock but not smaller haddock, while larger cod reductions occurred only in one of two cases (2712). Size\u2011sorting escape grids fitted to trawl nets reduced unwanted sizes of cod and other non\u2011target fish including haddock in multiple regions that include the North Sea, and in North Sea/Norwegian Sea studies grids improved size\u2011selection for haddock though not consistently for cod, with one study finding no improvement versus square\u2011mesh windows (2720). Fitting mesh escape panels/windows (square or large diamond) to trawl nets reduced unwanted catches including cod and haddock in several North Sea studies, and reviews/experiments reported improved size\u2011selectivity for Atlantic cod and haddock, with effects varying by panel design and position (2716).

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: How do mesh escape panels, size-sorting grids, and large supported openings compare in their effectiveness at improving size-selectivity in trawl nets?\nanswer: Across trawl fisheries, size-sorting escape grids frequently reduced unwanted fish catches and sometimes improved size-selectivity: in fish trawls, grids reduced undersized or non-target catches in most studies and improved size-selection for haddock in some cases but not for saithe or cod, and did not outperform square-mesh escape windows in one comparison [2720]; in prawn/shrimp trawls, grids often reduced unwanted fish (including sharks) across multiple regions, though effects varied by species, site, year, and grid type, with several studies finding no reduction or mixed outcomes [2721]. Large, supported escape openings (e.g., Fisheyes, Bigeyes, radial sections) generally reduced unwanted fish and total unwanted catch in most trials, with species-specific results (e.g., fewer unwanted Chinook salmon in both opening designs tested, mixed effects for widow rockfish), and one study reported reduced unwanted sharks but not rays or sawfish compared to standard nets [2723]. Mesh escape panels/windows showed mixed effects: modifying panel position/size sometimes improved size-selectivity for haddock and whiting while effects for cod were similar to standard trawls, and reductions in unwanted catches were inconsistent across species and studies [2717]. Combining devices tended to enhance selectivity and bycatch reduction: panels/windows plus grids reduced unwanted fish, rays, sharks, and total discards in several studies and increased size-selectivity of whiting, with escape occurring via either device depending on species/size [2727]; grids combined with large supported openings reduced unwanted fish and sharks/rays in most studies, with exceptions (no reduction in sharks in one study; no reduction in sawfish) [2726].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

In the Mediterranean, areas closed to all bottom\u2011towed gears for 14 years showed higher biomass and larger sizes of adult red mullet and increased recruitment of young red mullet compared to before closure or to fished areas [2673]. In the North Atlantic, an area closed to bottom trawling did not show higher recruitment or survival of young haddock seven years after closure compared to a trawled area [2673], whereas other closures that prohibited mobile and static bottom gears for 5\u201315 years reported cod with better growth and higher numbers of larger and older individuals than in openly fished areas [2654]. For benthic invertebrates, North Sea sites (part of the North Atlantic) closed to trawling for 15 years had different community composition and higher diversity than trawled sites [2099], while Mediterranean sites closed for 20 years had different composition but showed no differences in overall invertebrate diversity or abundance compared to trawled sites in one study [2099]. Evidence from studies conducted across multiple regions, including the Indian Ocean, indicates that effects on fish size in areas prohibiting bottom\u2011towed gears varied between fish groups and with habitat type, and in some cases closures had no effect on average fish weight or on combined fish and invertebrate sizes [2673].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

For topless trawls, four replicated, controlled studies reported mixed but often positive effects: reduced catches of unwanted Atlantic cod and discards of commercial species in some trials, size\u2010dependent reductions for haddock (larger fish reduced, smaller not), and reductions for only one of four commercial species in another case (2712). For separator trawls, two studies reported targeted reductions via gear design: one randomized North Sea study showed unwanted cod were directed into a lower codend with larger mesh that allowed more smaller cod to escape, and another Atlantic study found that adding a square\u2011mesh escape panel reduced catches of one of two unwanted fish species in a crustacean fishery (2711).

A Northeast Atlantic tagging study reported adult cod spent nearly a third of their time inside a seasonally closed spawning area during implementation (2664). In the North Sea, fixed temporary closures had little effect on cod fishing effort, whereas real-time area closures reduced the annual amount of cod caught (retained and discarded) (2664). In targeted fisheries, catch rates of red mullet and total catch (fish and invertebrates combined) increased after temporary closures over 10 years, but not European hake (2664); another Atlantic before-and-after, site comparison found no change in cod catches over nine years (2664). During a grouper closure, spear-fisher catches of herbivores increased, indicating a shift in targeting (2664). Long-term closures: Across five studies, replicated before-and-after work in the Norwegian Sea found higher weights of young salmon (but similar or lower weights of older salmon) after long-term closure of a commercial coastal fishery, and more young salmon (but similar older salmon) returning to rivers compared to before (2655). Site comparisons found mixed abundance responses: higher abundance for only one of seven species and lower monkfish abundance inside year-round groundfish closures of six\u2013eight years (2655). In the North Sea, lesser sandeel biomass and density peaked but did not show an overall increase three years after long-term closure, and annual sandeel catches varied after an indefinite closure (2655). Inside an area closed to customary fishing for eight years, six of seven species had reduced flight response distance (2655).

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the most effective spatial management actions for protecting spawning fish and their habitats?\nanswer: Evidence from 79 studies indicates that prohibiting all fishing in marine protected areas (no\u2011take MPAs) is associated in many cases with higher fish abundance/biomass, higher species richness, larger fish sizes, increased egg production for targeted species, greater use of protected areas by sharks and commercially important reef fishes, reduced fishing mortality for tagged fishes, higher stock biomass, and in some cases elevated catch rates near reserve boundaries, although effects can vary by species, habitat, and enforcement [2682]. Protecting spawning fish from capture via seasonal or permanent closures shows mixed population outcomes: a North Atlantic before\u2011after comparison found no increase in cod spawning stock biomass, survival, or size and no change in commercial catches over nine years, while tracking showed substantial use of closed spawning/nursery areas by cod and juvenile sharks, and a seasonal grouper closure shifted spear\u2011fishing effort toward herbivores [2938]. Establishing temporary fishery closures similarly showed no cod biomass, survival, or size increase over nine years in one Atlantic study, but tagged cod spent about one\u2011third of time inside a seasonal spawning closure during implementation, real\u2011time area closures reduced annual cod caught, some targeted fisheries showed increased catch rates after closures, and spear\u2011fishers targeted herbivores more during a grouper closure [2664]. Areas allowing only periodic fishing had greater fish biomass than openly fished areas and similar biomass to permanently closed areas, with higher catch rates than open areas over 18 months to six years [2679].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: How does the effectiveness of no-take marine protected areas on fish communities differ between the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean?\nanswer: Across studies of no\u2011take marine protected areas, 15 studies were in the Indian Ocean and 12 in the Mediterranean Sea [2682]. In both regions, site comparisons reported different fish community composition in no\u2011take areas versus fished areas after 3\u201316 years [2682]. For richness/diversity, studies including both regions often found higher species richness in no\u2011take areas, but one replicated Indian Ocean study found the effect on species richness/diversity after 15 years varied with sampling method [2682]. For abundance, multiple studies across regions (including the Mediterranean and Indian Oceans) reported higher fish abundance or biomass in no\u2011take areas, while other studies found similar or mixed effects depending on species, trophic position, size, habitat, or protection duration [2682]. Region\u2011specific findings included: Mediterranean\u2014more eggs of four commercially targeted fish species inside a no\u2011take reserve enforced for three years, and higher small\u2011scale commercial catch rates closest to a 22\u2011year no\u2011take reserve, decreasing with distance [2682]; Indian Ocean\u2014higher fish grazing rates in no\u2011take areas protected for 1 and 24 years, highest reef\u2011fish stock biomass in enforced no\u2011take areas compared to other management regimes, and most individuals of five fish species remaining within a no\u2011take reserve over nine years [2682].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
