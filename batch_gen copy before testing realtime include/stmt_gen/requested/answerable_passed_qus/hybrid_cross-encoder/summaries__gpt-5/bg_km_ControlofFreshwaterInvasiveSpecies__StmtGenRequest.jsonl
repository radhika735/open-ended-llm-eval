For parrot\u2019s feather, lab and field results show differing efficacy by chemical and over time: endothall reduced growth in lab but field cover decreased only shortly after treatment before returning toward pre-treatment levels [1681]; dichlobenil reduced growth but was less effective than a 2,4\u2011D+MCPA mix at 8 days and early cover reductions often rebounded by 45 days [1699]; 2,4\u2011D reduced growth more than diquat, glyphosate, or imazapyr in lab, 2,4\u2011D amine reduced biomass in field, and combinations (2,4\u2011D+MCPA; 2,4\u2011D+carfentrazone\u2011ethyl) achieved higher short\u2011term reductions or elimination, though some advantages diminished by 45 days [1606, 1699]. Some herbicides (fluridone, clopyralid, copper chelate) did not reduce growth, while others (imazamox, imazapyr, flumioxazin, florpyrauxifen\u2011benzyl, glufosinate\u2011ammonium, glyphosate) reduced growth or biomass in certain studies [1699]. For water primrose, triclopyr TEA at 0.25% killed 100% of young cultivated plants within two months; glyphosate achieved 97\u2013100% mortality when mixed with specific sticking agents (non\u2011oil based or TopFilm); halosulfuron\u2011methyl reduced coverage without apparent rice toxicity, indicating adjuvants, concentration, plant age, and crop selectivity considerations affect outcomes [1139]. Combining herbicides with mechanical removal improved control, with glyphosate plus a surfactant (Cygnet\u2011Plus) followed by mechanical removal yielding a 75% kill, and integrated programs reducing coverage by 85\u201390% [1140]. For skunk cabbage, outcomes differed by active ingredient and dose: one UK study reported both glyphosate and 2,4\u2011D amine killed all plants, while another found 2,4\u2011D amine at 9 L/ha eradicated plants but glyphosate was unsuccessful beyond limited growth reduction [1102].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
