[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the overall effects of altering pesticide application strategies to benefit natural enemies?\nanswer: Evidence indicates several pesticide strategy changes can increase natural enemies, though effects often vary by group, time and context. Spraying insecticides earlier in the season was associated with more natural enemies in one UK study [723]. Using threshold-based spraying increased natural enemy numbers in two of three years in a Finnish study, with effects lasting as little as three weeks [750]. Delaying herbicide applications increased natural enemies in two randomized, replicated, controlled trials, though benefits differed among enemy groups and were fewer early in the season [774]. Broad reductions in chemical inputs often benefited invertebrates, but multiple studies also reported mixed, minimal or no effects [139]; specifically for butterflies and moths, reduced or less frequent chemical inputs were frequently linked to higher richness and/or abundance, with some studies finding similar levels to conventional management [3897]. Incorporating parasitism rates into insecticide thresholds produced acceptable pest damage levels, but effects on natural enemy populations were not monitored [726]. Experimental conversions to organic farming often increased natural enemies in 8 of 12 studies, but several studies found no, inconsistent or negative effects, and responses varied by enemy group and over time [717].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What is the evidence for the effectiveness of manipulating field structure by adding linear features like hedges, beetle banks, or alley cropping?\nanswer: Evidence for linear features shows mixed but often positive ecological effects, with variable pest and yield outcomes. Alley cropping: Across four replicated/controlled studies, effects on parasitism varied by site, date, pest stage or alley width, with two studies finding no effect; fungal infection effects were mixed and egg predation was lower in one study; natural enemies included more wasps and spiders but fewer ladybirds in one trial, with hedge tree types influencing some groups; pest numbers increased in two studies, decreased in one, and varied by group/year in another; crop damage increased in one study and showed no effect in another; weeds showed mixed responses; yields were lower in a USA study and similar or lower in a Philippines study; costs were lower but profits also lower in a USA study [718]. Hedges: Two studies (France, UK) found newly planted hedges had higher beetle/spider abundance, richness or diversity than crop fields or field margins, and vascular plant diversity was higher than in recently established grass margins; a review reported newly established hedges supported more ground beetles than older hedges; a literature review reported lower pest outbreaks with new hedges; arthropod diversity varied among seven hedge plant species; an unreplicated German study found 2/85 ground beetle species used new hedges as dispersal stepping stones and passive movers (e.g., snails) benefited most; local hawthorn provenance grew better and was more stock-proof than eight other provenances [538]. Additional hedge evidence: One RCT in China found no effect of hedges on spiders in crops; studies from France/China reported more natural enemies in hedges than adjacent crops or context-dependent effects by crop, hedge species and year; two RCTs (France, Kenya) found natural enemy abundance in hedges depended on shrub/tree species and varied among enemy groups; nematode responses to hedges in Kenya varied among groups; crops included barley, beans, maize and wheat [752]. Beetle banks: For adjacent crops, a review found predator increases, while individual studies showed time-dependent or no effects; two studies observed small/slow predator movements from banks to crops; greater beetle activity in fields did not improve predation in one study; on banks, four studies and a review found more invertebrate predators than in crops, though effects sometimes varied seasonally; compared with other refuge habitats, results ranged from more predators on banks (sometimes seasonally) to similar or lower numbers; pest reductions were greatest nearest banks or on banks in one RCT and a review, and a review found fewer pests in fields with banks; an RCT and a review indicated potential economic savings if banks prevent pests reaching spray thresholds or causing 5% yield loss; certain grass species supported higher predator numbers [729]. Beetle banks and Lepidoptera: compared to hedgerows, butterfly richness and adult abundance were lower on beetle banks, while beetle banks and agri-environment field margins had higher richness and abundance of micro-moths than conventionally managed margins; caterpillar abundance on beetle banks was similar to margins, crop fields and other edge habitats [3927]. Beetle banks and mammals: harvest mouse nest densities were higher on beetle banks than on field margins [2393]. Hedges and Lepidoptera: established hedgerows had higher butterfly and macro\u2011moth species richness than in\u2011field beetle banks, crops or pasture in three of four studies; butterfly/moth abundance was higher along hedgerows than beetle banks, grass margins without hedgerows, field interiors, or 5\u201310 m away from hedgerows in five of six studies; gorse, oak and blackthorn planted within hedgerows supported more arthropod species, including caterpillars, than commonly planted hawthorn; moths near hedgerows were more likely to fly parallel to them [3976].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
