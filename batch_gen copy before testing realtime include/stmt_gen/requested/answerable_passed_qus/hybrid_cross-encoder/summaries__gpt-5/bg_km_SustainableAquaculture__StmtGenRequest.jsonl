[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What factors influence the success of non-pesticide methods for controlling sea lice on salmon farms?\nanswer: Evidence indicates that outcomes depend on the specific method and implementation: the effectiveness of cleaner wrasse varies by species, with one controlled study finding corkwing and goldsinny wrasse as effective as chemical treatments while another found rockcook wrasse ineffective at preventing outbreaks [738]. Light regime matters, with lower lice counts under natural or low\u2011intensity artificial light, and higher counts as artificial light intensity increases [741]. Farm management through fallowing has been associated with lower lice numbers on Atlantic salmon in at least one study [1026]. Nutritional and immunostimulant strategies can reduce lice infection levels, including a diet with 28% plant-based protein and additional reductions when beta\u2011glucans are added, compared with controls [732].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: In Norway, how do different plant-based feed alternatives, such as vegetable oils versus plant proteins, affect salmon growth and body composition?\nanswer: Across studies that included Norway, plant-protein diets sometimes reduced growth rates compared to fish meal, though some studies reported similar growth rates (924). Reduced final body weights were reported in replicated, controlled studies conducted in Norway and Scotland, while two Norwegian studies found similar final weights between plant-protein and fish-meal diets (924). In Norway, feeding efficiency responses to plant proteins were mixed, with two replicated, controlled studies showing lower efficiency and one replicated study showing higher efficiency compared to fish-meal diets; some other studies reported similar efficiency (924). For vegetable oils in Norway, multiple replicated studies found growth rates similar to fish-oil diets, one study found higher growth on vegetable oils, and one controlled study showed family-dependent higher or lower growth on vegetable oils (926). Norwegian studies reported similar average final body weights between fish-oil and vegetable-oil diets (926). Body composition responses with vegetable oils included salmon flesh fatty-acid profiles reflecting dietary oil source in Norway and Scotland, higher liver lipid and lower plasma lipoprotein on vegetable-oil diets in a Norwegian study, and lower flesh pigment concentration with vegetable oils alongside similar gaping, texture, and liquid-holding capacity in Norwegian product-quality tests (926).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the documented effects, both positive and negative, of replacing fish meal with plant-based proteins in Atlantic salmon diets?\nanswer: Across studies, replacing fish meal with plant-based proteins in Atlantic salmon diets was associated with decreased growth rates in six studies, while three studies found similar growth to fish meal diets (924). Four studies reported reduced final body weight with plant-based protein diets, whereas two found similar final body weight to fish meal diets (924). Feeding efficiency was lowered in two studies, increased in one, and similar in two others when using plant-based proteins (924). Digestibility of feed components was lower in two studies with plant proteins, but similar in two other studies (924). Two studies reported no effect on survival or appetite (924). Distal intestine morphology was altered in two studies with plant-based proteins (924). Condition increased in one study but was reduced in two others with plant-based protein diets (924). Additionally, two replicated studies found similar final weights across diets containing low, medium, or high levels of fish meal (915).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

A replicated, controlled study in Norway found salmon fed a diet with 28% plant-based protein had 28% fewer lice infections than controls, and adding beta-glucans decreased lice infection levels by a further 28%; mannan oligosaccharides also improved gut function by preventing soybean-induced enteritis (732).
