[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What evidence exists for the effectiveness of different strategies to combat white-nose syndrome in bats?\nanswer: Based on the action documents, very limited evidence exists for the effectiveness of strategies to combat white-nose syndrome in bats. The only strategy with documented evidence is treating bats with probiotic bacteria (Action 2008). Two studies evaluated probiotic treatment effects: one randomized, controlled study in Canada found that treating little brown bats with a probiotic bacterium at the time of infection with white-nose syndrome increased survival within cages in a laboratory, and one randomized, controlled study in the USA found that treating little brown bats with a probiotic bacterium within a mine increased survival for free-flying bats, but not caged bats (Action 2008). Regarding disease symptoms, the Canadian study found that little brown bats treated with a probiotic bacterium at the time of infection had reduced symptoms of the disease, but bats treated 21 days prior to infection had worse symptoms, while the USA study found that little brown bats kept within cages in a mine and treated with a probiotic bacterium had a similar severity of white-nose syndrome to untreated bats (Action 2008). For all other potential strategies, no studies were found that evaluated their effectiveness, including: culling infected bats (Action 1012), vaccination against the pathogen (Action 1011), captive breeding to supplement affected populations (Action 2009), treating hibernacula environments to reduce pathogen reservoir (Action 2007), decontaminating clothing and equipment (Action 2006), and restricting human access to caves (Action 1010).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: To mitigate the impact of road and railway developments, what structures can be installed to help bats cross safely?\nanswer: Several types of crossing structures can be installed to help bats cross roads and railways safely. Green bridges show promise, with one study in the UK finding that a green bridge was used by 97% of bats crossing a road (action 979). Underpasses and culverts are widely used, with eight studies across Germany, Ireland, the UK, Australia and France finding that bats used underpasses and culverts below roads in varying proportions, with use influenced by underpass type and height, road width, and surrounding landscape features (action 976). Overpasses are another option, with studies in Ireland and France finding that two or three bat species used overpasses, though up to three-quarters of bats still crossed at traffic height or at other nearby locations (action 977). One UK study found that an overpass with planters was used by two-thirds of crossing bats, while an unvegetated overpass was not used (action 977). Bat gantries or bat bridges have shown mixed results, with UK studies finding fewer bats used gantries than crossed below at traffic height, and one gantry was not used at all, while a French study found a temporary gantry was used by three bat species but almost half of crossing bats flew over the road at other locations (action 978). Additionally, bats can be diverted to safe crossing points using plantings or fencing, with one controlled study in Switzerland finding that up to one fifth of lesser horseshoe bats flew along an artificial hedgerow to commute (action 981).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Increasing the wind speed at which turbines become operational (cut-in speed) has been evaluated in twelve studies, with ten of twelve studies finding that this operational change resulted in fewer bat fatalities than at conventionally operated turbines (Action 1960). Preventing turbine blades from turning at low wind speeds, known as 'feathering', has been tested in six studies, with five of six studies finding that this practice resulted in fewer bat fatalities than at conventionally operated turbines (Action 970). Additionally, slowing the rotation of turbine blades at low wind speeds has been evaluated, with one study finding that bat fatalities were reduced when turbine blades were slowed at low wind speeds (Action 2939). These operational adjustments focus on reducing turbine activity during low wind conditions when bats are most active and vulnerable to turbine strikes.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

For fruit orchard protection, action 1953 documents effective measures including organic deterrent sprays, hanging plastic flags in trees, covering individual tree branches with nylon net bags to reduce damage to lychees caused by Madagascan flying foxes or Mauritius fruit bats, and ringing bells in lychee trees to deter most Madagascan flying foxes. For wind turbine conflicts, action 968 shows that ultrasonic deterrents can reduce bat fatalities, with studies finding 21-51% fewer bats killed at turbines with ultrasonic deterrents in some cases, though results were mixed across different species and study years. Roost management approaches include creating alternative bat roosts within developments (action 949), where purpose-built roosts like bat boxes or bat lofts/barns were used by bats at 13-74% of development sites, though new roosts were four times less likely to be used than retained roosts. Exclusion methods during building work (action 1930) have been documented, with one study finding that excluding bats from roosts within buildings did not change roost switching frequency or foraging behaviors of soprano pipistrelle colonies. The documents also reference actions for replacing culling with non-lethal methods for preventing vampire bats from spreading rabies to livestock (action 1950) and humans (action 1979), and educating farmers and communities to reduce indiscriminate culling (action 2044), though no studies were found that directly evaluated these specific approaches.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: Besides avoiding illumination entirely, what alternative lighting strategies can be used to minimize disturbance to bats?\nanswer: Several alternative lighting strategies can be used to minimize disturbance to bats beyond avoiding illumination entirely. Red lighting shows promise as an alternative, with studies finding that more soprano pipistrelles emerged from a roost when lit with red light than when lit with white light (Action 2021). Additionally, one study found that using low intensity white lights or red lights in caves resulted in fewer bat flights than with full white lighting (Action 1994). Ultraviolet filtering is another effective strategy, with one study finding that hedges lit with ultraviolet filtered lights had higher soprano pipistrelle activity than hedges lit with unfiltered light (Action 1020). Shielding lights can also reduce impacts, with studies on shielded \"full cut-off\" lights showing that fewer individual moths and moth species were attracted to lights fitted with blinds to prevent light scattering along with filters to remove shorter wavelengths than to conventional lights (Action 3904). This is relevant for bats since many species feed on insects attracted to lights. Studies also demonstrate the importance of avoiding illumination of specific areas, particularly commuting routes, with research showing that 28-96% of pond bats changed their flight paths along canals to avoid light spill from lamps, and that lesser horseshoe bats and myotis bats had greater activity along unlit hedges than along hedges illuminated with street lights (Action 2017).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly.

Actions include retaining access points for bats following mine closures (Action 1962), excluding bats from roosts prior to mine reclamation (Action 1961), and reopening entrances to closed mines and making them suitable for roosting bats (Action 1965). Maintaining microclimate in closed/abandoned mines is another approach, with one study in the USA finding that modifying the microclimate of an abandoned mine by closing a man-made entrance resulted in a greater number of bats hibernating within the mine (Action 1964). \n\nFor cases where mines cannot be preserved as bat habitat, providing artificial subterranean bat roosts to replace roosts in reclaimed mines (Action 974) and relocating bats from reclaimed mines to alternative subterranean roost sites (Action 975) are potential mitigation measures. Creating artificial caves or hibernacula for bats has shown some success, with studies in the UK and Germany finding that artificial hibernacula were used by up to four bat species, and the number of bats using an artificial hibernaculum increased in each of nine years after it was built (Action 2049).\n\nInstalling and maintaining gates at mine entrances to restrict public access while allowing bat access is another conservation approach. However, nine studies found mixed results: while 43 of 47 mines continued to be used 12 years after gates were installed, bats abandoned four mines with 'ladder' design gates, and gate installation resulted in fewer bat species entering mines and altered bat behavior at mine entrances (Action 1963).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the most effective legislative actions for protecting bats and their habitats?\nanswer: The most effective legislative action for protecting bats and their habitats, based on available evidence, is legally protecting bat habitats (Action 2045). Studies show that protected areas generally have higher bat activity and species diversity compared to unprotected areas. Specifically, four studies found higher overall bat activity, higher activity of three of six bat species/species groups, and a greater number of bats in protected sites and forests than unprotected sites and forests. One study found that protected sites had a greater number of bat species than unprotected sites. Additionally, the activity of Daubenton's bats was higher over rivers on farms in protected areas than in unprotected areas, and common noctule bat activity was higher in protected forests than unprotected forests. The distributions of 10 of 11 bat species overlapped with areas designated to protect them significantly more than by chance. However, for other potential legislative actions such as legally protecting bat species (Action 2037), introducing legislation to control hunting of bats (Action 984), regulating bat guano harvesting (Action 987), and enforcing regulations to prevent bat trafficking and trade (Action 1971), no studies were found that evaluated their effectiveness on bat populations.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: For bat conservation related to transportation infrastructure, what are the documented benefits and limitations of providing or retaining roosts in bridges and culverts?\nanswer: Based on the available evidence, creating spaces for roosting bats in road bridges showed mixed success with recolonization occurring at four of eight sites in similar or greater numbers to the original roosts (Action 1967). When maintaining existing bat roosts during road bridge repair work, results were species-specific: a maternity colony of Daubenton's bats continued to roost in similar numbers after crevices were retained, and Yuma myotis and Mexican free-tailed bats recolonised most roosts in similar numbers, but pallid bats did not return (Action 1966). The key limitation identified was that alternative bat roosts provided during bridge replacement works were significantly less effective, with bat houses being used by fewer Mexican free-tailed bats than the original roost at one site and not used at all at three sites (Action 2942).

Microclimate management is a key factor - one before-and-after study in Spain found more bats in two artificial roosts within buildings after they had been modified to reduce internal roost temperatures (Action 2052). However, temperature management shows mixed results, as one replicated, before-and-after study in the UK found that heated bat boxes were used by common pipistrelle bats at only one of seven sites, but none were used by maternity colonies (Action 2052). Site location appears important - one review in the USA found that spaces created in road bridges for roosting bats to replace those lost during bridge works were recolonized by bats in similar or greater numbers to the original roosts at four of eight sites (Action 1967). Artificial hibernacula show promise, with one study in the UK finding that the number of bats using an artificial hibernaculum increased in each of nine years after it was built, and multiple studies in Germany and the UK found that artificial hibernacula were used by up to four bat species (Action 2049). Success rates for bat boxes and alternative roosts vary significantly - three studies found that bat boxes or bat lofts/barns were used by bats at 13-74% of development sites, and three of five before-and-after studies found that bat colonies used purpose-built roosts in higher or similar numbers after the original roosts were destroyed, while two other studies found that bats used purpose-built roosts in lower numbers than the original roost (Action 949).

Preventing turbine blades from turning at low wind speeds ('feathering') has been shown effective, with five of six studies in the USA and Canada finding that feathering resulted in fewer bat fatalities than at conventionally operated turbines (Action 970). Slowing the rotation of turbine blades at low wind speeds is another alternative, with one replicated, randomized, controlled study in Canada finding that bat fatalities were reduced when turbine blades were slowed at low wind speeds (Action 2939). \n\nAutomatically reducing turbine blade rotation when bat activity is high has proven effective, with two studies in Germany and the USA showing that automatically reducing rotation speed when bat activity is predicted to be high resulted in fewer bat fatalities for all bat species combined and for five bat species (Action 971). Deterring bats from turbines using ultrasound shows mixed results, with three studies in the USA finding varied effectiveness - one study found 21-51% fewer bats killed in the first year but mixed results in the second year, while other studies found ultrasonic deterrents reduced fatalities for some but not all bat species (Action 968). \n\nAdditional operational modifications include applying textured coating to turbines, though one study in the USA found this did not reduce bat activity or observations (Action 1957).

For reducing pesticide, herbicide or fertiliser use, four studies from Mexico, Portugal, Germany and Colombia were found (Action 2013). These studies found that farms using few or no chemicals had different compositions of bat species, higher diversity of insect-eating bat species, more bat species recorded over grassland, higher overall bat activity, and improved body condition in great fruit-eating bats compared to areas with high chemical inputs. For organic farming instead of conventional farming, twelve studies were found from Europe, USA, Canada and Chile (Action 961). Results were mixed, with five of seven studies finding no difference in bat species richness between organic and non-organic farms, while two studies found more species on organic farms. For bat abundance, five of nine studies found no difference, while four studies found higher bat activity, feeding activity, and activity of specific species on organic farms. However, for several related actions there is no evidence available: no studies were found evaluating the effects of preventing pollution from agricultural land or forestry from entering watercourses (Action 2015), planting riparian buffer strips (Action 2016), or educating pest controllers about illegal pesticide use in bat roosts (Action 2043).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What design and placement factors influence the successful use of bat boxes by bats?\nanswer: Based on the evidence from multiple studies, several key design and placement factors influence the successful use of bat boxes by bats. Regarding design factors, bat box color significantly affects usage, with bats using black bat boxes more than grey, white or wooden boxes (action 1024). Box size matters, as one of two studies found higher occupancy rates in larger bat boxes (action 1024). Material choice influences occupancy timing, with resin bat boxes becoming occupied more quickly than wood boxes, though both materials are used by bats (action 1024). Concrete bat boxes showed higher occupancy rates than wooden ones (action 1024). Design complexity also affects usage, with bat boxes having two compartments being occupied by more bats than single compartment boxes during breeding season, and standard and four/five chamber bat boxes being occupied by breeding colonies while flat bat boxes were used by individuals (action 1024). For placement factors, orientation and sunlight exposure affect bat occupancy according to three studies, though one study found orientation had no significant effect (action 1024). Height influences occupancy according to two studies, while two other studies found no effect of height (action 1024). Location type is important, with higher occupancy rates found for bat boxes placed on buildings compared to trees (action 1024). Habitat context affects success, with higher occupancy in farm forestry sites than native forest, higher occupancy in pine relative to mixed deciduous stands, and higher occupancy in forest fragments than in pasture (action 1024). Prior bat presence increases success rates, with higher occupancy in areas where bats were known to roost before box installation (action 1024). Installation strategy matters, as bat boxes are more likely to be occupied when a greater number are installed across a site (action 1024). Occupancy rates vary considerably, with 22 studies finding bats occupying less than half of provided bat boxes (0-49%) while nine studies found bats occupying more than half (54-100%) (action 1024).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: How do different types of purpose-built road crossing structures compare in effectiveness for bats?\nanswer: Green bridges show the highest effectiveness for bats, with one study in the UK finding that a green bridge was used by 97% of bats crossing a road (Action 979). Overpasses show variable effectiveness depending on design, with two replicated studies in Ireland and France finding that two or three bat species/species groups used overpasses but up to three-quarters of bats crossed the road below at traffic height or crossed at other nearby locations, while in the UK an overpass with planters was used by two-thirds of crossing bats, and an unvegetated overpass with a paved road over it was not used by crossing bats (Action 977). Underpasses and culverts are consistently used by bats but with varying effectiveness, as eight studies in Germany, Ireland, the UK, Australia and France found that bats used underpasses and culverts below roads and crossed over the roads above them in varying proportions, with effectiveness influenced by underpass type and height, road width, and the amount of forest and hedgerows in the surrounding landscape (Action 976). Bat gantries show limited effectiveness, with two replicated studies in the UK finding that fewer bats used bat gantries than crossed the road below at traffic height, and one bat gantry was not used at all, while in France a temporary bat gantry was used by three bat species/species groups but almost half of crossing bats flew over the road at other locations (Action 978).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: For arid regions, what is the evidence on the effectiveness of creating or managing water sources to support bat populations?\nanswer: The evidence shows that creating artificial water sources can be effective for supporting bat populations. Five studies evaluated the effects of creating artificial water sources for bats, conducted in the USA, Germany, South Africa, Israel and Mexico (Action 959). These studies found that bat activity (relative abundance) was similar or higher over reservoirs and waste water treatment pools, heliponds and drainage ditches, retention ponds and farm/cattle ponds compared to over natural wetlands, nearby vineyards, surrounding forest or grassland/crops, trees and orchards (Action 959). One study in South Africa found a similar number of bat species over farm ponds and in grassland/crops, trees, vineyards or orchards (Action 959). Additionally, managing livestock water troughs as drinking resources shows promise, with two studies in the USA demonstrating that removing livestock modifications from water troughs resulted in bats drinking from them more frequently, and that larger, full water tanks surrounded by sparse vegetation had more bats drinking from them than smaller, half full tanks surrounded by no or dense vegetation (Action 1951). Small dams can also provide effective habitat, with one study in Portugal finding that reservoirs created using small dams had greater activity of four bat species than the streams feeding into them (Action 1997). Wetland restoration showed positive results in one USA study, where restoring wetlands increased overall bat activity and restored wetlands had similar bat activity to undisturbed wetlands (Action 2036). However, no studies were found that specifically evaluated managing natural water bodies in arid areas to prevent desiccation for bat populations (Action 2027).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: In agricultural landscapes, which farming systems are most beneficial for bat populations?\nanswer: Based on the available research evidence, several farming systems and practices show benefits for bat populations in agricultural landscapes. Organic farming shows mixed but generally positive results compared to conventional farming, with four of nine studies finding higher overall bat activity, bat feeding activity, Brazilian free-tailed bat activity, and activity of four of seven bat species on organic farms (Action 961). Additionally, two studies found higher activity of Myotis species over water and rivers on organic farms, and one study found higher activity for two of three bat species over organic fields compared to conventionally managed fields (Action 961). \n\nAgroforestry systems, particularly those with varied shade cover, demonstrate clear benefits for bats. Coffee plantations with varied shade cover had more bats captured and higher activity of forest bat species compared to plantations with single shade species (Action 963). Shaded coffee, cacao and banana plantations had more bat species and higher bat diversity than plantations with single shade species or no shade (Action 963). Silvopastoral systems using agroforestry combined with no chemicals resulted in great fruit-eating bats with higher body weights and body condition scores compared to conventional farming areas (Action 963).\n\nReducing chemical inputs benefits bat populations, with farms using few or no chemicals showing different bat species compositions, higher diversity of insect-eating bat species in coffee agroforestry plantations, and higher overall bat activity compared to farms with high chemical inputs (Action 2013). Agricultural landscapes with smaller fields had higher activity of six of seven bat species compared to landscapes with larger fields (Action 1939). \n\nHedge management also shows benefits, with hedges trimmed three or more years prior having more bat species and higher activity of two of eight bat species compared to recently trimmed hedges (Action 1943). However, tree plantations on agricultural land showed mixed results, with bat activity generally lower in plantations compared to original forest and woodland remnants (Action 958).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the outcomes and success rates associated with ex-situ bat conservation actions like captive breeding and rehabilitation?\nanswer: Based on the available evidence, ex-situ bat conservation actions show varied outcomes and success rates. For bat rehabilitation programs, four studies found that 70-90% of hand-reared pipistrelle bats survived for at least 4-14 days after release into the wild, with six of 21 bats successfully joining wild bat colonies (action 2054). One study found that 13% of ringed hand-reared pipistrelle bats were found alive in bat boxes 38 days to almost four years after release (action 2054). Bats that flew in large flight cages for long periods before release survived for longer and were more active than those that flew for short periods or in small enclosures (action 2054). For captive breeding programs, eight studies found that 6-100% of female bats captured in the wild successfully conceived, gave birth and reared young in captivity (action 2053). Survival rates for bat pups born in captivity ranged from 20-100% from between 10 days to adulthood (action 2053). Two studies found that two of five and two of three bats born in captivity successfully gave birth to live young (action 2053). However, no studies were found that evaluated the effects of releasing captive-bred bats on bat populations (action 2039) or breeding bats in captivity specifically to supplement wild populations affected by white-nose syndrome (action 2009).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
