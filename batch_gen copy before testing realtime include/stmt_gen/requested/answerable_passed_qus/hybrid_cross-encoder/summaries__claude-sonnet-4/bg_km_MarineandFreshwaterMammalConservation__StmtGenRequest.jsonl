[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: How does the evidence for using acoustic devices to reduce human-wildlife conflict at aquaculture systems compare to their use on fishing gear?\nanswer: The evidence for acoustic devices to reduce human-wildlife conflict differs substantially between aquaculture systems and fishing gear contexts. At aquaculture systems (action 2775), six studies were evaluated, with four of six studies finding that acoustic devices reduced predation on caged salmon by grey seals, harbour seals and South American sea lions, or reduced the number of harbour seals approaching fish cages. However, two studies found that acoustic devices did not reduce harbour seal predation at salmon farms or reduce the presence, approach distances, group sizes or time spent around fin-fish farms by common bottlenose dolphins.\n\nFor fishing gear (action 2808), thirty-three studies were evaluated, showing much more extensive evidence. In terms of human-wildlife conflict specifically, five of six controlled studies found that acoustic devices reduced damage to fish catches and/or fishing nets caused by common bottlenose dolphins and seals, while one study found acoustic devices did not reduce damage to swordfish catches by California sea lions. Additionally, fishing gear studies demonstrated significant evidence for reducing entanglements, with nine studies finding that acoustic devices resulted in fewer collisions of humpback whales or entanglements of harbour porpoises, Franciscana dolphins, beaked whales and small cetaceans.\n\nThe fishing gear evidence base is substantially larger (33 vs 6 studies) and shows broader applications across more marine mammal species and geographical locations. Acoustic devices on fishing gear also demonstrated effectiveness for both reducing unwanted catch/entanglements (14 studies) and human-wildlife conflict (6 studies), while aquaculture studies focused primarily on predation reduction at fish farms.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: How does the evidence for using acoustically reflective materials on fishing gear compare to attaching acoustically reflective objects for reducing marine mammal entanglement?\nanswer: The evidence shows different levels of effectiveness between the two approaches for reducing marine mammal entanglement. For attaching acoustically reflective objects to fishing gear (action 2806), two studies were conducted with both showing no effectiveness: one controlled study in the Timor Sea and Arafura Sea found that attaching metallic bead chains to fishing nets did not reduce dolphin entanglements, and one controlled study in the Gulf of Alaska found that attaching acrylic beads next to fishing hooks did not reduce predation on fish catches by sperm whales. In contrast, using acoustically reflective fishing gear materials (action 2807) showed more promising results based on five studies conducted across multiple locations. Two of three controlled studies in the North Sea, Bay of Fundy, and South Atlantic Ocean found that fishing nets made from acoustically reflective materials (iron-oxide or barium sulfate) had fewer entanglements of harbour porpoises than conventional fishing nets, though one study found that nets made from barium sulfate did not reduce dolphin entanglements. Additionally, two behavioural studies examined how harbour porpoises responded to acoustically reflective materials: one study found that porpoises approached both barium sulfate and conventional nets similarly but used fewer echolocation clicks at barium sulfate nets, while another study found that harbour porpoise echolocation activity was similar at both net types.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What is the evidence for interventions that directly manage individual mammals to boost threatened populations?\nanswer: Evidence shows multiple direct management interventions for boosting threatened mammal populations with varying success rates. Captive breeding and release programs demonstrate mixed results: studies from 31 locations found that captive-bred mammals had lower post-release survival rates than wild-born translocated animals, though populations of mountain gazelles, Corsican red deer, P\u00e8re David's deer, Eurasian otters and swift foxes increased following releases (Action 2476). Review evidence indicates over half of mammal release programmes were considered successful, with release programmes for macropods resulting in successful establishment in 61% of cases and 40% surviving over five years (Action 2476).\n\nTranslocation shows promise for marine mammals: 50-83% of translocated Hawaiian monk seal pups survived for at least one year, with similar survival rates to non-translocated pups born at release sites (Action 2930). More than a quarter of translocated Hawaiian monk seals reproduced when combined with other interventions (Action 2930). For captive-bred marine mammals, two of three Antillean manatees and two of 14 Florida manatees born in captivity and released survived for at least one year (Action 2933).\n\nPre-release captive management improves outcomes: holding translocated mammals in captivity before release increased survival rates, with longer captivity periods improving survival of European hedgehogs and Canada lynx (Action 2458). Translocated animals held in captivity prior to release had higher post-release survival rates than captive-bred animals released directly (Action 2458).\n\nProvision of artificial refuges and breeding sites enhances success: release sites with artificial burrows had higher abundances of European rabbits and California ground squirrels compared to sites without (Action 2453). Translocated European ground squirrels released into plugged artificial burrows had higher recapture rates than those in unplugged burrows (Action 2453).\n\nSupplementary feeding provides population support: studies found supplementary feeding increased abundance of bank voles, red squirrels, striped mice, brown hyena and black-backed jackals (Action 2367). It increased reproductive rates in ungulates in five of eight studies and survival in four out of seven studies (Action 2367). Supplementary feeding increased the proportion of striped mice breeding, arctic fox litters, and prairie vole litter sizes (Action 2367).\n\nGenetic management techniques show limited evidence: artificial insemination resulted in fewer than half of female black-footed ferrets giving birth and lower pregnancy rates in giant pandas compared to natural mating (Action 2473). However, artificial insemination using preserved genetic material increased genetic diversity and lowered inbreeding in captive black-footed ferret populations (Action 2475).\n\nPrimate reintroduction success varies by rearing method: most reintroduced golden lion tamarins born and reared in cages had higher mortality than wild-born tamarins and did not survive over seven years (Action 1594). Only two out of three black lion tamarins raised in free-ranging environments survived over four months despite this more natural rearing approach (Action 1596).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Action 2815 shows that killer whale distances from fishing vessels decreased after the first exposure to acoustic devices, suggesting habituation may occur. Action 2816 found that the probability of harbour porpoises approaching within 125 m of acoustic devices increased over 10-11 days, also indicating habituation effects. Action 2775 shows inconsistent effectiveness, as acoustic devices did not reduce harbour seal predation at some salmon farms and did not reduce the presence of common bottlenose dolphins around fin-fish farms. Action 2815 demonstrates that acoustic devices on fishing vessels can reduce surfacing and echolocation rates of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins and Australian snubfin dolphins, which could potentially interfere with their natural behaviors. Action 2808 found that acoustic devices on fishing gear were effective for some species but not others, and in some fishing areas but not others, indicating variable effectiveness.

Acoustic devices on fishing gear showed the strongest evidence - twelve of 16 controlled studies found that acoustic devices on fishing nets resulted in harbour porpoises, common bottlenose dolphins and other cetaceans approaching nets less closely and having fewer encounters with nets (Action 2808). Nine studies in the North Atlantic Ocean and North Sea found that acoustic devices on fishing nets resulted in fewer entanglements of harbour porpoises, Franciscana dolphins, beaked whales and small cetaceans, though effectiveness varied by fishing area in some cases.

However, one study found that barium sulfate nets did not reduce dolphin entanglements. Acoustic devices on fishing vessels showed limited evidence from Atlantic regions, with one controlled study in the North Atlantic Ocean finding that acoustic devices did not reduce predation of squid catches by Risso's dolphins (Action 2815). Attaching acoustically reflective objects to fishing gear showed no effectiveness, with one controlled study finding that attaching metallic bead chains to fishing nets did not reduce dolphin entanglements (Action 2806).

For hand-reared orphaned manatees, studies found that approximately three-quarters of Antillean manatees that were captive-reared and released in the South Atlantic Ocean (Brazil) were known to survive for at least one year, and some survived for more than seven years (action 2926). Additionally, two-thirds of Florida manatees that were captive-reared and released in water bodies in Florida survived for at least one year (action 2926). Importantly, most captive-reared Antillean manatees released back into the wild in the South Atlantic Ocean reproduced, indicating successful integration (action 2926). However, there were also some failures noted, as three West Indian manatee calves that were captive-reared either died before or after release, had to be returned to captivity after release, or survived in the wild only with supplemental feeding (action 2926). For captive-bred manatees specifically, evidence shows lower success rates, with two of three Antillean manatees born in captivity and released in the Porto de Pedras estuary (Brazil) surviving for at least one year without further intervention, and two of 14 Florida manatees born in captivity and released in water bodies in Florida surviving for at least one year without further intervention (action 2933). General rehabilitation data shows that 10-100% of manatees released after rehabilitation in captivity survived during post-release monitoring periods ranging from three days to five years in various locations including the Gulf of Mexico, Indian River Lagoon, and water bodies in Florida (action 2925).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Two of four studies found that net sleeves or cage and chain devices on fishing hooks reduced damage to fish catches by sperm whales, killer whales and toothed whales (Action 2821). However, two other studies found that attaching 'umbrella' or 'spider' devices on fishing hooks did not reduce predation and/or damage to fish catches by sperm whales or toothed whales (Action 2821). One study found that catch protection devices made from streamers reduced dolphin predation on fish bait, but only during the first two trials (Action 2821).\n\nIn contrast, modifying fishing pots and traps showed more consistent positive outcomes for reducing human-wildlife conflict. Two controlled studies found that installing wire grids or steel bars on fishing trap-nets or bag-nets, along with strengthened netting or other modifications to prevent seal access, reduced damage to salmon catches by seals (Action 2822). One study found that one of two methods of securing crab pot doors with a bungee cord reduced common bottlenose dolphin interactions (Action 2822). One study found that installing wire grids on trap-nets, along with strengthened netting, resulted in higher catches of undamaged salmon but not whitefish, likely due to reduced seal predation (Action 2822).\n\nBoth approaches also showed effectiveness in reducing entanglements and unwanted catch.

Nine studies found that acoustic devices on fishing nets and cod traps resulted in fewer entanglements of harbour porpoises, Franciscana dolphins, beaked whales and small cetaceans, with one study specifically finding that fishing nets with a 'complete' set of acoustic devices had fewer entanglements of harbour porpoises (Action 2808).

One study found that fishing nets with an 'incomplete' set of acoustic devices did not reduce harbour porpoise entanglements, and another found that acoustic devices reduced harbour porpoise entanglements in one fishing area but not another (Action 2808). Additionally, four studies found that acoustic devices did not have significant effects on the behaviour of common bottlenose dolphins, harbour porpoises, Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins or dugongs (Action 2808).\n\nRegarding potential harms, the evidence suggests displacement effects where porpoises and other marine mammals avoid areas with acoustic devices. Studies found that acoustic devices caused porpoises to approach nets less closely and reduced activity in surrounding areas, which represents a form of habitat displacement (Action 2808). Studies on acoustic devices used for noise exposure reduction showed they could reduce harbour porpoise activity and sightings at distances of 1-18 km from the devices (Action 2896).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

These studies found that installing steel rods on lobster pots or metal frames on fishing pots reduced the number of Australian sea lion pups or grey seals and harbour seals that entered or became trapped in pots. Additionally, installing wire grids or steel bars on fishing trap-nets or bag-nets, along with strengthened netting or other modifications, reduced damage to salmon catches by seals and resulted in higher catches of undamaged salmon due to reduced seal predation (Action ID: 2822).\n\nThe evidence for installing exclusion and/or escape devices on fishing nets for mammals comes from seven studies in the Indian Ocean (Australia, Tasmania), Tasman Sea (Tasmania), and South Atlantic Ocean (South Georgia) (Action ID: 2823). These studies showed that installing exclusion and/or escape devices on trawl nets reduced the number of trapped or entangled Antarctic fur seals and common bottlenose dolphins. However, the evidence also revealed limitations: less than one third of common bottlenose dolphins exited escape hatches on trawl nets alive, and fewer fur seals died in exclusion devices with large escape openings than in those with small openings (Action ID: 2823).\n\nBoth approaches showed evidence of reducing unwanted catch, but the pot and trap modifications appear to have more studies demonstrating reduced damage to target catches, while the net exclusion devices showed mixed results regarding survival rates of mammals that encountered the devices.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

While these devices can be effective for reducing unwanted interactions, they also cause significant behavioral changes in marine mammals. According to action 2896, acoustic devices successfully deter mammals from areas to reduce noise exposure, with studies finding reduced activity and sightings of harbour porpoises at distances of 1-18 km from devices, and minke whales increasing swimming speed and swimming more directly when devices were deployed. Action 2816 shows that acoustic devices on moorings reduced numbers of grey and harbour seals and activity of harbour porpoises, short-beaked common dolphins and common bottlenose dolphins, though effectiveness varied by species as they had no significant effect on humpback whale behavior. Action 2815 demonstrates that acoustic devices on fishing vessels caused common bottlenose dolphins to avoid boats more frequently and reduced surfacing, echolocation rates, and time spent foraging or socializing in Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins and Australian snubfin dolphins. Action 2808 reveals that while acoustic devices on fishing gear successfully reduced entanglements of various species including harbour porpoises, Franciscana dolphins, and beaked whales, they also caused behavioral changes including reduced approaches to nets and decreased activity in surrounding areas. Action 2775 shows acoustic devices at aquaculture systems reduced predation by seals and sea lions but had inconsistent effects across species and locations. A key trade-off identified in action 2816 is that while acoustic devices can reduce immediate mammal presence, the probability of porpoises approaching within 125 m actually increased over 10-11 days, suggesting potential habituation effects that could reduce long-term effectiveness.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Across multiple relevant actions, including setting or improving minimum sewage treatment standards (Action 2867), treating wastewater from intensive livestock holdings (Action 2880), limiting, ceasing or prohibiting dumping of untreated sewage (Action 2865), limiting, ceasing or prohibiting dumping of sewage sludge (Action 2866), establishing riparian buffers to reduce pollutants reaching rivers and the sea (Action 2882), reducing pesticide, herbicide or fertilizer use (Action 2879), creating artificial wetlands to reduce pollutants reaching rivers and the sea (Action 2881), and establishing aquaculture to extract nutrients from run-offs (Action 2883), no studies were found that evaluated their effects on marine and freshwater mammal populations. Additionally, there was no evidence found for preventing pollution from agricultural lands or sewage treatment facilities entering watercourses on amphibian populations (Action 802), and no studies evaluating preventing pollution from agricultural land or forestry from entering watercourses on bat populations (Action 2015). This consistent lack of evidence across all actions indicates that while these interventions exist as potential mitigation strategies, their effectiveness for protecting marine mammals from agricultural and sewage pollution threats has not been scientifically documented.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the documented behavioral effects on marine mammals of implementing regulations for vessel operations during tourism activities?\nanswer: Based on the documented evidence, four studies have evaluated the behavioral effects of implementing regulations for marine and freshwater mammal watching tours. These studies were conducted in the North Atlantic Ocean (the Azores), the Canan\u00e9ia estuary (Brazil), the South Pacific Ocean (Australia) and the Bass Strait (Australia). Two controlled studies in the North Atlantic Ocean and South Pacific Ocean found that when whale-watching vessels followed approach regulations, fewer sperm whales and humpback whale pods changed their behaviours (e.g. swimming speed, aerial displays) or avoided the vessels compared to when regulations were not followed, but direction of movement and diving patterns or diving behaviours did not differ. One replicated, controlled study in the Canan\u00e9ia estuary found that when tour boats followed approach regulations, fewer Guiana dolphins displayed negative behaviours (e.g. moving away, diving, groups separating). One study in the Bass Strait found that when boats approached a seal colony to 75 m, more seals remained on shore than when boats approached to 25 m. Additionally, one before-and-after study in the Kenai Fjords (Alaska) found that fewer harbour seals were disturbed during kayak excursions after training was provided to kayak guides. No studies were found that evaluated the effects of developing and implementing regulations for operating vessels around mammals generally, introducing permits or licences for marine and freshwater mammal watching tours, providing training to vessel operators on mammal behaviour and appropriate avoidance techniques, or setting minimum distances for approaching mammals.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Four of five studies found that after hunting was prohibited, the abundance of harbour seals and humpback whales increased over 7-30 years in the Kattegat and Skagerrak Seas, the South Pacific Ocean, the North Atlantic Ocean and the Southern Ocean (Action 2780). A review covering the North Atlantic Ocean, North Pacific Ocean and the Southern Hemisphere found significant increase rates for 10 of 12 baleen whale populations during 7-21 years after legislation to prohibit hunting was introduced (Action 2780). However, one study found that numbers of mature male sperm whales did not differ significantly before or 31 years after hunting was prohibited (Action 2780).

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: For shark control programs in Australia and South Africa, what is the evidence for alternative methods to nets that reduce harm to marine mammals?\nanswer: The evidence for alternative methods to nets in shark control programs comes primarily from studies evaluating baited lines as an alternative to nets. Two studies from the Indian Ocean (South Africa) and South Pacific Ocean (Australia) found that using baited lines instead of nets for shark control had fewer entanglements of dolphins, whales and dugongs than nets (Action 2856). Additionally, one site comparison study in the South Pacific Ocean found that using baited lines instead of nets increased the survival of entangled common and bottlenose dolphins (Action 2856). \n\nFor reducing harm from fishing nets more generally, several methods show promise: Installing exclusion and/or escape devices on fishing nets reduced the number of trapped or entangled Antarctic fur seals and common bottlenose dolphins in studies from the South Atlantic Ocean and Indian Ocean (Action 2823). However, less than one third of common bottlenose dolphins exited escape hatches on trawl nets alive in one Indian Ocean study (Action 2823). \n\nAcoustic devices on fishing gear showed mixed results across multiple locations including Australia. Nine studies found that using acoustic devices on cod traps or fishing nets resulted in fewer collisions of humpback whales or entanglements of harbour porpoises, Franciscana dolphins, beaked whales and small cetaceans (Action 2808). However, three studies found that acoustic devices resulted in fewer entanglements of some species but not others, and one study in Australia found no significant effect on the behaviour of common bottlenose dolphins, harbour porpoises, Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins or dugongs (Action 2808).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Use of acoustic devices on fishing gear showed mixed but generally positive results, with nine studies finding that acoustic devices on cod traps or fishing nets resulted in fewer collisions of humpback whales or entanglements of harbour porpoises, Franciscana dolphins, beaked whales and small cetaceans, and five of six studies finding that acoustic devices reduced damage to fish catches and/or fishing nets caused by common bottlenose dolphins and seals (Action 2808).

For aquaculture systems, replacing anti-predator nets more frequently at salmon farms resulted in fewer salmon losses to harbour seal predation (Action 2774). However, some commonly considered actions showed limited effectiveness: installing cork line barriers did not deter harbour seals from feeding on salmon released from a hatchery (Action 2824), switching off artificial lights on bridges did not deter harbour seals from feeding on salmon (Action 2825), and translocating fur seals away from salmon farms resulted in more than half or nearly all animals returning (Action 2776).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What is the comparative effectiveness of deploying acoustic devices on fishing gear, vessels, or moorings for reducing human-wildlife conflict at wild fisheries?\nanswer: Based on the available evidence, acoustic devices show different levels of effectiveness depending on their deployment method for reducing human-wildlife conflict at wild fisheries. Acoustic devices on fishing gear appear most effective, with five of six controlled studies showing reduced damage to fish catches and/or fishing nets caused by marine mammals (action 2808). These devices also reduced entanglements, with nine studies finding fewer collisions or entanglements of various whale and dolphin species when acoustic devices were used on fishing nets and cod traps (action 2808). Acoustic devices on moorings showed limited evidence for reducing human-wildlife conflict, with only one randomized controlled study finding that deployment on moorings reduced harbour seals feeding on migrating juvenile salmon (action 2816). However, moorings-based devices effectively modified marine mammal behavior, with studies showing reduced numbers of seals and reduced activity of various dolphin and porpoise species (action 2816). Acoustic devices on fishing vessels showed the least effectiveness for human-wildlife conflict reduction, with one randomized controlled study finding no reduction in predation of squid catches by dolphins when acoustic devices were used on vessels (action 2815). However, vessel-based devices did modify dolphin behavior, causing avoidance and reduced foraging activity (action 2815). Acoustically reflective objects attached to fishing gear showed no effectiveness, with studies finding no reduction in dolphin entanglements or whale predation (action 2806). The evidence suggests that direct attachment to fishing gear provides the most consistent results for reducing human-wildlife conflict compared to vessel or mooring deployment methods.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

For noise dampening methods, one study in the North Sea found that using bubble curtains or screens during pile driving resulted in harbour porpoise detections within 15 km decreasing less compared to before pile driving than at sites without bubble curtains or screens (Action ID 2901). For acoustic deterrent devices, four studies from the North Sea, Great Belt, and Iceland found that using acoustic devices to deter mammals from an area at wind farm construction sites or pelagic sites reduced the activity and sightings of harbour porpoises at distances of 1-18 km from the devices, and caused minke whales to swim away from devices, increase swimming speed, and swim more directly (Action ID 2896). For soft start procedures during seismic surveys, three studies from the South Atlantic, South Pacific, and UK waters found that a greater proportion of cetaceans avoided or moved away from vessels during soft start procedures with seismic airguns compared to when airguns were not firing, though responses varied by species with some whales remaining within 900m and humpback whales only slowing their speed without significantly altering course (Action ID 2897). No studies were found evaluating the effectiveness of delaying or ceasing operations when mammals are detected within specified zones (Action ID 2898), reducing hammer energy during pile driving (Action ID 2900), using alternative methods instead of airguns for seismic surveys (Action ID 2899), or modifying vessels to reduce noise disturbance (Action ID 2904).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Speed limit enforcement in all areas also showed fewer manatee deaths compared to partial enforcement in zones only (Action 2777).\n\nOther available actions include diverting shipping routes to avoid whale habitats (Action 2754), using observers on board vessels to detect mammals and allow vessel course or speed to be altered (Action 2755), and training vessel operators on appropriate avoidance techniques to reduce collisions (Action 3534). Technology-based solutions are also available, such as using real-time automated tools on board vessels to detect mammals and allow vessel course or speed to be altered (Action 2756), using remote tools to detect mammals in an area and allow vessel course or speed to be altered (Action 2757), and using technology and reporting systems to avoid collisions (Action 3535).\n\nAdditional vessel modifications include modifying vessels to reduce risk of physical injury to mammals (Action 2762) and reducing shipping along inland waterways (Action 2763).

Approximately three-quarters of captive-reared Antillean manatees and two-thirds of Florida manatees survived for at least one year after release, with some surviving for more than seven years (Action 2926). More than a quarter of rehabilitated Hawaiian monk seals reproduced after release (Action 2925). Most captive-reared Antillean manatees released into the wild reproduced (Action 2926). Captive-reared and released Pacific harbour seal pups had similar survival estimates to wild pups, with similar diving behavior to wild pups (Action 2926). Two of three Antillean manatees and two of 14 Florida manatees born in captivity and released into the wild survived for at least one year without further intervention (Action 2933). In captive breeding programs, 80% of common bottlenose dolphins born in captivity over two decades survived, with survival increasing with improved husbandry techniques (Action 2932).\n\n**Negative Outcomes:**\nSome rehabilitated animals died before or after release, had to be returned to captivity after release, or survived only with supplemental feeding, including three West Indian manatee calves, seven Hawaiian monk seal pups and one Antillean manatee calf (Action 2926). At least a quarter of California sea lions treated for toxic algae poisoning and released died or had to be euthanized (Action 2925). California sea lions treated for toxic algae poisoning showed altered behavior after release, traveling further from shore, spending less time diving or hauled out, and making shorter, shallower dives than wild sea lions (Action 2925). Most captive-born Amazon river dolphins, narrow-ridged finless porpoises and Irrawaddy dolphins did not survive in captivity (Action 2932). A population of Yangtze finless porpoises breeding in semi-captive conditions had low genetic diversity (Action 2932).
