For vaccinations (Action 733), controlled studies from Iceland and Norway found higher survival rates in vaccinated salmon compared to unvaccinated control groups after exposure to disease-causing bacteria Aeromonas salmonicida spp.achromogenes and Yersinia ruckeri, respectively. Additionally, controlled studies in Australia and Canada reported higher survival in salmon infected with marine flexibacteriosis and bacterial kidney disease post vaccination, and two controlled studies in Norway reported similar results for salmon vaccinated against infectious salmon anaemia. For cage size alteration (Action 742), only one replicated study in Australia was identified, which recorded lower levels of amoebic gill disease in salmon kept within larger compared to smaller cages. The vaccination intervention demonstrates broader evidence across multiple disease types and geographic locations with consistently higher survival rates, while cage size evidence is limited to one study focusing specifically on amoebic gill disease reduction.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

One action documents studies from Norway examining the use of genetically modified soybeans in Atlantic salmon diets (Action 928). Three controlled, replicated studies in Norway found no difference in growth rate of Atlantic salmon that were fed diets containing either GM or non-GM soybeans, and one randomised, replicated, controlled study in Norway found no differences in fish fed diets containing either GM or non-GM soybeans on the histology of the fish (Action 928). However, the action documents do not contain specific information about international regulatory frameworks, approval processes, or compliance requirements for the use of genetically modified ingredients in salmon feed.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
