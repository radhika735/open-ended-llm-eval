For both actions, systematic journal and report searches have not identified any studies that directly evaluated these actions, meaning there is currently no evidence available to assess whether either action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Therefore, no comparison of effectiveness between these two actions can be made based on the available evidence.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
