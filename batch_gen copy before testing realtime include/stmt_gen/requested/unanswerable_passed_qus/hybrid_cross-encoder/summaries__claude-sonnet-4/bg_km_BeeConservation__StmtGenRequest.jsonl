Similarly, no evidence was found demonstrating the effects of restoring natural or semi-natural habitat on bee diversity or abundance in neighbouring farms (action 6). While general studies on habitat connectivity for invertebrates show mixed results, with all four studies from the Czech Republic, Germany and the Netherlands finding some degree of colonization of connected areas by invertebrates, the colonization process was found to be slow and the extent of colonization varied between invertebrate taxa (action 579). However, none of these studies specifically examined wild bee communities or their responses to habitat connectivity.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

This means that no studies have been found that directly and quantitatively tested whether retaining dead wood during forest management helps conserve wild bee populations.

However, studies on reintroducing laboratory-reared bumblebee colonies provide relevant context. Seven replicated trials monitored the success of laboratory-reared colonies introduced to the environment, with four trials allowing colonies to develop until new queens were produced or the founding queen died. In two of these trials (both in the UK), the numbers of queens per colony were very low or zero, while two trials produced good numbers of new queens (Action 52). High rates of social parasitism by cuckoo bees were observed in released colonies, with rates of 25-66% in Canada and 79% in the UK, though parasitism was reduced by placing colonies in landscapes with intermediate nectar and pollen availability and releasing them late in the season rather than early (Action 52). For captive rearing programs, studies show that declining North American species like B. vagans and B. terricola can successfully rear adults in captivity, though B. fervidus queens consistently laid eggs but larvae died before becoming adults across all trials (Action 50).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What is the most cost-effective method for increasing wild bee populations on farmland?\nanswer: Based on the evidence from multiple trials, planting dedicated floral resources on farmland appears to be one of the most effective methods for supporting wild bee populations. Fourteen trials in Europe and North America have recorded substantial numbers of wild bees foraging on perennial or annual sown flowering plants in agricultural environments (Action ID: 17). Ten trials monitoring phacelia patches found substantial numbers of foraging wild bees, particularly bumblebees, with foraging bee species ranging from eight to 35 (Action ID: 17). Wild bird seed or cover mixtures also show promise, with seven UK studies finding positive effects on bee abundance or species richness (Action ID: 594). Agri-environment schemes demonstrate mixed results, with four replicated trials in Europe showing enhanced diversity and/or abundance of foraging wild bees under various schemes including Swiss Ecological Compensation Areas and German organic farming options (Action ID: 24). Reducing intensity of farmland meadow management shows some benefit, with two replicated trials finding enhanced numbers and diversity of wild bees on meadows with delayed first cut and little agrochemical use (Action ID: 22). Converting to organic farming produces equivocal results, with three replicated trials showing higher abundance of wild bees under organic arable farming compared to conventional farming (Action ID: 25). Grass strips at field margins have mixed evidence, with three UK trials showing some enhancement of bee abundance but inconsistent effects on diversity (Action ID: 14). There is no evidence captured for increasing clover leys enhancing wild bee populations (Action ID: 16) or for introducing nest boxes stocked with solitary bees (Action ID: 81).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: Is it more effective to connect existing semi-natural habitats or to re-plant native forest to boost bee populations?\nanswer: The available evidence from action documents provides limited direct comparison between connecting existing semi-natural habitats versus replanting native forest for boosting bee populations. Action 10 (\"Connect areas of natural or semi-natural habitat for bees\") found no evidence of the effects on wild bee communities of connecting patches of natural or semi-natural habitat. Similarly, action 6 (\"Increase the proportion of natural or semi-natural habitat in the farmed landscape\") found no evidence demonstrating the effects of restoring natural or semi-natural habitat on bee diversity or abundance in neighbouring farms. Action 5 (\"Protect existing natural or semi-natural habitat to prevent conversion to agriculture\") also captured no evidence for the effects of protecting areas of natural or semi-natural habitat on bee populations or communities.\n\nHowever, there is substantial evidence for the effectiveness of creating new flowering habitat. Action 19 (\"Sow uncropped arable field margins with a native wild flower seed mix\") found that five replicated trials in the UK showed that uncropped field margins sown with wild flowers support a higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees than cropped field edges, grassy margins or naturally regenerated uncropped margins. Action 442 (\"Plant nectar flower mixture/wildflower strips\") found that 80 individual studies investigated the effects of flowering strips on biodiversity, with 64 studies showing some benefits to one or more wildlife groups. Specifically, 65 studies reported effects on invertebrates, with 50 reporting positive effects and 41 studies finding evidence that flower strips had a positive influence on invertebrate numbers with increased abundance, species richness/diversity, or both.\n\nAction 3932 (\"Plant nectar flower mixture/wildflower strips\") found that 23 studies evaluated the effects of planting nectar flower mixtures on butterflies and moths, with multiple studies finding that sown wildflower strips had higher species richness and diversity of butterflies and moths than conventional field margins, unsown margins, cropped fields or conventional grassland.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

However, the evidence shows contradictory findings: Action 18 indicates that three replicated trials showed that a mix of agricultural forage plants including legumes attracts greater numbers of bumblebees than a perennial wildflower mix, at least in the first year. Conversely, Action 19 reports that one small replicated trial showed that common long-tongued bumblebee species (Bombus pascuorum and B. hortorum) strongly preferred plots of perennial wildflower seed mix over a mix of annual forage plants.
