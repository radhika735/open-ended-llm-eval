According to action 1033, no evidence was captured on the effect of removing food sources as a control tool for Procambarus crayfish. Similarly, according to action 1034, no evidence was captured on the effect of draining the waterway as a control tool for Procambarus crayfish. Both actions note that no studies were found that directly and quantitatively tested these control methods during systematic journal and report searches, meaning the effectiveness of neither approach has been assessed.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Action 2171 found no studies that evaluated the effects of using biocides or other chemicals to control non-native, invasive or other problematic species on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations. Action 2937 similarly found no studies that evaluated the effects of using biocides or other chemicals to control invasive or problematic species on marine and freshwater mammal populations. While there is some evidence of chemical control effectiveness for other aquatic invasive species - such as action 1036 showing that red swamp crayfish could be killed using natural pyrethrum Pyblast at a concentration of 0.05 mg/l, and action 1095 finding that iodine solution, acetic acid, Virkon S and sodium hypochlorite killed invasive killer shrimp in laboratory conditions but were considered impractical for field application - no specific studies were found that directly evaluated chemical biocide effectiveness against zebra mussels.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

The action documents reviewed focus on the effectiveness of rotenone as a biocide for black bullhead eradication (action 1050) and its effects on amphibian populations (action 828), but do not contain information about impacts on invertebrate communities. Action 1050 reports that rotenone successfully achieved eradication of black bullhead in studies from the UK and USA. Action 828 discusses rotenone's effects on amphibians, finding both positive effects (increased amphibian species numbers and abundance) and negative effects (mortality in frogs and adverse symptoms in newts), but provides no data on invertebrate community responses or long-term ecological recovery patterns.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What is the most cost-effective method for controlling American bullfrog populations: introducing northern pike or the direct removal of adults?\nanswer: Based on the evidence found in the action documents, there is limited information comparing the cost-effectiveness of introducing northern pike versus direct removal of adults for controlling American bullfrog populations. Regarding biological control using northern pike, one replicated, controlled study conducted in Belgium found the introduction of the northern pike led to a strong decline in bullfrog tadpole numbers (Action 1039). For direct removal of adults, the evidence shows mixed results: one replicated study in Belgium found catchability of adult bullfrogs in small shallow ponds using one double fyke net for 24 h to be very low, one small study in the USA found that bullfrog adults can be captured overnight in a single trap floating on the water surface, and one replicated, controlled study in the USA found that bullfrog populations rapidly rebounded following intensive removal of the adults (Action 1045). One before-and-after study in France found a significant reduction in the number of recorded adults and juveniles following the shooting of metamorphosed individuals before reproduction, when carried out as part of a combination treatment (Action 1045). The documents do not provide specific cost-effectiveness comparisons between these two methods.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
