For peatlands specifically, systematic searches found no studies that examined changing livestock type (Action 1736) or changing grazing season/timing (Action 1737) either individually or in combination. While there is some evidence about livestock exclusion effects on peatland vegetation - showing no consistent effects on most vegetation groups like cottongrass, sedges and Sphagnum mosses (Action 1734), and evidence that reducing grazing intensity can increase vegetation and shrub cover (Action 1735) - no studies have investigated how different livestock species (such as switching from cattle to sheep) might interact with different grazing seasons to affect peatland vegetation communities.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the long-term effects (over 30 years) of using prescribed fire to control problematic plants on bog vegetation composition?\nanswer: Based on available studies examining prescribed fire effects on bog vegetation composition, research shows that repeated burning has measurable effects on plant communities. In bogs, studies found that increased burning frequency results in higher moss cover (including Sphagnum species) while reducing heather cover. For herbaceous vegetation, results are mixed - one study found burning increased cottongrass cover after 8-18 years while another found no short-term effects (2-7 months). Burning reduces purple moor grass cover and shows variable effects on other grass-like plants and forbs. Studies also report that plant species richness and diversity may be reduced or limited by burning treatments. However, it's important to note that no studies specifically monitored vegetation changes for 30 years or longer - the longest reported monitoring periods were up to 20 years in one experimental set-up in UK bogs.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
