[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What is the most cost-effective method for controlling American bullfrogs in small ponds?\nanswer: For controlling American bullfrogs in small ponds, the evidence suggests that direct removal methods are the most practical approaches. Double fyke nets have been found effective for catching bullfrog tadpoles in small shallow ponds (Action 1046). For adult removal, one study found that bullfrog adults can be captured overnight in a single trap floating on the water surface (Action 1045), though another study noted that catchability of adult bullfrogs using one double fyke net for 24 hours was very low (Action 1045). A before-and-after study in France showed significant reduction in recorded adults and juveniles following the removal of juveniles by trapping when carried out as part of a combination treatment (Action 1046). However, it's important to note that one replicated, controlled study found that bullfrog populations rapidly rebounded following intensive removal of adults (Action 1045), indicating that removal efforts need to be sustained. No evidence was found for the effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of pond draining or pond destruction methods (Actions 1042 and 1043).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Action 1033 states \"No evidence was captured on the effect of removing food sources as a control tool for Procambarus crayfish.\" Similarly, Action 1034 states \"No evidence was captured on the effect of draining the waterway as a control tool for Procambarus crayfish.\" In both cases, the absence of evidence means that systematic journal and report searches have not yet found studies that directly and quantitatively tested these control methods, making it impossible to assess their effectiveness or potential harmful impacts.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What is the effectiveness of using chemical biocides to control invasive zebra mussel populations?\nanswer: The evidence base specific to zebra mussel control using chemical biocides is limited, with no direct studies found in the systematic searches conducted. However, evidence from related invasive bivalve species suggests that chemical biocides can be effective. Studies on Asian clams (another invasive bivalve) found that dosing with biocides including chlorine, potassium and copper successfully killed these molluscs, with higher concentrations of chlorine and bromine delivered at higher temperatures shortening the time required to achieve mortality. A field-based trial in Spanish irrigation systems using fat-coated particles called BioBullets achieved 100% mortality of Asian clams within pipes. While these results demonstrate the potential effectiveness of chemical biocides for invasive bivalve control, no studies were found that specifically evaluated biocide effectiveness for zebra mussels, nor assessed the potential environmental impacts on non-target species.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

The documents primarily report the effectiveness of rotenone in eradicating black bullheads, with studies in the UK and USA demonstrating successful eradication. However, these documents primarily focused on vertebrate species impacts, including both positive effects (increased amphibian species, abundance and recruitment of newt populations) and negative effects (many frogs died, small number of newts showed symptoms of negative effects). No specific information about long-term impacts on native invertebrate communities following black bullhead eradication using rotenone was found in the available action documents.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Two specific actions have been documented: electrofishing alone and a combination of netting and electrofishing. For both approaches, no studies were found that directly and quantitatively tested these methods as control tools for invasive gobies.
