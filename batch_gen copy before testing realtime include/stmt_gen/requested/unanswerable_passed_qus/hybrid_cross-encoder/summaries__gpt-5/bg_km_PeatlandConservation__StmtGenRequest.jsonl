Related evidence gaps include: no evidence for the effects of introducing beavers to impede water flow in forest watercourses on forests [1187]; and no studies evaluating the effects on marsh/swamp vegetation of reintroducing overharvested animals [3018].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the long-term effects (over 30 years) of using prescribed fire to control problematic plants on bog vegetation composition?\nanswer: Across five bog studies evaluating prescribed fire to control problematic plants, reported vegetation responses included: higher moss cover (including Sphagnum) in plots burned more often in a UK bog, and increased moss/lichen/bare ground cover 2\u20137 months after burning in Germany [1774]. Cottongrass cover was unchanged 2\u20137 months after burning in Germany, increased 8\u201318 years after burning in the UK, and was similar between plots burned every 10 or 20 years in the same UK bog [1774]. Heather cover was lower in plots burned more often in a UK bog and lower in burned than unburned plots in Germany; cover of other shrubs was not affected in Germany [1774]. Vegetation structure responses in a UK bog included more grass-like biomass but less total vegetation, shrub and bryophyte biomass in more frequently burned plots [1774]. Plant species richness in a UK bog was reduced or limited by burning [1774]. Reported bog study timeframes included short-term (2\u20137 months) and multi-year (8\u201318 years) measurements [1774].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
