A replicated laboratory and field study in South America found that a South American weevil produced more feeding lesions on floating pennywort than on other plant species, but field results showed no reduction in floating pennywort biomass [1123]. One field study in South Africa reported reduced growth of parrot\u2019s feather after release of a South American leaf\u2011feeding Lysathia beetle [1599]. No evidence was captured for the effectiveness of introducing co\u2011evolved, host\u2011specific herbivores against skunk cabbage [1098].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Survival of monarch caterpillars was similar on common milkweed planted in gardens and meadows [3842]. Growth of monarch caterpillars was similar on eight different native milkweed species [3842]. Adult monarchs used common milkweed planted in gardens more than milkweed planted in meadows [3842].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
