No studies were found that evaluated the effects of creating large ridges or ledges (>50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures on the biodiversity of those structures [3445]. One controlled study in Japan examined creating small protrusions (1\u201350 mm) on a subtidal artificial structure and reported mixed effects on macroalgal abundance on structure surfaces depending on species; no community or behaviour studies were reported [3453].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

A related action on reducing the slope of subtidal artificial structures reports no studies at all and likewise offers no information on public perceptions [3442].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
