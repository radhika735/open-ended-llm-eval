Another study in Australia, however, found no difference in mortality from Amoebic Gill Disease in cages where a fallowing system was used [1026]. A replicated, controlled study in Norway discovered that salmon bred for high resistance to infectious pancreatic necrosis had higher survival rates when exposed to the disease compared to a family bred for low resistance [735].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Additionally, two controlled studies in Australia and Canada reported higher survival in salmon infected with marine flexibacteriosis and bacterial kidney disease after vaccination [733]. For salmon vaccinated against infectious salmon anaemia, two controlled studies in Norway yielded similar results [733]. On the other hand, a replicated study in Australia showed that salmon housed in larger cages had reduced levels of amoebic gill disease when compared to those in smaller cages [742].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
