[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: How does setting a maximum landing size for fish compare to setting a minimum landing size in terms of improving the reproductive success of commercially fished species?\nanswer: A global review on setting a minimum landing size for commercially fished species found that one of five swordfish fisheries showed an increase in recruitment after implementing recommended minimum landing sizes and catch limits (2735). However, a study in the Ionian Sea reported that despite established minimum sizes, most commercially landed fish were immature and had not yet spawned (2735). No studies were found that evaluated the effects of setting a maximum landing size or specifying a size range for commercially fished species on marine fish populations (2736, 2737).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the social and economic impacts on fishing communities of establishing long-term fishery closures?\nanswer: One study found that the long-term closure of a commercial fishery for lesser sandeel resulted in a reduction of overall fishing effort for that species (2655). In the same study, it was found that the annual sandeel catch rates were varied after the closure (2655). Another study found that in an area that had been closed to fishing for eight years, six out of seven fish species were more vulnerable to capture by spear guns (2655). None of the studies that were reviewed had any information on the social or community response to long-term fishery closures (2655).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
