[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: Which is the more cost-effective method for increasing farmland bird populations: providing supplementary food or sowing wild bird seed mixture?\nanswer: Of the 18 studies that looked into the effects of providing supplementary food for birds, nine studies indicated that the practice increased the abundance, breeding population size, density, and overwinter survival of farmland birds (648). Five studies, however, revealed no discernible impact on the abundance of breeding farmland birds or their success in reproducing (648). Additionally, one study discovered that in one year, nests that were given extra food had lower fledging rates (648). \n\nIn 30 separate studies that examined the practice of sowing wild bird seed or cover mixture, 21 revealed beneficial outcomes (594). These studies showed that fields planted with a wild bird cover mix had a higher density, abundance, and variety of bird species than other agricultural habitats (594). Nine replicated studies from France and the UK reported mixed or negative effects of wild bird cover on birds compared to other farmland habitats (594).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: How effective is the creation of 'beetle banks' for conserving native predator insects in North American soybean fields?\nanswer: A review found that predators increased in adjacent crops, but one study found effects varied with time and another found no effect [729]. Two studies found small or slow movements of predators from banks to crops [729]. One study found greater beetle activity in fields but this did not improve pest predation [729]. Four studies and a review found more invertebrate predators on beetle banks than in surrounding crops, but one of these found that effects varied with time [729]. A replicated, randomised study and a review found the largest pest reductions in areas closest to a beetle bank or on the beetle bank itself [729]. One review found fewer pests in fields with than without a beetle bank [729]. One replicated, randomised, controlled trial and a review showed that beetle banks could make economic savings if they prevented pests from reaching a spray threshold or causing 5% yield loss [729]. Crops studied included soybean [729].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

However, for marking fencing in general to avoid bird mortality, no evidence of its effects on farmland wildlife has been captured [706]. There is also no evidence of the effects of avoiding lead shot on farmland wildlife [100].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
