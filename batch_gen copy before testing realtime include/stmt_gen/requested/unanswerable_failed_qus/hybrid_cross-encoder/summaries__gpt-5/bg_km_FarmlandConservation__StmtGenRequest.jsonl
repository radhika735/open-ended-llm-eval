Implementing food labelling schemes relating to biodiversity-friendly farming (including organic or LEAF marque) has no captured evidence for effects on farmland wildlife or bird populations [71, 170]. Providing or retaining set\u2011aside areas in farmland shows multiple studies from Europe and North America where more species or higher densities used set\u2011aside than crops, with some studies finding fewer species or lower densities; productivity effects were mixed, and naturally regenerated set\u2011aside held more birds and species than sown set\u2011aside [175].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
