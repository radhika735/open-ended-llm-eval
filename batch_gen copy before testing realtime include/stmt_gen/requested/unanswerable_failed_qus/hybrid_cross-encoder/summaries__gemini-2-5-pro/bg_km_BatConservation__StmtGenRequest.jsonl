One study in the UK found that retaining riparian buffers on agricultural land did not affect pipistrelle activity (2284).

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: Which combination of forestry management practices offers the best protection for bats during logging operations?\nanswer: Based on the available information, several forestry management practices have been studied for their impact on bat populations during logging operations.\n\nOne review in the Neotropics found that reduced-impact logging had a smaller effect on bat abundance compared to conventional logging [989]. Another study in Italy reported greater bat activity in two out of three sites where selective logging was used to open the forest canopy, while a study in Germany found similar bat activity and diversity in selectively and conventionally logged forests [989]. A study in Trinidad also noted that the composition of bat species was different between selectively logged and conventionally logged forests [989].\n\nRetaining forested corridors in logged areas has also been studied. One study in the USA found that bat activity was significantly higher along the edges of these corridors compared to the interiors or adjacent logged areas [996]. The same study also observed that Seminole bats were more likely to roost in forested corridors than in logged stands or mature forest, while another study found more male but fewer female evening bats roosting in corridors compared to logged stands [996].\n\nFor the practices of protecting roost trees during forest operations and retaining buffer zones around core habitats, no studies were found that evaluated their effects on bat populations [1982, 2028].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Eight studies evaluated the effects of breeding bats in captivity (2053). Six of these studies found that between 6% and 100% of female bats captured in the wild successfully conceived, gave birth, and reared young in captivity (2053). Seven studies found that 20-100% of bat pups born in captivity survived from between 10 days to adulthood (2053). One study found that two of five New Zealand lesser short-tailed bat pups born in captivity survived, both of which were hand-reared (2053).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

A review of programmes in the USA and Canada argues that education was not sufficient to change behaviour, although it was necessary as a catalytic factor for economic incentives and law enforcement (162). Two studies, one in Estonia and one in the UK, found that raising public awareness, along with other interventions, increased the numbers of natterjack toads and created 1,023 ponds for amphibians. A study in Mexico found that raising awareness among tourists increased their knowledge of axolotls, while another study in Taiwan found that holding press conferences to publicize frog conservation had no effect on a green tree frog project (831).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What is the most cost-effective method for creating artificial bat roosts?\nanswer: No studies were found that evaluated the cost-effectiveness of creating artificial bat roosts. One study in the UK found that the number of bats using an artificial hibernaculum increased in each of the nine years after it was built [2049]. Another study in the UK found that an artificial cave was used by a small number of brown long-eared bats [2049]. Three studies in Germany and the UK found that artificial hibernacula were used by up to four bat species [2049]. One study in the UK found that a roost reinstated by attaching the felled tree trunk to a nearby tree continued to be used by common noctule bats as a maternity roost [2048]. A review in the USA found that bat houses provided as alternative roosts during bridge replacement works were used by fewer Mexican free-tailed bats than the original roost at one site and were not used by bats at all at three sites [2942]. Two replicated studies in the USA and UK found that bats did not use any of the alternative roosts provided in bat houses or a purpose-built bat wall after exclusion from buildings [949]. Three studies in the USA and UK and one review in the UK found that bat boxes or bat lofts/barns were used by bats at 13-74% of development sites, and bat lofts/barns were used by maternity colonies at one of 19 development sites [949]. Three of five before-and-after studies in Portugal, Ireland, Spain and the UK found that bat colonies used purpose-built roosts in higher or similar numbers after the original roosts were destroyed [949]. The other two studies found that bats used purpose-built roosts in lower numbers than the original roost [949]. One review in the UK found that new bat boxes/lofts built to replace destroyed roosts were four times less likely to be used by returning bats than roosts retained during development [949]. A review in the USA found that spaces created in road bridges for roosting bats to replace those lost during bridge works were recolonized by bats in similar or greater numbers to the original roosts at four of eight sites [1967]. No studies were found that evaluated the effects of providing artificial subterranean bat roosts to replace roosts in reclaimed mines or disturbed caves on bat populations [974, 1005]. No evidence was found for the effects of providing bat boxes, bat grilles or improvements to roosts on farmland wildlife [95].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
