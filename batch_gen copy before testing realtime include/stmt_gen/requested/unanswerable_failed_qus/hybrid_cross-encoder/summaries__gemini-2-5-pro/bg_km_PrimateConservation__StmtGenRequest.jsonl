Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: How does the success rate of primate reintroduction programs vary between different continents?\nanswer: In Africa, a reintroduced chimpanzee population in Tanzania increased in size (1589). In Guinea and the Republic of Congo, most reintroduced chimpanzees survived for at least one to five years (1591). In Senegal, an infant chimpanzee was reunited with its mother (1589). In Uganda, a reintroduced chimpanzee repeatedly returned to human settlements (1591). In Madagascar and South Africa, a minority of primates survived for at least fifteen weeks to seven years (1591). In both Gabon and South Africa, a majority of primates survived for at least two months to one year (1591). The diet of reintroduced lemurs in Madagascar was found to overlap with that of wild lemurs (1596, 1591).\n\nIn Asia, primate populations in Thailand declined after reintroduction (1591, 1589). In Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam, a minority of primates survived for between two months and one year (1589), while another study in Vietnam found that half of the introduced primates survived after two months (1589). In Indonesia, reintroduced gibbons and other primates showed similar behavior and diets to wild populations (1589, 1591). A study in Malaysia found that a reintroduced orangutan population declined, though 98% of the orangutans survived the release (1589).\n\nIn South America, a minority of primates in Brazil and French Guiana survived for at least fifteen weeks to seven years (1591). A reintroduced primate population in Brazil declined (1589), but in other instances, an abandoned infant muriqui was reunited with its mother (1589), and a reintroduced muriqui rejoined a wild group (1591). In Brazil, a majority of primates survived for at least two months to one year (1591), and in another case, two out of three reintroduced black lion tamarins survived for over four months (1596). In French Guiana, a majority of primates survived for at least two months to one year (1591).\n\nIn Central America, a study in Belize found that the primate population increased five years after reintroduction (1591).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
