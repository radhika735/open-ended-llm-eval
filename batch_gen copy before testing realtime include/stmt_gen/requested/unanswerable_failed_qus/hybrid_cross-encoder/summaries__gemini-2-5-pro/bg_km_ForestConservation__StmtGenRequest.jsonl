Seventeen of 25 studies found that thinning trees in forests increased the density and cover of understory plants (1211). In contrast, four of seven studies found that logging trees in forests increased species richness and diversity of understory plants (1273), and five of ten studies found that logging trees in forests increased the density and cover of understory plants (1273). One replicated study in the USA found no effect of logging season on plant species richness and diversity (1216).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
