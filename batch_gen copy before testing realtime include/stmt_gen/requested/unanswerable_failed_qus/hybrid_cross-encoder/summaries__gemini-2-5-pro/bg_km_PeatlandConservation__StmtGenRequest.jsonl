It also prevented increases in plant species richness [1776]. No studies were found that evaluated the effects of using covers or barriers to control problematic plants on peatland vegetation [1775], or of physically damaging problematic plants [1769].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
