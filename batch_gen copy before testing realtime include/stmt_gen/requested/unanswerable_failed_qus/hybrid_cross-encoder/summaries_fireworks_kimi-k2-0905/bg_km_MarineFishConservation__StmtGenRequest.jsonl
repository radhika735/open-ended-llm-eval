Size-sorting mesh funnels (sieve nets) on prawn/shrimp trawls consistently reduced unwanted fish catches in North Sea studies (Action ID: 2722). Trawl gear modifications with size-sorting escape grids reduced unwanted catches in 6 of 16 studies, with effectiveness varying by fish species, light conditions, and net type (Action ID: 2728). Alternative fishing methods like traps showed mixed results, appearing to reduce unwanted catch but also reducing commercial catch in some cases (Action ID: 2142). Governance approaches showed promise: catch limits/quotas for non-commercial species reduced unwanted catch in 2 of 3 cases across Atlantic and Pacific Oceans (Action ID: 2693), and real-time catch information technology reduced unwanted catch in 2 of 3 cases in Pacific and Atlantic Oceans (Action ID: 3826). However, the documents lack specific cost-benefit analyses to determine which method is most economically efficient, focusing instead on biological effectiveness.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
