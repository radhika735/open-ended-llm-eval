2880: Treat wastewater from intensive livestock holdings
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Intensive agriculture constitutes a major source of pollution to marine and freshwater environments. Wastewater from intensive livestock holdings containing bacteria, excess nutrients, chemical residues, and solid particles can enter rivers and other watercourses and be discharged into the sea. Treating wastewater from intensive livestock holdings may reduce the pollution levels in aquatic environments, and therefore reduce the associated impacts on marine and freshwater mammals.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of treating wastewater from intensive livestock holdings on marine and freshwater mammal populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
