1612: Legally protect plant species affected by gathering
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Gathering of plants may involve removal of the whole plant (e.g. for sale as an ornamental species) or removal of plant parts, such as flowers or fruits. Gathering of certain species can be prohibited or limited by national legislation. In addition, international agreements such as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) can be used to control the trade of certain species, potentially reducing the motivation for their harvest.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of legally protecting the species affected by gathering on shrublands.

'We found no studiesâ€™ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches.
