3278: Facilitate tidal exchange before/after planting trees/shrubs: freshwater wetlands
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This action involves increasing the frequency or duration of flooding by tides in areas planted with marsh or swamp vegetation. Tidal exchange could be facilitated by breaching sea walls or embankments, installing or widening culverts, excavating tidal creeks, or opening/closing sluice gates. Tidal wetlands may be brackish/saline (e.g. mangroves, coastal marshes) or freshwater (e.g. at the upstream end of estuaries, as in the Mississippi, Yangtze, and Elbe rivers; Baldwin et al. 2009).
Related actions: Facilitate tidal exchange to restore degraded marshes; Facilitate tidal exchange to restore/create marshes from other land uses; Reprofile/relandscape before planting; Remove surface soil/sediment before planting.

Key Messages:
We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of facilitating tidal exchange in freshwater wetlands planted with trees/shrubs.
 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
