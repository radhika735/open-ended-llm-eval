3565: Use biodegradable materials to construct fishing gear to prevent entanglement of reptiles in lost or abandoned gear
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Abandoned, lost or otherwise discarded fishing gear (or ‘ghost’ gear) is a major threat to aquatic reptiles. Sea turtles in particular are at risk of becoming entangled in ‘ghost’ gear, such as nets, lines and ropes resulting in injury or death (Stelfox et al. 2016). Synthetic materials used for fishing gear, such as nylon, may persist for decades leading to an accumulation of ‘ghost’ gear in marine and freshwater environments. Biodegradable fishing gear, which is naturally broken down by microbes or ultraviolet light, may offer an alternative to traditional materials (Kim et al. 2016) and help to reduce the impact of ‘ghost’ gear on reptiles. The degraded products of biodegradable materials (carbon dioxide, methane, water) also have no impact on marine ecosystems, unlike synthetic materials which eventually degrade into microplastics.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on reptile populations of using biodegradable materials to construct fishing gear to prevent entanglement of reptiles in lost or abandoned gear.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
