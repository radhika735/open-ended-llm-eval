1912: Carnivores: Increase variety of food items
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
In the wild, animals have a varied diet due to food abundance and availability. In captive environments, the same food is routinely given, with little variety. Essential amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins and minerals may not be provided in one type of feed. The aim of a varied diet is to supply an animal with all nutrients essential for health, growth and maintenance.

Key Messages:

No evidence was captured on the effect of increasing the variety of food items on captive carnivores.
