3692: Protect nests and nesting sites from predation using visual deterrents
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
A range of visual deterrents, including flags, may be used to deter predators from approaching reptile nests and nesting sites. If successful, such deterrents could reduce incentives for carrying out lethal control of predators.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of protecting nests and nesting sites from predation using visual deterrents on reptile populations. This study was in Australia.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Reproductive success (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in Australia found that a similar number of loggerhead turtle nests marked with red flags were predated compared to those marked only with wooden stakes.

BEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)

Supporting Evidence:
A replicated, controlled study in 2014–2015 at one beach in south-eastern Queensland, Australia (Lei & Booth 2017) found that using red flags as a visual deterrent to predators of loggerhead turtle Caretta caretta nests did not reduce nest predation. The number of predated nests did not differ significantly between those marked with red flags (7 out of 10) and those marked with wooden stakes (10 out of 11). Yellow-spotted goannas Varanus panoptes were the most common predator of nests. In May 2014–June 2015, ten nests were each marked with a bright red canvas flag (30 x 40 cm) mounted on a 1.2 m high stake inserted 50 cm into the sand, 30 cm to the side of the nest. A further 11 nests were marked with only a wooden stake. All nests were visited daily in early December to the end of February 2014–2016 to record predation events.
