3088: Control problematic plants (multiple interventions): brackish/saline marshes or swamps
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This section considers control of problematic plants using &gt;3 separate interventions at once, such that it is difficult to attribute outcomes to any single specific intervention. Where three or fewer interventions have been used together in a study, it is included as evidence for each intervention elsewhere in the synopsis (whilst explicitly noting the use of multiple interventions in each summary paragraph).
For this section, “vegetation” refers to overall or non-target vegetation. Studies that only report responses of target problematic plants have not been summarized.

Key Messages:
We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of controlling problematic plants in brackish/saline marshes or swamps using &gt;3 combined interventions.
 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
