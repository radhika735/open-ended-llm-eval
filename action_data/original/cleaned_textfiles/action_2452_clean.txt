2452: Use mobile phone communications to warn farmers of problematic mammals (e.g. elephants)
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Farmers may be vulnerable to loss of crops from raids by wild herbivores or to loss of livestock to mammalian predators. The large growth in use of mobile phones makes it easier for farmers to communicate the presence of problem animals to others in the general area. This may allow faster responses in deployment of prevention measures (Lewis et al. 2016). If this reduces crop damage or livestock predation, it might also reduce incentives for lethal control of wild herbivores or predators.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of using mobile phone communications to warn farmers of problematic mammals (e.g. elephants).

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
