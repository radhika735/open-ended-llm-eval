2792: Deploy fishing gear at times when mammals are less active
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Deploying fishing gear during times when marine and freshwater mammals are less active may reduce the risk of entanglement and unwanted catch (‘bycatch’) of mammals. However, this intervention would not be feasible for fisheries where both mammals and the target species actively feed at the same time.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of deploying fishing gear at times when mammals are less active on marine and freshwater mammal populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
