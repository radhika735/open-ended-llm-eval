1898: Amphibians: Use artificial cloning from frozen or fresh tissue
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Conservation breeding programmes are being used more frequently for threatened amphibian species. However, captive breeding often results in loss of genetic variation. This may mean that animals bred for release to the wild have reduced fitness. Freezing, or ‘cryopreservation’, of sperm and eggs or tissue, allows them to be stored until they are needed. Gene banks can therefore be created for amphibians ensuring that species’ genetic variation is preserved. It also means that the number of a particular species needed in captivity can be reduced and genes can be swapped between captive facilities. Cloning is the process whereby organisms are artificially produced with identical genetic material to the single ancestor from which a tissue sample has been preserved. This technique could be used to produce clones of individuals from threatened or even extinct amphibian species for use in captive breeding or reintroduction projects.

Key Messages:

No evidence was captured for the effects of using artificial cloning from frozen or fresh tissue.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
