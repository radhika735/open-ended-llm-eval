3857: Enhance natural habitat to improve landscape connectivity to allow for range shifts 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Climate change threatens butterfly and moth species by shifting areas of suitable climatic conditions away from species’ historic ranges. For most species, this leads to areas at lower latitudes becoming less climatically suitable, and areas at higher latitudes becoming more suitable (Mason et al. 2015). To survive, butterfly and moth populations must be able to move polewards across the landscape, between suitable habitat patches, but this movement is hindered by habitat loss and fragmentation. Enhancing natural habitat to improve landscape connectivity may enable species to move, and adapt their distribution to cope with climate change.
For studies on improving habitat to facilitate elevational range shifts, see “Protect and connect habitat along elevational gradients”. For studies on creating habitat refuges for species less able to alter their distribution, see “Create microclimate and microhabitat refuges”.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of enhancing natural habitat to improve landscape connectivity and allow for range shifts.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
