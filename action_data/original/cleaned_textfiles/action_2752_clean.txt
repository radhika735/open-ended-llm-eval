2752: Reduce capacity of cooling water intake structures
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Marine or freshwater mammals may enter or be drawn into the cooling water intake structures of power plants, which may result in injury or death. Reducing the capacity of intake structures may prevent mammals from entering and becoming trapped.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of reducing capacity of cooling water intake structures on marine and freshwater mammal populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
