1942: Plant new hedges
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Hedgerows provide important commuting and foraging habitats for bats within open agricultural landscapes. Frey-Ehrenbold et al. (2013) found bat activity to be 1.4–2.8 times higher along linear features such as hedgerows than in open farmland areas, and one study in the UK found bats to be highly sensitive to the loss of hedgerows (Pocock & Jennings 2008). Planting new hedges within farmland may benefit bats. However, it will take a considerable amount of time for hedgerows to become established and sufficiently mature. Existing hedges should therefore be retained where possible. See ‘Manage hedges to benefit bats’. For studies that may carry out this intervention alongside other interventions to benefit bats on farmland, see ‘Pay farmers to cover the costs of conservation measures (e.g. agri-environment schemes)’.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of planting new hedges on bat populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
