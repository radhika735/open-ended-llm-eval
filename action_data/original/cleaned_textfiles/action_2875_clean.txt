2875: Set regulatory ban on marine burial of nuclear waste
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
The disposal of nuclear and radioactive waste at sea was practised by 13 countries from 1946 until 1993, when it was banned following international treaties. However, enforcement is lacking in parts of the world, where illegal dumping is reported to occur. Disposal within the sediment (sub-sea burial) is currently prohibited but has been proposed by various countries and may be an option in the future (Hollister & Nadis 1998). Setting pre-emptive regulatory bans on the sub-sea burial of nuclear waste may help prevent the occurrence of associated threats to marine mammals.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of setting a regulatory ban on marine burial of nuclear waste on marine mammal populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
