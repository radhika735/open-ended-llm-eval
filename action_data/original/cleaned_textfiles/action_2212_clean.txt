2212: Limit, cease or prohibit the discharge of waste effluents overboard from vessels
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Commercial, recreational, industrial, and military vessels can generate large amounts of liquid waste, such as sewage, grey waters, and bilge waters (Welles 2003). Discharge of these wastes overboard from vessels can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through the introduction of bacteria, excess nutrients, toxic substances and solid particles. Limiting, ceasing or prohibiting the discharge of waste overboard from vessels in an area can potentially reduce or stop the source of pollution and allow subtidal benthic invertebrates to recover over time. In many parts of the world, it is illegal to dispose of waste effluents into coastal waters or delimited zones, for instance following local bylaws.
Evidence for interventions related to the discharge of solid wastes overboard are summarised under “Threat: Pollution – Limit, cease or prohibit the discharge of solid waste overboard from vessels”.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of limiting, ceasing or prohibiting the discharge of waste effluents overboard from vessels on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.

 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
