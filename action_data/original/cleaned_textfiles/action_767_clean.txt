767: Treat amphibians with chytridiomycosis in the wild or pre-release
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Studies investigating the effects of treating amphibians in captivity are discussed in ‘Use antifungal skin bacteria or peptides to reduce infection’, ‘Use antifungal treatment to reduce infection’, ‘Use antibacterial treatment to reduce infection’ and ‘Use temperature treatment to reduce infection’.

Key Messages:


One before-and-after study in Mallorca found that treating wild midwife toads with fungicide, along with pond drying, reduced infection levels but did not eradicate chytridiomycosis.


 
 

Supporting Evidence:
A before-and-after study in 2009–2010 in a pond in Mallorca (Lubick 2010) found that treating wild midwife toads Alytes muletensis with a fungicide, along with drying out the pond, reduced the prevalence but did not eradicate chytridiomycosis. All samples from tadpoles came back positive for the chytrid fungus the spring after treatment and pond drying. However, the number of spores detected on each swab was lower than the previous year, suggesting a lower level of infection. Healthy-looking toads were seen breeding in the pond following treatment. Over 2,000 toad tadpoles were removed from the pond in March–August 2009. The pond was emptied and left to dry over the summer. Tadpoles were taken to a laboratory and given daily five minute baths in the fungicide itraconazole for one week. They were held in captivity for up to seven months. Once the pond refilled in autumn, tadpoles were released. The following spring tadpoles were swabbed to test for chytridiomycosis.
