2876: Introduce and enforce water quality regulations for aquaculture systems
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Aquaculture systems may discharge water with waste and effluents into aquatic environments causing pollution and habitat degradation with adverse impacts on marine and freshwater mammals. Typical wastes include faeces, excess feed and nutrients, and chemicals, such as disinfectants, antifoulants, pesticides, herbicides, and drugs for disease control. Current water quality regulations at aquaculture systems vary widely between different countries, and some have no or very few regulations in place. Introducing and enforcing water quality regulations for aquaculture systems may reduce pollution and harmful impacts on marine and freshwater mammals.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of introducing and enforcing water quality regulations for aquaculture systems on marine and freshwater mammal populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
