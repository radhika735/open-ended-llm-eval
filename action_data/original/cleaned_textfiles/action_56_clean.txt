56: Introduce mated females to small populations to improve genetic diversity
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:


Key Messages:
One trial in Brazil showed that genetic diversity can be maintained in small isolated populations of stingless bees Melipona scutellaris by regularly introducing inseminated queens.
Â 

Supporting Evidence:
Carvalho (2001) established a small isolated population of the Brazilian stingless bee Melipona scutellaris, based on 22 wild-collected colonies. She introduced between three and 13 inseminated queens each year over four consecutive years, and found that the small population retained diversity in its sex allele over nine years. It did not increase its production of sterile diploid males or collapse to extinction, as might have been expected. Carvalho recommends exchange of inseminated queens between beekeepers as a way to ensure the survival of small meliponiaries.
