Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:


Key Messages:
Soil organisms (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study from Italy found more microbial biomass in plots with buffers.

Supporting Evidence:
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in (1997–2010) in a maize field in the Po Valley, Italy, found more organic matter, nitrogen, and microbial biomass in buffered plots, compared to unbuffered plots. Soil organisms: More microbial biomass (measured as carbon) was found in buffered plots, in six of eight comparisons (316–566 vs 257 mg/kg dry soil), and more microbial biomass (measured as nitrogen) was found in two of eight comparisons (40–47 vs 27 mg/kg dry soil). Methods: Maize plots had grass buffers (3 m grass: tall fescue Festuca arudinacea), grass and woody buffers (3 m grass with one tree row; 6 m grass with one tree row; 6 m grass with two tree rows), or no buffers (two replicates of each plot). Trees included guelder-rose Viburnum opulus and London sycamore Platanus hybrida. Plots were ploughed (35–40 cm depth) and harrowed before sowing crops. Fertilizers were applied (April: 400 kg/ha of NPK; May: 450 kg/ha of urea). Grass buffers were mown twice a year in growing season (residues were not removed) and tree offshoots were removed. Trees were coppiced in 2003 and 2010. Soil samples were taken (0–15 cm) in April and October 2010.
