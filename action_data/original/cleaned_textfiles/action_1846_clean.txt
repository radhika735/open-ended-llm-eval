1846: Raise awareness amongst the public (problematic species)
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
The public could be educated about the importance of peatlands, threats they face and what can be done to protect them. Messages could be conveyed through information boards, talks, art projects, adverts, leaflets, celebrity endorsements and social media. This section considers biosecurity to prevent the spread of problematic species, including the creation of ‘black lists’ or ‘alert species’ to which particular attention should be paid.
Key peatland types for which this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: raise awareness through engaging volunteers in peatland management or monitoring; provide education/training programmes about peatlands.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of interventions to raise awareness about problematic species on knowledge, behaviour, peatland habitats or peatland vegetation.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
