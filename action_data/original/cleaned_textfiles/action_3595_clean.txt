3595: Set regulatory ban on marine burial of persistent environmental pollutants, including nuclear waste
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Historically, a range of persistent environmental pollutants have been intentionally disposed of in the marine environment.  The disposal of nuclear and radioactive waste at sea was practised by 13 countries from 1946 until 1993, and other pollutants, including the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), have been disposed of at sea in large quantities. A range of national laws and international treatise have sought to end the disposal of such pollutants into the marine environment, though enforcement is lacking in parts of the world, where illegal dumping is reported to occur. Setting pre-emptive regulatory bans on the sub-sea burial of persistent environmental pollutants may help prevent the occurrence of associated threats to aquatic and semi-aquatic reptiles.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on reptile populations of setting regulatory bans on marine burial of persistent environmental pollutants, including nuclear waste.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
