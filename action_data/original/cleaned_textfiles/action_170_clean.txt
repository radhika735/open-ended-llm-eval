170: Food labelling schemes relating to biodiversity-friendly farming
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Food from many parts of the world now carries certification labels such as the LEAF Marque (Integrated Farm Management) or Rainforest Alliance, or labelling for shade-grown coffee or chocolate. These schemes are designed to allow biodiversity-friendly farming to attract a price premium, become more profitable and therefore spread, potentially benefiting biodiversity.

Key Messages:

We captured no evidence for the effects of food labelling schemes on bird populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
