1496: Close non-essential roads as soon as logging operations are complete
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Uncontrolled roads threaten primate populations through providing access for poaching and forest encroachment (e.g. Laurance et al. 2009), and because they promote habitat loss, fragmentation, and wildfires. Therefore, to promote primate conservation in logging concessions, it is critical that logging companies close non-essential roads as soon as logging operations are complete.

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of closing non-essential roads as soon as logging operations are complete on primate populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
