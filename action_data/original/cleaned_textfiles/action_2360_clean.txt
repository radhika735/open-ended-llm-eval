2360: (CFT) Wetland birds: Cut, mow and/or graze to maintain early succession (22e)
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:


Key Messages:
Birds (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in grasslands in the USA found higher densities of dabbling duck nests, but similar nesting success, in cattle-grazed plots, compared to ungrazed plots.

Supporting Evidence:
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 1995–1997 in pastures in central California, USA, found that more dabbling ducks Anas sp. nested in rotationally grazed fields, compared to ungrazed fields, in one of two years. Birds: Nesting densities were higher in grazed fields, compared to ungrazed fields in 1996 (2.2 nests/ha vs 0.6, 4 replicates) but not in 1997 (0.7 vs 0.4). Nest success did not differ between grazed and ungrazed fields (5% success vs 3%). Methods: Half of each field (10–14 ha) was grazed by 70 cows and calves for 7–15 days at a time in July–November 1995–1996, after the duck nesting period. Fields were also mown at various times outside the nesting period to control milk thistles Silybum marianum and star thistles Centaurea solstitialis.
