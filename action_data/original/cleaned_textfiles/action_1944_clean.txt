1944: Manage ditches to benefit bats
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Ditches, particularly those with still water, may provide foraging habitats for bats within farmed landscapes. Intensive agriculture can result in loss of ditch biodiversity through activities such as mowing, grazing and the use of fertilizer and pesticides. Management practices that maintain and increase the diversity of invertebrate species within ditches may benefit bats. For studies that may carry out this intervention alongside other interventions to benefit bats on farmland, see ‘Pay farmers to cover the costs of conservation measures (e.g. agri-environment schemes)’.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of managing ditches to benefit bat populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
