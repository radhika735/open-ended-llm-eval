2312: (CFT) Predatory invertebrates: Use reduced tillage (15e,16e)
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:


Key Messages:
Natural enemy numbers (1 study): One replicated, controlled study from the USA found similar numbers of predatory mites in soils with reduced tillage or conventional tillage.

Supporting Evidence:
A replicated, controlled study in 1993–2006 in an irrigated tomato-corn field in Davis, California, USA, found similar numbers of natural enemies in soils with reduced tillage or conventional tillage. Natural enemy numbers: Similar numbers of predatory mites were found in soils with reduced tillage or conventional tillage (8–12 vs 5–7 individuals/100 g fresh soil). Methods: Conventional tillage or reduced tillage was used on six plots each (0.4 ha plots). Plots were tilled about five times/year (conventional) or two times/year (reduced; depth not reported). All plots were irrigated. Half of the plots were fertilized, and compost was added to the other half. Soil samples were collected eight times in March 2005–November 2006 (three samples/plot). Mites were sampled with soil cores (5 cm diameter, 10 cm depth).
