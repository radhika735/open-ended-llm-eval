3647: Protect habitat along elevational gradients 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Global warming is prompting poleward and uphill shifts in species’ ranges (e.g. Chen et al. 2011). Species reliant on particular habitats may suffer population declines if they are unable to move towards higher latitudes and if there is no suitable habitat available at higher altitudes. Protecting habitat along elevational gradients may allow reptiles to naturally expand their ranges with climatic changes.
For other studies focusing on the impacts of protecting habitat on reptiles, see Habitat Protection.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of protecting habitat along elevational gradients on reptile populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
