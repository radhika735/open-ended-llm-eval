3685: Leash or restrict domestic dog movements in reptile habitats 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Domestic dogs Canis lupus familiaris are known to harass and predate on reptiles or their eggs, including lizards, turtles and snakes (Ruiz-Izaguirre et al. 2015, Weston & Stankowich 2013). Leashing domesticated dogs or restricting their movements may reduce the impact they have on reptile populations.
