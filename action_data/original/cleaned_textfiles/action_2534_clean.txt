2534: Remove/control non-native species that could interbreed with native species
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Hybridisation of non-native mammals with closely related native species can threaten local populations (e.g. Biedrzycka et al. 2020; Nussberger et al. 2014). Attempts may be made to reduce the risk through carrying out lethal control of the non-native species. The strategy can be difficult to execute, due to difficulties in separating hybrids from parent species.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on mammals of removing or controlling non-native species that could interbreed with native species.

'We found no studies' means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
