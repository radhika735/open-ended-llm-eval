46: Exclude ants from solitary bee nesting sites
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:


Key Messages:
One replicated controlled trial showed that excluding ants from solitary nests of the endemic Australian bee Exonuera nigrescens increased production of offspring.
 

Supporting Evidence:
In a replicated controlled trial in Cobboboonee State Forest, Victoria, Australia, 50 single female nests of the endemic allodapine bee Exonuera nigrescens were protected from ants using two plastic cups and the sticky barrier Tanglefoot (Zammit et al. 2008). Fifty control nests were not protected. The nests, made in old flowering stems of the grass tree Xanthorrhoea, were set out in groups of four, one protected and one unprotected. Protected nests were more productive, with an average of 3.6 young per adult female, compared to 1.6 young per adult female in control nests.
