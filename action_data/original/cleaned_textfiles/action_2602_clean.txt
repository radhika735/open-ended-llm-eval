BEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)

Supporting Evidence:
A before-and-after study in 1922â€“1932 in Sweden (Swenson et al. 1995) found that after the banning of private ownership of hunted bears, fewer brown bears Ursus arctos were reported killed. Fewer brown bears were reported killed during the five years after the private ownership of hunted bears was banned (average 0.8 bears/county/year) than during the five years before the ban (8.2 bears/county/year). All killed brown bears became state property in 1927. Numbers of bears killed in 1922-1932 were obtained from national harvesting records.
