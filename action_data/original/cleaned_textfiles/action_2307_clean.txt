Soil organisms (16 studies)

Microbial biomass (15 studies): Eleven replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Italy, Spain, and the USA found more microbial biomass in soils with reduced tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in some comparisons. Two replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Spain and Syria found less microbial biomass in soils with reduced tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in some comparisons. Two replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Spain found similar amounts of microbial biomass in soils with reduced tillage or conventional tillage, in all comparisons.
Bacteria (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study from Spain found more denitrifying bacteria in soils with reduced tillage, compared to conventional tillage.
Other soil organisms (2 studies): One replicated, controlled study from the USA found similar numbers of mites and nematodes, but differences in mite and nematode communities, in soils with reduced tillage, compared to conventional tillage. One replicated site comparison from the USA found more earthworms in fields with fewer passes of the plough, in one of three comparisons.


Supporting Evidence:
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 1994–2011 in a rainfed cereal-legume field near Madrid, Spain more soil organisms in soils with reduced tillage, compared to conventional tillage. Soil organisms: More bacteria were found in soils with reduced tillage, compared to conventional tillage (denitrifying bacteria: 108 vs 106 gene copies), but no difference in microbial biomass (measured as carbon) was found (186 vs 94 mg C/kg soil). Methods: No tillage or reduced tillage was used on three plots each (10 x 25 m), in October. A chisel plough and a cultivator were used for reduced tillage (15 cm depth). A mouldboard plough and a cultivator were used for conventional tillage (20 cm depth). Soil and greenhouse-gas samples were collected 1–12 times/month, in November 2010–October 2011, in the vetch phase of a fallow-wheat-vetch-barley rotation (soil cores: 0–15 cm depth, 2.5 cm diameter; closed chambers: 19.3 cm height, 35.6 cm diameter, 20 mL gas samples, 0–60 minutes after chamber closure). The vetch was not fertilized.
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 1991–2010 in rainfed wheat-sunflower-pea fields near Seville, Spain found fewer soil organisms. Soil organisms: Less microbial biomass (measured as carbon) was found in soils with reduced tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in one of ten comparisons (in autumn, 1–2 mm aggregates: 67 vs 107 g microbial C/kg organic C). Methods: Reduced tillage or conventional tillage was used on three plots each (300 m2 plots). A mouldboard plough (25–30 cm depth), a cultivator (15–20 cm depth, two passes), and a disc harrow (5–7 cm depth) were used for conventional tillage. A chisel plough (15–20 cm depth, every other year) and a disc harrow (5–7 cm depth) were used for reduced tillage, and crop residues were retained (&gt;60% cover). Wheat, sunflowers, and peas were grown in rotation. Wheat was fertilized, but sunflowers and peas were not. Soil samples were collected in spring and autumn 2010 (0–10 cm depth, five samples/plot).
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 1994–2013 in a rainfed field near Madrid, Spain found more soil organisms in soils with reduced tillage, compared to conventional tillage. Soil organisms: More microbial biomass (measured as carbon) was found in plots with reduced tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in three of 12 comparisons (380–400 vs 200–250 mg C/kg soil). Methods: Conventional tillage or reduced tillage was used on eight plots each (10 x 25 m plots). A mouldboard plough was used for both conventional tillage (25 cm depth) and reduced tillage (20 cm depth). Wheat was grown on half of the plots, whereas wheat, vetch, and barley were grown in rotation on the other half. Wheat and barley were fertilized. Crop residues were shredded and retained. Soil sam  ples were collected six times in October 2010–April 2013 (soil cores, 0–15 cm depth, 5 cm diameter).
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 1991–2011 in rainfed wheat-sunflower-pea fields near Seville, Spain, found more soil organisms in soils with twenty years of reduced tillage, compared to conventional tillage. Soil organisms: More microbial biomass (measured as carbon) was found in soils with reduced tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in one of three comparisons, in long-term plots (1991–2011, 0–5 cm depth: 580 vs 474 mg C/kg soil), but no differences were found in short-term plots (2008–2011: 740–958 vs 689–868 mg C/kg soil). Methods: Reduced tillage or conventional tillage was used on three plots each, in each of two experiments: a short-term experiment (2008–2011, 20 x 9 m plots), and a long-term experiment (1991–2011, 20 x 14 m plots). A mouldboard plough (25–30 cm depth), a cultivator (15–20 cm depth, two passes), and a disc harrow (15 cm depth) were used for conventional tillage. A chisel plough (15–20 cm depth, every other year) and a disc harrow (5–7 cm depth) were used for reduced tillage, and crop residues were retained (&gt;60% cover). Soil samples were collected in January 2011 (0–25 cm depth, five samples/plot).
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 2008–2010 in a rainfed wheat-vetch field in southwest Spain found more soil organisms in soils with reduced tillage, compared to conventional tillage. Soil organisms: More microbial biomass (measured as carbon) was found in soils with reduced tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in four of five comparisons (in soil aggregates &lt;2 mm in diameter: 526–646 vs 339–346 g C/kg soil). Methods: Conventional tillage or reduced tillage was used on three plots each (300 m2 plots), in 2008–2009. From 1999–2008, no tillage was used on all plots. A mouldboard plough (25 cm depth, in 2008), or a chisel plough (10–15 cm depth, in 2009), and a disk harrow were used for conventional tillage, and crop residues were removed (in 2008 and 2010).

A mouldboard plough (20 cm depth) was used for both conventional tillage (6–8 ploughings/year) and reduced tillage (one ploughing/year, plus hoeing to control weeds). Compost was added to all plots (15–30 t/ha/year). Soil samples were collected in May 2009 (five sub-samples/plot, 0–20 cm depth).
A replicated, controlled study in 1993–2006 in an irrigated tomato-corn field in Davis, California, USA, found similar numbers of soil organisms, but different communities of soil organisms, in plots with reduced tillage, compared to conventional tillage. Soil organisms: Similar numbers of mites and nematodes were found in soils with reduced tillage or conventional tillage (596–888 vs 527–797 individuals/100 g fresh soil). However, the composition of nematode and mite communities differed between soils with reduced tillage or conventional tillage (reported as distance in multivariate space). Methods: Conventional tillage or reduced tillage was used on six plots each (0.4 ha plots). Plots were tilled about five times/year (conventional) or two times/year (reduced; depth not reported). All plots were irrigated. Half of the plots were fertilized, and compost was added to the other half. Soil samples were collected eight times in March 2005–November 2006 (three samples/plot). Mites were sampled with soil cores (5 cm diameter, 10 cm depth). Nematodes were sampled in soil cubes (20 x 20 x 20 cm).

Soil samples were collected in March 2006 (0–25 cm depth).
A replicated site comparison in 2004–2005 in 16 irrigated tomato fields in the Sacramento Valley, California, USA, found more earthworms in fields with fewer passes of the plough. Soil organisms: More earthworms were found in fields with fewer passes of the plough in the year before they were sampled, in one of three comparisons (individual earthworm biomass; data reported as model results). Methods: Earthworms were collected from 16 tomato fields, in February–April 2005. In 2004, these fields had different numbers of tillage operations (3–10 passes of the plough). Five fields were cover cropped, and seven were mulched with crop residues. All fields were fertilized and irrigated.
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 1992–2005 in a rainfed wheat-sunflower-pea field near Seville, Spain, found more soil organisms in soils with reduced tillage, compared to conventional tillage. Soil organisms: More microbial biomass (measured as carbon) was found in soils with reduced tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in one of six comparisons (0–5 cm depth, November 2004: 316 vs 183 mg C/kg soil). Methods: Conventional tillage or reduced tillage was used on three plots each (22 x 14 m plots).

A chisel plough (25–30 cm depth), a disc harrow (5–7 cm depth), and herbicide were used for reduced tillage. Wheat, sunflowers, and peas were grown in rotation. Wheat was fertilized, but sunflowers and peas were not. Soil samples were collected in November 2004 and December 2005 (0–25 cm depth, two samples/plot).
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 1998–2000 in an irrigated vegetable field in the Salinas Valley, California, USA, found more microbial biomass in soils with reduced tillage, compared to conventional tillage. Soil organisms: More microbial biomass (measured as carbon) was found in soils with reduced tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in two of 16 comparisons (120–130 vs 90–100 μg C/g soil). More microbial biomass (measured as nitrogen) was found in soils with reduced tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in three of 16 comparisons (12–15 vs 5–8 μg N/g soil). Methods: There were four plots (0.52 ha), for each of four treatments (reduced tillage or conventional tillage, with or without added organic matter). In plots with added organic matter, compost was added two times/year, and a cover crop (Merced rye) was grown every autumn or winter. Lettuce or broccoli crops were grown in raised beds. Sprinklers and drip irrigation were used in all plots. Soils were disturbed to different depths (conventional tillage: disking to 50 cm depth, cultivating, sub-soiling, bed re-making, and bed-shaping; reduced tillage: cultivating to 20 cm depth, rolling, and bed-shaping). Soils were collected, along the planting line, with 6 cm soil cores.
