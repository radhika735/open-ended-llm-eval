771: Create walls or barriers to exclude pollutants
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
In some situations it may be possible to install barriers to prevent pollutants reaching habitat that supports amphibians.
 

Key Messages:

One controlled study in Mexico found that installing filters across canals to improve water quality and exclude fish increased weight gain in axolotls.

 

Supporting Evidence:
A controlled study in 2009 of canals within agricultural land in Xochimilco,  Mexico (Valiente et al. 2010) found that installing filters to improve water quality and exclude competitive fish increased weight gain in axolotls Ambystoma mexicanum. Only four of 12 previously marked axolotls were recaptured; however, their weight had increased by 16%. Weight gain was greater than that of axolotls in control colonies over the same period. After four months, water was significantly lower in ammonia (77%), nitrates (87%) and turbidity (15%) compared to control canals. Working with farmers in 2009, a canal used as a refuge by axolotls was isolated from the main system using filters made of wood to exclude fish and improve water quality. Farmers benefited from improved farm products with the improved water quality and the protection of traditional agriculture.
