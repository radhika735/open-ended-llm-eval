2685: Selectively avoid unwanted fish based on temperature distribution
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Multispecies fisheries are often managed on a quota system whereby fishers must avoid vulnerable or weak stocks while trying to maintain catches of stronger stocks. One way to do this may be to selectively avoid fish based on differences in distribution between non-target and target species caused by oceanographic features such as temperature. Temperature influences the distribution and abundance of fish seasonally, not only at different geographical locations, but also throughout the water column at different depths. Based on this, Dunn et al. 2016 suggested that unwanted Atlantic cod could largely be avoided in the spring in the North Atlantic Ocean, when their distribution differed from 38–54% of other species.
Evidence for similar interventions is summarized under ‘Deployment of fishing gear and mode of operation - Deploy fishing gear at selected times (day/night) to avoid unwanted species’ and ‘Deploy fishing gear at selected depths to avoid unwanted species’.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of selectively avoiding fish by their temperature distributions on marine fish populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
