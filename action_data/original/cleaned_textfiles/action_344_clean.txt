344: Add woody debris to forests
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
If large amounts of wood are available, then it may be possible to deliver the benefits of having woody debris in forests without having to damage the trees themselves.
 

Key Messages:
A randomised, replicated, controlled study from Australia found that brown treecreeper numbers were higher in plots with large amounts of dead wood added, compared to control plots or those with less debris added.
 

Supporting Evidence:
In Gunbower State Forest, Victoria, Australia, a randomised, replicated, controlled study (MacNally et al. 2002) found that brown treecreeper Climacteris picumnus numbers were consistently higher in plots of red river gum Eucalyptus camaldulensis forest with coarse woody debris (aged fallen wood &gt;10 cm in diameter) added to them, compared to control plots (1.5-2.2 birds/ha in plots with 40-80 Mg/ha or more of debris added vs. 0.6 and 0.4 birds/ha for 20 Mg/ha and no debris added treatments). Birds appeared not to discriminate between logs and tree crowns.
