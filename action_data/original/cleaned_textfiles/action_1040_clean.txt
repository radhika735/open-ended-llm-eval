1040: American bullfrog control: Biological control of co-occurring beneficial species
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
American bullfrog populations can benefit from the presence of other species, such as invasive fishes. Reducing the population of co-occurring beneficial species in localised populations, and limiting their spread or intentional introduction, may offer a tool for managing and reducing bullfrog populations.  For example, one replicated, controlled field experiment in Oregon, USA found that the invasive bluegill sunfish increased the survival rate of bullfrog tadpoles by reducing the abundance of native aeshnid dragonfly nymphs (Adams et al. 2003).  Treatments consisted of either one bluegill or no fish plus either twelve recently hatched aeshnid dragon fly nymphs and three aeshnid dragonfly nymphs close to metamorphosis, or no nymph).  Fifty bullfrog tadpoles were added to each enclosure. This was a three year study during which 85 ponds and wetlands were surveyed.

Key Messages:

No evidence was captured on the effects of removing co-occurring beneficial species on the control of American bullfrogs.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
