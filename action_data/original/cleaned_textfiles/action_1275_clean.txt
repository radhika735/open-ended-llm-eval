1275: <i>Crassula helmsii</i>: Use hot water to control plants
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Treatment with hot water can kill Crassula helmsii (Anderson et al. 2015), and could potentially be used to control small local patches of the plant. However, if it opens up bare patches of earth, this may provide suitable conditions for recolonization by C. helmsii (Ewald 2014).
Treatment of equipment with hot water to prevent spread is discussed in ‘Decontamination to prevent spread’.  Studies that used hot foam to control C. helmsii are described in ‘Use hot foam’.

Key Messages:

We found no evidence on the use of hot water to control Crassula helmsii.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
