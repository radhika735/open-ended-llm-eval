1839: Use fences or barriers to protect planted vegetation
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Small plants introduced to peatlands may be vulnerable to grazing by livestock or wild herbivores. Barriers could be used to exclude these animals. We consider all kinds of barriers in this section, from those erected around plants (e.g. fences and tree guards) to those placed on plants (e.g. copper strips to deter slugs and snails, and sticky/oily substances that may be applied to tree trunks). Barriers erected around individual plants (e.g. tree guards) may also offer some protection against desiccation, sunlight, temperature fluctuations and strong winds.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: use fences or barriers to protect peatland vegetation in general, by excluding livestock or wild herbivores.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of using fences or barriers to protect planted peatland vegetation.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
