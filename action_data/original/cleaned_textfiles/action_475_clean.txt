475: Use artificial visual and auditory stimuli to induce breeding in wild populations 
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Some species that nest in colonies may require a ‘critical mass’ of individuals to be present before breeding behaviour is stimulated. If this is the case, it might be possible to help very small populations (beneath this threshold) to breed by using decoys and vocalisations to stimulate courtship behaviours.
 

Key Messages:
A single small study from the British Virgin Islands found that there was an increase in breeding behaviour in a small population of Caribbean flamingos Phoenicopterus ruber following the introduction of visual and auditory stimulants.
 

Supporting Evidence:
A small before-and-after study in the British Virgin Islands, Caribbean in 1992 (O\'Connell-Rodwell et al. 2004) found there was an increase in group display and nest-building behaviour in a population of six (two females, four males) Caribbean flamingos Phoenicopterus ruber, following the introduction of ten life-sized flamingo decoys, eight artificially constructed mud nests (some with artificial eggs) and the playback of recordings of display vocalisations (3.6% of behavioural records in the two weeks after stimuli introduction were related to group display vs. no records in 12 hours before stimuli introduction).
