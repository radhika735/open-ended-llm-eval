1012: Cull bats infected with white-nose syndrome
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Culling of bats infected with white-nose syndrome has been considered as a possible means of reducing transmission and slowing the spread of the disease. However, this has not been tested and simulation modelling indicates that culling is unlikely to be an effective method to control the spread of white-nose syndrome (Hallam & McCracken 2011).

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of culling bats infected with white-nose syndrome on bat populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
