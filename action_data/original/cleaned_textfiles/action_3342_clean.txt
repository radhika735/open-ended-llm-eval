3342: Plant non-woody plants into moisture-retaining peat pots: brackish/saline wetlands
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Pots made from compressed peat can retain moisture during dry periods, which may improve survival or growth rates of planted marsh or swamp plants. Focal plants could be grown in peat pots in nurseries then planted with the pot in the field. Alternatively, peat pots could be inserted into the soil before planting. Caution: Extracting peat to produce peat pots could damage natural peatlands.

Key Messages:
We found no studies that evaluated the effects of using moisture-retaining peat pots when planting emergent, non-woody vegetation in brackish/saline wetlands.
 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
