A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 1995–1999 in arable farmland in southern Turkey found more organic matter and greater stability in soils with organic fertilizer, compared to inorganic fertilizer. Organic matter: More organic matter was found in soils with compost, compared to mineral fertilizer, at one of two depths (0–15 cm: 1.8% vs 1.7%). Similar amounts of organic matter were found in soils with manure, compared to mineral fertilizer (1.6–1.8% vs 1.6%). Soil erosion and aggregation: Larger particles were found in soils with compost, compared to mineral fertilizer, at one of two depths (0–15 cm: 0.38 vs 0.27 mm mean weight diameter). Larger particles were found in soils with manure, compared to mineral fertilizer (0.38–0.43 vs 0.19–0.29 mm mean weight diameter). Methods: There were three plots (10 x 20 m) for each of three treatments: cattle manure (25 t/ha), compost (25 t/ha), or mineral fertilizer (160 kg N/ha, 26 kg P/ha, 83 kg P/ha). The compost was made of grass, stubble, and leaves. Wheat, sweet peppers, maize, and wheat were grown in rotation. Soils were sampled in 1999, after harvesting the last wheat crop (0–30 cm depth). Wet sieving was used to determine mean weight diameter.

A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 2003–2005 in farmland in the Sele river plain, Italy, found more organic matter and more carbon dioxide in organically fertilized soils, compared to inorganically fertilized soils. Organic matter: More organic matter was found in organically fertilized soils, compared to inorganically fertilized soils, in five of 18 comparisons (greenhouse, 45 t compost/ha: 30 vs 26 mg organic C/kg dry soil; open field, 30–45 t compost/ha: 10–12 vs 8). Greenhouse gases: More carbon dioxide was found in organically fertilized soils, compared to inorganically fertilized soils, in a greenhouse (0.9–1.2 vs 0.7 μg CO2/g dry soil/hour), but there were no significant differences in an open field (0.8–1.4 vs 0.9). Methods: At each of two sites (unheated tunnel greenhouse with 24 m2 plots, or open field with 70 m2 plots), there were three replicates for each of four treatments (15, 30, or 45 t compost/ha, in March–April each year, or NPK fertilizer with 260–325 kg N/ha, 160–320 kg P2O5/ha, 140–310 kg K2O/ha). The compost was made from municipal food waste and yard trimmings. Crops were grown in rotation (greenhouse: tomatoes, beans, lettuce; open field: tomatoes or eggplants, endive and/or broccoli sprouts). Soil samples (five/plot, 0–20 cm depth) were collected three times/year before the crops were harvested (greenhouse: spring, autumn, winter; open field: summer, autumn, winter). Organic carbon was measured in winter samples (residual carbon). Carbon dioxide (soil respiration) was measured in all samples.

Soil erosion and aggregation: Similar amounts of aggregation were found in soils with organic or inorganic fertilizer (1.2 vs 1.4 mm mean weight diameter). Greenhouse gases: Lower nitrous oxide emissions were found in soils with organic fertilizer, compared to inorganic fertilizer, in two of seven comparisons (emissions not reported for all comparisons; the highest emissions were found in plots with conventional tillage: 40 g N2O–N/ha/day). Methods: Organic or inorganic fertilizer was used on six plots each (1.5 x 1.0 m plots). Urea was added to inorganically-fertilized plots (April: 60 kg N/ha; May: 200 kg N/ha). On organically-fertilized plots, inorganic fertilizer was replaced, every other year, with the residues of legume cover crops (100 kg N/ha). Soil samples were collected with soil cores (two cores/plot, 4 cm diameter, 0–15 cm depth), when the maize was harvested (September). Greenhouse-gas emissions were measured with closed chambers (March–September, every three week). Maize was sown at different times (organically-fertilized plots: March; inorganically-fertilized plots: May), and different amounts of nitrogen were applied. It was not clear whether these results were direct effects of differences in the type of fertilizer (organic or inorganic), the amount of fertilizer, or the planting date.

The most recent studies included in this meta–analysis were published in 2011. 
A meta-analysis from 2013 of studies in Mediterranean climates found that nitrous oxide emissions from soils were lower after adding organic fertilizer, compared to synthetic fertilizer. Greenhouse gases: Nitrous oxide emissions were 23% lower after adding organic fertilizer, compared to synthetic fertilizer. Implementation options: Nitrous oxide emissions were lower after adding solid organic fertilizer, but not liquid organic fertilizer, compared to synthetic fertilizer (solid: 28% lower; liquid: 8% lower). Methods: Solid organic fertilizers included cover-crop residues, manure, composed manure, composted municipal solid waste, and composted thick fractions of digested pig slurries. Liquid organic fertilizers included raw or digested pig slurries. Synthetic fertilizers included ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulfate, urea, and NPK. Eight studies were included in the meta-analysis. These studies were found by searching the Web of Knowledge database, using the terms “nitrous oxide” or “N2O” and “emission” and “Mediterranean” or the name of a country with a Mediterranean climate, and also by searching the references in the publications that were found.

A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 1996–2011 in a vineyard in Navarra, Spain, found more organic matter and nutrients, and higher greenhouse-gas emissions, in plots with organic fertilizer, compared to inorganic fertilizer. Organic matter: More organic matter was found in plots with organic fertilizer, compared to inorganic fertilizer, in one of three comparisons (SMC compost: 1.8% vs 1.1%). Nutrients: More nitrogen (in two of three comparisons: 0.1% vs 0.06%), phosphorus (65–81 vs 29 mg/kg), and potassium (potassium oxide, in one of three comparisons: 474 vs 253 mg/kg) were found in soils with organic fertilizer, compared to inorganic fertilizer. Soil organisms: Similar bacteria communities were found in all plots, for 11 of 12 bacteria genera. However, in plots fertilized with compost, a lower percentage of RNA sequences came from Nitrosporia or Nitrosolobus species (0.0–0.1%), compared to plots fertilized with inorganic fertilizer (0.2%). Greenhouse gases: Higher greenhouse-gas emissions were found in plots with organic fertilizer, compared to inorganic fertilizer (1,591–1,745 vs 1,053 kg CO2 equivalent/ha, cumulative over 115 days after fertilizer). Similar nitrous oxide emissions were found in plots with organic or inorganic fertilizer (1.8–5.1 g N2O-N/ha/day, 15 days after fertilizer). Methods: Three types of organic fertilizer (compost) were compared with one mineral fertilizer (MIN): pelletized organic compost (PEL), compost from the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OF-MSW), and sheep-manure compost (SMC). Each treatment was assigned to a plot (15 vines), and there were three blocks (the size of plots within blocks was not clearly reported). Compost or fertilizer was added in February 1998–2011 (PEL: 3,700 kg fresh weight/ha/year; OF-MSW: 4,075 kg; SMC: 4,630 kg; MIN: 340 kg NPK/ha/year). For N, P, K, and pH measurements, soil samples were taken at the end of 2011 (four samples/plot, 0–30 cm depth). For greenhouse-gas measurements, air samples (20 ml, 10 samples/plot, closed chambers) were taken over 115 days after adding fertilizer. For partial prokaryotic 16S rRNA sequencing, soil samples (four/plot, 5–30 cm depth) were taken 15 days after adding fertilizer. 
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 2015 in a sorghum field in Italy found inconsistent differences in bacteria between plots with organic or inorganic fertilizer. Soil organisms: More bacteria were found in plots with organic fertilizer, compared to inorganic fertilizer, in three of 32 comparisons (111–2,017 vs 20–1,690 phylotype 16S rRNA sequences), but fewer were found in three of 32 comparisons (60–1,658 vs 103–1,858 sequences). Implementation options: More bacteria were found in plots with a double application of organic fertilizer, compared to a single application, in one of 16 comparisons (1,658 vs 1,469 sequences), but less were found in one of 16 comparisons (34 vs 111 sequences). Methods: Plots (5 x 8 m) had inorganic fertilizer (130 kg urea/ha) or compost (single application: 130 kg N/ha; double application: 260 kg N/ha) (four plots for each). After three years of compost addition, plants were dug up (three plants/plot) and soil that was clinging to plant roots was collected for sampling bacteria (through RNA sequencing). 
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 2003–2004 in an irrigated maize field in Spain found similar amounts of nitrogen in plots with organic or inorganic fertilizer. Nutrients: Similar amounts of nitrogen were found in plots with organic or inorganic fertilizer (21–80 vs 13–37 kg N/ha). Methods: Plots (30 x 40 m) had organic fertilizer (pig slurry: 30, 60, 90, or 120 Mg/ha) or inorganic fertilizer (0, 180, 240, or 300 kg N/ha) (three plots for each). Slurry was immediately covered after application. Lysimeters (2.6 x 2 m; 1.5 m depth) were installed in each plot, five years before the study. Each lysimeter was drip-irrigated, simulating flood irrigation (May to mid-September, with 7–12 intervals). Soil samples were collected after harvest (0–120 cm depth). 
A replicated site comparison in 2009 in rainfed vineyards in southern France found more organic matter, nitrogen, and microbial biomass, but less phosphorus and fewer nematodes, in soils with organic fertilizer, compared to inorganic fertilizer. Organic matter: More organic carbon was found in soils with organic fertilizer, compared to inorganic fertilizer, in one of three comparisons (11 vs 7 g C/kg soil). Nutrients: More nitrogen was found in soils with organic fertilizer, compared to inorganic fertilizer, in one of three comparisons (1.1 vs 0.7 g N/kg soil), but less phosphorus was found in one of three comparisons (6 vs 8 mg P/kg soil). Similar amounts of potassium and similar pH levels were found in soils with organic or inorganic fertilizer (data not reported). Soil organisms: More microbial biomass (measured as carbon) was found in soils with organic fertilizer, compared to inorganic fertilizer, in one of three comparisons (49 vs 23 mg C/kg soil), and fewer nematodes were found in one of three comparisons (616 vs 860 total nematodes/100 g soil). Methods: In 146 plots of three soil types, inorganic fertilizer only (37–69% of plots in each soil type) or at least some organic fertilizer (31–63%) was used for at least five years before soil sampling. Soil samples were collected from the interrows in March–May 2009 (10 homogenized samples/plot, 0–15 cm depth).
