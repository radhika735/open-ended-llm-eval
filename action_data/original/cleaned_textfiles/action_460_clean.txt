460: Convert to or maintain organic farming systems 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Organic farming systems combine a number of interventions that aim to conserve and enhance biodiversity.  Practices include replacing synthetic fertilisers with organic fertilisers (e.g. manure, compost), reducing pesticide use and encouraging biological pest control and using crop rotations.

A replicated, controlled, site comparison study from 1991-1993 in ten organic, ten minimum-tillage and ten conventional agricultural fields in North Dakota, USA (Lokemoen & Beiser 1997), found that more farmland birds nested on organic than on conventional fields. Organic fields possessed a significantly greater diversity of nesting species (1.6 vs. 0.9 species/field) and higher nest densities than conventional fields (0.12 vs. 0.05 nests/ha). Although organic fields did not differ in bird abundance from other field treatments, nest density of three special concern species (northern pintail Anas acuta, grasshopper sparrow Ammodramus savannarum and lark bunting Calamospiza melanocorys) was greatest in organic fallow fields. There were no significant differences in nest loss or daily survival rate between treatments. The effects of reduced tillage are discussed in ‘Reduce tillage’. 
A replicated study in the summers of 1993-5 on seven farms in southern England (Wilson et al. 1997) found significantly higher densities of Eurasian skylark Alauda arvensis territories on organic fields than on those managed conventionally. This held true for all crop types for which there was a large enough sample for statistical comparison (cereals: 0.16-0.38 territories/ha for organic fields vs. 0.06-0.17 territories/ha for conventional fields; silage: 0.22-0.24 territories/ha vs. 0.03-0.08 territories/ha; grazed pasture: 0.05-0.10 territories/ha vs. 0.00-0.02 territories/ha). Set-aside fields on organic farms had higher territory densities, but this difference was not significant (0.33-0.56 territories/ha for organic vs. 0.26-0.36 territories/ha). Estimated nest survival was higher on organic fields than conventional fields (approximately 35% survival to fledging on organic fields vs. approximately 25% for conventional fields), but this was not significant, possibly because sample sizes were too small. This study also describes the impact of set-aside on skylarks, discussed in ‘Provide or retain set-aside areas in farmland’. 
A replicated, controlled study from June-July in 1996-1997 in 37 conservation tillage, 40 organic, 38 conventional and 31 wild (control) sites in both upland and wetland areas of crop farms (75% wheat) in Saskatchewan, Canada (Shutler et al. 2000) found that bird diversity and abundance was highest overall in wild areas compared to farmed areas, highest in conservation tillage farms in upland areas and in organic farms in wetland areas. In upland areas, of 37 species recorded, one was more abundant on farms, 4 more abundant in wild areas, whereas the rest showed no distinct preference. Organic farms on uplands exhibited greater species richness and abundance than conventional farms. In wetland areas, of 79 species recorded, seven were more abundant on organic or wild sites while the rest displayed no preference. Organic farms were government-certified as not having used agrochemicals for at least four years.  This study is discussed in more detail in ‘Reduce tillage’. 
A replicated site comparison in April-June 2002 in Uppland, Sweden (Belfarge et al. 2005), found that six organic farms (totalling 512 ha) had significantly more species of birds (approximately 40 vs. 30) and more bird territories (260 vs. 170) than six conventional farms (totalling 961 ha). The study also found that small organic farms (&lt;52 ha) had 56% more bird species than large organic (&gt;135 ha) farms. 
A 2006 replicated site comparison study of 42 fields in Germany (Kleijn et al. 2006) found that more birds, but not more breeding territories, occurred on organically farmed fields compared to similar fields with more intensive farming practices. There was no difference in the numbers of species on each type of farmland. The study surveyed seven pairs of fields (one organic, one conventionally farmed) from each of three different parts of Germany four times during the breeding season. 
A paired sites comparison in 2005-6 on 40 arable farms in Oostelijk Flevoland and Noordoostpolder, the Netherlands (Kragten & de Snoo 2007), found that there were higher densities of  successful northern lapwing Vanellus vanellus nests on organic farms than conventional farms (2.6-3.3 nests/100 ha for organic farms vs. 1.7-2.8 nests/100 ha for conventional farms). However, this was only due to a higher breeding density, as nest success was (non-significantly) lower on organic farms (39-54% of 161 nests surviving on organic farms vs. 45-67% of 95 nests on conventional farms), mainly because more lapwing nests were lost to agricultural activity on organic farms (62-65% of losses due to farming activities on organic farms vs. 38-50% on conventional). 
A 2007 systematic review identified three papers investigating the effect of organic farming practices on farmland birds in the UK (Roberts & Pullin 2006). In both summer and winter surveys there were significantly higher densities of farmland bird species on organically cropped fields than on conventionally managed fields. The meta-analysis included experiments conducted between 1992 and 1997 from two controlled trials and one site comparison study. 
A replicated study in 2005-6 on arable farms in Noordoostpolder and Oostelijk Flevoland, the Netherlands (Kragten et al. 2008), found that survival rates for northern lapwing Vanellus vanellus nests did not differ between organic and conventionally managed farms. Although marked nests were less likely to be destroyed by machinery on organic farms (0% of 100 nests on organic farms destroyed vs. 4-9% of 1,544 nests on conventional farms), unmarked nests were more likely to be destroyed on organic farms (33-42% of 146 nests vs. 15-31% of 83). This study is discussed in more detail in ‘Mark nests during harvest’. 
A replicated, controlled study from April-June in 2006-2007 in 48 conservation tillage, 31 organic and 63 conventional winter barley and wheat fields in Seine-et-Marne, France (Ondine et al. 2009), found that that species differed in their responses to management.  Specialist species were more abundant on organic fields, compared to the other management regimes both when considering the whole community and non-farmland species only. Three species were more abundant on organic fields than conventional, whilst four non-farmland species were more abundant on conventional fields. Omnivores were more abundant than insect-eating birds on organic, compared to conventional fields. The authors point out that organic fields were less disturbed than other managements. The impact of reduced tillage is discussed in ‘Reduce tillage’.
