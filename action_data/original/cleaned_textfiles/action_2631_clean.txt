2631: Plant trees following clearfelling
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Following felling of tees, for timber harvesting, a range of actions may be employed to accelerate forest regrowth. These include treating with herbicide (to supress herbaceous vegetation) and planting of trees.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on mammals of planting trees following clearfelling. This study was in Canada.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)

Use (1 study): A replicated, site comparison study in Canada found that forest stands subject to tree planting and herbicide treatment after logging were used more by American martens compared to naturally regenerating stands.


Supporting Evidence:
A replicated, site comparison study in 2001–2002 of boreal forest stands in Ontario, Canada (Thompson et al. 2008) found that forest stands subject to tree planting and herbicide treatment after logging were used more by American martens Martes americana than were naturally regenerating stands. The effects of planting and herbicide use were not separated in the study. Radio-tracked martens made greater use of planted and herbicide-treated stands than they did of naturally regenerating stands (data not presented). However, the live-capture rate of martens in planted and herbicide-treated stands (5.6 martens/100 trap nights) was not significantly different to that in regenerating stands (1.9 martens/100 trap nights). Stands were 35–45 years old and located in a 600-km2 forestry area. Forest stands were either regenerating naturally following logging or planted following logging and treated with herbicide. Martens were live-trapped in 2003–2007, and monitored subsequently by radio-tracking.
