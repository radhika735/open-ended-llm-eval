1373: Soil: Plant hedgerows
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
The effectiveness category for this action refers to its effects on soil fertility (not its effects on greenhouse gases or climate regulation).

Key Messages:
Organic matter (0 studies)
Nutrients (0 studies)
Soil organisms (0 studies)
Soil erosion and aggregation (1 study): One replicated site comparison from the USA found similar particle sizes in soils with or without planted hedgerows.
Greenhouse gases (0 studies)

Supporting Evidence:
A replicated site comparison in farmland in the Central Valley, California, USA (years of study not reported), found similar soil structure in field edges with or without planted hedgerows. Soil erosion and aggregation: Similar particle sizes were found in soils with or without planted hedgerows (data reported as statistical results). Methods: Eight fields with planted hedgerows (mostly Californian native shrubs and forbs, at least five years after planting) were compared with eight field edges without planted hedgerows. Two soil samples were collected from each site (0–10 cm depth).
