2315: (CFT) Predatory invertebrates: Exclude grazers (29c)
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:


Key Messages:
One replicated, randomized and controlled in grasslands in the USA found no difference in ant abundance between ungrazed and cattle-grazed plots. 

Supporting Evidence:
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 2002–2004 in grasslands in northern California, USA, found similar numbers of ants in plots with or without cattle excluded. Invertebrates: Similar numbers of ants were found in ungrazed plots, compared to grazed plots (data not reported). Methods: A total of eighteen 30 x 30 m plots were established in winter 2002–2003 in two sites normally grazed (one cow-calf pair/8 ha, between November and May). Twelve plots were fenced to prevent cattle grazing, of which six were also burned. Ants were surveyed with pitfall traps 14 days after burning and one year after burning.
