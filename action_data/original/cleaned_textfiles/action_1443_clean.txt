1443: Use GPS and/or VHF tracking devices on individuals of problem troops to provide farmers with early warning of crop raiding
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Using telemetry tracking devices on primates to record the location of their movements can help to warn farmers when primates approach their fields. In addition, such data may become valuable in understanding spatial movement patterns and drivers of crop-raiding behaviour. Although GPS (Global Positioning System) devices have improved greatly over the past 10 years, the dense canopy cover characteristic of the habitat of many primate species can make it difficult to obtain accurate GPS readings. In addition, deploying telemetry devices to the primate usually involves tranquilizing the individual, which poses various health risks to, and may even result in the death of the primate. Primatologists generally oppose attaching telemetry devices to great apes, as these may alter their behaviour and because it is not ethical to use them on great apes (Lonsdorf et al. 2010).

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of tracking devices on crop-raiding primates to provide farmers with early warning of crop raiding on primate populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
