Ratio of natural enemies to pests (0 studies)
Pest numbers (1 study): One replicated site comparison from the USA found more weeds in orchards next to restored riparian habitats, compared to remnant habitats.
Natural enemy numbers (0 studies)
Implementation options (1 study): One replicated, site comparison from the USA found more weeds in orchards next to older restored sites, compared to younger restored sites.

Supporting Evidence:
A replicated site comparison in 1991–2004 in 26 riparian sites along the Sacramento River, California, USA, found more weed seeds in orchards next to restored habitat, compared to remnant habitat. Pest numbers: More weed seeds were found in orchards next to restored habitat, compared to remnant habitat (data reported as log abundance). Implementation options: More weed seeds were found in orchards next to older restored sites, compared to younger restored sites (data not reported). Methods: Soil samples were collected from 26 walnut plots, 0–5.6 km from restored riparian, remnant riparian, and agricultural habitats. Restored sites were formerly farmland. Restoration included disking, burning, furrowing, levelling, and spraying with herbicide, and replanting. On each walnut farm, soil samples (10 cm depth) were collected from seven points adjacent to restored or remnant forest and nine points within the walnut orchard, in March 2004. Seeds were germinated and identified in a greenhouse.
