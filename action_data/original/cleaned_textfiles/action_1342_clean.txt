1342: Primates: Feed individuals separately
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Some primate species lead solitary largely lives in the wild but are normally housed in pairs or social groups in captivity where they may experience feeding competition. In captivity, training, feeding devices or enclosure modifications may allow group-housed primates to forage individually.
 

Key Messages:

No evidence was captured for the effects of feeding individual primates separately
