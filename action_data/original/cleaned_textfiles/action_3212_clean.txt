3212: Excavate brackish/saline pools
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Pools are small, discrete water bodies: &lt;8 ha in area or &lt;280 m in diameter (Ramsar Convention Secretariat 2016). They may be permanently or seasonally flooded. Pools may be lost through drainage or filling, or become degraded through pollution, invasion or lack of management. For this intervention, we consider “pools” and “ponds” as synonymous.
To be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must evaluate the effects of excavating pools on emergent vegetation (e.g. coverage of emergent vegetation within permanent pools, or characteristics of vegetation in marshes or swamps around pools). Studies of pools, or zones within pools, that contain little emergent vegetation will be summarized in a future synopsis.
Related actions: Reprofile/relandscape areas larger than pools (brackish/salt marshes – brackish/saline swamps).

Key Messages:
We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation within pools or surrounding marshes/swamps, of excavating brackish/saline pools.
 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
