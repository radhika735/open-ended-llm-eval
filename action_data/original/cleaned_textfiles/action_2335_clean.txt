2335: Keep domestic cats and dogs well-fed to reduce predation of wild mammals
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Domestic pets can be major predators on wild mammals. For example, an estimated 57 million mammals are killed by domestic cats Felis catus in the UK each year (Wood et al. 2003) while negative impacts of domestic dogs Canis lupus familiaris on wild mammals include predation, disease transmission and disturbance (Hughes & Macdonald 2013). Keeping animals well fed might reduce their hunting activities and other interactions with wild mammals.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on mammals of keeping domestic cats and dogs well-fed to reduce predation of wild mammals.

‘We found no studies' means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
