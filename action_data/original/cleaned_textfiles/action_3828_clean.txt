3828: Introduce gear exchange programs
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Gear exchange programmes aim to remove and replace what may be considered as more destructive, less selective, or even illegal fishing gears. They typically involve financial help and incentives for fishers, particularly those with low income or in poverty. Gear exchange programmes may reduce unwanted catch by providing more selective gears to reduce fish mortality, damage to fish habitats and the impacts of illegal fishing (Signa et al. 2008).
