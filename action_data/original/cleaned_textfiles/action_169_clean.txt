169: Practice integrated farm management
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Integrated Farm Management is a whole farm system that aims to provide profitable production whilst being environmentally responsible. It focuses on integrating beneficial natural processes, by using efficient soil management and crop rotations for example, into modern farming techniques. Practitioners of Integrated Farm Management need to be able to clearly demonstrate improvement to the quality of soil, water, air, wildlife habitat and the landscape.
We have not included studies describing the effects of Integrated Farm Management because farms are able to use a variety of different management interventions and which were used in any particular case is not always recorded. Where individual interventions are recorded, studies are described in the appropriate section.

Key Messages:

We found no intervention-based evidence on the effects of practicing integrated farm management on bird populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
