2601: Remove roadkill regularly to reduce kill rate of predators/scavengers
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Animals killed on roads provide a food source for scavengers and some predators. These scavengers and predators then become vulnerable to being killed in collisions with vehicles themselves. Removing carcasses of road-killed animals thus removes a source of attraction towards roads for these species.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of removing roadkill regularly to reduce the kill rate of predators/scavengers.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
