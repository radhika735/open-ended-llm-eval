49: Provide nest boxes for stingless bees
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:


Key Messages:
One replicated trial tested nest boxes placed in trees for the stingless bee Melipona quadrifasciata in Brazil and found no uptake.
 

Supporting Evidence:
Antonini & Martins (2003) erected 40 nest boxes (25 x 25 x 40 cm) for stingless bees on tree branches 3-5 m above ground, in pristine and degraded cerrado (grass/shrubland) in Minas Gerais, Brazil, in March 1999. None were occupied by any stingless bee colonies, although 48 natural nests were found in the 18 km2 study area. The lack of nest box uptake was thought to be due to an abundance of natural nest sites.
