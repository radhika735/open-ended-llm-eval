465: Use lime to reduce acidification in lakes
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Acid rain, caused by airborne pollutants such as sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, can acidify lakes and reduce the number of fish they hold. Adding lime (calcium and magnesium-rich minerals) to lakes can help reduce acidity.
 

Key Messages:
A before-and-after study from Sweden found no difference in osprey Pandion haliaetus productivity during a period of extensive liming of acidified lakes compared to two periods without liming.
 

Supporting Evidence:
A before-and-after study at three acidified lakes in southwest Sweden (Eriksson & Wallin 1994) found that the average number of large (over four week-old) osprey Pandion haliaetus nestlings produced in successful breeding attempts was not significantly different during a period of extensive liming of acidified lakes (1980–7), compared to either of two periods without liming (1961-71: 2.0 nestlings/successful breeding attempt; 1972-9: 2.0 nestlings/successful attempt; 1980-7: 1.9 nestlings/successful attempt).
