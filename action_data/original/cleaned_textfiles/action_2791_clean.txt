2791: Use passive listening devices to detect mammals and prompt fishing vessels to move away
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Passive listening devices, such as hydrophones, may be used to detect marine and freshwater mammals and prompt fishing vessels to move away. This is likely to increase the chance of mammals being detected within an area, especially during the night or periods of low visibility.
See also Establish ‘move-on rules’ for fishing vessels if mammals are encountered.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of using passive listening devices to detect mammals and prompt fishing vessels to move away on marine and freshwater mammal populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
