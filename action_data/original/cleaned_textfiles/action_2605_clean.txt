2605: Site management for target mammal species carried out by field sport practitioners 
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Hunters and field sport participants may manage sites specifically to maintaining populations of their target mammal species. Management could include predator control and management of habitat features.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of site management for a target mammal species being carried out by field sport practitioners. This study was in Ireland.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Abundance (1 study): A replicated, site comparison study in the Republic of Ireland found that sites managed for the sport of coursing Irish hares held more of this species than did the wider countryside.

Supporting Evidence:
A replicated, site comparison study in 2003–2007 on 17 improved farmland sites in County Donegal, Republic of Ireland (Reid et al. 2010) found that sites managed for the sport of coursing Irish hares Lepus timidus hibernicus held more of this species than did the wider countryside. Accounting for differences in habitat, hare densities on coursing sites (96 hares/km2) were higher than on wider countryside sites (31 hares/km2). Eight sites managed for hare coursing were compared with nine sites containing suitable hare habitat in the wider countryside. Management for hare coursing included predator control, poaching deterrence, retaining fine scale habitat features, such as rush patches, and administering veterinary attention while holding hares captive prior to coursing events. Hares flushed by lines of 20–30 beaters were counted, in September–December of 2003–2007.
