2742: Modify aquaculture gear
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Marine and freshwater mammals may be attracted to aquaculture systems to feed and can subsequently become entangled in gear. Modifications to aquaculture gear, such as using stiffened or rigid materials, may reduce the risk of entanglement. This may also reduce mammal predation on fish stocks thereby reducing human-wildlife conflict.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of modifying aquaculture gear on marine and freshwater mammal populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
