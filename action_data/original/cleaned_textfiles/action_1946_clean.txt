1946: Plant in-field trees
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Single or scattered trees may be planted within fields to provide roosting and foraging habitat for bats in open agricultural landscapes. However, it will take a considerable amount of time for trees to become established and sufficiently mature. Existing in-field trees should therefore be retained where possible. See ‘Retain existing in-field trees’.
For studies that may carry out this intervention alongside other interventions to benefit bats on farmland, see ‘Pay farmers to cover the costs of conservation measures (e.g. agri-environment schemes)’. For other interventions that involve planting trees on agricultural land, see ‘Create tree plantations on agricultural land’ and ‘Retain or plant native trees and shrubs amongst crops (agroforestry)’.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of planting in-field trees on bat populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
