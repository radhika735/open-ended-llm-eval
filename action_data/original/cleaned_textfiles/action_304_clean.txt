304: Reduce gillnet deployment time to reduce seabird bycatch 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
If birds are attracted to the fish caught in gillnets then removing the nets more quickly may reduce their attractiveness to birds and so reduce bycatch.
 

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects on seabird bycatch rates of reducing gill net deployment time.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
