2889: Improve methods for locating fishing gear
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Abandoned, lost or otherwise discarded fishing gear (or ‘ghost’ gear) is a major threat to marine and freshwater mammals. Mammals may become entangled in ‘ghost’ gear, such as nets, lines and ropes, resulting in injury or death (Stelfox et al. 2016). Improving methods for locating fishing gear, such as using markers, acoustic transponders or onboard systems, may reduce the amount of gear that is lost and therefore reduce the risk of mammal entanglement.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of improving methods for locating fishing gear on marine and freshwater mammal populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
