2317: (CFT) Aquatic fauna: Extensive grazing (29a)
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:


Key Messages:
Invertebrates (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in wet grasslands in the USA found more families of insects in streams in areas grazed by cattle at lower, compared to higher, intensities.

Supporting Evidence:
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 1992–2002 in grazed wetlands in northern California, USA, found more families of aquatic insects in streams in lightly, compared to moderately, grazed plots. Invertebrates: There were more families of insects in streams in lightly grazed plots, compared to moderately grazed plots (data not provided). Methods: Three meadows were studied, with three watersheds in each randomly assigned to a grazing intensity: one with cattle excluded, one with light grazing (leaving 800–1,000 pounds of residual dry matter at the end of the season) and one with moderate grazing (leaving 600–700 pounds). Samples were taken from both the spring and along the creek in each watershed. Insects were surveyed every three months in one year. Plants were surveyed each June using line transects.
