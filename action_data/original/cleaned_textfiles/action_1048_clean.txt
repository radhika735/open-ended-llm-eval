1048: American bullfrog control: Application of a biocide
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Biocides may offer a tool for localised eradication or population reduction of American bullfrogs, provided potentially negative effects on native species are carefully managed.
 

Key Messages:

One replicated, controlled study in the USA found a number of chemicals killed American bullfrogs, including caffeine (10% solution), chloroxylenol (5% solution), and a combined treatment of Permethrin (4.6% solution) and Rotenone (1% solution). 

 

Supporting Evidence:
A replicated, controlled laboratory study from 2008 to 2009 at the University of California, USA (Snow & Witmer 2010) reported that a number of chemicals killed American bullfrog.  Caffeine (10% solution), chloroxylenol (5% solution), and a combined treatment of Permethrin (4.6% solution) and Rotenone (1% solution) each achieved 100% mortality.  Dosed on their own, Permethrin (4.6% solution) and Rotenone (1% solution) each achieved 40% mortality.  In the trial, approximately 4 ml of treatment solution was sprayed on the entire dorsal surface of randomly-selected groups of bullfrogs using a handheld plastic spray bottle. There were five bullfrogs in each group.  Water was used as the solvent for all materials.  To improve solubility, a small amount of sodium benzoate was added to the caffeine solution, and a small amount of alcohol was added to the chloroxylenol solution.
