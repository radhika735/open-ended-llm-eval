357: Use greentree reservoir management
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
A greentree reservoir is a temporary impoundment of a forested river-bottom aimed at providing wildfowl habitat.
 

Key Messages:
A site comparison study from the USA found significantly lower numbers of breeding mid- and under-storey birds at a greentree reservoir site than at a control site. Canopy nesting species were not affected. The species investigated were not gamebirds or wildfowl.
 

Supporting Evidence:
In eastern Arkansas, USA, a site comparison study found significant differences in relative abundances of 12 of 28 non-gamebird species between a greentree site and an adjacent control area (Christman 1984). Singing birds were surveyed in the 1980-1981 breeding seasons. Greentree reservoir management reduced understory vegetation and bird species that are primarily understory foragers were absent or at lower frequencies, and nesting opportunities for ground- or understorey- nesting species were reduced, compared to the control. Canopy-foraging species were not affected. There were overall fewer breeding species and bird abundance was lower at the greentree reservoir site.
