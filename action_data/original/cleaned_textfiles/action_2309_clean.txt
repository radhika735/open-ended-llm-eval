2309: (CFT) Soil fauna: Exclude grazers (29c)
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:


Key Messages:
Soil organisms (1 study): One controlled study on a streambank in the USA found more nematodes and more diverse nematode communities in an area with goats and sheep excluded.

Supporting Evidence:
A controlled study in 2005–2008 in restored riparian habitat on a farm in the Central Valley, California, USA, found more nematodes overall, more bacteria-feeding nematodes, and more diverse communities of nematodes, in plots without grazers, compared to plots grazed by goats and sheep. Soil organisms: More nematode biomass and higher nematode diversity were found in plots without grazers, compared to plots with grazers (831 vs 557 µg/100 g soil; diversity reported as Shannon diversity index). More bacteria-feeding nematodes were found in plots without grazers, compared to plots with grazers (178 vs 86 nematodes/100 g soil), but similar numbers of fungus-feeding (168 vs 194), omnivorous and predatory (29 vs 21), and plant-feeding (180 vs 176) nematodes were found in plots with or without grazers. Methods: Grazers were introduced to half of a streambank in 2005 (14 animals/ha), but they were excluded by a fence from the other half. Soil samples were collected from the grazed area and the ungrazed area in December 2007 and March–April 2008 (0–30 cm depth).
