3071: Change season/timing of cutting/mowing: brackish/salt marshes
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Cutting/mowing could have different effects on vegetation depending on the time of year at which it is done. For example, it might be beneficial to avoid disturbance when certain plants are young/flowering so that they can grow/reproduce and contribute to the community. The season of disturbance can also affect nutrient levels and impacts to soils by trampling or vehicles.
To be summarized as evidence in this section, studies should have compared a fixed frequency and intensity of cutting/mowing, but in different seasons (e.g. summer vs winter) or in different temporal patterns (e.g. 50% of plants cut every summer vs 100% of plants cut every other summer).
Related actions: Change season/timing of vegetation harvest, including studies of cutting where vegetation is removed; Reduce frequency of cutting/mowing; Reduce intensity of cutting/mowing; Cut/mow herbaceous plants to maintain or restore disturbance; Use cutting/mowing to control problematic herbaceous plants.

Key Messages:
We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of cutting/mowing brackish/salt marshes in different seasons or at different times.
 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
