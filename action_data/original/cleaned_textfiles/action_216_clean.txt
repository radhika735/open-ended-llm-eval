216: Plant cereals in wide-spaced rows
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be ineffective or harmful
Background information and definitions:
Planting cereals in widely spaced rows can increase the proportion of habitat in the farmland that can be used by birds, as spaces between rows can be left fallow or planted with grass or legumes.
 

Key Messages:

A replicated and controlled study from the UK found that planting cereals in wide-spaced rows “offered benefits over conventional wheat for Eurasian skylarks, but details were not given. Another replicated and controlled study from the UK found that fields with wide-spaced rows had fewer skylark nests than control or skylark plot fields.
A replicated and controlled study from the UK found that the faecal content (and therefore diet) of skylark nestlings was similar between control fields and those with wide-spaced rows.

 

Supporting Evidence:
A replicated, controlled study from April-August in 2002-3 in 30 treatment and 30 control fields of winter wheat in northern and eastern England, UK (Smith et al. 2009) found no difference in faecal content of Eurasian skylark Alauda arvensis nestlings in fields with wide-spaced rows, compared to control fields.
