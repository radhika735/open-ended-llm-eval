3229: Disturb soil/sediment surface: brackish/saline swamps
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This action involves shallow disturbance of the top few centimetres of soil/sediment in degraded swamps (e.g. by tilling, ploughing, disking or scarifying) without permanently removing any material. Such disturbance may encourage the growth of desirable plants. It can break up any hard soil crust, or create bare patches clear of competing vegetation or litter in which new plants can grow. Swamp plants may colonize from nearby habitat patches, or germinate from propagules (e.g. seeds, spores or root/rhizome fragments) already in the soil. The first colonizing plants will typically be fast-growing, weedy species – but these may also be desirable members of target plant communities, or act as nurse plants for later desirable communities.
Related actions: Physically damage problematic plants, including by disturbing the soil/sediment; Remove surface soil/sediment; Bury surface soil/sediment, including by deep ploughing.

Key Messages:
We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of disturbing the surface of brackish/saline swamps.
 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
