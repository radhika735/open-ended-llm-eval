1216: Use summer instead of winter harvesting
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Logging alters the composition and ecology of forests. In seasonal climates the timing of logging operations can be adjusted to avoid damage during the major growing season of understory plants and seedlings.
 

Key Messages:

One replicated study in the USA found no effect of logging season on plant species richness and diversity. 

 

Supporting Evidence:
A replicated study in 2002-2006 in temperate mixed forest in Wisconsin, USA (Wolf et al. 2008) found no effect of logging season on plant species richness and diversity. Plant species richness/plot (winter-logged: 71-103; summer-logged: 70-99) and Shannon's index of diversity (winter-logged: 5.5-6.0; summer-logged: 5.5-6.0) were similar between treatments.  Five plots (100 × 250 m) were logged in 2002-2005 to retained 16-19 m2/ha basal area in summer (June - October) and winter (November – March). Data were collected in May-September 2006 in 60 plots (2 × 2 m) in each treatment plot.
