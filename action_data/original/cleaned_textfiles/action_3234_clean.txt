3234: Add upland topsoil
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Topsoil can be a source of soil organic matter and help to improve water retention (Bruland & Richardson 2004). This might benefit wetland vegetation, particularly when creating new marshes and swamps. However, given that upland soil will probably not contain seeds or fragments or marsh/swamp plants, it may be necessary to introduce these in some way. Caution: Topsoil may contain seeds or fragments of undesirable vegetation.
Related actions: Transplant or replace wetland soil (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps);     Add upland topsoil to complement planting (freshwater non-woody – brackish/saline non-woody – freshwater trees/shrubs – brackish/saline trees/shrubs).

Key Messages:
We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of adding upland topsoil to restore/create marshes or swamps.
 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
