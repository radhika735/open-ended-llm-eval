3587: Establish aquaculture facilities to extract the nutrients from agricultural run-off
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Intensive agriculture constitutes a major source of pollution to marine and freshwater environments. Agricultural waste and pollutants can enter rivers and other watercourses and be discharged into the sea. Excess nutrients from agricultural waste can lead to diminished water quality and eutrophication events, including harmful algal blooms. Some species used in aquaculture can naturally improve water quality through feeding (e.g. filter feeding species, such as mussels) or through photosynthesis (e.g. algae species). Establishing certain types of aquaculture near polluted areas may help to remove excess nutrients (Duarte & Krause-Jensen 2018).

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on reptile populations of establishing aquaculture facilities to extract the nutrients from agricultural run-off.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
