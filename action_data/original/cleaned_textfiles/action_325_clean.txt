325: Protect nest trees before burning 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Rare species, or those restricted to small areas, may suffer population declines if fires damage nests or kill chicks. Protecting nest trees may help reduce this negative effect. We found no studies describing the effects of nest tree protection on bird populations but (Williams et al. 2006) found that protected nest trees in a longleaf pine Pinus palustris forest in Florida, USA, had significantly lower mortality than unprotected trees.

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of protecting nest trees of bird populations before burning.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
