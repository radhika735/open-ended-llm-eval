2130: Limit the maximum weight and/or size of bobbins on the footrope
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
The footrope consists of a rope, wire or chain which is attached to the bottom front of the net (the lower edge of the net mouth) to provide weight. Bobbins, rollers or other hard material encircle or are tied along the footrope to bounce or pivot over seabed obstructions preventing the footrope and net from snagging on the seabed. Footrope configuration varies with trawls and the commercial species targeted, and can affect the level of negative impacts on the seabed and subtidal benthic invertebrates (Hannah et al. 2013). Large, heavy bobbins and rollers can damage the seabed, therefore affecting subtidal benthic invertebrates. Setting limits on their weight and/or size can potentially reduce damage to the seabed and associated impacts on subtidal benthic invertebrates.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of limiting the maximum weight and/or size of bobbins on the footrope on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.

 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
