1870: Amphibians: Vary water flow/speed of artificial streams in enclosures for torrent breeding species
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Some amphibian species live in habitats where flowing water is a constant or seasonal feature. Varying the flow rate of artificial streams or waterfalls in captivity may simulate seasonal changes in the wild which may signal the onset of breeding.

Key Messages:

No evidence was captured for the effects of allowing varying water flow/speed of artificial streams in enclosures for torrent breeding species.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
