1307: <i>Crassula helmsii</i>: Surround with wire mesh
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
C. helmsii can easily spread by regenerating from small fragments of plant material (Dawson & Warman 1987). Fine wire mesh (5 mm) can reduce the spread of C. helmsii by minimising movement of plant fragments to new areas. Mesh may need to fully surround the area of C. helmsii, including over the top of the affected area, to prevent spread by birds. This may be particularly important during physical disturbance caused by control treatments.

Key Messages:

We found no evidence that surrounding Crassula helmsii with wire mesh reduced its rate of spread.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
