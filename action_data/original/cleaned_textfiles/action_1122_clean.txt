1122: Asian clams: Public awareness and education
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
In order to minimize the transport of clams by humans, measures should be taken such as the education of fishermen in not using Asian clams Corbicula spp. as bait outside invaded places (Aldridge & Müller 2001) and the possibility of small specimens hitchhiking in their clothes and boats.  Caution should be taken in not transferring sand or gravel from invaded locations (Counts 1986).
