1456: Install green bridges (overpasses) 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Green bridges are bridges that have natural vegetation growing on them and that are usually not accessible to humans. These bridges try to combat habitat fragmentation by allowing animals to safely cross human-made barriers (e.g. roads or rail tracks), thus re-connecting previously continuous habitats. In addition, they also help reduce collisions between vehicles and wildlife. Green bridges could be used by terrestrial or semi-terrestrial primates, such as chimpanzees Pan troglodytes, baboons Papio spp. and sooty mangabeys Cercocebus atys.
            The use of canopy bridges to re-connect primate habitat and avoid primate road kills is discussed under ‘Install rope or pole (canopy) bridges to avoid primate road kills’.

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of installing green bridges on primate populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
