1740: Backfill trenches dug for pipelines
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
After pipelines have been dug in the surface of peatlands, peat could be replaced on top. This would provide the opportunity for peatland vegetation to redevelop.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: rewetting, because peatlands may be drained to allow pipeline construction; filling/blocking other types of ditches, trenches or gullies; general habitat creation and restoration, to restore vegetation following replacement of peat.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on peatland vegetation, of backfilling pipeline trenches.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
