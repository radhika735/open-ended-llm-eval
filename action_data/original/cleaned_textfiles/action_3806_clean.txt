3806: Limit dredge width or number of dredges per vessel
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Dredging on the seabed mainly occurs for harvesting of shellfish but can impact fish populations through the fish mortality associated with unwanted catch and discarding (Grothues et al. 2017). Limiting dredge width or the number of dredges per vessel may reduce the area fished/unit fishing time (Murray et al. 2010), and in turn the volume of unwanted fish caught and discarded, as well as help reduce effects from impact to the seabed.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of limiting dredge width or number of dredges per vessel on marine fish populations.

 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
