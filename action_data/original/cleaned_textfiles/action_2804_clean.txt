2804: Limit size of trawl net openings
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Limiting the size of trawl net openings may reduce the risk of marine and freshwater mammals entering the net and becoming trapped or entangled. However, any mammals that do enter the net may be less likely to find their way out through a smaller opening.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of limiting the size of trawl net openings on marine and freshwater mammal populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
