1664: Use biological control to reduce the number of problematic invertebrates
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Biological control refers to the introduction of natural enemies (e.g. virus, fungus or invertebrates) to control a problematic species. In the UK one such invertebrate species is the heather beetle Lochmaea suturalis. This species can cause die-off of heather, resulting in conversion to grassland.
Organisms introduced as a form of biological control can themselves become problematic or invasive species and as such before their introduction any likely negative impacts should be thoroughly assessed.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of reducing numbers of herbivorous invertebrates by using biological control on shrublands.

'We found no studiesâ€™ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
