2401: Leave cut vegetation in field to provide cover
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Leaving cut vegetation in a field, either following cutting or by adding hay from elsewhere, may increase ground-level shelter available to small mammals.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on mammals of leaving cut vegetation in field to provide cover. This study was in the USA

KEY COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Abundance (1 study): A controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that increasing cover, by adding cut vegetation (hay), did not increase rodent abundance.

BEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)

Supporting Evidence:
A controlled, before-and-after study in 1983–1984 on a prairie grassland in Kansas, USA (Kotler et al. 1988) found that increasing cover, by adding cut vegetation (hay), did not increase rodent abundance. Rodent numbers were not significantly different after hay addition (19–28/census) compared to before hay addition (10–25/census). Rodent abundances in plots with no added hay likewise did not differ significantly over the same time periods (after: 14–45/census; before: 9–36/census). Three plots, 0.81 ha each, were established on brome grass Bromus inermns and prairie vegetation. One had 16 cm depth of hay added in January 1984. Two were left unmanaged. Small mammals were sampled using 100 Longworth live traps/plot. Trapping occurred over two nights, biweekly, from 12 weeks before hay addition (October 1983) until 26 weeks after hay addition (August 1984).
