1972: Strengthen cultural traditions that discourage bat harvesting
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Species that provide an important cultural resource can be highly revered. For example, a study in the Solomon Islands found that bat teeth are used traditionally as currency, and the authors suggest that this tradition could be used to highlight the cultural value of bats and encourage sustainable hunting and conservation (Lavery & Fasi 2017).
