3568: Remove derelict fishing gear from reptiles found entangled
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Abandoned, lost or otherwise discarded fishing gear (or ‘ghost’ gear) is a major threat to aquatic reptiles. Sea turtles in particular are at risk of becoming entangled in ‘ghost’ gear, such as nets, lines and ropes resulting in injury or death (Stelfox et al. 2016). Attempts may be made to remove derelict gear from reptiles found entangled to improve survival. This may require specialist techniques, tools and training. Injuries or wounds caused by entanglement may also require treatment.
For studies that look at the release of rehabilitated reptiles that were injured see Species management – Rehabilitate and release injured or accidentally caught individuals. For studies that look at the release of accidentally captured reptiles see Threat: Biological resource use – Release accidentally caught (‘bycatch’) reptiles.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on reptile populations of removing derelict fishing gear from reptiles found entangled.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
