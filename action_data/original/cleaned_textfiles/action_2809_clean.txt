2809: Include fishers in management groups for marine protected areas
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Marine Protected Areas are designations to protect and conserve areas based on a particular ecological feature or sensitivity. The level of restrictions on human activities, including fishing, within such areas varies. Some areas have multiple users and may previously have been a source of food and income for fishers. Including fishers in the groups that set out the design and management of protected areas may improve compliance and help to create more effective management zones (Weigel et al. 2014)
Weigel J., Mannle K.O., Bennett N.J., Carter E., Westlund L., Burgener V., Hoffman Z., Da Silva A.S., Kane E.A., Sanders J., Piante C., Wagiman S. & Hellman A. (2014) Marine protected areas and fisheries: bridging the divide. Aquatic Conservation, 24, 199–215.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of including fishers in management fora for marine protected areas on marine fish populations. 

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
