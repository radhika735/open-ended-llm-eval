3351: Apply root dip to non-woody plants before planting: freshwater wetlands
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Before planting marsh or swamp plants, the roots could be dipped in a substance to retain moisture (e.g. mud or water-retaining gels) or stimulate growth (e.g. plant hormones). These dips may improve survival and/or growth of the planted vegetation. This action does not include root dips involving fungi.
To be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have explicitly compared the performance of treated and untreated plants. Studies that simply report the performance of treated plants are not summarized here. Studies do not have to be in flooded/saturated soils, as long as they involve wetland-characteristic species.
Related actions: Add root-associated fungi to plants before planting, including via a root dip.

Key Messages:
We found no studies that evaluated the effects – on emergent, non-woody plants typical of freshwater wetlands – of applying a non-fungal root dip before planting.
 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
