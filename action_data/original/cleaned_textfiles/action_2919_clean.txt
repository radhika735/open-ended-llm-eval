2919: Retain or create buffer zones around important habitats
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Protected areas are usually subject to the influence of human activities in surrounding areas. Retaining or creating buffer zones around important habitats may help to reduce disturbance and degradation on the periphery of protected areas. Buffer zones are usually areas that do not receive full protection and are not subject to the same management intensity of core areas, but in which there may be a degree of limit to activities, such as fishing, shipping or development.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of retaining or creating buffer zones around important habitats on marine and freshwater mammal populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
