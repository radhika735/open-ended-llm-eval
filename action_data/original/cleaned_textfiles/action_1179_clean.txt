1179: Adopt continuous cover forestry
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Continuous cover forestry is a way of managing forests where clearcutting is avoided in favour of other management systems that maintain a continuous forest cover and high structural diversity. This may increase species diversity compared to clearcutting.
