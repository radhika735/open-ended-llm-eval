2830: Provide training and tools for safe release of mammals captured by fisheries
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Providing training and tools for the safe release of marine and freshwater mammals captured by fisheries may increase the survival of released mammals. Specially designed tools may reduce stress and potential injury to captured mammals (e.g. Bergmann et al. 2016). Training may be provided on best practice handling and release protocols. See Establish handling and release protocols for mammals captured by fisheries.
For an intervention related to releasing mammals from derelict fishing gear, see Remove derelict fishing gear from mammals found entangled.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of providing training and tools for the safe release of mammals captured by fisheries on marine and freshwater mammal populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
