Key Messages:
Soil organisms (17 studies)

Microbial biomass (13 studies): Five replicated, controlled studies (four randomized) from Italy and Spain found more microbial biomass in soils without tillage, compared to soils with tillage, in some or all comparisons. Two replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Spain sometimes found more microbial biomass, and sometimes found less, in soils without tillage, compared to soils with tillage. Six replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Spain and the USA found similar amounts of microbial biomass in soils with or without tillage.
Earthworms (2 studies): Two replicated studies (one controlled, one site comparison) from the USA found more earthworms in soils without tillage, compared to soils with tillage.
Nematodes (2 studies): Two replicated, controlled studies (one randomized) from the USA found similar numbers of nematodes in soils with or without tillage. However, one of these studies found different communities of nematodes in soils with or without tillage.
Mites (1 study): One replicated, controlled study from the USA found different communities of mites, but similar numbers of mites, in soils with or without tillage.
Other soil organisms (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study from Spain found similar amounts of denitrifying bacteria in soils with or without tillage. Another replicated, randomized, controlled study from Spain found more microorganisms in soils without tillage, compared to soils with tillage, in some comparisons. One replicated, randomized, controlled study from Portugal found more fungus in soils without tillage, compared to soils with tillage.


Supporting Evidence:
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 1994–2011 in a rainfed cereal-legume field near Madrid, Spain, found fewer soil organisms, in soils with no tillage, compared to reduced tillage. Soil organisms: Fewer bacteria were found in soils with no tillage, compared to reduced tillage (denitrifying bacteria: 106 vs 108 gene copies), but no difference in microbial biomass (measured as carbon) was found (304 vs 186 mg C/kg soil). Methods: No tillage or reduced tillage was used on three plots each (10 x 25 m). A chisel plough and a cultivator were used for reduced tillage (15 cm depth) in October. A seed drill and herbicide were used for no tillage. Soil and greenhouse-gas samples were collected 1–12 times/month, in November 2010–October 2011 (soil cores: 0–15 cm depth, 2.5 cm diameter; closed chambers: 19.3 cm height, 35.6 cm diameter, 20 mL gas samples, 0–60 minutes after closing).
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 2004–2010 in rainfed wheat-sunflower-pea fields near Seville, Spain (same study as (13,33)), found more organic matter and more soil aggregation in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage. Organic matter: More organic carbon was found in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in four of ten comparisons (6–10 vs 5–6 g C/kg soil). Soil organisms: Similar amounts of microbial biomass (measured as carbon) were found in soils with no tillage or conventional tillage (20–75 vs 27–87 g microbial C/kg organic C). Soil erosion and aggregation: More large aggregates were found in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in autumn, in one of two comparisons (1–2 mm aggregates: 20 vs 17% of soil weight), and fewer small aggregates were found in autumn, in one of three comparisons (&lt;0.25 mm aggregates: 15 vs 21% of soil weight). However, no differences in aggregate distributions were found in spring (data reported for five aggregate sizes). Methods: No tillage or conventional tillage was used on three plots each (200 m2 plots). A mouldboard plough (25–30 cm depth), a cultivator (15–20 cm depth, two passes), and a disk harrow (15 cm depth) were used for conventional tillage. A seed drill and pre-emergence herbicide were used for no tillage, and crop residues were retained (&gt;60% cover). Wheat, sunflowers, and peas were grown in rotation. Wheat was fertilized, but sunflowers and peas were not. Soil samples were collected in spring and autumn 2010 (0–10 cm depth, five samples/plot).
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 1994–2013 in a rainfed wheat field near Madrid, Spain (same study as (6,19,39)), found that tillage had inconsistent effects on organic matter, soil organisms, and greenhouse gases. Organic matter: More organic carbon was found in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in seven of 12 comparisons (9–13 vs 6 g organic C/kg soil), but less was found in one of 12 comparisons (6 vs 5 g). Soil organisms: More microbial biomass (measured as carbon) was found in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in six of 12 comparisons (390–750 vs 200–300 mg C/kg soil), but less was found in one of 12 comparisons (200 vs 300 mg). Greenhouse gases: More carbon dioxide was found in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in six of 12 comparisons (40–60 vs 20–30 mg CO2–C/kg soil/d), but less was found in one of 12 comparisons (18 vs 22 mg). Methods: No tillage or conventional tillage was used on four plots each (in which a total of 24 subplots, 10 x 25 m each, were used for this study). A mouldboard plough was used for conventional tillage (25 cm depth). Pre-emergence herbicide was used for no tillage. The subplots had wheat monocultures or fallow-wheat-vetch-barley rotations. The cereals were fertilized (NPK, 200 kg/ha, twice/year, in October and March). The crop residues were shredded and retained. Soil samples were collected in October 2010, April 2011, November 2011, May 2012, October 2012 and April 2013 (50 mm diameter, 0–15 cm depth).
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 2010–2012 in a rainfed barley field in northeast Spain found less nitrate and greater stability in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage. More greenhouse gas was absorbed by soils with no tillage. Organic matter: Similar amounts of organic matter were found in soils with no tillage or conventional tillage (6 g C/kg dry macroaggregates). Nutrients: Less nitrate was found in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage (93 vs 110 mg NO3-N/kg dry macroaggregates), but there were similar amounts of ammonium (13 vs 20 mg NH4-N/kg dry macroaggregates). Soil organisms: Similar amounts of microbial biomass (measured as carbon and nitrogen) were found in soils with no tillage or conventional tillage (954 vs 866 mg C/kg soil; 237 vs 228 mg N/kg soil). Soil erosion and aggregation: More water-stable aggregates were found in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in one of three comparisons (0.2 vs 0.1 g). Greenhouse gases: More methane was absorbed by soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage (–0.2 vs 0.07 µg/kg macroaggregates/h). Similar carbon-dioxide emissions (1,406 vs 1,334 µg/kg macroaggregates/h) and nitrous-oxide emissions (0.92 vs 0.75 µg/kg macroaggregates/h) were found in soils with no tillage or conventional tillage. Methods: No tillage or conventional tillage was used on three plots each (plot size not clearly reported). Some plots were fertilized (0–150 kg N/ha). A disk plough (20 cm depth) was used for conventional tillage, in October. Pre-emergence herbicide was used for no tillage. Soil samples (0–5 cm depth) were collected in March 2012 (greenhouse gases were measured in soil samples).
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 2004–2011 in rainfed wheat-sunflower-pea fields near Seville, Spain (same study as (13,38)), found more organic matter in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage. Organic matter: More organic carbon was found in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in one of three comparisons, in medium-term plots (2004–2011, 0–5 cm depth: 11 vs 9 g C/kg soil), but no differences were found in short-term plots (2008–2011: 7–10 vs 7–9 g C/kg soil). Soil organisms: Similar amounts of microbial biomass (measured as carbon) were found in soils with no tillage or conventional tillage (581–746 vs 604–858 mg C/kg soil). Methods: No tillage or conventional tillage was used on three plots each (20 x 9 m plots), in each of two experiments: a short-term experiment (2008–2011), and a medium-term experiment (2004–2011). A mouldboard plough (25–30 cm depth), a cultivator (15–20 cm depth, two passes), and a disk harrow (15 cm depth) were used for conventional tillage. A seed drill was used for no tillage, and crop residues were retained (&gt;60% cover). Soil samples were collected in January 2011 (0–25 cm depth, five samples/plot).
A replicated, controlled study in 1991–2010 in a rainfed durum wheat field in Sicily, Italy, found more microbial biomass and carbon dioxide in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage. Organic matter: Similar amounts of organic carbon were found in soils with no tillage or conventional tillage (20–21 vs 19–21 g C/kg soil). Nutrients: Similar amounts of nitrogen were found in soils with no tillage or conventional tillage (1.1–1.3 vs 1–1.4 g total N/kg soil). Soil microbial biomass: More microbial biomass (measured as carbon) was found in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage (330–509 vs 208–293 mg C/kg soil). Greenhouse gases: More carbon dioxide was found in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage (19–22 vs 14–17 mg C/kg soil/day). Methods: No tillage or conventional tillage was used on four plots each (18.5 × 20 m plots), with either wheat-faba bean or wheat-wheat rotations. Fertilizer and herbicide were used on all plots. Ploughing (30 cm depth) and harrowing (1–2 passes, 10–15 cm depth) were used for conventional tillage. Soil samples were collected after the harvest, in June 2009 (three samples/plot, 0–15 cm depth). Carbon dioxide was measured on 36 days in April 2008–April 2009 (closed chambers, 12 measurements/plot, 9–11 am).
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 2008–2010 in a rainfed wheat-vetch field in southwest Spain (same study as (22)) found more organic matter, soil organisms, and aggregation in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage. Organic matter: More organic carbon was found in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in three of five comparisons (soil aggregates &lt;1 mm in diameter: 18–22 vs 13–15 g C/kg soil). Soil organisms: More microbial biomass (measured as carbon) was found in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in three of five comparisons (in smaller soil aggregates with diameters of 1–2, 0.25–0.5, or &lt;0.5 mm: 504–549 vs 341–346 mg C/kg soil). Soil erosion and aggregation: More large aggregates were found in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage (2–5 mm macroaggregates: 31% vs 24% of soil weight), and fewer smaller aggregates were found, in two of four comparisons (0.5–1 mm aggregates: 21% vs 26% of soil weight). Methods: No tillage or conventional tillage was used on three plots each (300 m2 plots), in 2008–2009. In 1999–2008, no tillage was used on all plots. A mouldboard plough (25 cm depth, in 2008), or a chisel plough (10–15 cm depth, in 2009), and a disk harrow were used for conventional tillage, and crop residues were removed (in 2008 and 2010). A seed drill and herbicide were used for no tillage, and crop residues were retained. Soil samples were collected in October 2010 (0–10 cm depth, five samples/plot). It was not clear whether these results were a direct effect of tillage or residue removal
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 1996–2008 in a rainfed barley field in the Ebro river Valley, Spain (same study as (4,17,23,24,26)), found more organic matter and more soil organisms in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage. Organic matter: More organic carbon was found in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage (9.25 vs 7.39 g C/kg dry soil). Soil organisms: More microbial biomass (measured as carbon) was found in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage (295 vs 231 mg C/kg dry soil). Methods: There were nine plots (50 x 6 m) for each of two tillage treatments (no tillage: pre-emergence herbicide; conventional tillage: mouldboard plough, 25–30 cm depth). Plots were tilled in October or November. Soils samples were collected in October 2008 (before tillage, three soil cores/plot, 4 cm diameter, 0–50 cm depth).
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 2008–2010 in a rainfed wheat-legume field in southwest Spain found more microbial biomass in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in two of 18 comparisons. Soil organisms: More microbial biomass (measured as carbon and nitrogen) was found in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in two of 18 comparisons (0–5 cm depth, in January 2010: 445 vs 263 mg C/kg soil; 31 vs 17 mg N/kg soil). Methods: No tillage or conventional tillage was used on three plots each (30 x 10 m plots). A mouldboard plough was used for conventional tillage (25 cm depth). Herbicides and a seed drill were used for no tillage. All plots were fertilized. Soil samples were collected in January 2009, June 2009, and January 2010 (three samples/plot, nine soil cores/sample, 0–25 cm depth). No tillage was used on all plots in 1999–2008.
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 2003–2005 in an occasionally irrigated oat field in Portugal found less organic matter and phosphorus, lower pH, and fewer fungal colonies in plots with no tillage, compared to tillage. Organic matter: Less organic carbon was found in soils with no tillage, compared to tillage, in three of four comparisons (5.6–6.2 vs 6.0–7.7 g organic C/kg soil). Nutrients: Similar amounts of nitrogen were found in plots with or without tillage (30–45 mg mineral N/kg soil). Less phosphorus was found in soils with no tillage, compared to tillage, in three of four comparisons (47–70 vs 75–81 mg extractable P/kg soil). Lower pH levels were found in soils with no tillage, compared to tillage, in two of four comparisons (pH 5.5 vs 5.7–5.8). Soil organisms: More fungal colonies were found in plots with no tillage, compared to tillage (2004–2005: 3.6 vs 4.5 colonies/mg soil). Methods: Tillage or no tillage was used on four plots each (400 m2 plots). A disk plough was used for tillage (two passes, 15 cm depth). The plots were intercropped with oats and Lupinus albus lupins in 2003–2004 (residues were retained, and incorporated into the soil in the plots with tillage) and oats were grown in monoculture in 2004–2005. The plots were fertilized in 2003–2004 (60 kg P/ha; 100 kg N/ha), but not in 2004–2005. Soils samples were collected in October, November, January, March, May, and July each year (15 cm depth, 15 samples/plot).
A replicated, controlled study in 1993–2006 in an irrigated tomato-corn field in Davis, California, USA, found similar numbers of soil organisms, but different communities of soil organisms, in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage. Soil organisms: Similar numbers of mites and nematodes were found in soils with no tillage or conventional tillage (822 vs 797 individuals/100 g fresh soil). However, the composition of nematode and mite communities differed between soils with no tillage or conventional tillage (reported as distance in multivariate space). Methods: No tillage or conventional tillage was used on three plots each (conventional tillage: 0.4 ha plots; no tillage: 3 m2 microplots). Plots with conventional tillage were tilled about five times/year (depth not reported). Plots with no tillage were hand weeded. All plots were irrigated. Half of the plots were fertilized, and compost was added to the other half. Soil samples were collected eight times in March 2005–November 2006 (three samples/plot). Mites were sampled with soil cores (5 cm diameter, 10 cm depth). Nematodes were sampled in soil cubes (20 x 20 x 20 cm).
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 1982–2008 on a rainfed wheat-sunflower-legume field near Seville, Spain (same study as (14)), found similar amounts of microbial biomass in soils with no tillage or conventional tillage. Soil organisms: Similar amounts of microbial biomass (measured as carbon) were found in soils with no tillage or conventional tillage (272–766 vs 314–378 mg C/kg soil). Methods: No tillage or conventional tillage was used on three plots each (15 x 18 m). A mouldboard plough and a cultivator (depths not reported) were used for conventional tillage, and crop residues were burned. A seed drill and herbicide were used for no tillage, and crop residues were retained. Herbicide was used on all plots. Wheat, sunflowers, and legumes were grown in rotation. Wheat was fertilized, but sunflowers and legumes were not. Soil samples were collected in March 2008 (three samples/plot, 400 g/soil core, 0–20 cm depth).
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 2005–2008 on two rainfed wheat-sunflower-pea fields near Seville, Spain (same study as (15)), found similar amounts of microbial biomass in soils with no tillage or conventional tillage. Soil organisms: Similar amounts of microbial biomass (measured as carbon) were found in soils with no tillage or conventional tillage (291–791 vs 127–472 mg C/kg soil). Methods: No tillage or conventional tillage was used on three plots each (200 m2 each). A mouldboard plough (25–30 cm depth), a cultivator (15–20 cm, 2–3 passes), and a disk harrow (15 cm) were used on plots with conventional tillage. Herbicides and a seed drill were used on plots with no tillage. Wheat, sunflowers, and peas were grown in rotation. Wheat was fertilized, but sunflowers and peas were not. Soil samples were collected in March and July 2008 (three samples/plot, 0–20 cm depth).
A replicated site comparison in 2004–2005 in 11 irrigated tomato fields in the Sacramento Valley, California, USA, found more earthworms, more carbon and nitrogen, and greater soil aggregation in soils with no tillage, compared to tillage. Organic matter: More carbon was found in soils with no tillage, compared to tilled fallows (1.6 times as much total carbon). Nutrients: More nitrogen was found in soils with no tillage, compared to tilled fallows (1.5 times as much total nitrogen). Soil organisms: More earthworms, and larger earthworms, were found in soils with no tillage, compared to tilled fallows (85 vs 19 g earthworms/m2; 2.9 times larger). Soil erosion and aggregation: Greater aggregation was found in soils with no tillage, compared to tilled fallows (larger mean weight diameter; data presented as model results). Methods: Earthworms were collected from 11 tomato fields (four fields that were tilled, incorporating the tomato residues into the soil, and seven fields that were not tilled, retaining the tomato residues as mulch), in three 30 cm3 soil pits/field, in February–April 2005. Organic matter and nutrients were measured in horizontal soil cores, collected from the walls of the soil pits (0–15 cm length). All fields were tilled in 2004, after the tomatoes were harvested. All fields were fertilized and irrigated.
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 2002–2004 in an irrigated maize field in southwest Spain found less nitrogen and more microorganisms in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage. Tillage had inconsistent effects on soil stability. Nutrients: Less nitrogen was found in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in one of nine comparisons (0–5 cm depth, in 2002: 0.11 vs 0.12 g total N/kg soil). Soil erosion and aggregation: Lower stability was found in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in two of nine comparisons (0–10 cm depth, in 2002: 31–35% vs 48–58% of aggregates were stable), but higher stability was found in two of nine comparisons (0–10 cm depth, in 2004: 61–69% vs 41–58%). Soil organisms: More microorganisms were found in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in one of three years (0–5 cm depth, in 2004: 437 vs 261 colony forming units/g dry soil). Methods: Conventional tillage or no tillage was used on four plots each (20 x 10 m plots). A mouldboard plough (0–30 cm depth, in October 2001–2003 and March and April 2002–2004) was used for conventional tillage, and maize residues were burned in September–October 2002–2004. Herbicide was used for no tillage (April and May–June 2002–2004), and maize residues were not burned. For organic carbon, nitrogen, and aggregate stability, soil samples were collected in March, June, and October 2002–2004 (three samples/plot, 0–30 cm depth). For microorganisms, soils samples were collected every two months (0–5 cm depth). It was not clear whether these results were a direct effect of tillage or residue burning.
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 2003–2004 in irrigated farmland in Davis, California, USA, found more organic matter and phosphorus in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage. Tillage had inconsistent effects on potassium. Organic matter: More carbon was found in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in one of two comparisons (in rotations with fallows: 4 vs 3.8 kg total C/m2). Nutrients: Similar amounts of nitrogen were found in plots with no tillage or conventional tillage (450–460 g total N/m2). More potassium was found in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in two of six comparisons (10.3–12.9 vs 6–7.7 mg K/litre), but less was found in one of twelve comparisons (4.8 vs 6.3 mg/L). More phosphorous was found in plots with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in one of six comparisons (27 vs 19 mg P/kg soil). Similar pH levels were found in soils with no tillage or conventional tillage (pH 6.8–7.3). Soil organisms: Similar amounts of microbial and nematode biomass (both measured as carbon) were found in plots with no tillage or conventional tillage (60–80 vs 60 g microbial C/m2; 0.1–0.2 vs 0.2–0.25 g nematode C/m2). Methods: No tillage or conventional tillage was used on six plots each (67 x 4.7 m plots, three beds/plot). Crop residues were incorporated to 20 cm depth, and the beds were shaped, on plots with conventional tillage (disk, lister, and ring roller). Crop residues were flail mown and spread on the plots with no tillage. All plots were fertilized in 2003, but not thereafter (112 kg P/ha phosphorous, 50 kg NPK/ha, and 67 kg N/ha). Cultivation was used to control weeds on plots with conventional tillage. Hand weeding was used on plots with no tillage. Herbicide was used on all plots. Some plots were irrigated. Soil samples were collected in December 2003, and June, September, and December 2004 (0–30 cm depth, three samples/plot).
A replicated, controlled study in 1996–1998 in an irrigated tomato field in the San Joaquin Valley, California, USA (same study as (2)), found more soil carbon and earthworms in plots with winter cover crops and no tillage, compared to plots with bare soil in winter and conventional tillage in spring. Organic matter: More soil carbon was found in plots with no tillage, compared to tillage (0.66–0.72% vs 0.62% carbon, 0–0.6 inches depth). Soil organisms: More earthworms were found in plots with no tillage, compared to tillage (2.1 vs 0.6 earthworms/square foot). Methods: There were 12 plots (4.5 x 27.5 m plots) for each of two treatments (two grass-legume mixtures as winter cover crops, sown in October 1996–1997, killed and retained as mulch, with no tillage, in March 1997–1998) and there were 12 control plots (bare-soil fallow in winter, with herbicide, and conventional tillage in spring). Soil carbon was sampled in September 1998 (eight subsamples/plot, 0–0.6 inches depth). Earthworms were sampled in March 1998 (two cylinders/plot, 16.5 inches diameter, 6 inches depth, sprinkled with mustard powder so that earthworms would come to the surface). It was not clear whether these results were a direct effect of cover crops or tillage.
