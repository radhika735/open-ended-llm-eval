Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
The effectiveness category for this action refers to its effects on soil fertility (not its effects on greenhouse gases or climate regulation).

Key Messages:

Supporting Evidence:
A replicated, controlled study in 1998–1999 in irrigated arable farmland in Spain found more nitrate in soils with added slurry, compared to soils without it. Nutrients: More nitrate was found in soils with added slurry, compared to soils without it (40–90 vs 10–22 mg/kg). Methods: Plots (10 × 11 m) had added pig slurry (165 kg/ha) or no added fertilizer (three replicates each). Slurry was incorporated into the soil, five days after application, using a rotocultivator (0–5 cm depth). Soil samples were taken during the first 15 days after application and every 2 weeks thereafter. 
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 2002 in irrigated arable farmland in Spain found higher nitrous oxide emissions in plots with added slurry, compared to plots without it. Greenhouse gases: Higher nitrous oxide emissions were found in plots with added slurry, compared to plots without it, in one of two comparisons (1.1 vs 0.5 g N/m2). Implementation options: Similar nitrous oxide emissions were found in plots with surface application, compared to injection, of slurry (0.8 vs 1 g N/m2). Methods: Plots (3 x 3 m) growing tall fescue Festuca arundinacea had pig slurry (surface application or injection, 200 kg N/ha) or no fertilizer (three plots each). Each plot had a lysimeter (1 x 1 m, 0.75 m depth) to measure leaching. Slurry was injected (5 L/m) or applied with a watering can. Water (5 L/plot) was added to the control plots. All plots were sprinkler-irrigated (June–August: daily; September: twice/week). Soil cores were taken from the centre of the plots (0–10 cm depth). Gas samples were taken (chambers, 30 cm diameter, 30 cm height) twice/day for 1–4 days after slurry application, every 2–3 days from 7 to 40 days after application, once/week in July and August, and every fortnight in September–December. 
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 2004 in a maize field in the Jarama river basin, Spain, found higher nitrous oxide emissions from soils fertilized with slurry, compared to unfertilized soils. Greenhouse gases: Higher nitrous oxide emissions were found in soils with slurry, compared to unfertilised soils (untreated pig slurry: 8.3 vs 6.0; digested pig slurry: 7.7 vs 6.0 kg N/ha). Implementation options: No difference in nitrous oxide emissions was found between soils fertilized with digested pig slurry or untreated pig slurry (7.7 vs 8.3 kg N/ha). Methods: There were three plots (40 m2) for each of two treatments (untreated pig slurry or anaerobically digested thin fraction of pig slurry) and one control (no slurry). Both slurries were applied at a rate of 175 kg available N/ha. Nitrous oxide was measured in closed chambers (two chambers/plot, one within a maize row, one between rows; 35 cm diameter, 23 cm height; one sample/week, April-September). 
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 2006 in a barley field in the Henares river basin, Spain, found no difference in greenhouse-gas emissions between soils with or without added slurry. Greenhouse gases: No differences in greenhouse-gas emissions were found between soils with or without added slurry (digested slurry, carbon dioxide: 465 vs 411 kg C/ha; methane: –287 vs –294 mg C/m2; untreated slurry, carbon dioxide: 447 vs 411; methane: –229 vs –294). Implementation options: No differences in greenhouse-gas emissions were found between soils fertilized with digested slurry, compared to untreated slurry (carbon dioxide: 465 vs 447 kg C/ha; methane: –287 vs –229 mg C/m2). Methods: There were three plots (30 m2) for each of two treatments (anaerobically digested thin fraction of pig slurry or untreated pig slurry) and three control plots (no slurry). Slurry was applied in January (125 kg available N/ha). Plots were cultivated (5 cm depth) to incorporate the slurry. Barley was planted in January and harvested in June. Greenhouse-gas emissions were measured with closed chambers (35 cm diameter, 25 cm height, 1–4 measurements/plot/week, 23 January–28 November). 
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 2007–2009 in an irrigated onion field near Madrid, Spain, found that more nitrous oxide was emitted from, and less methane was absorbed by, plots with added slurry, compared to plots without it. Greenhouse gases: More nitrous oxide was emitted from plots with slurry, compared to plots without it (1 vs 0.4 kg/ha), and less methane was absorbed by plots with slurry (–0.5 vs –1 kg/ha). Methods: Plots (20 m2) had anaerobically digested pig slurry (110 kg N/ha) or no fertilizer in 2007 and 2008 (three plots for each). Slurry was immediately incorporated into the soil (10 cm depth), using a rotocultivator. Plots were irrigated 1–2 times/week (608–618 mm/year). Greenhouse-gas samples (closed chambers, 19 litre volume, 10 mL samples, 0, 30, and 60 minutes after closing) and soil samples (0–10 cm depth) were collected four times/week in the first two weeks after fertilizer was applied, twice/week during the first month, and once/week until the end of cropping season. 
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 2007 in an irrigated melon field in Spain found lower nitrous oxide emissions from plots with added slurry, compared to plots without it. Greenhouse gases: Higher nitrous oxide emissions were found in plots with added slurry, compared to plots without it (1–3 vs 2–3 kg/ha). Methods: Plots (4 x 5 m) growing melon Cucumis melo (6,950 plants/ha) had digested pig slurry or no slurry, and were either drip or furrow irrigated (three plots for each). Slurry was applied using a hose pipe (175 kg N/ha). Additional fertilizers were added immediately after (phosphorous: 50 kg/ha; potassium: 150 kg/ha). Slurry and fertilizer were incorporated into the soil (15 cm) using a rotocultivator. For furrow irrigation (2 L/min), there were five furrows/plot (80 cm width, 15 cm depth, 100 cm apart). For drip irrigation (3 L/h), there were two lines/subplot (1.8 m apart). Irrigation was applied 20 times, on a weekly basis. Gas samples were taken weekly until irrigation, daily for the first week after fertilizer application, 2–3 days/week for the first month, and then weekly. 
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 2006–2008 in a cereal field in the Castelo Branco region, Portugal, found similar amounts of nitrate in soils with or without added slurry. Nutrients: Similar amounts of nitrate were found in plots with and without added slurry (1–22 vs 1–10 mg NO3–N/L water). Methods: Water in the soil was collected in porous ceramic suction cup samplers (four/plot; 0.6–0.7 m depth; 50 kPa for 24 hours), whenever drainage occurred (October–November and April–May; 16 samples in total). Cattle slurry was added to three treatment plots (5.6 x 8 m), but not three control plots, in spring. Maize was grown in spring–summer, and oats were grown in autumn–winter. 
A meta-analysis from 2013 of studies in Mediterranean climates found similar percentages of organic carbon in soils with or without added slurry. Organic matter: There was no difference in organic carbon between soils with or without added slurry (2% higher in soils with slurry).

The Web of Knowledge database was searched, using the keywords, “Mediterranean”, “soil”, and “conventional”, and 3 data sets from 3 studies of slurry amendment were found and meta-analysed. The most recent studies included in this meta-analysis were published in 2011.
