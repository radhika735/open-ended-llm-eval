2913: Establish a network of legally protected areas
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves establishing a network of legally protected areas with connectivity, such as migration routes, between them. This may provide suitable habitats and safe routes for range expansion of marine and freshwater mammals in response to climate change.
See also Legally protect areas where climate change impacts are predicted to be less severe.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of establishing a network of legally protected areas on marine and freshwater mammal populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
