1491: Thin trees within forests
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Thinning of trees entails the removal of trees to reduce density. This intervention, which is usually undertaken in commercial forestry to ensure that stands are made up of healthy even-spaced trees, aims to restore more natural open forest by increasing structural diversity in young even-aged stands and promoting the development of larger trees, multi-level canopies, and understorey vegetation. Although originally used in the context of commercial forestry, this intervention is believed to also promote primate conservation in selectively-logged forest.
            The clearing of open patches in the forest to reduce undergrowth density is discussed under ‘Clear open patches in the forest’. The clearing of secondary mid-storey and ground-level vegetation is discussed under ‘Manually control or remove secondary mid-storey and ground-level vegetation’.

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of thinning trees within forests on primate populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
