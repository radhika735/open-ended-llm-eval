2012: Introduce or enforce legislation to prevent ponds and streams from being contaminated by toxins
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Contamination of ponds and streams by toxins can reduce the availability of prey and cause the build-up of toxins in the food chain. Toxic heavy metals have been found in high concentrations in bats (Zukal et al. 2015), although little is known about the long-term impacts.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of introducing or enforcing legislation to prevent ponds and streams from being contaminated by toxins on bat populations.
