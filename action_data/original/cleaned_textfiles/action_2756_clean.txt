2756: Use real-time automated tools on board vessels to detect mammals and allow vessel course or speed to be altered
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Using tools on board vessels that automatically detect marine or freshwater mammals within shipping lanes in real time and alert crew to their presence may allow collisions to be avoided. Techniques may include infra-red imaging, active sonar, Radio Detection and Ranging (RADAR), or passive acoustic monitoring (Pyć et al. 2016, Horton et al. 2017).

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of using real-time automated tools on board vessels to detect mammals and allow vessel course or speed to be altered.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
