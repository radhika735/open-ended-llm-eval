71: Implement food labelling schemes relating to biodiversity-friendly farming (organic, LEAF marque)	
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:

Some food products now carry certification labels such as the LEAF (Linking Environment and Farming) Marque (Integrated Farm Management) or are labelled as organic. These schemes are designed to allow biodiversity-friendly farming to attract a price premium, become more profitable and therefore spread, potentially benefiting biodiversity.

 

Key Messages:

We have captured no evidence for the effects of implementing food labelling schemes relating to biodiversity-friendly farming (organic, LEAF marque) on farmland wildlife.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
