Key Messages:
Pest regulation (0 studies)
Crop damage (0 studies)
Ratio of natural enemies to pests (0 studies)
Pest numbers (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study from Australia found less weed biomass in plots with a canola-wheat sequence, compared to a wheat-wheat sequence.
Natural enemy numbers (0 studies)
Implementation options (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study from the USA found similar amounts of weed biomass in plots with four-year or two-year crop rotations.

Supporting Evidence:
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 1994–1998 on an irrigated, arable farm near Davis, California, USA, found similar amounts of weed biomass in plots with four-year or two-year crop rotations. Implementation options: Similar amounts of weed biomass were found in plots with four-year or two-year crop rotations (4–273 vs 140–467 kg dry weight/ha). Methods: A four-year rotation (tomato, safflower, corn and wheat, beans) was used on 16 plots (four plots for each phase, each year), and a two-year rotation (tomato, wheat) was used on eight plots (four plots for each phase, each year). Each plot was 68 x 18 m. Fertilizer and pesticide were used on all plots. Weeds were sampled in the tomato plots, at harvest, in 1994–1998. 
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 2010–2011 in a rainfed field in Western Australia found less weed biomass in plots with a canola-wheat sequence, compared to a wheat-wheat sequence. Pest numbers: Less weed biomass was found in plots with a canola-wheat sequence, compared to a wheat-wheat sequence (36 vs 43 g/m2). Methods: Wheat or canola was grown on three plots each in 2010, and wheat was grown on all plots in 2011. Each plot was 1.4 x 40 m. Fertilizer (150 kg/ha/year) and herbicide were used on all plots. Weeds were sampled at the end of 2011.
