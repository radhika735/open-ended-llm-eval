Supporting Evidence:
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 1983–1996 in a rainfed wheat field in the Henares river valley, Spain, found similar crop yields in plots with reduced tillage or conventional tillage. Crop yield: Similar wheat yields were found in plots with reduced tillage or conventional tillage (2.6 vs 2.5 Mg/ha). Methods: Conventional tillage or reduced tillage was used on four plots each. Each plot had two subplots (20 x 30 m, with or without crop rotations). A mouldboard plough (30 cm depth) was used for conventional tillage, in autumn. A chisel plough (20 cm depth) was used for reduced tillage, in autumn. A tine cultivator (10–15 cm depth, two passes) was used for both conventional and reduced tillage, in spring. Fertilizer and post-emergence herbicide were used on all plots. Wheat was harvested at maturity (July 1996), and yield was measured in two strips/subplot (1.4 x 30 m strips). 
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 1998–2000 in an irrigated vegetable field in the Salinas Valley, California, USA, found that tillage had inconsistent effects on crop yield and quality. Crop yield: Lower broccoli yields were found in plots with reduced tillage, compared to conventional tillage (610–620 vs 630–640 g dry weight/m2). Higher lettuce yields were found in plots with reduced tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in two of six comparisons (310–410 vs 300–390 g dry weight/m2), but lower lettuce yields were found in two of six comparisons (280–390 vs 300–430). Crop quality: Smaller lettuce or broccoli plants were found in plots with reduced tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in five of eight comparisons (lettuce: 750–1,080 vs 830–1,150 g fresh weight/plant; broccoli: 240 vs 270), but larger plants were found in two of eight comparisons (lettuce: 1,090 vs 1,050; broccoli: 230 vs 210). Methods: There were four plots (0.52 ha), for each of four treatments (reduced tillage or conventional tillage, with or without added organic matter). In plots with added organic matter, compost was added two times/year, and a cover crop (Merced rye) was grown every autumn or winter. Lettuce or broccoli crops were grown in raised beds. Sprinklers and drip irrigation were used in all plots. Soils were disturbed to different depths (conventional tillage: disking to 50 cm depth, cultivating, sub-soiling, bed re-making, and bed-shaping; reduced tillage: cultivating to 20 cm depth, rolling, and bed-shaping). Crops were collected in two 2 m2 areas/plot.

A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 2009–2011 in two irrigated pepper fields in central Italy found no difference in crop yields between plots with reduced tillage or conventional tillage. Crop yield: No difference in pepper yields was found between plots with reduced tillage or conventional tillage (3.7–41.4 vs 2.2–40.2 t/ha, fresh weight). Methods: A mouldboard plough (30 cm depth) was used on all plots in autumn, before winter cover crops were planted. Cover crops were mown or chopped in spring, before tillage. Conventional tillage or reduced tillage was used on 12 plots each (6 x 12 m plots), in May 2010–2011. A mouldboard plough and a disc (two passes) were used for conventional tillage (which incorporated the cover crop residues into the soil to a depth of 30 cm).

Methods: Reduced tillage or conventional tillage was used on nine plots each (6 x 4 m plots). Each plot had a winter cover crop (hairy vetch, oats, or oilseed rape). Cover crops were sown in September 2009–2010 and suppressed in May 2010–2011. A mouldboard plough and a disk harrow (two passes) were used for conventional tillage (incorporating the cover crop residues to 30 cm depth). A rotary hoe was used for reduced tillage (incorporating the cover crop residues to 10 cm depth). Pepper seedlings were transplanted into these plots in May 2010–2011 and were last harvested in October 2010 and September 2011. After the pepper harvest, endive and savoy cabbage seedlings were transplanted into these plots, and they were harvested in December 2010 and November 2011 (endive) or March 2011 and February 2012 (cabbage). No fertilizer was added while the crops were growing, but the plots were irrigated.

Crop yield: Higher wheat yields were found in plots with reduced tillage, compared to conventional tillage (1,324 vs 1,238 kg grain/ha). Lower wheat yields were found in plots that were tilled to 15 cm depth, compared to 20–25 cm depth (1,392 vs 1,516–1,518 kg/ha). Implementation options: Higher wheat yields were found in plots that were tilled at slower tractor speeds (0.69–1.25 m/s: 1,454–1,528 kg/ha), compared to the fastest speed (1.53 m/s: 1,397 kg/ha). Methods: Reduced tillage or conventional tillage was used on three plots each (0.45 ha plots). A chisel plough was used for both reduced tillage (one pass) and conventional tillage (two passes). Each plot had three subplots (0.15 ha subplots, tilled to 15, 20, or 25 cm depth). Each subplot had four sub-subplots (size not reported; tilled at 0.69, 1, 1.25, or 1.53 m/s). Wheat was planted in December 2012, fertilized, and harvested in May 2013. 
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 2009–2011 in an irrigated eggplant field in central Italy found that tillage had inconsistent effects on crop yield. Crop yield: Higher eggplant yields were found in plots with reduced tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in three of four comparisons (21–36 vs 18–32 Mg/ha fresh weight), but lower yields were found in one of four comparisons (7 vs 14). Methods: A mouldboard plough (30 cm depth) was used on all plots in autumn, before winter cover crops were planted. Cover crops were mown or chopped in spring, before tillage. Reduced tillage or conventional tillage was used on 12 plots each (6 x 4 m plots). A mouldboard plough (30 cm depth) and a disc (two passes) were used for conventional tillage (which incorporated the cover crop residues into the soil). A rotary hoe (10 cm depth) was used for reduced tillage (which incorporated some of the cover crop residues into the soil). Eggplant seedlings were transplanted into the plots in May, and fruits were harvested four times/year in July–September 2010–2011. All plots were fertilized before the cover crops were grown, but not after. All plots were irrigated.
