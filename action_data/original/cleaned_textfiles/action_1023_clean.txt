1023: Restrict timing of timber treatment application
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be ineffective or harmful
Background information and definitions:
Restricting the timing of timber treatment application, e.g. to periods when bats are not present within a roost, may reduce the impact on bats.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of restricting the timing of timber treatment application on bat populations. The study was in the UK.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Survival (1 study): One replicated, controlled laboratory study in the UK found that treating timber with lindane and pentachlorophenol 14 months prior to exposure by bats increased survival but did not prevent death.

BEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)  

Supporting Evidence:
A replicated, controlled study in 1982–1984 in a laboratory in northeast Scotland, UK (Racey & Swift 1986) found that treating cages with a commercial remedial timber treatment 14 months prior to exposure by common pipistrelle bats Pipistrellus pipistrellus resulted in bats surviving for longer than when cages were treated six weeks before exposure, but all bats still died. Bats survived longer in cages that had been treated 14 months previously (average 15 days) than cages treated six weeks previously (average four days), but all bats still died within 23 days of exposure. Female common pipistrelle bats were caught at nursery roosts and 10–14 bats were used in each of two trials. Experimental and control cages (40 x 20 x 20 cm) were made from steel or zinc and lined with plywood. Experimental cages were treated with timber treatment (1% w/v lindane and 5% w/v pentachlorophenol in an organic solvent) either 14 months or six weeks before the experiments. Control cages were left untreated. All cages were kept in unheated rooms with constant conditions, and bats were inspected daily for 113–120 days during summer in 1982–1984.
