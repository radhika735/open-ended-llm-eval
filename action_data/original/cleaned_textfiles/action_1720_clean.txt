1720: Retain/create habitat corridors in developed areas
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Habitat corridors are strips that link two larger habitat patches – in this case preventing peatland patches being separated by development. By connecting the habitat patches, corridors could improve survival prospects of peatland plant populations. Seeds, pollen or vegetation fragments can more easily move between the habitat patches (perhaps carried by animals), maintaining populations and diversity in each (Damschen et al. 2006).
Caution: Habitat corridors can also have negative effects, like allowing diseases, non-native species and fire to spread between patches (Resasco et al. 2014).
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: rewetting, because peatlands may be drained to allow development or are dried out by drainage of sites nearby; habitat creation and restoration interventions.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on peatland vegetation, in habitat patches or within corridors, of maintaining or creating habitat corridors in developed areas.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
