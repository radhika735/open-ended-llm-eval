2321: (CFT) Reptiles: Exclude grazers (29c)
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:


Key Messages:
Reptiles (1 study): One replicated site comparison in desert in the USA found lower abundances of reptiles, and of some reptile species, in areas with sheep excluded, compared to grazed areas, in some comparisons.

Supporting Evidence:
A replicated site comparison in 1994–1996 in a desert site in south-central California, USA, found more lizards in fenced plots, compared to unfenced plots. Reptiles: Fewer lizards were found in ungrazed plots, compared to grazed plots (1–4 vs 2–10 lizards/survey), and two of six species were less abundant in ungrazed plots, in some comparisons. Methods: Two 2.25 ha plots that were fenced in 1980 were compared to two plots that were grazed by sheep until 1994. Sites were matched for environmental variables. Lizards were surveyed using 1.25 km transects three times in summer (1994–1995).
