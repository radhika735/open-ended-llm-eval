491: Provide artificial nesting sites for oilbirds
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Oilbirds Steatornis capripensis are a unique, nocturnal species in their own family Steatornithidae, related to nightjars, potoos and frogmouths. However, unlike their relatives oilbirds feed entirely on fruit and nest and roost in caves in northern and central South America. It is thought that the availability of nesting and roosting sites in these caves may limit populations, although increasing habitat destruction is also threatening the species (Thomas 1999).

Key Messages:
A before-and after-study in Trinidad and Tobago found an increase in size of an oilbird colony following the creation of artificial nesting ledges.
 

Supporting Evidence:
A before-and after-study at a colony of oilbirds Steatornis capripensis nesting in a cave at the Asa Wright Nature Center, Trinidad (Lambie 1993), found that the population increased from 25-30 birds to more than 100 individuals and 43 nests by 1977 following the installation of  artificial concrete ledges in 1967-1968. Before this, the colony appeared limited in size by the 15 or 16 ledge nest sites available. In 1977, 21 of the nests were on artificial ledges.
