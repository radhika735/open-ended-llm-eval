3489: Manage crop diversity
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Some heterogeneity in farmland is thought to be key in determining on-farm biodiversity (Benton et al. 2003). Therefore, increasing the range of different crops grown in a given year may increase the biological value of a farm.
Benton T.G., Vickery J.A. & Wilson J.D. (2003) Farmland biodiversity: is habitat heterogeneity the key? Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 18, 182–188.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of managing crop diversity on reptile populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
