2186: Reduce aquaculture stocking densities
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Aquaculture systems can negatively impact subtidal benthic invertebrate communities through pollution and diminished water quality (Wu et al. 1994). To limit the amount of pollution emitted by one aquaculture site, stocking density could be reduced (Naylor et al. 2000). A lower number of organisms in one area will produce less waste and limit organic enrichment. This may potentially reduce the level of impact in the vicinity of the aquaculture site and allow some recovery of the subtidal benthic invertebrate community.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of reducing aquaculture stocking densities on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.

 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
