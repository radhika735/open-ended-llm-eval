3501: Reduce legal speed limit
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
High vehicle speed is generally considered to be a substantial contributing factor in wildlife-vehicle collisions. Slower road speeds allow drivers to identify and avoid wildlife, as well as allowing reptiles the time necessary to cross roads. Speed limits can be reduced in areas where there are high numbers of collisions, either permanently or during seasonal migrations.
See also Use signage to warn motorists about wildlife presence.
