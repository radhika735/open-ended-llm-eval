1618: Create buffer zones beside roads and other transportation corridors
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Creating buffer zones adjacent to roads and other transportation corridors has been suggested as a way to reduce their impact on surrounding habitats (Spellerberg, 1998). Creating buffer zones increases the distances between roads and adjacent habitat. In particular buffer zones may help to reduce the inputs of pollutants from vehicle exhausts to nutrient-poor shrubland ecosystems (Angold 1997, Milton et al. 2015).

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of creating buffer zones beside roads and other transportation corridors on shrublands.

'We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
