2770: Establish open and transparent reporting of fishing effort data
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Marine fisheries throughout the world are often highly regulated and may be subject to many different international or national laws and byelaws. Effective management relies on accurate information on fishing activity and the level of compliance. One way to encourage compliance and to increase enforcement may be to require commercial fishers to provide detailed information on their fishing operations, including the amount of time spent fishing, catches and landings, to the relevant fisheries administrations. Many countries already have in place schemes to enable catch data reporting (e.g. logbooks) and publish annual fishing effort data that is increasingly freely accessible via the worldwide web. Some countries (e.g. Brazil) have developed online logbooks to increase transparency in reporting compared to paper logbooks that are not widely accessible.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of establishing open and transparent fishing effort data on marine fish populations. 

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
