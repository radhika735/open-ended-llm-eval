466: Reduce incidental mortality from birds being attracted to artificial lights 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Many species of birds fly at night and can be attracted to artificial lights. This can be detrimental both through direct collision mortality, but also because seabirds especially can be vulnerable to predators or dehydration if they are downed by collisions, even if they are not hurt.
Dangerous lights can be designed specifically to be seen, for example on communications towers or lighthouses, or can simply be lights used at night, for example, domestic lighting.
 

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for reduced incidental mortality from birds being attracted to artificial lights.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
