1061: Ponto-Caspian gobies:  Biological control using native predators
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Encouraging native predators could potentially increase predation on the population of invasive gobies, thereby biologically controlling goby populations.  For example, a before-and-after field and modelling study, from 1999-2008 in Lake Erie, North America suggested that predator control of round goby Neogobius melanostomus,
by native burbot Lota lota could be effective at controlling population size (Madenjian et al. 2011).  Populations of native burbot were reported to have high potential for predatory control of invasive round gobies and computer modelling indicated that in 2007, burbot consumed approximately 61% of round goby standing stock (Madenjian et al. 2011). Although many species consume round goby, no effective and species-specific biocontrol has yet been reported. More work is therefore required.

Key Messages:

No evidence was captured on the deliberate introduction of a native predator to biologically control gobies.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
