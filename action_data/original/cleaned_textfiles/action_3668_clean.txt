3668: Modify dams or water impoundments to enable wildlife movements
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Dams or ‘impoundments’ may restrict aquatic reptile movements. Modifying dam structures, for example by providing ladders, may enable reptiles to move up and down stream of dam sites.
See also: Maintain dams or water impoundments.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on reptile populations of modifying dams or water impoundments to enable wildlife movements. This study was in the USA.

Use (1 study): One study in the USA found that an eel ladder was used by common watersnakes in five of eight years.


Supporting Evidence:
A study in 2007–2014 on a river in West Virginia, USA (Welsh & Loughman 2015) found that an eel ladder was used by common watersnakes Nerodia sipedon in five of eight years of monitoring. The ladder was used by common watersnakes (1–5 individuals/year) in five of eight years that the ladder was monitored. A stainless steel fish ladder (11 m long, 13 cm deep and 41 cm wide with a 50° slope containing a suitable substrate for climbing, see original paper for details), designed to facilitate the upstream passage of the snake-like movements of American eels Anguilla rostrata, was installed from late spring (May–July) to autumn (October–November) in 2007–2014 (106–188 days/year). Numbers of snakes (and eels) were monitored by live catching or photographs when they reached the upstream end of the ladder.
