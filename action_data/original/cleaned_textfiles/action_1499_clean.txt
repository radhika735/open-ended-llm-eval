1499: Reduce the size of forestry teams to include employees only (not family members)
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This intervention is based on the observation that high human densities correlate with higher primate threat intensity prevalent in these areas. In other words, primate species facing the most threat are those that occur in regions of higher than average human density (Harcourt & Parks 2003). To promote primate conservation in logging concessions, it is therefore advisable to restrict the number of people in forestry teams (only employees, not family members) and to control the influx of people into logging concessions.
            The provisioning of employees with meat protein is discussed under ‘Provide domestic meat to workers of the logging company to reduce hunting’.

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of reducing the size of forestry teams to include employees only and not family members on primate populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
