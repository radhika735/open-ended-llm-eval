3534: Train vessel operators on appropriate avoidance techniques to reduce collisions 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Sea turtle collisions with vessels may be avoided if animals are detected and avoidance measures are carried out by the vessel operator. Training vessel crew to detect and identify sea turtles and using dedicated observers on vessels may help avoid collisions in daylight on manoeuvrable vessels (Schoeman et al. 2020).

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on reptile populations of training vessel operators on appropriate avoidance techniques to reduce collisions.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
