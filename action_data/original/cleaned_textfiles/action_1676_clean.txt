1676: Parrot’s feather: Use of herbicides - carfentrazone-ethyl
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Chemical herbicides have been used for the localized control of parrot’s feather (e.g. Morreira et al. 1999). Herbicides licensed for use around the world use a wide diversity of different active ingredients (e.g. 2,4-D, imazapyr, carfentrazone-ethyl, diquat). However, herbicide control of aquatic vegetation is prohibited in numerous countries (e.g. no herbicides are approved for submerged species in Europe) (De Winton et al. 2013; Hussner et al. 2017). Therefore it is important to consider local regulations before using herbicide control. Legislative restrictions may be lifted for herbicides under particular conditions (Hussner et al. 2017). Impacts on non-target species should be considered prior to herbicide use.
Emerged and submerged vegetation may require different herbicides, and adjuvants may increase the efficacy of the treatment. More than one application of the herbicide is often required. The use of fungal-based herbicides to control parrot’s feather is discussed under the intervention ‘Biological control using fungal-based herbicides’.

Key Messages:

Five laboratory studies (including one replicated, controlled, before-and-after study) in the USA found that carfentrazone-ethyl reduced growth in parrot’s feather.


Supporting Evidence:
A small, replicated, controlled, before-and-after, laboratory study conducted in 2003 in the USA (Glomski et al. 2006), found that the application of the herbicide carfentrazone-ethyl reduced growth in parrot’s feather Myriophyllum aquaticum but did not lead to plant death. After 28 days, the biomass of parrot’s feather shoots treated with carfentrazone-ethyl was 29.5–54% lower than untreated plants. However, emerged and submerged foliage remained viable. The study was carried out using 12 1,600 l containers filled with water, each of which contained eight 5 l containers with three 15 cm parrot’s feather stems. Each of the three tested herbicide rates (50, 100 and 200 μg/l) was applied to three 1600 l containers, and plants in three containers were left untreated. Plants from four of the eight 5 l plastic containers placed inside each 1600 l container were harvested, dried and weighed before herbicide application, and the remaining plants were harvested, dried and weighed 28 days after herbicide application.
A small, replicated, randomized, controlled, laboratory study conducted in 2004 in the USA (Gray et al. 2007), found that the herbicide carfentrazone-ethyl reduced growth in parrot’s feather Myriophyllum aquaticum. After three weeks, young parrot’s feather plants treated with carfentrazone-ethyl had a lower dry weight (1.8–2.4 g/pot) than untreated plants (6.4–10 g/pot). Parrot’s feather shoots were propagated in 3.9 l plastic containers. Carfentrazone-ethyl application rate ranged between 100 and 200 μg/l and each herbicide rate was applied to three plants.
A small, replicated, controlled, laboratory study conducted in the USA (Richardson et al. 2008), found that the herbicide carfentrazone-ethyl reduced growth in parrot’s feather Myriophyllum aquaticum. Parrot’s feather plants treated with carfentrazone-ethyl had a lower dry weight (0.55–0.88 g) than untreated plants (1.43 g). Parrot’s feather shoot tips (5–10 cm) were transplanted into 9 cm2 pots. Carfentrazone-ethyl application rate ranged between 56 and 224 g/ha and each herbicide rate was applied to pots with three plants and plants in one pot were left unsprayed. Dates of the studies are not presented.
A small, replicated, randomized, controlled, laboratory study conducted in 2006 in the USA (Wersal et al. 2010), found that the application of the herbicide carfentrazone-ethyl reduced growth in parrot’s feather Myriophyllum aquaticum. After four weeks, the dry weight of parrot’s feather plants treated with carfentrazone-ethyl was lower than untreated plants (1–2.1 vs 4.6 g/pot). Daytime and night-time application of the herbicide resulted in similar results. Parrot’s feather shoots were propagated in 3.78 l pots and placed inside 246 l containers filled with water. Each herbicide rate (0.1 and 0.2 mg/l) was applied to three plants.
A small, replicated, controlled, laboratory study conducted between 2007 and 2008 in the USA (Wersal & Madsen 2010) found that the application of the herbicide carfentrazone-ethyl reduced growth of parrot’s feather Myriophyllum aquaticum. After six weeks, the dry weight of parrot’s feather plants treated with carfentrazone-ethyl was lower (10–12 g/pot) than that of untreated plants (18 g/pot). Six weeks after application, plants treated with carfentrazone-ethyl were reduced by 0–15% (visual assessment with 0% corresponding to no reduction in cover relative to untreated plans and 100% to complete elimination). Parrot’s feather shoots were propagated in 3.78 l pots and placed inside 246 l containers filled with water. Each herbicide rate (0.1 and 0.2 mg/l) was applied to four 246 l containers, each holding four plants. Number of plants used as control is not presented.
