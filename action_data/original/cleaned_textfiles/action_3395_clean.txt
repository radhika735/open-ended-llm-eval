3395: Classify conservation status of individual sites
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Classifying the conservation status of individual marshes or swamps, or the level of threat that they face, may help to prioritize sites in need of the most urgent intervention – or avoid wasting resources on sites that are unlikely to be saved by intervention. Lists of the most threatened or degraded sites may also help in arguments to secure funding for conservation. The Montreux Record, for example, is a register of internationally important wetlands where changes in ecological character have occurred, are occurring, or are likely to occur (Ramsar Convention Secretariat 2013).
To be clear, studies would be summarized as evidence for this action if the classification is substantially related to marshes and swamps, even if it involves other wetland habitats (e.g. peatlands), aquatic habitats (e.g. rivers and lakes) or upland habitats (e.g. forests).
Related actions: Designate protected area involving marshes or swamps; Provide general protection for marshes or swamps.

Key Messages:
We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation or human behaviour, of classifying the conservation status of individual marshes or swamps.
 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
