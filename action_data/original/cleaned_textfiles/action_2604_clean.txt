2604: Retain/maintain road verges as small mammal habitat
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Roads can damage or destroy grassland habitats that host a range of mammal species, especially rodents and other small mammals. Roadside verges provide habitat that can at least partly mitigate this loss for a range of small mammal species (e.g. Ascensão et al. 2012; Bellamy et al. 2000).

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of retaining or maintaining road verges as small mammal habitat.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
