965: Modify turbine placement to reduce bat fatalities
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Positioning wind turbines away from bat roosts, foraging areas and commuting or migration routes may reduce bat mortality. At wind farms in the USA, bat fatalities are often dominated by migratory species and are higher during autumn migration periods (e.g. Arnett et al. 2008, Baerwald & Barclay 2009, Piorkowski & O’Connell 2010). A review of reports in northwest Europe found higher fatality rates at wind farms located on forested hills than in flat, open farmland (Rydell et al. 2010). Spatial patterns of bat fatalities within wind farms in Europe and the USA have been found in some studies (Arnett et al. 2008, Baerwald & Barclay 2011, Georgiakakis et al. 2012) but not others (Arnett et al. 2008, Piorkowski & O’Connell 2010).

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of modifying turbine placement to reduce bat fatalities.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
