1463: Re-use old roads rather than building new roads 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Where old roads already exist in an area where development is going to take place, it is likely to be less detrimental for biodiversity if existing roads are re-used (and repaired where necessary) instead of building new roads. This will help to ensure that negative impact of roads (and their construction) on primates and/or their habitat is kept at a minimum.
            Building only the minimum number of roads that is necessary to reach sites and minimizing the construction of secondary roads is discussed under ‘Implement a minimum number of roads (& minimize secondary roads) needed to reach mining sites’.

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of re-using old roads rather than building new roads on primate populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
