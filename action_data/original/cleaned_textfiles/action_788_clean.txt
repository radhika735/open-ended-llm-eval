788: Manage cutting regime
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Many amphibians require damp terrestrial habitat once they move out of water. If vegetation surrounding water bodies is cut very short, it will not retain sufficient humidity and cover for amphibians during their terrestrial stages.  Cutting can also disturb amphibians.

Key Messages:
One study investigating the effects of changing mowing regimes is discussed in ‘Habitat restoration and creation – Change mowing regime’.
