2354: Retain wildlife corridors in residential areas
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Residential and commercial developments can fragment home ranges of mammal species, making access to some resources difficult or dangerous. Retention of wildlife corridors, such as undeveloped land, riversides, woodland strips or other habitat through which mammals can pass, may help to reduce or mitigate some of these impacts of development.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on mammals of retaining wildlife corridors in residential areas. This study was in Botswana.

Use (1 study): A replicated study in Botswana found that retained wildlife corridors in residential areas were used by 19 mammal species, including African elephants.


Supporting Evidence:
A replicated study in 2012–2014 in seven semi-arid residential and agricultural sites in northern Botswana (Adams et al. 2017) found that retained wildlife corridors in residential areas were used by African elephants Locondonta africana and 18 other mammal species. There were 2,619 camera-trap images of elephants captured, over 516 days. Elephant activity peaked in August, when 13 elephants/day were detected. Nineteen mammal species in total were recorded, including civet Civettictis civetta and buffalo Syncerus caffer (other species not named). Seven corridors that crossed urban and agricultural areas between a forest reserve and a major river were monitored using camera traps. The seven corridors were either fenced or otherwise ran between developed areas. They were 750–1,700 m long and 3–250 m wide. Camera traps were attached to trees or posts at 1.5–1.8 m high and operated for 24 hours/day from 1 November 2012 to 30 April 2014.
