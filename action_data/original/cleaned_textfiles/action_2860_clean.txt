2860: Treat disease in wild marine and freshwater mammals
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Treatment of diseases in wild marine and freshwater mammals can be problematic. It can be difficult to diagnose causes of illness and the direct administration of medicines to target individuals can be challenging. The treatment of disease in wild marine and freshwater mammals is usually only carried out in cases of highly threatened species, or when there are potential public health risks or economic costs associated with not treating. This intervention involves treating wild mammals or those temporarily confined for treatment, with the aim of releasing treated individuals to improve the health of wild populations. For studies that treated mammals for disease in captivity as part of a rehabilitation programme, see Rehabilitate and release injured, sick or weak marine and freshwater mammals.
