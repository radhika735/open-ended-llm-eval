1119: Asian clams: Clean equipment
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
The economic impacts of Asian clams Corbicula spp. might be reduced by the regular cleaning of vulnerable equipment and machinery. Cleaning can often be easily managed and cost-effective.
 

Key Messages:

A study in Portugal found that mechanical removal and regular cleaning of industrial pipes or addition of a sand filter were effective methods of permanently removing or reducing numbers of Asian clams, respectively.

 

Supporting Evidence:
A study conducted in 1980-2010 at a power station and drinking water treatment plant in Portugal (Rosa et al. 2011) found that subjecting structures infested by the Asian clam Corbicula fluminea to cleaning, maintenance and sand filtration prevented or reduced re-infestation. At the power station, cleaning and maintenance procedures completely removed clam populations from the bypass channel of the power station and prevented re-infestation. At the treatment plant, installation of a multilayer sand-filter downstream from the raw water reservoir significantly reduced the amount of Asian clams passing through into the waterworks. Of the facilities managers interviewed, three out of 420 drinking water plants and two out of six power plants provided details on clam control. Managers were interviewed about past or current occurrence of clam infestation episodes, the types of structures affected, interventions in place and their degree of success. Interventions included mechanically removing and washing out clams, shortening the period between filter maintenance and regularly replacing sand in the multilayer sand filter.
