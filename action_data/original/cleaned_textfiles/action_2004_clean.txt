2004: Use collar-mounted devices on cats to reduce predation of bats
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Collar-mounted devices, such as bells, alarms, and lights may reduce predation by making cats more conspicuous. Cats equipped with collar-mounted bells, sonic devices and a ‘pounce protector bib’ have been found to capture fewer mammals than without the devices (Nelson et al. 2005, Calver et al. 2007). Bats were among the mammals caught, but numbers captured with and without the devices were not reported.
For other interventions relating to cat predation, see ‘Exclude domestic and feral cats from bat roosts and roost entrances’ and ‘Keep domestic cats indoors at night’.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of using collar-mounted devices on cats to reduce predation of bats on bat populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
