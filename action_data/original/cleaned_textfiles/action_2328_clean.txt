2328: Set maximum number of people/vehicles approaching mammals
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
At some sites, such as at national parks where safaris are a popular means of visitors observing animals, large numbers of people or vehicles approaching mammals may cause them disturbance or cause changes in their behaviour. This may restrict areas that these animals use or affect hunting or feeding opportunities. Setting limits on the numbers of people or vehicles permitted to be in close proximity to such animals may lessen such potential impacts.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on mammals of setting a maximum to the number of people or vehicles permitted to approach mammals.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
