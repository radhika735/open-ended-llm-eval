3789: Provide rewards (monetary or non-monetary) for reporting injured or entangled reptiles
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
A reward system may increase the incentive to report injured or entangled reptiles, and as such increase the number of these reptiles that may be assisted/rescued. Before implementing any rewards system, the potential for unintended consequences should be carefully considered.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of providing rewards for reporting injured or entangled reptiles on their populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches.
