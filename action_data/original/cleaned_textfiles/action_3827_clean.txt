3827: Employ adaptive management methods to achieve long-term goals
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Adaptive management is an approach to natural resource management that deals with uncertainty about the impacts of actions/decisions or policy choices (Walters 2007). It seeks to continually improve management strategies in response to new information and measured changes (e.g. in climate or population). However, adaptive management methods are often based on predicted outcomes, for example using Management Strategy Evaluation (Edwards & Dankel 2016) and therefore not including in the evidence here. Employing adaptive management in fisheries may help prevent over-fishing or restore depleted populations.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of employing adaptive management methods to achieve long-term goals on marine fish populations.

 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
