2286: Restore bat foraging habitat at ex-quarry sites
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Abandoned mining sites, such as quarries, may be rehabilitated to provide foraging habitat for bats, e.g. through the restoration of grassland, trees and wetlands.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of restoring bat foraging habitat at ex-quarry sites on bat populations. The study was in France.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in France found that gravel-sand pits had higher overall bat activity (relative abundance) 10 years after restoration than gravel-sand pit sites before or during quarrying.

BEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)

Supporting Evidence:
A replicated, site comparison study in 2009–2013 of 21 gravel-sand pit sites in France (Kerbiriou et al. 2018) found that restored gravel-sand pits had higher overall bat activity 10 years after restoration than gravel-sand pit sites before or during quarrying, but there was no difference for gravel-sand pits less than 10 years after restoration. Overall bat activity was higher at gravel-sand pits that had been restored more than 10 years previously (average 0.8 bat passes/six minute interval) than at gravel-sand pit sites before or during quarrying (both 0.3 bat passes). However, there was no significant difference between gravel-sand pits restored 5–10 years previously (0.5 bat passes) or less than five years previously (0.4 bat passes) and gravel-sand pit sites before or during quarrying. Twelve bat species were recorded in total (see original paper for data for individual species). Gravel-sand pit sites (average 4 ha) consisted of bare soil and were restored to water, wooded vegetation and meadows after quarrying ceased. At each of 21 sites, 1–5 points (18–37 points/treatment in total across all sites) were sampled with bat detectors during two visits/year in June–September 2009–2013.
