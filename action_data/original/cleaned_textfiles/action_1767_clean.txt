1767: Implement biosecurity measures to prevent introductions of problematic species
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
It is often cheaper and easier to prevent problematic species from being introduced to a site than trying to control them afterwards (Leung et al. 2002). This section includes all interventions aiming to directly prevent introductions of problematic species: from physical biosecurity measures like cleaning and drying equipment between sites, to legislative measures like banning the sale or ownership of problematic species.
Caution: Bans on sale or ownership of problematic species may encourage mass releases into the wild, from people concerned about their newly illegal organisms (Hulme 2015).
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related action: raise awareness amongst the public about problematic species and biosecurity.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on peatland vegetation, of implementing biosecurity measures to prevent introductions of problematic species.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
