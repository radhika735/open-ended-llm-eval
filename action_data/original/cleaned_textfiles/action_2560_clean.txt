2560: Encourage habitat protection of privately-owned land
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Most land is privately-owned by individuals or businesses. Whilst most of this land is not managed for wildlife conservation, some areas are operated as private nature reserves (e.g. Lanhholz 1996), or as part of larger protected areas, including corridors and buffer zones (e.g. Environmental Law Institute 2003, Figgis 2004). On other land, a wide range of individual actions may be taken to promote or conserve wildlife. The effectiveness of these individual actions is covered under those specific interventions. This intervention more generally considers the effectiveness of promoting habitat conservation among private landowners.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on mammals of encouraging habitat protection of privately-owned land.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
