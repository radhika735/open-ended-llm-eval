2035: Restore or create linear habitat features/green corridors
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Linear habitat features, such as riparian corridors, woodland edge, tree lines and hedgerows, are important to maintain connectivity across the landscape for bats. These features may be restored or created to connect patches of isolated natural or semi-natural habitat.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of restoring or creating linear habitat features/green corridors on bat populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches.
