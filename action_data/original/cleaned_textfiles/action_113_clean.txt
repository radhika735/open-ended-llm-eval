113: Provide training for land managers, farmers and farm advisers
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:

This refers to training events on general or specialized aspects of wildlife conservation on farms. It is a way of building capacity and knowledge amongst farmers and land managers.

 

Key Messages:

One study from the UK found farmers who were trained in how to implement agri-environment schemes created better quality wildlife habitat over five years.


Supporting Evidence:
A recently completed project under the UK’s Rural Economy and Land Use (RELU) programme showed that farmers who were trained in how to implement agri-environment schemes created better quality wildlife habitat, in terms of flower resources for bees (Apidae) and seeds for birds, over five years. This was reflected in local increases in target species of bird and bee. The results from this project are not yet published, but briefly described in RELU Policy and Practice note number 37 (Rural Economy and Land Use Programme 2012). Details of the experimental design are not given.
