1980: Restrict the collection of bat specimens for research
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Both ethical and conservation concerns have been raised over the unnecessary collection of bat specimens for research (e.g. Russo et al. 2017). It has been suggested that there should be stricter regulation and the use of alternatives, such as collecting tissue or fur samples for molecular analysis, should be encouraged.
