379: Control mammalian predators on islands for raptors 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
The effectiveness assessment of the control of mammalian predators on islands was carried out across all bird species groups.

Key Messages:
A study in Mauritius found that numbers of Mauritius kestrel Falco punctatus may have increased following the trapping of predators near nests. However, the authors do not provide any data to support this observation.
 

Supporting Evidence:
A study of an integrated conservation programme for the endangered Mauritius kestrel Falco punctatus from 1973-1994 in montane forest habitat and a captive breeding centre in Black River, Mauritius (Jones et al. 1995) found that trapping and removing nest predators may have significantly increased breeding pair productivity. Two introduced predators (small Indian mongoose Herpestes auropunctatus and feral cat Felis catus) were trapped near some wild nests and at all artificial nestboxes. The authors provide no data on the numbers of predators trapped or experimental data on the effects of their removal.
