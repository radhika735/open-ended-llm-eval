3417: Burn vegetation before seeding/planting
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Burning of vegetation in degraded grasslands can reduce dense swards and the encroachment of woody shrubs or invasive non-native species. When carried out prior to seeding or planting, this may aid the germination and colonisation of grassland plants.
For studies that remove vegetation prior to sowing or planting using mechanical methods, see ‘Remove vegetation before seeding/planting’, or for studies that apply herbicide, see ‘Apply herbicide before seeding/planting’.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of burning vegetation before seeding/planting on grassland vegetation.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
