1089: Ponto-Caspian gammarids: Exposure to parasites
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Parasites have the potential to control gammarid populations by reducing production of offspring, increasing risk of predation, slowing growth rates or causing death. In the wild, parasite infections have been associated with rapid die-offs of natural populations of freshwater shrimps, with the invasive species being more vulnerable than native species (Kestrup et al. 2011).

Key Messages:

A replicated, laboratory study in Canada found that an introduced parasitic mould reduced populations of an invasive shrimp.

 

Supporting Evidence:
A replicated, controlled laboratory study in 2011 in Canada (Kestrup  et al. 2011) found that a parasitic water mould (oomycete) of unknown origin infected and killed invasive gammarids Echinogammarus ischnus. Invasive shrimps exposed to water carrying the mould had a 52% mortality rate after seven days, compared with 16% mortality in native shrimps. Laboratory tests used 20 replicate aquaria each containing 10 invasive and 10 native (Gammarus faciatus) shrimps. Two litres of river water was placed in each aquarium from the St. Lawrence River, which was the location of the mould’s original discovery.  Aquaria were checked twice daily for seven days and dead individuals were removed.
