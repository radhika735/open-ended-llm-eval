3398: Sow grassland forb species
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Many former pastures are dominated by relatively few grass species. Sowing grassland forbs may help other grassland species colonise these sites as well as helping to increase plant diversity.

Key Messages:

One study examined the effects of sowing grassland forb species on grassland vegetation. The study was in Belgium.

Germination/Emergence (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in Belgium found that sowing seeds of grassland forb species did not increase the number of seedlings for three forb species.


Supporting Evidence:
A replicated, controlled study in 2006–2007 in five grassland restoration sites in Belgium (Piqueray et al. 2013) found that sowing seeds of grassland forbs did not increase the number of seedlings for three forb species. The average number of pasqueflower Pulsatilla vulgaris seedlings did not differ significantly between plots where seeds were sown (0.6 seedlings/plot) and plots where seeds were not sown (0 seedlings/plot). Two other species, mountain clover Trifolium montanum and prostrate speedwell Veronica prostrata, did not germinate in either sown or unsown plots. In May–August 2007, at each of five sites, 25 seeds of pasqueflower, mountain clover or prostrate speedwell were sown in four 1 x 1 m plots, and in four plots no seeds were sown. All sites were former forest stands that were clearcut and restored to grassland 3–14 years before the study. In May 2008, the number of seedlings in each plot was counted.
