3860: Provide shelter habitat against highly adverse weather conditions 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of storms and flooding. Such severe weather events pose a threat to the survival of butterflies and moths in all of their four life stages (Joy & Pullin 1997, 1999). Shelter habitat, which provides protection against extreme weather, may include vegetation or banks to protect against wind and rain, raised sites on free-draining soil to protect against flooding, flood defences to protect against tidal surges, or any other habitat created specifically for protection or shelter.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of providing shelter habitat against highly adverse weather conditions.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
