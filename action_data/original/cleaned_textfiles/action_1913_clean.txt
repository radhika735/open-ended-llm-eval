Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Automated feeders can remove human contact for animals being prepared for reintroduction and could reduce stress for animals nervous of human interaction. Additionally, automatic feeders allow food quantity and intake to be monitored to maintain animals at their healthy weight. They are also utilized as a method to schedule feeding times, see 2.21. Provide food on a random temporal schedule.
