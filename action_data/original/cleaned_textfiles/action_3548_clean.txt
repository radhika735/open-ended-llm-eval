3548: Set commercial catch quotas
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Commercial fishing and harvest quotas (such as ‘Total Allowable Catch’) are a means by which many governments and local regulatory bodies regulate biological resources i.e. species stocks. Setting catch quotas for specific fisheries (for instance cod), can potentially reduce the pressure on other species not targeted by the fishery but commonly affected or caught during fishing operations.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on reptile populations of setting commercial catch quotas.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
