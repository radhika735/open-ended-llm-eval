3573: Establish emergency plans for oil spills
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Oil spills are an obvious threat in marine and aquatic environments because the oil spreads quickly through the water column and can contaminate beaches and other coastal habitats. Oil spill emergency plans provide an overview of possible procedures, as well as details of which authorities to contact, should an oil spill occur. The aim of emergency plans is to increase the speed and effectiveness of the response to minimize harmful impacts (Li et al. 2016).
