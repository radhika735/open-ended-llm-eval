1919: Carnivores: Feed individuals within a social group
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Feeding within a social group is natural for many species. For example, wolves have a strong social dynamic, and feeding behaviours reinforce social ranking. In captivity, animals may be housed individually either routinely (e.g. in some laboratory contexts) or temporarily (e.g. for medical treatment).Â 

Key Messages:

No evidence was captured for the effects of feeding individuals within a social group.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
