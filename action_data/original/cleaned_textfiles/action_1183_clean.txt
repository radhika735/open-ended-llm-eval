1183: Provide fuel efficient stoves
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
In many areas wood is the main fuel used for cooking and heating. The high demand for firewood can lead to strong pressure on forests. By providing fuel-efficient stoves, less wood is required, which may lead to reduced exploitation of forests.
