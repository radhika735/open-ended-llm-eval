3504: Alter road surfaces
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Due to the way that reptiles regulate their body temperature using external sources, it is possible that sun-warmed roads surfaces may contribute to road-related mortality. Gravel roads are cooler than surrounding natural habitats and may offer an intervention option to prevent reptiles from crossing roads (Shine et al. 2004).

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of altering road surfaces on reptile populations. This study was in Canada.

Use (1 study): One replicated study in Canada found that paved roads were not used more by Blanding’s turtles than unpaved roads.


Supporting Evidence:
A replicated study in 2010 in wetlands and forests bisected by roads along the Ottawa River in southern Québec, Canada (Proulx et al. 2014) found that Blanding's turtles Emydoidea blandingii did not cross paved roads more compared to unpaved roads. Blanding’s turtles showed similar levels of use of paved roads (0.1 crossings/individual) compared to unpaved roads (1.0 crossings/individual). Twenty-four of 52 turtles crossed roads. Fifty-two Blanding's turtles (22 females, 24 males, 6 juveniles) were captured by hand or using hoop nets and a radio transmitter was attached to their shell. All turtles were tracked every 2–4 days from May to August 2010.
