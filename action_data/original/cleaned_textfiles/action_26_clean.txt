26: Restrict certain pesticides
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:


Key Messages:
One site comparison study in Italy showed that a reduction in the number of solitary bee species in late summer associated with repeated applications of the insecticide fenitrothion can be avoided by not applying the insecticide.

Supporting Evidence:
Brittain et al. (2010) compared the wild bee and butterfly communities in 17 conventional grapevine fields with those in four vine fields in a natural park with negligible insecticide use, in Veneto, northeastern Italy. Sites with and without insecticide treatments had different landscape features and sample sizes in this study, so direct comparison is difficult. However, the study found that a reduction in the number of wild bee species caught in pan traps in July and August, apparently associated with two or more applications of the insecticide fenitrothion, did not happen in vine fields that were not treated. Bumblebees, counted in transect walks, were not affected by fenitrothion applications in this way.
