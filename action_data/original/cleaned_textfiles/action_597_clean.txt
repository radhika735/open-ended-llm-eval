A review of a captive-breeding programme on Mauritius and in the UK found that 42 pink pigeons, Nesoenas mayeri, were successfully bred in captivity.

Supporting Evidence:
A review of a captive-breeding programme on Mauritius (Jones et al. 1992) found that at least 40 pink pigeons, Nesoenas mayeri (formerly Columba mayeri), were successfully bred in captivity, fostered under African collared doves, Streptopelia roseogrisea, (formerly S. risoria) and released. A further two birds were raised at the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust (Jersey, UK) and released. This study is also discussed in ‘Provide supplementary food to increase adult survival’, ‘Release captive bred individuals’, ‘Provide supplementary food after release’ and ‘Predator control on islands’.
