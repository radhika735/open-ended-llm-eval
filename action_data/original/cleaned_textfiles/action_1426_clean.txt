1426: Use fences as biological corridors for primates 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Fences (also called ‘fence rows’) may be used by primates as travel pathways in agricultural-forest mosaics to move from one forest patch to the next. These may be ‘living fences’, which are wide fences that have natural vegetation (trees, bushes) growing around/between them, or they can be ordinary wire or wooden fences. A study found that red howler monkeys Alouatta seniculus, squirrel monkeys Saimiri spp., tufted capuchin monkeys Sapajus apella and dusky titis Callicebus moloch in gallery forest fragments in the Eastern Colombian Llanos used living fences and wire fences as corridors to travel between forest patches (Carretero Pinzón et al. 2008). However, this study reported on personal observations and did not evaluate this intervention using a robust study design and statistics and so has not been summarised as evidence below.

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of using fences as biological corridors on primate populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
