1142: Water primrose: Use of liquid nitrogen
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Liquid nitrogen may offer a potential control method for localised control of water primrose Ludwigia spp. when used in combination with other control methods.  For certain other species however, this has been found not to be feasible.  For example, a review on floating pennywort Hydrocotyle ranunculoides in the Netherlands found liquid nitrogen only killed parts of the floating pennywort plant above water, leaving the bulk of material underwater undamaged (Plant Protection Service et al. 2011).

Key Messages:

No evidence was found for use of liquid nitrogen to control water primrose.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
