1076: Brown and black bullheads: Biological control of beneficial species
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Numerous species benefit from the presence of beneficial species.  Reducing the population of co-occurring beneficial species in localised populations, and limiting their spread or intentional introduction, may therefore offer a tool for managing and reducing bullhead populations.
 

Key Messages:

No evidence was found for reducing or controlling bullhead population size by reducing the population of co-occurring beneficial species.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
