Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
In some situations, it may be necessary to remove bats from roosts in buildings where there is conflict with humans, e.g. for public health reasons. Providing training to wildlife operators on appropriate exclusion techniques may reduce harm to evicted bats. Training should be given to specific guidelines as applicable for the laws of the country and the protection status of bats.
