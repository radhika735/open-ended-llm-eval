3866: Strengthen cultural traditions such as sacred groves that prevent timber harvesting 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Forests have important cultural value in many societies around the world, which has led to many areas being protected under local tradition or law. As the surrounding forest is logged or managed, these cultural sites may become increasingly important for conservation, as they preserve intact, primary forest. However, national Governments or logging companies which do not respect local traditions may seek to exploit these sites and, if offered enough money or improvements to their livelihoods, local people may agree or be forced to accept this. Strengthening cultural traditions which protect forests, either within local communities or by lobbying national Governments, may help to prevent exploitation of these important sites.
