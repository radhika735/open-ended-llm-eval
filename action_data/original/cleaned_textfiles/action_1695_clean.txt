1695: Add manure to soil
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Adding manure to shrubland soils may help to stimulate the growth of any shrubland species that are present or encourage germination of seeds present in the soil.

Key Messages:

One replicated, randomized, controlled study in South AfricaÂ found that adding manure to the soil increased plant cover and the number of plant species.


Supporting Evidence:
A replicated, randomized, controlled study between 2007 and 2011 in a karoo shrubland in Richtersveld, South Africa (Hanke et al. 2015) found that adding manure to increase colonisation increased plant cover and the number of plant species. After three years, plant cover of areas where manure was added (7%) was higher than that in areas where manure was not added (4%). Similarly, the number of plant species in areas where manure was added (11 species) was higher than in areas where manure was not added (7 species). Five 1 ha blocks were divided using a fence to exclude cattle. In each block goat and sheep manure was spread in one 10 m x 10 m plot while another plot was left without manure addition. Vegetation in each 10 m x 10 m plot was assessed annually between 2008 and 2011.
