268: Insulate power pylons to prevent electrocution
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Another method of preventing electrocution is to insulate parts of pylons that large birds are likely to touch at the same time.
 

Key Messages:
A single before-and-after study in the USA found the insulating power pylons significantly reduced the number of Harris’s hawks Parabuteo unicinctus electrocuted.
 

Supporting Evidence:
A before-and-after study in 2003 in urban environments in Tucson, Arizona, USA (Dwyer & Mannan 2007), found that there were significantly fewer electrocutions following the insulation of potentially dangerous elements of power pylons (1.4 electrocutions/nest before insulation vs. 0.2 electrocutions/nest afterwards). Any differentially energised hardware components, closer than 60 cm apart, on half the power poles within 300 m of 58 Harris’s hawk Parabuteo unicinctus nests were insulated.
