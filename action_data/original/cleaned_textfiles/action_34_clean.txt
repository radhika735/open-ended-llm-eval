34: Legally protect large native trees
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:


Key Messages:
A study in degraded savannah in Minas Gerais, Brazil showed that the stingless bee species Melipona quadrifasciata selectively nested in the protected cerrado tree Caryocar brasiliense, evidence that protecting this species from logging or wood harvesting has helped to conserve stingless bees.
Â 

Supporting Evidence:
The cerrado tree Caryocar brasiliense is the only tree species protected by federal regulations in Brazil. A detailed study of nest sites used by the stingless bee species Melipona quadrifasciata in 18 km2 of degraded cerrado (72 plots, each 500 m2) in Minas Gerais, Brazil, found that they almost exclusively nested in C. brasiliense (Antonini & Martins 2003). Forty-six out of 48 nests were found in that species, although there were 55 tree species at the site. The authors argue that M. quadrifasciata is only found in the area because of the protection of C. brasiliense.
