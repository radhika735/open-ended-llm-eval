2001: Exclude domestic and feral cats from bat roosts and roost entrances
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Cats can injure or kill bats and have been reported to wait at roost entrances for bats to emerge (e.g. Scrimgeour et al. 2012, Ancillotto et al. 2013). Excluding both domestic and feral cats from bat roosts and roost entrances may reduce bat mortality. For other interventions relating to cat predation, see ‘Keep domestic cats indoors at night’ and ‘Use collar-mounted devices on cats to reduce predation of bats’.
