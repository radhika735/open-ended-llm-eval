3503: Use road closures
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Reptiles are vulnerable to road mortality, particularly during the breeding season when activity levels increase and roads may bisect nesting habitat. In some areas, roads may be closed to protect hotspots for reptile movements.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of using road closures on reptile populations. This study was in Canada.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)

Use (1 study): One replicated study in Canada found that closed roads were not used more by Blanding’s turtles than unclosed roads.


Supporting Evidence:
A replicated study in 2010 in wetlands and forests bisected by roads along the Ottawa River in southern Québec, Canada (Proulx et al. 2014) found that closed roads were not used more by Blanding's turtles Emydoidea blandingii compared to roads open to vehicle traffic. Blanding’s turtles showed similar levels of use of roads closed (0.9 crossings/individual) and open to vehicle traffic (1.1 crossings/individual). Twenty-four of 52 turtles crossed roads. Fifty-two Blanding's turtles (22 females, 24 males, 6 juveniles) were captured by hand or using hoop nets and a radio transmitter was attached to their shell. All turtles were tracked every 2–4 days from May to August 2010.
