2278: Cease or prohibit the harvest of conch
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Conch populations have significantly declined due to overharvest, for commercial and recreational purposes (Theile 2001). Bylaws, legislation, or voluntary agreements could be established which prohibit the harvest of conch in an area, in order to reduce the pressure on conch populations and in theory allow the population to recovery naturally.
When this intervention occurs in a marine protected area, the evidence is summarised under “Habitat protection – Designate a Marine Protected Area and prohibit harvest of conch”.
