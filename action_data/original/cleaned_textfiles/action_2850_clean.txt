2850: Maintain water level and flow along regulated rivers
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves maintaining water levels and flow along regulated rivers to ensure that freshwater mammal habitats, such as deep pools, are conserved and remain accessible. This may involve identifying minimum flow thresholds.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of maintaining water level and flow along regulated rivers on marine and freshwater mammal populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
