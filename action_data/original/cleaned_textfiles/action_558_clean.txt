558: Provide supplementary water to increase survival or reproductive success
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
In arid environments water supply may be as much of limiting factor as food supply and providing drinking water may increase survival, particularly of chicks.
 

Key Messages:
A controlled study in Morocco found that water supplemented northern bald ibis Geronticus eremite pairs had significantly higher reproductive success than those far from water sources.
 

Supporting Evidence:
A controlled, multi-year study between 1998 and 2002 in coastal semi-desert steppe in southern Morocco (Smith et al. 2008) found that northern bald ibis Geronticus eremite pairs nesting less than 1 km from supplementary water points had significantly higher reproductive success than pairs nesting more than 5 km from water points (all nests: 1.0-2.2 fledglings/nest for nests close to water vs. 0.37-1.6 fledglings/nest for distant nests; only successful nests: 1.3-2.4 fledglings/nest vs. 1.0-2.3 fledglings/nest). There were no differences in clutch size between treatments, so the authors suggest that differences in productivity were due to failure rates, with 11% of 105 nests close to water failing, compared to 38% of 74 nests far from water. The increase was greatest in years of low natural rainfall but apparent in all years.
