1427: Provide sacrificial rows of crops on outer side of fields 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Farmers may decide to sacrifice crop rows located on the outer side of fields to crop-raiding primates. This assumes that crop raiding individuals feed only at the periphery of the field.

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of providing sacrificial rows of crops on the outer side of fields on primate populations.
