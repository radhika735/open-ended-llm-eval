1131: Floating pennywort: Flame treatment
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Flame treatment may provide an effective treatment for controlling floating pennywort Hydrocotyle ranunculoides, especially when growing on soil, and particularly when used in early spring when the plants emerge from the embankments or as an after treatment after rigorous removal has taken place.
 

Key Messages:

A controlled, replicated, pilot experiment in 2010 in The Netherlands, found that flame treatments of 1, 2 or 3 seconds had a significantly negative and progressive impact on floating pennywort, and a 3 second repeat treatment after 11 days proved fatal.


Supporting Evidence:
A controlled, replicated, pilot experiment in 2010 in greenhouses in The Netherlands (Joost van der Burg & Michielsen 2010) found that flame treatments of 1, 2 or 3 seconds had a significantly negative and progressive impact on floating pennywort Hydrocotyle ranunculoides.  Repeat treatment six hours after the first had no marked effect on the eventual recovery of the plants, but a three second repeat treatment after 11 days proved fatal.  The plants were collected from the wild in Laarne, Belgium in early spring 2010 and raised in containers in the greenhouse. Photographs were taken of all treatments and estimates were made of pot surface coverage by green leaves.
