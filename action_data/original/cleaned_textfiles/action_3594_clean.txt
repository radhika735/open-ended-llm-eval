3594: Remove coal combustion waste to reduce contamination of terrestrial and aquatic habitats
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Fly-ash (flue ash, pulverised fuel ash) is a by-product of coal combustion and is often stored on or near coal fired power stations either in water impoundments (ponds) or underground in landfill. Fly-ash contains a number of metals and other trace elements and is known to contaminate groundwater. Metals and trace elements from fly-ash may be accumulated in the bodies of a range of reptile species with potentially harmful effects (Rowe et al. 2002). Removing the waste from coal combustion may help to reduce the exposure of reptiles to these harmful pollutants.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on reptile populations of removing coal combustion waste to reduce contamination of terrestrial and aquatic habitats.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
