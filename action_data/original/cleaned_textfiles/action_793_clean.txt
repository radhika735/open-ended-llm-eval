793: Use amphibians sustainably
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Many amphibian species have become popular among collectors in the pet trade. Others are used for food, in traditional medicines or harvested for products such as skin toxins. This means that animals are removed from the wild, which can have significant effects on populations. To avoid overexploitation and the decline of populations, amphibians must be used sustainably.
 

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of using amphibians sustainably.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
