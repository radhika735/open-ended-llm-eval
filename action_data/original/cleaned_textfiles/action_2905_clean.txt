2905: Limit, cease or prohibit the discharge of cooling effluents from power stations
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
The cooling water effluents of power stations may be released from power plants back into rivers, lakes, or the ocean. The discharge of warm water, often containing chemicals, can damage marine and freshwater mammal habitats and contribute to harmful algal blooms (Barnett 1972). Limiting, ceasing or prohibiting the discharge of cooling effluents from power stations may reduce these effects.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of limiting, ceasing or prohibiting the discharge of cooling effluents from power stations on marine and freshwater mammal populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
