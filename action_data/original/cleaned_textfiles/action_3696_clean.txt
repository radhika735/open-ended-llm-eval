3696: Remove or control non-native reptile competitors
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Non-native species are a threat to native fauna worldwide, and there is growing recognition of the negative impacts that non-native reptiles have on native species and communities (Kraus 2015). Control of non-native species can be expensive and benefits may be difficult to maintain, though actions aimed at reducing their populations may be carried out on an ongoing basis for the benefit of native reptiles.
