406: Use snakeskin to deter mammalian nest predators
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Some bird species such as great crested flycatchers Myiarchus crinitus and tufted titmice Baeolophus bicolor use snake skins in their nests, possibly to reduce predation.
 

Key Messages:
A randomised, replicated and controlled trial in the USA found that artificial nests were less likely to be predated if they had snake skin wrapped around them than control nests.
 

Supporting Evidence:
A randomised, replicated and controlled trial in May-June 2004 in Arkansas, USA (Medlin & Risch 2006) found that artificial great crested flycatcher Myiarchus crinitus nests placed inside 60 nest boxes were less likely to be predated if there was black rat snake Elaphe obsolete skin inside the nest box (0/20 nests predated) or both inside and outside the nest box (0/20 predated) than if there was no snake skin present (5/20 predated). Predation was mainly by southern flying squirrels Glaucomys volans. Snake skins were treated by being placed in proximity with to a live rat snake for five hours prior to installation.
