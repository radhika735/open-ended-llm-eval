305: Mark trawler warp cables to reduce seabird collisions
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:


Key Messages:
A replicated, controlled study in Argentina found that seabird mortality from collisions with trawler warp cables was much lower when the cables were marked.
 

Supporting Evidence:
A replicated and controlled study in Golfo San Jorge, Argentina between December 2004 and April 2005 (González-Zevallos et al. 2007) found that there were significantly fewer seabird collisions with warp cables during net-hauling activities (and cable-related mortality was nil) when an orange-coloured plastic traffic cone was attached to each cable (average of 5.4 contacts/haul and no mortalities in 12 hauls) compared with when cones were not used (average of 58.5 contacts/haul and a total of 11 mortalities in ten hauls). Trials were on three commercial trawlers using cones 1 m long and 20-10 cm in diameter. Mortalities were eight kelp gulls Larus dominicanus and three black-browed albatross Thalassarche melanophrys.
