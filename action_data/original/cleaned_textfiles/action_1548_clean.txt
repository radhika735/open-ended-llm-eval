1548: Wear gloves when handling primate food, tool items, etc. 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This intervention aims to prevent the spread of viral and bacterial diseases from humans to primates and can be implemented in situations where humans regularly come into close contact with primate food, tools and other items that may be handled by both humans and primates. For example, researchers and tourist guides may handle such items to collect information on primate behaviour, presence and spatial distribution.
            Other means of preventing the spread of bacterial and viral diseases from researchers/tourists/managers to primates are discussed under ‘Wear face-masks to avoid transmission of viral and bacterial diseases to primates’, ‘Keep safety distance to habituated animals’, ‘Limit time that researchers/tourists are allowed to spend with habituated animals’, ‘Implement quarantine for people arriving at, and leaving the site’, ‘Ensure that researchers/tourists are up-to-date with vaccinations and healthy’, and ‘Regularly disinfect clothes, boots etc.’.

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of wearing gloves when handling primate food, tool items, etc. on primate populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
