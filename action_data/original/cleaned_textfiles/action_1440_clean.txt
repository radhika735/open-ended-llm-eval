1440: Plant crops favoured by primates away from primate areas
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
The idea behind this intervention is that crop damage by primates may be prevented if crops that are favoured by particular species are planted out of its reach, i.e. outside of its home range.

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of planting crops favoured by primates away from primate areas on populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
