1709: Parrot’s feather: Multiple integrated measures
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Due to the complexity of controlling parrot’s feather, multiple integrated measures may be needed for the complete removal of the species from one site. These could include a combination of mechanical and physical control techniques, biological control techniques and/or chemical control techniques. For example, suction dredging and hand-weeding could be used in combination for the removal of submerged invasive aquatic plants, or herbicide could be applied prior to grass carp stocking for faster control and a reduction of management costs (De Winton et al. 2013).

Key Messages:

We found no evidence on the use of multiple integrated measures to control parrot’s feather.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
