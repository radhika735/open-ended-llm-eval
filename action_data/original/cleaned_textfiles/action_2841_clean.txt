2841: Introduce permits or licences for recreational watersports 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Introducing permits or licences for recreational watersports (e.g. boating, kayaking, jet-skiing, diving, snorkelling, recreational fishing etc.) may reduce disturbance to marine and freshwater mammals. This may involve limiting the number and/or type of activities that are permitted to take place in an area. Conditions of permits/licences may also require that individuals follow specific guidelines while carrying out watersports (e.g. minimum approach distances, speed limits etc.), and report marine mammal encounters.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of introducing permits or licences for recreational watersports on marine and freshwater mammal populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
