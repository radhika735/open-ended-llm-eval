1147: Water primrose: Environmental control (e.g shading, altered flow, altered rooting depth, or dredging)
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Environmental control which includes alterations to shade, water flow speed, rooting depth, and dredging, may provide useful tools for control of water primrose Ludwigia spp., particularly in combination with other treatments.
Promotion of competitive, perennial, native plants can also help reclaim water primrose infested habitats.  For example, during attempts from 1996-2001 to control Peruvian primrose-willow Ludwigia peruviana in the Botany Wetlands, Australia, it was found that once the original Peruvian primrose-willow infestations were controlled, facilitation of competitive plants, and mulching with leaf and bark mulch, drastically reduced Peruvian primrose-willow recolonization (Chandrasena et al. 2002).

Key Messages:

No evidence was captured on the use of environmental control of water primrose using shading, altered flow, altered rooting depth, or dredging.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
