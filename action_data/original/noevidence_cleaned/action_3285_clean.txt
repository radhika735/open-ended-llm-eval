3285: Reprofile/relandscape (before planting)
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This action involves large-scale reprofiling or landscaping of sites that are later planted with marsh or swamp vegetation. This includes excavating large basins (&gt;8 ha or 300 m diameter), moving soil/sediment from the site into levees/berms/impoundments, removing unnatural hills or levees, filling in deep depressions, and altering the elevation/slope of coastal areas. Generally, these interventions aim to restore wetland hydrology (how wet the soil is and when it is wet/flooded) by adjusting the ground surface relative to the water table or sea.
Caution: Landscaping often relies on heavy machinery, which can damage any existing vegetation, and churn or compress wetland soils (Campbell et al. 2002).
Related actions: Reprofile/relandscape, other than to complement planting; Raise water level before/after planting; Facilitate tidal exchange before/after planting; Create mounds or hollows before planting; Remove surface soil/sediment before planting.

Key Messages:
We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of reprofiling/relandscaping before planting emergent marsh/swamp plants.
 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
