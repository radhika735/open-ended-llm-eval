1437: Use of natural hedges to deter primates
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Certain plants can make effective mechanical barriers due to their thorns, spines, or teeth-like leaf edges, as well as because of their bulk and density. Therefore, natural hedges can be used to keep primates out of farmland areas.

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of using natural hedges to prevent primates from entering agricultural areas and raiding crops on primate populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
