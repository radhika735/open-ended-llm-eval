2162: Prevent the attachment of biofouling organisms/species in aquaculture
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
While aquaculture facilities can be partly located on land (hatcheries), most of it occurs at sea, in cages, pens, bags, or ropes exposed to the marine environment. They represent hard structures onto which organisms can attach and grow – those organisms are known as the biofouling community. Non-native, invasive and other problematic species can be part of this biofouling community (Fitridge et al. 2012) and use aquaculture structures as “stepping stones” to spread and reach new areas to colonize (Ruiz et al. 1997). They can impact on native subtidal benthic invertebrate species through predation, competition for resources (food & space), contamination (for pathogens and diseases), or hybridization (through reproduction) (Bishop et al. 2010). Preventing the attachment of biofouling organisms can potentially help reduce the risks that invasive, non-native and other problematic biofouling species pose to subtidal benthic invertebrates. Non-fouling material, anti-fouling paints or coatings can be used for aquaculture infrastructures to prevent attachment (Fitridge et al. 2012).
Evidence for other interventions related to biofouling are summarised under “Threat: Invasive and other problematic species, genes and diseases – Remove biofouling organisms/species in aquaculture”, “Clean anthropogenic platforms, structures or equipment”, “Use antifouling coatings on the surfaces of vessels and anthropogenic structures”, “Use non-toxic antifouling coatings on surfaces” and “Restrict the use of tributyltin or other toxic antifouling coatings”.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of preventing the attachment of biofouling organisms/species in aquaculture on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.

 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
