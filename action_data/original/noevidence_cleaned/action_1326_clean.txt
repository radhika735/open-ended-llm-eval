1326: Primates: Add gum solutions to drilled hollow feeders
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Some small primates, such as marmosets, eat gum in the wild by gouging  in tree branches and eat the gum that accumulates. In captivity we can provide artificial gum in hollow feeders or painted on rough bark., The aim is to encourage foraging behaviour and promote feeding behaviours seen in the wild.
 

Key Messages:

No evidence was captured for the effects of adding gum solutions to drilled hollow feeders for primates.
