3818: Purchase fishing permits from fishers to limit vessel or fisher numbers
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Commercial fishing can lead to unsustainable depletion of fish populations through removal of fish and mortality of discards. In areas or fisheries where permits or licences are required to fish, “buy-back” schemes that purchase the permits/licences from fishers may remove excess capacity (vessels and/or fishers) and reduce fishing effort, thereby potentially reducing unwanted catch and the overall threat to fish from overfishing.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of purchasing fishing permits from fishers to limit vessel or fisher numbers on marine fish populations.

 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
