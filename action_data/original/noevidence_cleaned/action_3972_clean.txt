3972: Maintain or restore native wood pasture and parkland
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Wood pasture, where livestock are grazed at a low intensity under widely spaced mature trees, can support a diverse community of invertebrates, including butterflies and moths (Runquist 2011). For example, 12% of all British butterfly and moth species were recorded in a single summer in three small, traditionally managed orchards grazed by cattle (Smart & Winnall 2006). However, traditional wood pastures have been lost due to conversion into more intensive forms of agriculture or pasture, or abandonment. Restoring management may therefore benefit a wide range of butterflies and moths.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of maintaining or restoring native wood pasture and parkland on butterflies and moths.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
