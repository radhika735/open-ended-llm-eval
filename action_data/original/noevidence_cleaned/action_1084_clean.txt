1084: Brown and black bullheads: Changing salinity
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Changing the salinity of an invaded waterbody may offer a tool for localised eradication or population reduction of bullheads, provided potentially negative effects on native species are managed carefully.
 

Key Messages:

No evidence was captured on the impact of changing salinity on bullhead populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
