2083: Use a different technique when laying and burying cables and pipelines
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Communication and power cables, and oil and gas pipelines, can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through physical damage and habitat loss. The burial process could be planned ahead of installation with the aim of reducing physical impacts on the seabed and on subtidal benthic invertebrates. For instance, using ploughing techniques rather than water-jetted trenching or directional drilling can be less disruptive to subtidal benthic invertebrates and promote recovery following disturbance (Kraus & Carter 2018).

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of using a different technique when laying and burying cables and pipelines on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.

 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
