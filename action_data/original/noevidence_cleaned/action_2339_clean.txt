2339: Use voluntary agreements with locals to reduce disturbance
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Human access can be a major cause of disturbance to wild mammals. In some cases, disturbance can be reduced by restricting access using regulations or laws. In other instances, local communities may have long-standing access rights or traditions and voluntary agreements drawn up in consultation with such stakeholders may be attempted.
