1952: Prevent culling of bats around fruit orchards
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Bats are frequently shot, persecuted, and even legally culled around fruit orchards to prevent damage to or loss of fruit crops. This is likely to have a significant impact on the survival of fruit bat populations. For example, the Mauritius fruit bat Pteropus niger has undergone an estimated population decline of 50% since government-implemented culling took place in 2015 and 2016 (Vincenot et al. 2017).
