1170: Create managed paths/signs to contain disturbance
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
People can be directed away from vulnerable areas in forests by creating managed routes and placing signs to direct or prohibit access for example.  Studies looking at controlling access are also discussed in 'Re-route paths, control access and close paths'.
 

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of creating managed paths/signs to contain disturbance on forests.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
