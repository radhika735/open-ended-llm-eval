440: Guard nests to reduce risk of ectoparasites
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
If populations are reduced to extremely low levels and are threatened by parasitism, then extremely intensive monitoring can be used to ‘guard nests’ and remove parasites if they increase to damaging levels. Due to the intensive nature of this work it is only likely to be viable if there are volunteers to do it, and the population being monitored is very small. Nest guarding is also used as a response to several other threats, such as predation and poaching and is therefore discussed in ‘General responses to small/declining populations’.
 

Key Messages:

We found no evidence on the effects of guarding nests to reduce the risk of ectoparasites

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
