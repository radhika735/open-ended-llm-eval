1587: Parrot’s feather: Dye application
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Dye treatments work by absorbing light that penetrates through water, and reducing the photosynthetic capacity of submerged plants (Hussner et al. 2017). However, undesirable side effects have been reported for some Myriophyllum species following the use of dyes to control problematic epiphytes, leading to healthier and bigger Myriophyllum plants (Hussner et al. 2017). For studies covering the use of lightproof barriers to inhibit growth see ‘Use of lightproof barriers’.

Key Messages:

We found no evidence on the use of dye treatments to control parrot’s feather.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
