1159: Plant a mixture of tree species to enhance the survival and growth of planted trees
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Competition within species is generally stronger than competition between species (Connel 1983). Therefore, planting multiple tree species together may reduce the competition between planted seedlings and increase overall seedling survival.

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effect of planting a mixture of tree species to enhance the survival and growth of planted trees.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
