2636: Install barrier fencing along waterways
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Mammals may be attracted to canals and other waterways for drinking. When such waterways have steep sides, mammals may fall in and be unable to escape. Waterways may also act as barriers to animal movements and mammals may attempt to cross them but be unable to exit the water. In such cases, mammals may be at risk of drowning (e.g. Peris & Morales 2004). At areas of high risk, barrier fencing could be installed in order to prevent mammals accessing waterways and so reduce the drowning risk.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on mammals of installing barrier fencing along waterways.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
