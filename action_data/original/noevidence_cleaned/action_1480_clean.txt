1480: Inform hunters of the dangers (e.g., disease transmission) of wild primate meat 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
For this intervention, hunters are informed about the health risks associated with handling wild primate meat. Although the study did not link bushmeat consumption to primate offtake rates by hunters, Ordaz-Németh et al. (2017) found that Liberian households informed about the health risks of preparing/consuming bushmeat, decreased their bushmeat consumption significantly more during the Ebola crisis (compared to before the crisis) than households that were not informed about these risks.

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of informing hunters of the dangers of wild primate meat on primate populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
