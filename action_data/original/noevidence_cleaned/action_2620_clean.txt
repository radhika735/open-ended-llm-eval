2620: Use wildlife decoy to reduce vehicle collisions with mammals
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Animal silhouettes made of wood, Styrofoam or cardboard, or models or stuffed animals, placed along the edge of roads, may remind people to slow down in certain areas where animals are commonly hit. Reduced vehicles speeds may help to reduce vehicle-wildlife collisions. One small study found that a stuffed deer did reduce vehicle speeds (Reed & Woodard 1981) but did not assess whether or not this resulted in fewer collisions between vehicles and animals.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of using wildlife decoys to reduce vehicle collisions with mammals.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
