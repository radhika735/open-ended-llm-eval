3574: Contain or recover oil following spills
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Oil spills are an obvious threat in marine and aquatic environments because the oil spreads quickly through the water column and can contaminate beaches and other coastal habitats.  There are a number of different methods that can be used in an attempt to contain or recover the spill including: open-water mechanical recovery using booms and skimmers, offshore dispersant application using chemical dispersants, off-shore in situ burning, manual and mechanical clean-up to collect and dispose of contaminated sand or soil, and bioremediation using nutrients, aeration or bacteria to speed up natural breakdown of the oil (Huff & Shigenaka 2003). Different methods vary in number of ways, including cost, efficiency, time taken, amount of oil recovered, as well as impact on wildlife (Dave & Ghaly 2011).

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on reptile populations of containing or recovering oil following spills.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
