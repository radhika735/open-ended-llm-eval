1439: Change of crop (i.e. to a crop less palatable to primates)
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This intervention entails changing crops favoured by crop-raiding primates to those less palatable or accessible to raiders. However, switching to less susceptible subsistence crops may lead to reduced dietary diversity and food insecurity possibly affecting human communities living in/near the primate habitat (e.g. Akankwasah 2008). Additionally, changes in the range and type of food crops may reduce fertility if crops are not rotated (Mc Guinness & Taylor 2014).

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of changing the crop to a less palatable crop on primate populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
