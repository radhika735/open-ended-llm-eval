3540: Enforce regulations to prevent trafficking and trade of reptiles
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Some reptile species threatened by trade are protected under the CITES agreement (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora), which aims to regulate the international trade of endangered species. However, it is the responsibility of each participating country to adopt its own national legislation to ensure the regulations are implemented, and in some countries illegal trade continues. Alongside enforcement by exporting countries, importing countries may have an important role to play in developing solutions to mitigate the threat of trafficking and trade in reptiles.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on reptile populations of enforcing regulations to prevent trafficking and trade of reptiles.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
