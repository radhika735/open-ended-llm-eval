2798: Retain buoys and lines at the sea floor or river bed when not hauling
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Retaining buoys and lines at the sea floor or river bed when not hauling may reduce the risk of marine and freshwater mammals becoming entangled in vertical lines within the water column. Buoy lines may be kept coiled on the fishing pot or trap until they are remotely released to the surface by fishers for hauling (e.g. Partan & Ball 2016). Automatic or timed-release systems may also be used.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of retaining buoys and lines at the sea floor or river bed when not hauling on marine and freshwater mammal populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
