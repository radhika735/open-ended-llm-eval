Background information and definitions:
Untreated sewage reaching aquatic environments may impact marine and freshwater mammals through the introduction of bacteria and viruses, excess nutrients, toxic substances, and solid particles. Limiting, ceasing or prohibiting the dumping of untreated sewage in an area may reduce the risk of contaminating marine and freshwater mammals and their habitats.
