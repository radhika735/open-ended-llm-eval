Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Billboards may be an effective medium to inform and raise awareness about primates, their habitat, threats to their survival and conservation strategies to a potentially large number of people, as billboards are easily visible and repeatedly read by people travelling on roads in urban areas.

We found no evidence for the effects of installing billboards to raise primate conservation awareness on primate populations.
