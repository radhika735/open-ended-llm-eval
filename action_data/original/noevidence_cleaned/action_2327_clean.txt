2327: Set minimum distances for approaching mammals
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
At some sites, such as at national parks where safaris are a popular means of visitors observing animals, large numbers of people or vehicles closely approaching mammals may cause them disturbance or cause changes in their behaviour. This may restrict areas that these animals use or affect hunting or feeding opportunities. Limits, including through voluntary guidelines, exist in some areas on the minimum distance to which people or vessels may approach sea mammals (e.g. Inman et al. 2016). Similar regulation or guidelines may also lessen such potential impacts for mammals.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on mammals of setting a minimum permitted distance to which they can be approached.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
