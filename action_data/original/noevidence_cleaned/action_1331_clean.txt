1331: Primates: Provide nectar (including artificial nectar) 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Nectar forms a significant component of the wild diets of many species of primate (Sussman 1978, Cabana et al. 2014). In captivity providing nectar offers primates the opportunity to manipulate their food with their feed and hands to extract the nectar, expecially if given in line with an enrichment device.

Key Messages:

No evidence was captured for the effects of providing nectar (including artificial nectar) to primates.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
