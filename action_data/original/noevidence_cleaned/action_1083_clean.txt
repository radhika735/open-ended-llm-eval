1083: Brown and black bullheads: UV radiation
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Applying UV radiation to an invaded waterbody may offer a tool for localised eradication or population reduction of bullheads, provided potentially negative effects on native species are carefully managed. A combined laboratory and field study in Lake Tahoe, USA indicated that UV levels in parts of the lake are intense enough to kill all larvae of largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides (Tucker et al. 2012).

Key Messages:

No evidence was captured on the impact of UV radiation on bullhead populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
