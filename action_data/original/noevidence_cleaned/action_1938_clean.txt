Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This intervention is concerned with general increases in the proportion of natural or semi-natural habitat in the landscape. For studies that may carry out this intervention alongside other interventions to benefit bats on farmland, see ‘Pay farmers to cover the costs of conservation measures (e.g. agri-environment schemes)’.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of increasing the proportion of semi-natural habitat in the farmed landscape on bat populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
