1460: Impose fines for breaking the speed limit or colliding with primates 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Speed limits in areas with high traffic and high primate densities may help prevent vehicle collisions with primates and also to reduce stress levels in primates. Furthermore, primates may be able to cross roads more easily in areas where speed limits are enforced compared to areas with no traffic regulations. To effectively enforce existing speed limits it can help if fines are imposed for breaking the speed limit and/or for colliding with primates.
            Implementing and enforcing speed limits is discussed under ‘Implement speed limits in particular areas (e.g. with high primate densities) to reduce vehicle collisions with primates’.

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of imposing fines for breaking the speed limit or colliding with primates on primate populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
