3591: Augment ponds with ground water to reduce acidification
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Disturbance of soils during land clearing or development can result in release of salts and therefore water with a low pH. This acidic water can end up in water bodies and have significant effects on aquatic biodiversity including reptiles. Adding uncontaminated ground water to ponds can help to regulate the pH of the water.
Studies that investigated regulating water levels of ponds are discussed in Threat: Natural system modifications – Regulate water levels.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on reptile populations of augmenting ponds with ground water to reduce acidification.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
