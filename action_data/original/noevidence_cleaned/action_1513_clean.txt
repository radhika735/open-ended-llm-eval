1513: Coppice trees
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Coppicing takes advantage of the fact that many trees make new growth from the stump or roots if cut down. It is a pruning technique where a tree or shrub is cut to near ground level, or higher, before bud break to encourage vigorous young shoots. In subsequent growth years, many new shoots will emerge, and, after a number of years the coppiced tree is ready to be harvested and the cycle begins again. This intervention could help to reduce the loss of mature trees, thereby reducing the negative impact of wood harvesting on the intactness of primate habitat.

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of coppicing trees on primate populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
