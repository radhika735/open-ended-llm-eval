2069: Recycle or repurpose fluids used in the drilling process
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Fluids used in the drilling process, also called “muds” are often contaminated with oil and chemical additives causing pollution in the area (Henry et al. 2017). These fluids could be reused or recycled, potentially reducing the cumulative risk to subtidal benthic invertebrates through reducing a source of pollution (Loan et al. 2018). Additional evidence related to drilling fluids are summarised under “Threat: Energy production and mining – Use water-based muds instead of oil-based muds (drilling fluids) in the drilling process”.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of recycling or repurposing fluids used in the drilling process on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.

 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
