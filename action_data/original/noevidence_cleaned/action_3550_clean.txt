3550: Limit the number of fishing vessels or fishing days in an area
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Limiting the number of fishing vessels or days in which an area can be fished may reduce the risk of entanglements and unwanted catch (‘bycatch’) of aquatic reptiles. This may involve the rotation of fishing areas. Careful planning may be required to ensure that fishing effort is not redirected to other areas with a high reptile density.
See also: Limit the length of fishing gear or density of traps in an area and Reduce duration of time fishing gear is in the water.
