2424: Provide science-based films, radio programmes, or books about mammals to improve behaviour towards mammals and reduce threats
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
There are different types of media that can be used to inform people and raise their awareness about threats to mammals and their conservation. Environmental education campaigns frequently use film, sound or print media to present either factual information or fictional stories that have parallels to environmental issues. It can be difficult to assess the impact of such initiatives, as it is harder to assess people’s subsequent behaviours than it is to measure their stated attitudes towards mammals after exposure to media.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on mammals of providing science-based films, radio programmes, or books about mammals to improve behaviour towards mammals and reduce threats.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
