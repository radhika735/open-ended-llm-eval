2871: Rehabilitate and release marine and freshwater mammals following oil spills
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Marine and freshwater mammals affected by oil spills may be rescued, rehabilitated, and released back into the wild. One study in the USA reported that a live-stranded dolphin was successfully de-oiled at a rehabilitation facility using vegetable oil and detergent and subsequently survived (Wilkin et al. 2017). However, the dolphin was considered unsuitable for release due to its young age and was kept in captivity.
