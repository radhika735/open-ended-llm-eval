3678: Provide training for local staff in species identification 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Species identification skills play an important role in recognising the conservation needs of reptile populations, as well as the threats some reptiles may pose to humans. Where staff across a range if sectors (e.g. government agencies, building and development sector, conservation organisations) have good identification skills they may be better able to respond to situations involving reptiles with appropriate and proportionate actions, with benefits for wild reptile populations.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on reptile populations of providing training for local staff in species identification.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
