2799: Use sinking lines instead of floating lines
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Using sinking or negatively buoyant lines (e.g. between pots or traps) that lie closer to the sea floor or river bed instead of floating in the water column may reduce the risk of marine and freshwater mammals becoming entangled.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of using sinking lines instead of floating lines on marine and freshwater mammal populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
