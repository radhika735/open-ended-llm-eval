1845: Raise awareness amongst the public (wild fire)
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
The public could be educated about the importance of peatlands, threats they face and what can be done to protect them. Messages could be conveyed through information boards, talks, art projects, adverts, leaflets, celebrity endorsements and social media.
This section considers education about preventing wild fire (e.g. Adinugroho et al. 2005). People are a major cause of wild fire on peatland – through arson, carelessness or losing control of prescribed burns.
Key peatland types for which this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: raise awareness through engaging volunteers in peatland management or monitoring; provide education/training programmes about peatlands.
