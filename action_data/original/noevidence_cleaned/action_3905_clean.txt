3905: Use glazing treatments to reduce light spill from inside lit buildings 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Artificial lighting disrupts the activity of nocturnal moths. For example, even when offered a food source, moths spend less time feeding in the presence of artificial light than when kept in complete darkness (van Langevelde et al. 2017). Attraction to artificial lights may also limit moths’ dispersal ability and mate-finding behaviour. Reducing the spillover of light through windows may minimize the impact of lights on moths living in urban areas (Gaston et al. 2012).

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of using glazing treatments to reduce light spill from inside lit buildings.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
