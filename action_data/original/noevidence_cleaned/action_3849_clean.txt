3849: Use signs and access restrictions to reduce disturbance 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
People can deliberately or unintentionally damage important habitats by straying from footpaths in sensitive areas, allowing animals such as dogs to roam freely, or by driving vehicles off-road. Introducing signs or imposing access restrictions may reduce unintentional, careless actions, as well as discouraging deliberate acts of vandalism by indicating that a site is being monitored.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of using signs and access restrictions to reduce disturbance.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
