Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
To reduce disturbance to bats roosting within road/railway bridges or culverts, maintenance work may be avoided at times of year when they are most vulnerable, such as during hibernation and the maternity season.

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of changing the timing of maintenance work at road/railway bridges and culverts on bat populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches.
