789: Reduce tillage
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Conventional ploughing uses a mould-board plough, cultivating to a depth of around 20 cm. A number of methods can be used to reduce the depth or intensity of ploughing, such as layered cultivation, non-inversion tillage and conservation tillage. Such have been found to be beneficial for some farmland biodiversity (Holland & Luff 2000).

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of reduced tillage on amphibian populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
