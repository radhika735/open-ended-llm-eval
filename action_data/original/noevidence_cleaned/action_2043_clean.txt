2043: Educate pest controllers and homeowners/tenants to reduce the illegal use of pesticides in bat roosts
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
In some countries, e.g. in Africa, pest controllers, homeowners and tenants have been reported to illegally kill bat colonies in buildings using pesticides. Although the pesticides themselves are not illegal, they have not been registered for use on bats and many people are unaware of this.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of educating pest controllers and homeowners/tenants to reduce the illegal use of pesticides in bat roosts on bat populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
