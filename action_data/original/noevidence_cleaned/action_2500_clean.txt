2500: Use electric fencing to deter mammals from energy installations or mines
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Mammals may cause damage to equipment if they enter energy installations or mines. There is also a direct risk to mammals from becoming trapped, falling into pits or being electrocuted. Electric fencing may be use around such sites to deter mammal entry. As well as reducing direct risks to mammals, if successful the intervention may also reduce the need to carry out lethal control of mammals on such sites.
