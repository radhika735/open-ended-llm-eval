3529: Limit vessel numbers
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Collisions with boats or their motors can kill or severely injure reptiles. Increases in watercraft activity in areas developed for human recreation have been shown to greatly increase the likelihood of major shell injuries and limb amputations in some species (e.g. Cecala et al. 2009). Limiting numbers of vessels may reduce collision rates.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of limiting vessel numbers on reptile populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
