2767: Use onboard CCTV for monitoring catches and discards
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Marine fisheries throughout the world are often highly regulated and may be subject to many different international or national laws and byelaws. Compliance with these measures is important to protect commercially targeted and non-targeted species and their habitats: non-compliance has been shown to have a negative impact on the biomass of targeted species in no-take marine reserves (Bergseth et al. 2015). One way to improve compliance may be to use onboard camera equipment such as CCTV to monitor and record catches and discarding that is subsequently analysed and enforced by management organisations ashore. This may encourage fishers to make more effort to avoid catching prohibited or undersized fish (if, for example, they are regulated) and may reduce fishing mortality (Course et al. 2011).
For a similar intervention relating to onboard monitoring of catches, see ‘Enforcement and Compliance to Reduce Illegal Fishing - Use human observers onboard fishing vessels to monitor catches and discards’.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of using onboard CCTV monitoring on marine fish populations. 

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
