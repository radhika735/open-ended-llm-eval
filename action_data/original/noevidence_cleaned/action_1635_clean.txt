1635: Cut trees and increase livestock numbers
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Cutting trees may kill them or slow growth and combining this with an increase in grazing intensity may also reduce the spread of problematic tree species by reducing the abundance of seedlings.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of controlling tree species by cutting and increasing grazing intensity of livestock on shrublands.

'We found no studiesâ€™ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
