1498: Work inward from barriers or boundaries (e.g. river) to avoid pushing primates toward an impassable barrier or inhospitable habitat
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
The idea behind this intervention is to take into account physical barriers in the environment that may restrict primate movement, such as rivers, dense vegetation, mountains, steep valleys, roads or other human-made barriers, etc. when planning logging activities. In this context it is important that the logging company works inwards from such barriers to avoid pushing primates toward these, thereby allowing them to relocate to more suitable habitat.

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of working inward from barriers or boundaries to avoid pushing primates toward an impassable barrier or inhospitable habitat on primate populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
