59: Raise awareness amongst the general public through campaigns and public information
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:


Key Messages:

We have captured no evidence for the effects of campaigning or raising awareness about bees and their conservation.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
 
 

Supporting Evidence:
There has been a large amount of campaigning to the public and to policymakers about bee conservation in recent years, particularly in Europe and North America. It is possible that this awareness-raising has already resulted in direct benefits for bees, in the management of urban and rural landscapes. However, we have found no studies examining the effects of awareness-raising in changing the way people behave or the way land is managed.
