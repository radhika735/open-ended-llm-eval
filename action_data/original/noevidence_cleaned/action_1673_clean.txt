Background information and definitions:
Improving connectivity between shrubland areas may allow species to move between shrubland habitats as climate changes and alters the suitability of sites for shrubland species.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of improving connectivity between areas of shrubland to allow species movements in response to climate change on shrublands.
