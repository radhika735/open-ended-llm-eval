1495: Incorporate forested corridors or buffers into logged areas
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This intervention aims at reducing the impact of primate habitat fragmentation resulted from logging by incorporating forested corridors into logged areas in order to link unlogged habitat patches or by creating buffers around natural primate habitat patches that were left unlogged.
            The avoidance of critical primate habitat during logging operations is discussed under ‘Use 'set-asides' for primate protection within logging area’.

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of incorporating forested corridors or buffers into logged areas on primate populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
