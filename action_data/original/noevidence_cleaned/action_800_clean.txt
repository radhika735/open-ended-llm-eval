800: Use zooplankton to remove zoospores
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Zooplankton such as water fleas (Cladocera), copepods (Copepoda) and seed shrimps (Ostracoda) consume the aquatic zoospores of the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (e.g. Buck et al. 2011). They may therefore play a role in regulating the fungus and so could help to reduce the risk of amphibian infection in aquatic environments. Copepods have successfully been used as biological control agents in other disease systems (Marten 2000).

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of using zooplankton to remove chytrid zoospores on amphibian populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
