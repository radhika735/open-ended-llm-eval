1747: Implement ‘mosaic management’ when harvesting wild biological resources
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Mosaic management involves managing neighbouring patches of land in different ways. For example, while some patches might be fully harvested, others might not be harvested in a given year. Patches may be harvested at different times within a given year. In this way, there are always parts of the peatland with older vegetation that could assist re-vegetation of harvested patches. This system could be implemented by individual landowners and/or at a larger scale across land owned by multiple people (Dicks et al. 2013).
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related action: implement mosaic management of farmland around peatlands.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on peatland vegetation, of implementing mosaic management when harvesting wild biological resources.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
