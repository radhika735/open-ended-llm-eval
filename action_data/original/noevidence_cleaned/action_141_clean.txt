141: Support or maintain low intensity agricultural systems
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:

Low-intensity agricultural systems have consistently been shown to have higher biodiversity than more intensive systems. Supporting such systems may therefore benefit farmland wildlife.

 

Key Messages:


We have captured no evidence for the effects of supporting or maintaining low intensity agricultural systems on farmland wildlife.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
