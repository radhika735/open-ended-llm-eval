2091: Provide additional moorings to reduce anchoring
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Anchoring can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through physical damage, disturbance to and penetration in the seabed (Griffiths et al. 2017). Moorings, permanent or temporary, provide an alternative to anchoring and allow for reduced anchoring in the area. Moorings can be provided for recreational vessels, as well as commercial vessels up to specific sizes. The damaging impact to the seabed is contained within the mooring vicinity rather than at multiple anchoring sites. Evidence for other interventions related to anchoring are summarised under “Threat: Transportation and service corridors – Use moorings which reduce or avoid contact with the seabed (eco-moorings)”, “Use a different type of anchor”, and “Set limits or reduce the area where ships/boats/vessels can anchor”.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of providing additional moorings to reduce anchoring on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.

 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
