2632: Control firewood collection in remnant native forest and woodland
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Firewood is an important fuel for heating and cooking in some homes and communities. However, wood that may be collected as firewood, such as from fallen trees, may provide an important element of the habitat for some forest floor species. This is most likely to be the case in forests that have been least affected by management. Thus, collection of firewood may be controlled in remnant native forests and woodland to benefit woodland biodiversity, including mammals.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on mammals of controlling firewood collection in remnant native forest and woodland.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
