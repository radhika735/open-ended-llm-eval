2786: Introduce alternative sources of bait to replace the use of marine and freshwater mammals
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
The practice of using marine and freshwater mammals as bait is widespread and affects a range of species (Mintzer et al. 2018). Introducing alternative sources of bait (that do not negatively impact other species) may reduce hunting pressure. For example, fish scraps and oil and bovine viscera were found to be effective alternatives to dolphin products for attracting fish (Sinha 2002, Beltrão et al. 2017).

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of introducing alternative sources of bait to replace the use of marine and freshwater mammals.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
