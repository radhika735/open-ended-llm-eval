3061: Use herbicide to maintain or restore disturbance: brackish/saline swamps
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Disturbance can clear dominant plants, maintain light availability and control nutrient levels – and may maintain vegetation in a desirable and/or species-rich state (Hall et al. 2008; Middleton 2013). Therefore, conservationists sometimes want to actively restore disturbance where it has ceased, or maintain disturbance at a site where it would otherwise be lost. Applying herbicide might be one way to do this.
Bear in mind that the effects of herbicide might be highly dependent on the chemical used, how it is applied and local site conditions (e.g. nutrient availability, water levels, presence/density of wild herbivores) (Tobias et al. 2016).
Caution: In many herbicides, the active chemicals are not specific to the problematic species so can cause collateral damage to desirable species. Relying on herbicides as the only tool to manage problematic plants can lead to the development of herbicide resistance in future generations (Powles et al. 1997). Herbicides can have severe negative side effects on biodiversity, the environment and human health (Pimentel et al. 1992). Accordingly, herbicide use – particularly in or near wetlands or water bodies – is limited in many countries.
Related actions: Use herbicide to control problematic plants, whose success is not linked to a change in disturbance regime.

Key Messages:
We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of using herbicide to maintain or restore disturbance in brackish/saline swamps.
 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
