2909: Remove and clean-up shoreline waste disposal sites
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
In parts of the world, such as Antarctica, waste has been dumped in landfill sites (and onto sea ice in Antarctica) for lack of better solutions (Stark et al. 2006). Waste disposal sites can be highly contaminated and when occurring near the coastal zone or inland waterways can pollute marine and freshwater mammal habitats. Removing and cleaning up shoreline waste disposal sites would remove this source of pollution. Appropriate alternative waste disposable sites may also need to be provided to ensure that waste dumping does not reoccur.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of removing and cleaning up shoreline waste disposal sites on marine and freshwater mammal populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
