2095: Reduce ships/boats/vessels speed limits
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Vessel speed can induce waves and impact benthic invertebrates through disturbance to the seabed and changes in water flow (Gabel et al. 2012; Hammerstrom et al. 2007). Reducing vessel (recreational or commercial) speed limits in an area can potentially reduce the risk of changes in water flow or sediment transport, and benefit subtidal benthic invertebrates.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of reducing ships/boats/vessels speed limits on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.

 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
