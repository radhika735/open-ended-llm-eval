3210: Fill/block ditches
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Ditches could form as a result of erosion (e.g. heavy rainfall, repeated livestock use of set trails) or be deliberately dug to drain wetlands for agriculture, forestry or mining. It may be desirable to fill or block a ditch to allow vegetation characteristic of shallow still water to grow – as opposed to vegetation characteristic of deeper and perhaps moving water in extant ditches. Evidence summarized for this action relates to effects on vegetation within filled/blocked ditches.
Related actions: Backfill canals or trenches dug as transport or service corridors;     Raise water level to restore degraded habitats (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps);     Raise water level to restore/create habitats from other land uses (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps).

Key Messages:
We found no studies that evaluated the effects of filling/blocking ditches in marshes or swamps on vegetation within the ditches.
 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
