2459: Use scarecrows to deter crop damage by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Scarecrows are generally life-sized models of people that come in various designs, including static scarecrows and those that move, or inflate at intervals, to increase their impact. They are placed in crop fields, usually to deter visits by birds, but they could also be used to deter mammalian crop-raiders. If successful, this could reduce incentives for carrying out lethal control of such mammals.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of using scarecrows to deter crop damage by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
