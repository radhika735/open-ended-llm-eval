2771: Use methods to trace the source of catch
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Across the globe fish stocks are at risk of collapsing due to overexploitation and a factor that contributes to the problem is illegal fishing. Using methods to trace the source of catches should provide the transparency and openness required to confirm and validate legal fish catches. This may deter or prevent illegal fishing if fishers know they may be caught if they try to land illegally caught fish. One such method is DNA testing that can differentiate fish populations of the same species from where they were caught. That means telling, for instance, the difference between Atlantic cod captured legally in the Eastern Baltic and cod caught illegally in the North Sea. Or it can mean identifying prohibited or endangered species such as sharks (Feitosa et al. 2018).

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of using methods to trace the sources of catches on marine fish populations. 

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
