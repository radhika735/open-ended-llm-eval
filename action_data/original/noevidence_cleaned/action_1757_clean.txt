1757: Reduce water level of flooded peatlands
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Pools may naturally form on the surface of peatlands. However, peatland vegetation can be destroyed by deep, long-term flooding e.g. above dams constructed for electricity generation (Kelly et al. 1997) or following extreme weather events. Lowering the water level could allow the former peatland vegetation to recover.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.

(1997) Increases in fluxes of greenhouse gases and methyl mercury following flooding of an experimental reservoir. Environmental Science and Technology, 31, 1334–1344.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on peatland vegetation, of reducing the water level in unnaturally flooded peatlands.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
