3597: Enforce compliance to lighting regulations 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
While the effects of light pollution on reptiles such as sea turtles are well-studied and many countries have policies prohibiting the lighting of beaches during the sea turtle nesting season. Enforcement of regulations may be required where compliance is low. This may involve surveillance, policing, and prosecution of offenders.
