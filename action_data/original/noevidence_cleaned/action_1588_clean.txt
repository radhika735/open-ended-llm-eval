1588: Use weeding to promote regeneration of indigenous tree communities  
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
In the context of this synopsis, weeding refers to the removal of undesirable plants to promote regeneration of indigenous tree communities. A study that evaluated the effect of vine, grass, and shrub cutting over a 3-year period on regeneration of indigenous trees subsequent to the removal of plantation softwoods in Kibale National Park, Uganda, found no difference in the total number of stems in plots where competing weeds were removed and control plots. Furthermore, the number of stems that had reached a size of 1 cm diameter at breast height or higher was greater in the control plot than in the weeded plots, as was species richness (Chapman et al. 2002).

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of using weeding to promote regeneration of indigenous tree communities on primate populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
