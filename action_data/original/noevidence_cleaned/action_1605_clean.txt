1605: Parrot’s feather: Use of salt
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Salt has traditionally been used as a non-selective herbicide for controlling problematic aquatic weeds and the addition of salt has been suggested as a potential control method for parrot’s feather (Hussner et al. 2017). However, parrot’s feather appear to have some resistance to salt stress and may even colonize brackish water (Thouvenot et al, 2012).

Key Messages:

We found no evidence on the impact of using salt on the control of parrot's feather.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
