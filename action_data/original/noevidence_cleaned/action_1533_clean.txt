1533: Remove alien invasive vegetation where the latter has a clear negative effect on the primate species in question
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
The negative impact of alien invasive vegetation on resident native species, communities or ecosystems has been demonstrated by a wide range of studies (Vilà et al. 2011). This intervention involves the removal of alien invasive vegetation and could be implemented in the cases where such vegetation has a negative effect on the primate species in question. For example, alien invasive vegetation may replace native plant species that present important food sources to primates or that were used for shelter by the primate species in question. Furthermore, alien invasive vegetation may also alter fire regimes thereby representing a direct (death or injury) and indirect (habitat destruction) threat to resident primate populations (Brooks et al. 2004).

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of removing alien invasive vegetation on primate populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
