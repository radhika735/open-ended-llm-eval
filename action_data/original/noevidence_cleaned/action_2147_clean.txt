2147: Fit one or more mesh escape panels/windows on pots and traps
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Traps or pots are static gears often used to fish for crabs or lobsters. They consist of structures into which species of commercial interest enter through funnels. These funnels encourage entry but limit escape, and often catch a large amount of unwanted species (Stevens 1996). To try to minimise the amount of unwanted catch from this type of fishing, a device such as an escape zone can be fitted at the back or sides of the trap, or other types of “bycatch reducing devices” used, to increase the likelihood of unwanted species escaping. Such devices may potentially help reduce unwanted catch of subtidal benthic invertebrate species and benefit their populations. Evidence related to the use of other “bycatch reduction devices” on pots and traps are summarised under “Threat: Biological resource use – Fit one or more soft, semi-rigid, or rigid grids or frames on pots and traps”.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of fitting one or more mesh escape panels/windows on pots and traps on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.

 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
