3833: Retain buffer zones around core habitat 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
The edges of habitat patches, where they meet heavily modified landscapes such as agricultural fields or urban areas, often suffer from a number of “edge effects”. This can include an increase in exposure to pollution, such as noise, light or chemicals, produced and released from human landscapes, or changes to natural rhythms, such as higher or more variable temperatures, which are a result of the more open structure of human landscapes. Retaining buffer zones around core habitat, even if the buffers themselves are of lower quality habitat, may reduce the impact of edge effects on butterfly and moth populations.
For studies testing actions to tackle pollution directly, see “Threat - Pollution”.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of retaining buffer zones around core habitat.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
