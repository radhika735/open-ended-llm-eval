2779: Introduce and enforce regulations to prevent the use of harmful deterrents on mammals at wild fisheries
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Marine and freshwater mammals may be harassed or subjected to harmful deterrents at wild fisheries in attempts to reduce mammal predation on fish catches and damage to gear. This may include using firecrackers and rifle shots, flashlights, banging steel poles or oars together, and chasing mammals with boats (e.g. Shaughnessy et al. 1981, Sepulveda et al. 2018). Regulations may be introduced and enforced to prevent the use of such measures.
For a similar intervention, see Introduce and enforce regulations to prevent the use of harmful deterrents on mammals at aquaculture systems.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of introducing and enforcing regulations to prevent the use of harmful deterrents on mammals at wild fisheries.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
