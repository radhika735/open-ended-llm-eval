3807: Limit the number of traps or pots per vessel
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Traps and pots are used to commercially harvest fish or marine invertebrates such as crabs and lobsters. They are passive gears usually consisting of rectangular or circular frames of wicker or metal, covered with polypropylene or mono-metal netting. These are baited, and have shaped access funnels in the side or top to allow entry and then retention of feeding fish or invertebrates. Traps and pots can be set in multiple ‘strings’ or lines, with anywhere between a few and 500 in number set on a single line depending on the fishery. Traps and pots have the potential to capture varying volumes of unwanted fish, so limiting the number that can be fished by a vessel may reduce fishing effort in an area and/or season and thus reduce the amount of unwanted fish catch.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of limiting the number of traps or pots per vessel on marine fish populations.

 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
