3194: Deposit soil/sediment and introduce vegetation: freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This section considers studies that examine the combined effects of (a) large-scale deposition of soil or sediment (e.g. waste material from dredging) to form the physical structure of a marsh or swamp and (b) introducing marsh vegetation in any form, such as planting individual plants or sowing seeds. Introducing vegetation may help to stabilize the deposited sediment whilst natural colonization occurs.
Related actions: Deposit soil/sediment to form physical habitat structure, without introducing vegetation.

Key Messages:
We found no studies that evaluated the combined effects, on vegetation, of depositing soil/sediment to form the physical structure of freshwater marshes and introducing vegetation.
 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
