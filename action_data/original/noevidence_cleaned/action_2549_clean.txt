2549: Replant vegetation
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Planting vegetation can help to relatively rapidly re-establish habitats after human disturbance. As a result, this replanting may help to increase mammal species richness and abundance.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on mammals of replanting vegetation.

'We found no studies' means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
