1969: Minimize road lighting to reduce insect attraction
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Insect-eating bats may be attracted to lighting along roads to feed on insects, bringing them into contact with traffic and increasing the risk of collisions. Minimizing road lighting may reduce insect densities and bat foraging activity in proximity to roads.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of minimizing road lighting to reduce insect attraction on bat populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
