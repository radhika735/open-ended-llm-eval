1775: Use covers/barriers to control problematic plants
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Covers such as plastic sheeting or straw mulch could be used to control problematic plants. These may act as direct physical barriers (e.g. temporarily covering the peatland surface, to prevent seeds from establishing whilst they are viable) and/or indirect barriers that modify environmental conditions (e.g. opaque covers that block light, prevent photosynthesis and kill problematic plants). Caution: Covers may also kill desirable species. Temporary application, when the peatland is most vulnerable to invasion by problematic plants, could solve this problem.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on peatland vegetation, of using covers or barriers to control problematic plants.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
