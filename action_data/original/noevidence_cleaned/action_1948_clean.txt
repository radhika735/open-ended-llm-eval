1948: Avoid the use of antiparasitic drugs for livestock
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
In some countries, livestock are treated with antiparasitic drugs to control parasites. These drugs may persist in livestock dung and have a negative impact on dung-eating invertebrates, which are an important food source for some insect-eating bat species (e.g. see EUROBATS 2010). This action is often carried out as part of an organic farming approach. See ‘Use organic farming instead of conventional farming’ for studies that examine the effects of organic farming overall.
EUROBATS (2010) Report of the Intersessional Working Group on impact on bat populations of the use of antiparasitic drugs for livestock. Doc. EUROBATS.StC4-AC15.29. Rev1.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of avoiding the use of antiparasitic drugs for livestock on bat populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
