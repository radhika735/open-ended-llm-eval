3822: Prohibit the catching and/or landing of specific fish species
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Fishing activity contributes to the threat to uncommon or declining fish species, along with habitat loss, pollution and diseases. Some species are listed as endangered and are highly vulnerable to even small amounts of fishing mortality. Making certain fish illegal to catch and/or land may help sustain the population of a species or group of species by limiting mortality. It may also provide an incentive for fishers to avoid fishing in certain areas, with particular gears or at specific times, resulting in reduced effort and impacts to fish habitats. Prohibiting the landing of species may occur in jurisdictions adjacent to those without similar restrictions to protect conservation measures in place (Kabula 2000).
