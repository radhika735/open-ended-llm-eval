2031: Retain connectivity between habitat patches
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Habitat destruction and fragmentation are important factors in the decline of bat populations. Retaining linear habitat features and corridors of native vegetation between suitable habitat patches may help to maintain bat populations (e.g. Frey-Ehrenbold et al. 2013, Heim et al. 2015).
To be included as evidence for this intervention, studies must have monitored a comparison, i.e. compared areas where connectivity between habitat patches has been kept intact with similar/nearby areas where connectivity has been removed or otherwise degraded. There must have been an active decision (i.e. intervention) to retain the connecting features and the study must state when the intervention was carried out.
For similar interventions, see ‘Retain existing bat commuting routes’ and ‘Restore or create linear habitat features/green corridors’.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of retaining connectivity between habitat patches on bat populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
