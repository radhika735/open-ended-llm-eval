462: Provide unfertilised cereal headlands in arable fields
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Unfertilised cereal headlands are designed to provide food for birds during the cropping year and consist of a 6–24 m headland which (under UK Entry-Level Stewardship requirements) cannot be sprayed with insecticides between 15th March and harvest, and which can only have limited herbicide application.
 

Key Messages:

We found no evidence describing the effects of unfertilised cereal headlands on bird populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
