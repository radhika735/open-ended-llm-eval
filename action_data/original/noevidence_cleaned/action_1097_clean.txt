1097: Ponto-Caspian gammarids: Exchanging ballast water
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Many freshwater invaders can be transported across oceans within the ballast water of ships. By exchanging ballast water collected at one freshwater port with salty ocean water during the journey, the chance of transporting live organisms to other freshwater ports is reduced. A study on the Laurentian Great Lakes  has identified that possible non-compliance with a ballast exchange law prior to entering the lakes has facilitated repeated introductions of invasive shrimps (Hänfling et al. 2011).

Key Messages:

No evidence was captured for exchanging ballast water to control Ponto-Caspian gammarids.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
