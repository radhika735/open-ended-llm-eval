1988: Encourage natural regeneration in former plantations
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Encouraging logged plantations to naturally regenerate may provide habitat for bats. Regenerating secondary forests has been found to provide important habitats for some bat species in fragmented landscapes, although it may take many years for bat assemblages to recover to levels found in undisturbed forest (e.g. Farneda et al. 2018, Rocha et al. 2018).

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of encouraging natural regeneration in former plantations on bat populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
