286: Use larger hooks to reduce seabird bycatch
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Large hooks may be more difficult for birds to swallow and so may reduce bycatch rates. A correlative study found a negative relationship between hook size and bycatch rate (Moreno et al. 1996).  However, large hooks may be more likely to hook birds through the body or wings (‘foul hooking’).

Key Messages:

We captured no intervention-based evidence on the impact of large hooks on seabird bycatch.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action
