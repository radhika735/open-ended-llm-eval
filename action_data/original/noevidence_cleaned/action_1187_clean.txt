1187: Introduce beavers to impede water flow in forest watercourses
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
By constructing dams, beavers can obstruct water flow and can increase the water level. This may alter the species composition of forests in favour of species that can cope with high water levels.
 

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of introducing beavers to impede water flow in forest watercourses on forests.
