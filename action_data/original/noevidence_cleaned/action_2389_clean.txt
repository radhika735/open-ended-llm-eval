2389: Provide refuges during crop harvesting or mowing
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
During crop harvesting and mowing operations, mammals may move into adjacent areas of long grass or crops. If mowing/harvesting occurs from the outside of the field inwards, this behaviour can leave them trapped in the centre of the field and killed as the last patch is harvested. However, if unharvested refuges are left in fields then it is possible that mammals remain in them and survive.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on mammals of providing refuges during crop harvesting or mowing.

â€˜We found no studies' means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
