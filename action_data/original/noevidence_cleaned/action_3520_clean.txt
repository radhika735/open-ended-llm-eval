3520: Provide or retain set-aside areas on farmland 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Allocation of some farmland to set-aside (fields taken out of production) was compulsory under European Union agricultural policy from 1992 until 2008. The idea was to reduce production. However, set-aside has also been promoted as a method of enhancing biodiversity on farmland. Set-aside can be rotational (in a different place every year or two) or non-rotational (same place for 5–20 years) and fields can either be sown with fallow crops or left to naturally regenerate. Unlike fallow land, set-aside is not ploughed or harrowed except for the purpose of sowing. However, set-aside often is managed by cutting and/or spraying. In some cases, set-aside land has had wildflowers sown on it.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of providing or retaining set-aside areas on farmland on reptile populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
