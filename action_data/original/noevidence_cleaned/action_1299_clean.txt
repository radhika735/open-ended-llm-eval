1299: <i>Crassula helmsii</i>: Plant other species to suppress growth
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
It has been suggested that the native species shoreweed Littorella uniflora can compete with C. helmsii, leading to reductions in cover of C. helmsii under some circumstances (Denton 2013). Denton (2013) suggests that there may be a chemical effect by which shoreweed inhibits the grown of C. helmsii.

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of using other plant species to control growth of Crassula helmsii.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
