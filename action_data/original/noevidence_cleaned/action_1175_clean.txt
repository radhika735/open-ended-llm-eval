1175: Incorporate existing trees or woods into the landscape of new developments
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Forests or woods that are converted into new development areas suffer from almost total loss of the original biodiversity. Therefore, incorporation of patches of the original vegetation into new developments should have a positive effect on biodiversity. However, for many of the original species, the area of their new ‘island habitat’ may be insufficient to maintain populations.
 

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of incorporating existing trees or woods into the landscape of new developments on forests.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
