2907: Limit, cease or prohibit discharge of waste effluents overboard from vessels
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Commercial, recreational, industrial, and military vessels can generate large amounts of liquid waste, such as sewage, grey waters, and bilge waters (Welles 2003). Discharge of these wastes overboard can impact marine and freshwater mammals through the introduction of bacteria, excess nutrients, toxic substances, and solid particles. Limiting, ceasing or prohibiting the discharge of waste overboard from vessels in an area can potentially reduce or stop the source of pollution. In many parts of the world, it is illegal to dispose of waste effluents into coastal waters or delimited zones, for instance following local bylaws.
For an intervention related to the discharge of solid waste, see Limit, cease or prohibit discharge of solid waste overboard from vessels.
