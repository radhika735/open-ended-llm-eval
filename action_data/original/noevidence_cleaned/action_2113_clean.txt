2113: Introduce catch shares
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Catch shares are a type of fisheries management system whereby a secure share of targeted species or fishing area is given to individual fishermen, communities or fisheries associations (Costello et al. 2008). This normally involves the division of allocated catch quotas amongst fishery participants, who can then catch a certain amount of targeted species each year and are responsible for not exceeding that amount. Shares can sometimes be bought or sold. With a secure share of the catch, there can be reduced competition between fishery participants and focus may shift from maximising volume to maximising value, which may reduce fishing effort in the area, thereby potentially reducing the impact on the seabed, the amount of unwanted catch, and overall threat to subtidal benthic invertebrates.
 
Costello C., Gaines S.D. & Lynham J. (2008) Can catch shares prevent fisheries collapse? Science, 321, 1678–1681.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of introducing catch shares on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.

 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
