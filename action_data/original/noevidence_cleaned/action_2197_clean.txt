2197: Use other bioremediation methods in aquaculture
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Aquaculture systems can negatively impact invertebrate subtidal communities through pollution and diminished water quality (Wu et al. 1994). Various biological methods can be used to remove such pollution (‘bioremediation’; Chávez-Crooker et al. 2010), including better managing the use and dosage of chemicals, better managing fish food, using integrated multi-trophic aquaculture, locating or relocating aquaculture farms to specific areas, or placing artificial reefs nearby to act as biofilters [these interventions are summarised above]. Other methods can be used to mitigate pollution from aquaculture, such as microbial nitrification and denitrification in sediments, or the use of technological applications such as mechanical and biological filters (Chávez-Crooker et al. 2010). Using bioremediation methods may help improve water quality at aquaculture sites and reduce the risks to subtidal benthic invertebrates from pollution.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of using other bioremediation methods in aquaculture on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.

 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
