2392: Increase crop diversity for mammals
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Some farmland heterogeneity is thought to be key in determining on-farm biodiversity (Benton et al. 2003). Therefore, increasing the range of different crops grown in a given year may increase the biological value of a farm.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on mammals of increasing crop diversity.

‘We found no studies' means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
