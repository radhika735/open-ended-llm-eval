2060: Remove pipelines and infrastructure following decommissioning
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Pipelines and infrastructure from offshore industry structures, such as oil and gas, renewable energy, and mining can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through physical damage and loss of habitat when the infrastructure is constructed, but also following decommissioning through indirect environmental impacts, such as chemical leaching and corrosion of structures (Picken et al. 1997). Removing structures is one decommissioning option to remove the threat from the marine environment (Brigitte et al. 2018; Chandler et al. 2017). In the OSPAR maritime area for instance, the at-sea disposal or leaving in place of disused offshore installations is prohibited (OSPAR 1998).

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of removing pipelines and infrastructure in place following decommissioning on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.

 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
