1447: Use loud-speakers to broadcast primate alarm calls
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Farmers could use loud-speakers to play primate alarm calls to deter primates from farms. A study that tested the influence of a combination of human and mechanical sounds, predator sounds, and vocalizations of other primates living in the same area, on primate activity budgets, found that play-backs of these sounds caused Cape baboons Papio ursinus to run more and feed less, but that there was no effect on the behaviour of vervet monkeys Chlorocebus pygerythrus (Richardson, 2014).
            Using loud-speakers to broadcast sounds of potential threats to crop-raiding primates is discussed under ‘Use loud-speakers to broadcast sounds of potential threats (e.g. barking dogs, bird-fright explosions, gunshots)’.

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of using loud-speakers to broadcast primate alarm calls to crop-raiding primates on primate populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
