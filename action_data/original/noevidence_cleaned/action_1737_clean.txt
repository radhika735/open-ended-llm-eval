1737: Change season/timing of livestock grazing
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Grazing could have different effects on peatland vegetation depending on the time of year at which it is done. For example, it might be beneficial to avoid grazing when certain plants are young/flowering so that they can grow/reproduce and contribute to the peatland vegetation. Additionally, the effects of trampling may vary by season, being lowest in summer when the peatland is relatively dry or winter if it is frozen. Clearly, seasonal variation in the value of the peatland plants as food for livestock could also contribute to the decision of when to allow grazing.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: completely remove livestock from degraded peatlands; low intensity grazing as a traditional or novel conservation tool.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on peatland vegetation, of changing the season or timing of livestock grazing.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
