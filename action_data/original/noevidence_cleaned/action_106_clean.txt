106: Control grey squirrels
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves controlling grey squirrels Sciurus carolinensis to benefit farmland wildlife. Grey squirrels are naturally found in North America but have been introduced to the UK and northern Italy (Linzey et al. 2008). Grey squirrels may cause damage to woodlands through bark stripping and in the UK they compete with the native red squirrel S. vulgaris for food and habitats and also carry the squirrel pox virus (Natural England 2011).
