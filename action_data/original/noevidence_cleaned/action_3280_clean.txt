3280: Irrigate (before/after planting)
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This action involves active, direct, continuous or repeated application of water to areas planted with marsh or swamp vegetation. Irrigation could be done with systems such as sprinklers, channels or pipes. It can be used to manage moisture and salinity levels, creating suitable conditions for planted vegetation. Irrigation can be expensive so may be best used as a short-term intervention to kick-start restoration. It might also divert water resources away from marshes, swamps or other wetlands elsewhere.
Related actions: Actively manage water level, other than to complement planting; one-off interventions to Raise water level before/after planting; Actively manage water level after planting.

Key Messages:
We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of irrigating areas planted with emergent marsh/swamp plants.
 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
