3569: Improve treatment standards of sewage and wastewater
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
If left untreated, sewage and other wastewater may pose a threat to reptile populations, particularly those living in or around aquatic environments. Three main steps may be undertaken in the treatment of sewage and wastewater: primary treatment, where solid material that either floats or sinks is removed; secondary treatment, where soluble organic matter that escapes primary treatment is removed by microbial activity; and tertiary treatment, which provides a final stage to increase water quality before it is discharged into the environment. Improving the treatment standards for agricultural, residential and commercial waste may reduce the threat posed by wastewater to reptile populations.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on reptile populations of improving treatment standards of sewage and wastewater.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
