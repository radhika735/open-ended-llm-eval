3901: Restrict timing of lighting to conserve areas with natural light regimes 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Artificial lighting disrupts the activity of nocturnal moths. For example, even when offered a food source, moths spend less time feeding in the presence of artificial light than when kept in complete darkness (van Langevelde et al. 2017). Attraction to artificial lights may also limit moths’ dispersal ability and mate-finding behaviour. One option to reduce this impact is to protect areas with natural light regimes, by reducing the time that lights are on, or removing unnecessary lights entirely (Gaston et al. 2012).

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of restricting the timing of lighting to conserve areas with natural light regimes.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
