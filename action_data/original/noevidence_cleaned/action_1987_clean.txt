1987: Coppice woodland
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Coppicing involves repeatedly felling trees at the base and allowing them to regrow. The effects on bats are likely to be mixed. Temporarily removing tree cover may be beneficial for bat species that forage in open spaces or along edge habitats. However, coppice with dense regrowth may only be suitable for some bat species that are adapted to cluttered habitats. Older trees retained within coppice may provide roosting opportunities.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of coppicing woodland on bat populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
