2834: Introduce fishing gear exchange programmes to encourage fishers to use gear that reduces unwanted catch of mammals
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Introducing fishing gear exchange programmes may encourage fishers to use gear types that reduce the unwanted catch (‘bycatch’) of marine and freshwater mammals. Fishers may be provided with alternative gear types that are less harmful to mammals after surrendering their existing gear. Training on the use of new fishing gear may also be required.
