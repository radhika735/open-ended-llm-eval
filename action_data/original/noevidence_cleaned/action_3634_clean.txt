3634: Use patch retention harvesting instead of clearcutting
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Removing trees, through clearcutting or clearfelling is likely to have substantial effects on reptiles, through alteration of habitat and removal of food and shelter. Patch retention is the act of leaving groups of trees during harvesting, which may act as refugia to support forest fauna and enable its recolonization of the remainder of the forest as it regrows.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of using patch retention harvesting instead of clearcutting on reptile populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
