799: Prevent heavy usage or exclude wildfowl from aquatic habitat
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
High densities of wildfowl can strip aquatic vegetation from ponds and their banks, reducing shelter habitat and egg-laying sites for amphibians. Water quality may also be reduced through defecation and continual stirring up of sediments. Wildfowl can also prey on adult amphibians and their eggs. They are also potential environmental reservoirs for Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis the cause of chytridiomycosis. A study in Belgium found that 15% of wild geese tested in were positive for the fungus (Garmyn et al. 2012).

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of preventing heavy usage or excluding wildfowl from aquatic habitat on amphibian populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
