2128: Modify trawl doors to reduce sediment penetration
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Trawling is a method of fishing that involves pulling a fishing net (trawl) through the water behind one or more boats. Trawl doors are the boards or metal plates (otter boards) which attach to the sides of the net and keep the net open as it is pulled through the water. The trawl doors can be modified, for instance by using smaller otter boards, or securing netting at wing ends, to reduce sediment penetration. This may potentially limit impact on subtidal benthic invertebrates through reduced damage to the seabed (Balash et al. 2016).

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of modifying trawl doors to reduce sediment penetration on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.

 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
