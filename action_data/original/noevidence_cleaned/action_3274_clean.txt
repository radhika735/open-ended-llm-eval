3274: Raise water level (before/after planting)
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Drainage or water extraction, within or near to a focal wetland, can create conditions that are too dry to support healthy emergent vegetation. To complement planting efforts, the water level/table could be raised using techniques such as techniques such as: blocking drainage ditches; building raised embankments, berms or levees to retain water; switching off drainage pumps; installing or widening culverts under roads; ceasing groundwater extraction; removing dams upstream of the focal site; and reprofiling or diverting river channels.
The summarized evidence does not include general guidance about plant species’ moisture preferences, or laboratory studies of performance under different levels of soil moisture. To be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have experimentally tested the effect of raising the water level to complement planting in the field.
Related actions: Raise water level to restore degraded habitats (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps);     Raise water level to restore/create habitats from other land uses (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps);     Irrigate before/after planting;     Actively manage water level after planting (freshwater non-woody – brackish/saline non-woody – freshwater trees/shrubs – brackish/saline trees/shrubs);     Reprofile/relandscape before planting;     Remove surface soil/sediment before planting.

Key Messages:
We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of raising the water level in areas planted with emergent marsh/swamp plants.
 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
