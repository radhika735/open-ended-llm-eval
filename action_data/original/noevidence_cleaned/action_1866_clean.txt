1866: Amphibians: Vary duration of enclosure lighting to simulate seasonal changes in the wild
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
For some species, breeding is seasonal and may be triggered by longer periods of sunlight. It may be possible to trigger breeding by simulating these cues within an enclosure.

Key Messages:

No evidence was captured for the effects of varying duration of enclosure lighting to simulate seasonal changes in the wild.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches.
