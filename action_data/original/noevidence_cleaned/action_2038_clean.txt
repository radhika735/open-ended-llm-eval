2038: Regularly clean bat boxes to increase occupancy
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Some bat boxes can accumulate large amounts of droppings or debris and regular cleaning may increase bat occupancy. However, disturbance to resident bats during cleaning must be considered.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of regularly cleaning artificial bat roosts to increase occupancy on bat populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
