3388: Increase ‘on-the-ground’ protection (e.g. rangers) for marshes or swamps
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This action involves using an ‘on-the-ground’ human presence to protect marshes or swamps from immediate threats. This includes rangers or wardens that may patrol sites, ensuring legislation and voluntary agreements are followed (Moore et al. 2018). It also includes creating teams, such as firefighters, to directly manage threats.
Studies that include, or aim to conserve, at least some marsh or swamp habitat are summarized as evidence for this action. Given the broad scale of this action, results may include other wetland habitats (e.g. peatlands and mudflats), aquatic habitats (e.g. rivers and lakes) or upland habitats (e.g. forests).

Key Messages:
We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation or human behaviour, of increasing ‘on-the-ground’ protection for marshes or swamps.
 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
