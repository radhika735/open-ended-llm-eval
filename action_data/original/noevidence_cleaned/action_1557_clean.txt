1557: Implement a health programme for local communities  
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This intervention aims to indirectly prevent disease transmission from humans to primates by ensuring that humans do not carry diseases that can be contracted by primates and negatively affect their populations. It would be implemented in human communities that live in or close to primate habitat and should specifically focus on diseases that affect both humans and non-human primates.

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of implementing a health programme for local communities on primate populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
