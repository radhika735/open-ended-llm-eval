2624: Promote mammal-related ecotourism
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Watching mammals as a recreational activity and has grown considerably in popularity over recent years (Dinets & Hall 2018) with nature-based tourism in general increasing in most countries (Balmford et al. 2009). This may result in conservation benefits, such as increased revenue to local conservation projects and assistance with collection of data. Negative impacts can include disturbance pressures at popular sites or increased development to support tourism-related activities. Assessing the net benefits of mammal-related ecotourism may be hampered by lack of population data (Buckley et al. 2016).

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on mammals of promoting mammal-related ecotourism.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
