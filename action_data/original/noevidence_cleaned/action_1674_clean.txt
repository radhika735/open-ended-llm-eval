1674: Legally protect shrubland
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Legal protection can be given to habitats on a national or international scale. Levels of protection vary for habitats and may range from protection against all but light human use to allowing sustainable use of natural resources. Depending on the level of protection, human activities that are likely to affect protected habitats may be against the law or require licences from a government licensing authority.
 Please note that studies comparing shrubland vegetation inside and outside of a protected area are not included as they do not directly test the effect of legally protecting shrubland. Any differences in vegetation may have existed before protected areas were designated.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of legally protecting shrubland habitat on shrublands.

'We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
