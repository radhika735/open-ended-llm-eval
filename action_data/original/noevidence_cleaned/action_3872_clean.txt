3872: Retain riparian buffer strips during timber harvest 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Retaining riparian forest buffer strips along water courses or around ponds can help to shield waterways from the negative impacts of tree harvesting, such as sedimentation, by reducing soil erosion. It can also help to mitigate the effects of habitat loss and disturbance for forest butterflies and moths by retaining suitable habitat patches and favourable microclimates. Retained habitat strips can also provide corridors for dispersal through a disturbed landscape (see “Habitat protection – Retain connectivity between habitat patches”).
For other options for harvesting timber, see “Use selective or reduced impact logging instead of conventional logging”, “Harvest groups of trees or use thinning instead of clearcutting”, “Use patch retention harvesting instead of clearcutting”, “Use leave-tree harvesting instead of clearcutting” and “Use shelterwood harvesting instead of clearcutting”.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of retaining riparian buffer strips during timber harvest.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
