2914: Manage water levels and flow in rivers to maintain deep pools and connectivity
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Rising temperatures and changes in precipitation may substantially alter river flows and lead to desiccation and fragmentation of freshwater habitats (Arnell & Gosling 2013). Managing water levels and flow in rivers to maintain deep pools and connectivity may help to conserve freshwater mammal species that rely on these habitats, such as river dolphins (Choudhary et al. 2005). This may be particularly important in arid areas or during the dry season.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of managing water levels and flow in rivers to maintain deep pools and connectivity on freshwater mammal populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
