2025: Enhance natural habitat features to improve landscape connectivity to allow for range shifts of bats
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Landscape connectivity is important to allow for the range shift of bats in response to climate change (e.g. Aguiar et al. 2016). Natural habitat features such as forest corridors may be enhanced and/or extended to reduce habitat fragmentation.
This intervention will also depend on the availability of suitable habitats in new areas. See ‘Provide suitable bat foraging and roosting habitat at expanding range fronts’.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of enhancing natural habitat features to improve landscape connectivity to allow for range shifts of bats on bat populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
