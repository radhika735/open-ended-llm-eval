3142: Clean waste water before it enters the environment
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Waste water could be cleaned before it is released into the environment, or directly into marshes or swamps. Excess nutrients, salts, heavy metals, radioactive materials, organic compounds and solid waste should be removed. Acidity (pH) should be adjusted. Hot water should be cooled. Waste water can be treated through processes such as sedimentation or mechanical filtration, with bacteria or chemicals, or in ‘constructed wetlands’ that contain plants and microorganisms to absorb or break down pollutants (Kadlec et al. 2000; Siddiqui 2003).
Related actions: Remove pollutants from waste gases before they enter the environment.

Key Messages:
We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on marsh or swamp vegetation, of cleaning waste water before releasing it into the environment.
 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
