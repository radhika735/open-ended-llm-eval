2288: Modify bats roosts to reduce negative impacts of one bat species on another
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Different bat species occupying the same roosts may have negative impacts on one another. Bat roosts could be modified to reduce interactions between such species.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of modifying bat roosts to reduce negative impacts of one bat species on another on bat populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
