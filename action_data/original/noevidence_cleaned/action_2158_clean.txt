2158: Use sterile individuals in aquaculture systems using non-native species
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Non-native species are commonly used worldwide for aquaculture purposes due to their economic value (for instance, the Pacific oyster Magallana gigas is importantly produced in the UK despite not being native). The expanding aquaculture industry has led to the accidental introduction of non-native species into the wild marine environment (Bax et al. 2003; Hewitt et al. 2004; Manchester & Bullock 2000), where they can impact on native subtidal benthic invertebrate species through hybridization (reproduction). This could be potentially avoided by using only sterile individuals of a non-native species in aquaculture (Thresher et al. 2009). However, for this to be a fully effective intervention, advances in polyploidy aquaculture and genetic containment need to occur, given that sterile individuals have been shown to revert over time and that polyploidy can have negative outcomes (e.g. Piferer et al. 2009; Zajicek et al. 2011).

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of using sterile individuals in aquaculture systems using non-native species on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.

 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
