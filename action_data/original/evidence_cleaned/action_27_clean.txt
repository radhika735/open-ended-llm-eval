27: Reduce pesticide or herbicide use generally
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:


Key Messages:
One replicated trial in the USA showed that numbers of foraging bees on squash farms are not affected by the responsible use of pesticides. 
Â 

Supporting Evidence:
Shuler et al. (2005) compared the abundance of bees visiting squash flowers Cucurbita sp. on farms that either used pesticides (13 farms) or did not (12 farms), in the eastern USA. They found no difference in the abundances of squash bees Peponapis pruinosa, bumblebees Bombus sp. or honey bees Apis mellifera that could be explained by pesticide use. The study included no information about the type of pesticide, quantity or timing of its use. The authors assumed pesticides were applied on these study farms at times when bees were not exposed.
