815: Remove specific aquatic plants
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Non-native plant species can be introduced into or naturally invade waterbodies and out-compete native species altering aquatic habitats. For example, swamp stonecrop Crassula helmsii can form thick mats covering whole ponds.
Studies in which aquatic vegetation was removed as one of a combination of interventions for the restoration of ponds or wetlands are discussed in ‘Restore ponds’ and ‘Restore wetlands’.
 

Key Messages:
Two studies investigating the effects of removing specific aquatic plants are discussed in ‘Threat: Invasive alien and other problematic species – Control invasive plants’.
