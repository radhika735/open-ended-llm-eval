1702: Build bird perches to encourage colonisation by plants
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Building bird perches in degraded shrublands may help to encourage birds to perch on them. As a result the number of droppings deposited by birds at the site may increase, increasing the probability that the site will be colonized by plants.

Key Messages:

One replicated, controlled study in South Africa found that building artificial bird perches increased the number of seeds at two sites, but no shrubs became established at either of these sites.


Supporting Evidence:
A replicated, controlled study in two renosterveld shrubland sites in Western Cape province, South Africa (Heelemann et al. 2012) found that building artificial bird perches increased the number of seeds, but no shrubs became established at any of two sites. Two areas where artificial bird perches were built received more seeds (18–202 seeds/seed trap) than areas without artificial bird perches (0 seeds/seed trap). However, no shrubs became established at any of the sites with bird perches or those without bird perches. At both sites artificial bird perches made of dead branches of Eucalyptus spp. were erected in 10 abandoned agricultural areas, whereas in another 10 areas no perches were erected. Netted seed traps were placed below each perch or in the areas without perches.
