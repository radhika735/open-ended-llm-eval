351: Plant trees to act as windbreaks
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Excessive wind may reduce the suitability of open habitat patches. Planting windbreaks may overcome this risk.
 

Key Messages:

One of two before-and-after studies, from the UK, found that the local population of European nightjars increased following several interventions including the planting of windbreaks.
A before-and-after study, from the USA, found that erecting a windbreak appeared to disrupt lekking behaviour in greater prairie chicken territories nearby.

 

Supporting Evidence:
A before-and-after study in shrubland in 1962-1964 in Wisconsin, USA (Anderson 1969), found that the erection of a windbreak of 4 m high pines Pinus spp. appeared to disrupt lekking behaviour in male greater prairie chickens Tympanuchus cupido, with several males vacating their territories after trees were erected nearby. 
A before-and-after study at Minsmere reserve (151 ha), Suffolk, UK, in 1978-1988 (Burgess et al. 1990), found that the local population of European nightjars Caprimulgus europaeus increased following a series of management interventions, including the planting of ‘shelter belts’ to reduce wind in woodland glades. This study is discussed in detail in ‘Clear or open patches in forests’.
