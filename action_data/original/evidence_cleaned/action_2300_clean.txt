Key Messages:
Plants (9 studies)

Abundance (7 studies): 4 studies (2 replicated, randomized, and controlled) in  wetlands, riparian zones, and wet habitat features in the USA found higher biomass, cover, or abundance of some or all plant groups (or lower cover of non-native species), in areas with cattle, sheep or goats excluded, compared to grazed areas, in some or all comparisons. One replicated, randomized and controlled study from the USA found lower cover of native plants, in areas with grazers excluded, compared to grazed areas. Two replicated, randomized, controlled studies in grasslands in the USA found no difference in the cover or density of native plants between ungrazed and grazed areas.
Diversity (3 studies): One replicated, randomized, and controlled study in wetlands in the USA found more species, or fewer non-native species, in areas with cattle excluded, compared to grazed areas. One replicated, randomized, and controlled study in wetlands and grasslands in the USA found fewer species of native plants in areas with cattle excluded, compared to grazed areas. ne replicated, randomized, and controlled study in wetlands in the USA found no differences in the number of species or relative cover of native and non-native plants between areas grazed by cattle and ungrazed areas. 
Survival (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study along creeks in the USA found that similar percentages of planted willows survived in pastures with or without cattle excluded. 


Supporting Evidence:
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 1987–1988 in pastures along three creeks in the northern Sierra Nevada, California, USA, found that Geyer willow Salix geyeriana plantings had similar survival rates in pastures without or with cattle, but fewer were grazed in pastures without cattle. Plants: Similar percentages survived in pastures without or with cattle (33% vs 18–26%), but fewer were grazed in pastures without cattle (0.2 vs 0.7–1). Methods: The cuttings (over two-years old, 10.5 mm diameter, 42.3 cm length) were planted (30 cm depth) along three creeks (Cow, Freeman, and Big Grizzly), on thirty transects (3 m apart) across each creek and extending 10 m from the top of each bank, in May 1987 (300 plantings/creek). Along each creek, three pastures were fenced: one pasture was ungrazed by cattle, one was grazed early (1987: 22 June–7 August; 1988: 21 June–1 July) and one was grazed late (1997: 4 August–23 September; 1988: 18 August–31 August). The cuttings were measured in September 1987 and 1988.
A replicated site comparison in 1993–1994 in alpine meadows in central California, USA, found more golden trout Oncorhynchus mykiss aguabonita in streams, and more willows on stream banks, in areas of meadows from which cattle were excluded, compared to grazed areas. Ungrazed plots also contained larger willows and more young willows. Plants: Ungrazed plots contained more willows than grazed plots (124–246 vs 11–70 trees/125 m of bank), and contained larger willows than three of four grazed plots (140–220 vs 20–70 cm height for largest tree). Young willows less than 20 cm were more abundant in ungrazed plots (16–134 vs 1–8 trees/125 m of bank). Canopy shading over streams was higher in ungrazed plots, for three of four plots (32–35% vs 2–24% shading). Methods: Fences were erected in 1983 and 1991 in two meadows to exclude cattle from a total of three areas. Fish and vegetation were monitored in 125 m sections either upstream or downstream of the exclosures and inside them (a total of seven sites, three ungrazed) in August 1993–1994. Fish were surveyed by electrofishing and vegetation using transects every 5 m along the stream. Areas outside the exclosures were grazed by cattle in July and September
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 1992–2002 in grazed wetlands in northern California, USA. Plant diversity was lower at one of two grazing intensities. In a separate three-year experiment, diversity decreased in plots from which cattle were removed, but not in grazed plots. Plants: In a ten-year experiment, there was no difference in the number of plant species, or the relative cover of native and non-native species, in ungrazed plots, compared to grazed plots (data not reported). Lower plant diversity was found after the experiment, compared to before, in ungrazed plots, compared to lightly grazed plots (but not moderately grazed, plots). Plant community composition differed between plots with or without grazers along creeks, but not at springs (data reported as ordination scores). Plant cover at the end of the experiment was higher in ungrazed plots, compared to moderately grazed plots but not lightly grazed plots (data not reported). In a separate three-year experiment, plant diversity decreased in ungrazed plots, but not in grazed plots. Methods: The ten-year experiment from 1992–2002 was established in three meadows. Within each, three watersheds were randomly assigned to one of three grazing intensities: cattle excluded, light grazing (leaving 800–1,000 pounds of residual dry matter at the end of the season), or moderate grazing (leaving 600–700 pounds). Samples were taken from both the spring and along the creek in each watershed. The three-year experiment was in 1999–2002 in marshy areas within four meadows. Two plots were established in each: one ungrazed and one with moderate grazing. Insects were surveyed every three months in one year. Plants were surveyed each June using line transects.
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 1995–1998 in forested pastures in central California, USA, found no difference in plant cover on stream banks and the surrounding grass between ungrazed pastures and most cattle grazing regimes. Plants: There was no difference in plant cover on stream banks and the surrounding grass between ungrazed and grazed pastures, for three of four grazing regimes (6–94% cover). There was higher plant cover in ungrazed plot, compared to grazed plots, for high intensity, dry-season grazing (72–94% vs 31–51%). Methods: One pasture in each of three streams was ungrazed and the other four were grazed moderately or intensively (reducing stubble to 2–3 and less than 2 inches, respectively) and in the dry season or the wet season (July–October and October/November–May, respectively). Plant cover was measured in June on 10 transects across the streams.
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 1993–2002 in wetlands in central California, USA, found higher plant diversity in plots with cattle excluded, compared to grazed plots. Herbaceous plant cover increased over time in ungrazed plots, and lightly grazed plots, but decreased in moderately grazed plots. The species composition of plant communities differed between ungrazed and grazed plots, for one of two habitats. Plants: One measure of plant diversity along creeks was higher in ungrazed plots, compared to grazed plots. Another measure along creeks was lower in ungrazed plots, compared to moderately but not lightly grazed plots. There were no differences in diversity at springs. Herbaceous plant cover increased over time in ungrazed and lightly grazed plots, but decreased in moderately grazed plots (data reported as model results). The species composition of plant communities differed between ungrazed and grazed plots for creeks, but not springs (data reported as statistical results). Plant communities showed more variability over time in ungrazed, compared to grazed plots (data presented as coefficients of variation). Methods: In 1993, three wetlands in each of three watersheds were assigned to light grazing (reducing dry matter to 250 g/m2), moderate grazing (reducing dry matter to 150 g/m2), or no grazing (grazers excluded). Plots of 2–5 ha were established at springs and creeks in each wetland. Vegetation biomass was sampled each year in 1993–1998 from three 0.0625 m2 quadrats in each plot, and plant communities were sampled with transects in 1993–2002.
A controlled study in 2005–2008 in restored riparian habitat on a farm in the Central Valley, California, USA, found more plant biomass in plots without grazers, compared to plots grazed by goats and sheep. Plants: More plant biomass was found in plots without grazers, compared to plots with grazers (data reported as model results: grazing explained 21% of the variation in biomass). One-third of the identified plant species were planted during restoration (21 of 68 species), and 47 of 68 species were non-natives. Methods: Grazers were introduced to half of a streambank in 2005 (14 animals/ha), but they were excluded by a fence from the other half. Herbaceous biomass was collected in the ungrazed area and the grazed area in October 2007 and April–May 2008 (0.25 x 0.5 m plots).
A replicated site comparison in 2007–2008 in marshes in northeast California, USA. Ungrazed marshes had greater cover of wetland vegetation in one of two years. Plants: The cover of wetland vegetation was higher in ungrazed areas, compared to grazed areas, in one of two years (2007: 57–65% vs 40–58% cover; 2008: 58–69%). Methods: Fourteen ungrazed marshes (fenced between 1998–2005) and 20 winter-spring grazed marshes were surveyed for rails up to twice monthly in April–August (2007) or February–October (2008, excluding September). Vegetation was sampled every month in April–July (2007) or March–August (2008). Not all marshes were surveyed for rails or vegetation each year.
A replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after study in 2000–2010 in grasslands and wetlands in central California, USA (same study as (21)), found fewer species and lower cover of native plants in plots with cattle excluded, compared to grazed plots. Community composition differed, and biomass at the end of the summer was higher, in ungrazed plots, in some comparisons. Plants: Fewer native plant species were found in ungrazed plots, compared to cattle-grazed plots, in all but the first year of the experiment (6–8 vs 7–9 species/sample). Cover of native plant species was lower in ungrazed plots, compared to cattle grazed plots (32–61% vs 50–67%). This effect was stronger at pool edges than within pools or on dry land (lower native cover in four of 10 years for edges vs two of 10 years for other habitats). Ungrazed plots were more dominated by grasses in five of 10 years (0.7–4.6 vs 0.3–0.8 times more grass than non-grass cover). Ungrazed plots had higher plant biomass at the end of the grazing season, compared to grazed plots, in seven of 10 years (2,100–4,000 vs 860–2,200 kg dry mass/ha). Methods: Twenty-four plots were established in 2000, each with three pools (70–1,130 m2) and nine times more dry land than pool area. In 2000–2003, cattle were excluded from six pools, six were grazed continuously from October to June, and 12 were grazed seasonally (either October–January or April–June). In 2003, the seasonal grazing experiment was stopped and only ungrazed and continuously grazed plots were continued. Plants were monitored in April–May each year within pools, at pool edges, and on dry land. The area had been grazed for at least 100 years before the start of the experiment.
A site comparison in 2014 in an alpine meadow in southern California, USA, found more and larger willow Salix sp. trees in a plot from which cattle were excluded, compared to a grazed area. Plants: Streamside vegetation within a plot from which cattle were excluded had more willows than the surrounding grazed area (980 trees in 1,200 m vs 75 in 900 m) and had a lower cover of sedges Carex sp. (data not reported). Willows within the ungrazed plot were larger than those in the grazed area (average height: 48 vs 25 cm; maximum height: 300 vs 170 cm). Methods: Cattle were excluded from a 1,200 m section of stream in 1991 but were allowed to graze on the remaining 900 m. Vegetation within 2 m of the stream was surveyed in 2014.
