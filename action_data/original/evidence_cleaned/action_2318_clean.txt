2318: (CFT) Aquatic fauna: Allow resting time between periods of grazing (29b)
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:


Key Messages:
Invertebrates (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled before-and-after study in wet grasslands in the USA found more aquatic invertebrate species in continuously grazed plots, compared to seasonally grazed plots, in some comparisons.

Supporting Evidence:
A replicated, randomized, controlled before-and-after study in 2000–2003 in wet grassland in central California, USA, found that the number of aquatic invertebrate species varied between plots grazed at different times, in some comparisons. Invertebrates: There were more aquatic invertebrate species in pools in continuously-grazed plots, compared to seasonally-grazed plots, in one of three years (14 vs 11–12 species). Methods: Eighteen plots were established in 2000, each with three pools (70–1,130 m2) and nine times more dry land than pool. Areas were grazed continuously or seasonally (dry-season: October–November; wet-season: April–June). Before the experiment, the area had been grazed for at least 100 years.
