804: Use irrigation systems for amphibian sites
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Conservation of some species may require intensive management such as the redistribution of water resources. This could be achieved by using irrigation systems. Irrigation sprayers have been used to manipulate water at toadlet breeding sites (Mitchell 2001).

Key Messages:
One study investigating the effect of applying water to an amphibian site is outlined in ‘Threat: Energy production and mining - Artificially mist habitat to keep it damp’.
