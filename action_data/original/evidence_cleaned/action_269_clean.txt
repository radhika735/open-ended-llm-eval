269: Use perch-deterrents to stop raptors perching on pylons
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Preventing raptors from landing on pylons at all may reduce electrocution, for example, perch-deterrent power lines have spikes and pole caps on the pylons to deter birds.
 
 

Key Messages:
A single controlled study from the USA found significantly lower raptor activity close to perch-deterrent power lines, compared to control lines. No data were provided on electrocution rates.
 

Supporting Evidence:
A controlled study from September-August in 2006-2007 in shrubland in Wyoming, USA (Slater & Smith 2010), found that raptor activity and predation rates were significantly lower near a 24.9 km perch-deterrent line, compared to a 16.4 km section of control line (42 sightings vs. 551 and 69 prey items found vs. 277). Golden eagles Aquila chrysaetos and common ravens Corvus corax were the species most commonly observed successfully overcoming deterrent devices (76% of deterrent-line sightings). More raptors perched on wires (rather than pylons) on perch-deterrent lines (228 compared to 11 sightings on control lines; 68% of sightings were rough-legged hawks Buteo lagopus).
