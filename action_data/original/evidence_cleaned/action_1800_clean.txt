1800: Increase ‘on-the-ground’ protection (e.g. rangers)
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This section considers the use of an ‘on-the-ground’ human presence to protect peatlands from immediate threats. This includes rangers or wardens that may patrol peatlands, ensuring legislation and voluntary agreements are followed. It also includes creating teams to directly manage threats e.g. firefighters.
Key peatland types for which this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: raise awareness through engaging volunteers in peatland management; adopt ecotourism principles/create an ecotourism site. 

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on peatland habitats of increasing ‘on-the-ground’ protection. The study was in tropical peat swamps.
Behaviour change (1 study): One before-and-after study in a peat swamp forest in Indonesia reported that the number of illegal sawmills decreased over two years of anti-logging patrols.


Supporting Evidence:
A before-and-after study in 2006–2008 in peat swamp forest in Indonesia (CKPP 2008) reported that anti-logging patrols reduced the number of sawmills (associated with illegal logging) in the study area. Before patrols began, 147 sawmills were identified in Katingan Regency, including 102 in active use. After two years of weekly patrols, there were only two sawmills in the area. Patrols involved representatives of the National Park authorities, local communities and non-governmental organizations.
