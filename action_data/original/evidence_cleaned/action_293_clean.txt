293: Dye baits to reduce seabird bycatch
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Most seabirds are visual predators, and so are less likely to take bait if it is difficult to see. Dyeing bait blue so that it is hard to see against the water may therefore reduce bait loss and bycatch rates.
 

Key Messages:
A randomised replicated and controlled study in Hawaii found that dying bait blue significantly reduced the number of attacks from albatross on baits being set.
 

Supporting Evidence:
A randomised, replicated and controlled experiment in February 1999, in the Northwestern Islands, Hawaii, USA (Boggs 2001), found that dyeing squid bait blue when setting hookless bait lines reduced attacks by black-footed Phoebastria nigripes and Laysan P. immutabilis albatrosses by 95% and 94% respectively, compared to lines set with un-dyed baits (measured as attacks/bird/100 branch lines). Twenty-four repeats of each treatment were used, set during the day to mimic longline setting for swordfish.
