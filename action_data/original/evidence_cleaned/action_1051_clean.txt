1051: Brown and black bullheads: Netting
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Netting provides a potential tool for localised population reduction of invasive bullheads
 

Key Messages:


A replicated study from 1999-2000 in shallow interconnected ponds in a nature reserve in Belgium1 found that double fyke nets could be used to significantly reduce the population of brown bullhead measuring over 8cm


 

Supporting Evidence:
A replicated study from 1999-2000 conducted in small, shallow, interconnected ponds in a nature reserve in Belgium (Louette G. & Declerk S. 2006) found that double fyke nets were an effective tool to significantly reduce the population of brown bullhead Ameiurus nebulosus.  In ponds smaller than 1.5 hectares, a set of 12-16 double fyke nets caught an average of 66% (maximum 80%) of all brown bullhead measuring over 8 cm within one to two days. Capture rates were lower in a larger pond of three hectares. Mean depth of the ponds was 1.5 meters. The fyke nets consisted of two conically shaped nets connected by a vertically hanging net (11 x 1 m). Each fyke net had a total length of 8 m and mesh size of 8 mm. Trapped fish within the nets were counted and measured over one to two days.
