Supporting Evidence:
A replicated, controlled study in 1997–1998 in irrigated fallow land in California, USA, found more organic matter and higher carbon dioxide emissions in plots with added manure, compared to plots without manure added. Organic matter: More organic matter was found in soils with added manure (16 vs 10 g/kg). Soil erosion and aggregation: Similar aggregate stability was found in soils with or without added manure (366 vs 300 g/kg). Greenhouse gases: Higher carbon dioxide emissions were found in plots with added manure (3 vs 1 carbon dioxide µg/g/day). Methods: Plots (2 x 2 m) had poultry manure (25 Mg/ha) or no added fertilizer (five plots each). Manure was added in April 1987, February 1988, and October 1988 and was immediately incorporated into the soil (15 cm depth). Plots were irrigated weekly (100 mm/day). Five soil samples (25–100 mm depth) were taken from each plot. 
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 1995–1999 in arable farmland in southern Turkey found more organic matter and greater soil stability in soils with added manure, compared to soils without added manure. Organic matter: More organic matter was found in soils with added manure, compared to soils without added manure, in one of two comparisons (1.8% vs 1.6%). Soil erosion and aggregation: Larger soil particles were found in plots with added manure, compared to plots without added manure (0.38–0.43 vs 0.18–0.29 mm mean weight diameter). Methods: Cattle manure (25 t/ha) was added to three treatment plots (10 x 20 m), but not three control plots. Wheat, sweet peppers, and maize were grown in rotation. Soils were sampled in 1999, after harvesting the last wheat crop (0–30 cm depth). Wet sieving was used to determine mean weight diameter. 
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 2002–2005 in an irrigated maize field in Greece found similar amounts of organic matter in soils with or without added manure. Organic matter: Similar amounts of carbon were found in soils with or without added manure (5.7 vs 5.3 g/kg). Nutrients: Similar amounts of nitrogen were found in soils with or without added manure (0.81 vs 0.72 g N/kg). More phosphorus and potassium was found in soils with added manure, compared to soils without added manure (15–21 vs 4–11 mg P/kg; 67–85 vs 46–75 mg K/kg). Methods: Plots (5.6 x 8 m) had liquid cow manure (80 Mg/ha/year) or no added fertilizer (six plots each). The manure was incorporated into soil with a disk harrow (12–15 cm depth) within two hours of application. Soil samples were collected at the end of the growing season in 2005 (three samples/plot, 0–30 cm depth). 
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 2001–2005 in the Guadalquivir Valley, Andalusia, Spain, found greater stability and less erosion in soils with added manure, compared to soils without added manure. Soil erosion and aggregation: More stable soils were found in plots with added manure, compared to plots without added manure, in two of four years (data reported as log instability index). Less soil was lost from plots with added manure, compared to plots without added manure, after rainfall (60 mm rainfall/hour, in two of four years: 175–192 vs 210–211 kg/ha; 140 mm rainfall/hour, in three of four years: 390–439 vs 508–520). Methods: There were four plots (9 x 9 m) for each of two treatments (5.8 or 11.6 t poultry manure/ha) and there wre four control plots (no manure). The manure was added in October 2001–2004, and soils were ploughed (25 cm depth). Soil samples were collected one day before the manure was added, in 2002–2004, and also in October 2005 (30 mm diameter gauge augers, 25 cm depth). Soils were watered to simulate rainfall in October 2002–2005 (60 or 140 mm rainfall/hour), and soil loss was measured in plots (1 x 1 m) that overlapped the borders of the treatment and control plots by 0.5 m. 
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 1999–2004 in bare plots in Tunisia found more organic matter and nitrogen, but lower pH levels, in soils with added manure, compared to soils without added manure. Organic matter: More carbon was found in soils with added manure, in one of four comparisons (28 vs 9 g/kg). Nutrients: More nitrogen was found in soils with added manure (1.3–2 vs 1 g/kg). Lower pH levels were found in soils with added manure, in one of four comparisons (8 vs 8.3). Implementation options: Less carbon and nitrogen was found in plots with less fertilizer, compared to more fertilizer (carbon, in one of two comparisons: 12 vs 28 g/kg; nitrogen: 1 vs 2 g/kg). Similar pH levels were found in plots with different amounts of added manure (pH 8). Methods: Bare plots (1.5 x 1.5 m) had added manure (0, 40, or 120 t/ha) or no added manure (four plots for each). Manure was incorporated into the soil (10–15 cm depth). Soil samples (five samples/plot, 0–40 cm depth) were collected in September 2004.

More potassium was found in plots with added manure (312 vs 227 mg/kg). Soil organisms: Similar amounts of microbial biomass (measured as carbon) were found in plots with or without added manure (2–13 vs 4–10 mg/g). Methods: Four plots received 5–10 kg dry cow manure/ha, and four plots received no fertilizer. The manure was tilled into the soil (25 cm depth). Soil samples were collected in September (3–40 cm depth for organic matter in 2001–2008 and phosphorus in 2006) and four times in spring and summer in 2008–2009 (0–80 cm depth for nitrogen, and 4–20 cm depth for microbial biomass). 
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 2007–2009 in an irrigated onion field near Madrid, Spain, found higher nitrous oxide and methane emissions in plots with added manure, compared to plots without added manure. Greenhouse gases: Higher nitrous oxide and methane emissions were found in plots with added manure (nitrous oxide: 1 vs 0.4 kg/ha; methane: 0.08 vs –1.15 kg/ha). Methods: Plots (20 m2) had manure (a mixture of hen and goat manure) or no fertilizer (three plots each), added in 2007 and 2008 (110 kg N/ha). The manure was immediately incorporated into the soil (10 cm depth), using a rotocultivator. Plots were irrigated 1–2 times/week (608–618 mm/year). Greenhouse-gas samples (closed chambers, 19 litre volume, 10 mL samples, 0, 30, and 60 minutes after closing) and soil samples (0–10 cm depth) were collected four times/week in the first two weeks after fertilizer was applied, twice/week during the first month, and once/week until the end of cropping season.

Nutrients: More nitrogen was found in soils with added manure (0.10–0.17 vs 0.06–0.08%). Less phosphorus was found in soils with added manure, in five of six comparisons (1–6 vs 7–16 µg/g), but more was found in one of six comparisons. Methods: Plots (85 x 17.5 m) had added manure (commercial cow manure pellets: 1.5 t/h) or no added manure (three plots for each). Manure was incorporated into the soil (15 cm depth). Soil samples (five samples/plot, 0–15 cm depth) were collected in November 2006 and 2007.
