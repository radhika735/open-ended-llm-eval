Supporting Evidence:
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 1983–1996 in a rainfed wheat field in the Henares river valley, Spain, found no differences in soil stability between plots with reduced tillage or conventional tillage. Soil erosion and aggregation: No differences in soil stability were found between plots with reduced tillage or conventional tillage (pre-wetted soil aggregates: 78–89% were water-stable; air-dried soil aggregates: 1–4% were water-stable). Methods: Conventional tillage or reduced tillage was used on four plots each. Each plot had two subplots (20 x 30 m, with or without crop rotations). A mouldboard plough (30 cm depth) was used for conventional tillage, in autumn. A chisel plough (20 cm depth) was used for reduced tillage, in autumn. A tine cultivator (10–15 cm depth, two passes) was used for both conventional and reduced tillage, in spring. Fertilizer and post-emergence herbicide were used on all plots. Soil samples were collected in June or July 1996 (0–30 cm, four samples/subplot). 
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 1998–2000 in an irrigated vegetable field in the Salinas Valley, California, USA, found more microbial biomass in soils with reduced tillage, compared to conventional tillage. Tillage had inconsistent effects on nutrients. Nutrients: Similar amounts of nitrogen were found in soils with reduced tillage, compared to conventional tillage (1.5–1.6 g total N/kg soil; 0–15 cm depth). At depths of 0–90 cm, less nitrate was found in soils with reduced tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in 12 of 14 comparisons (4–61 vs 5–64 g NO3-N/g soil), but more nitrate was found in one of 14 comparisons (34 vs 29). At depths of 0–15 cm, tillage had inconsistent effects on nitrate (0–64 vs 0–53 μg NO3-N/g soil) and ammonium (0–9 vs 0–6 μg NH4-N/g soil). Soil organisms: More microbial biomass (measured as carbon) was found in soils with reduced tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in two of 16 comparisons (120–130 vs 90–100 μg C/g soil). More microbial biomass (measured as nitrogen) was found in soils with reduced tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in three of 16 comparisons (12–15 vs 5–8 μg N/g soil). Methods: There were four plots (0.52 ha), for each of four treatments (reduced tillage or conventional tillage, with or without added organic matter). In plots with added organic matter, compost was added two times/year, and a cover crop (Merced rye) was grown every autumn or winter. Lettuce or broccoli crops were grown in raised beds. Sprinklers and drip irrigation were used in all plots. Soils were disturbed to different depths (conventional tillage: disking to 50 cm depth, cultivating, sub-soiling, bed re-making, and bed-shaping; reduced tillage: cultivating to 20 cm depth, rolling, and bed-shaping). Soils were collected, along the planting line, with 6 cm soil cores. 
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 1996–1999 in three rainfed barley fields in the Ebro river valley, Spain (same study as (20,25,26,30)), found less nitrogen in soils with reduced tillage, compared to conventional tillage. Nutrients: Less nitrogen was found in soils with reduced tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in two of nine comparisons (125–176 vs 219–247 kg/ha). Methods: Reduced tillage or conventional tillage was used on 27 plots each (50 x 6 m plots). A mouldboard plough (25–30 cm depth) and a cultivator (15 cm depth, 1–2 passes) were used for conventional tillage, in August–September. A cultivator (10–15 cm depth, 1–2 passes) was used for reduced tillage, in September. Two-thirds of the plots were fertilized (50–75 or 100–150 kg N/ha). Barley was sown, with a seed drill, in October–November. Soil samples were collected four times/year (0–50 cm in two of three fields, 0–100 cm in one field, two soil cores/plot). 
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 2000–2002 in a rainfed sunflower-wheat field near Seville, Spain, found more phosphorus and potassium in soils with reduced tillage, compared to conventional tillage. Nutrients: More phosphorus and potassium were found in soils with reduced tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in three of 10 comparisons (26–29 vs 20–24 mg phosphorus/kg soil; 313–403 vs 261–313 mg potassium/kg soil). Methods: Reduced tillage or conventional tillage was used on three plots each (22 x 14 m plots). A mouldboard plough (25–30 cm depth, in 2000–2001), a cultivator (15–20 cm depth), and a disc harrow (15 cm depth) were used for conventional tillage, and crop residues were burned. A chisel plough (25–30 cm depth, in 2000), a disc harrow, and pre-emergence herbicide were used for reduced tillage, and crop residues were retained. Soil samples were collected in November 2001, January 2002, and December 2002 (six samples/tillage treatment, 0–40 cm depth). Sunflower was grown in 2001 and it was not fertilized. Wheat was grown in 2001–2002 and it was fertilized. 
A replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after study in 1999–2004 in an irrigated tomato-cotton field in the San Joaquin Valley, California, USA (same study as (36)), found that tillage had inconsistent effects on nitrogen in soils. Phosphorus in soils increased after reduced tillage, but it did not change after conventional tillage. Nutrients: After four years, nitrogen increased in soils with conventional tillage (before: 1,300 lb/acre; after: 1,400–1,600), but decreased in soils with reduced tillage, in one of two comparisons (before: 1,400; after: 1,200), and increased in soils with reduced tillage, in one of two comparisons (before: 1,300; after: 1,600). After four years, nitrate increased in soils with reduced tillage, in one of two comparisons (before: 18 ppm; after: 25), but did not change in soils with conventional tillage (before: 16–17; after: 10–19). After four years, phosphorus increased in soils with reduced tillage (before: 7–8 ppm; after: 15–17), but did not change in soils with conventional tillage (before: 8; after: 7–9). Methods: Reduced tillage or conventional tillage was used on 16 plots each, in 1999–2009. The plots (9 x 82 m) had six raised beds each. Rainfed winter cover crops (triticale, rye, and vetch) were planted on half of the plots, in October 1999–2003, and crop residues were chopped in March. Different numbers of tillage practices were used (conventional tillage: 18–21 tractor passes, including disc and chisel ploughing; reduced tillage: 12–13 tractor passes, not including disc and chisel ploughing). Tomatoes and cotton were grown in rotation. Fertilizer and herbicide was used in all plots. Soil samples were collected in spring (before planting) and in autumn (after harvest), in 2000–2004 (0–30 cm depth; number and volume of samples not reported). 
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 2003–2005 on rainfed farms in the Ebro river valley, Spain, found less greenhouse gas in soils with reduced tillage, compared to conventional tillage. Greenhouse gases: Less carbon dioxide was found in soils with reduced tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in 12 of 30 comparisons, in the two days after tillage (0.1–6.4 vs 0.1–13.3 g CO2/m2/hour). Methods: Reduced tillage or conventional tillage was used on seven plots each (33–50 x 7–10 m plots), on a total of two farms, with multiple crops. A mouldboard or subsoil plough was used for conventional tillage (25–40 cm depth). A cultivator (15 cm depth) or chisel plough (25–30 cm depth) was used for reduced tillage. Carbon dioxide was measured with a dynamic chamber (21 cm diameter, 900 mL airflow/minute, two samples/plot), 4–6 times in the 48 hours after tillage.

A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 2009–2012 in two irrigated vegetable fields in central Italy found more nitrate and ammonium in soils with reduced tillage, compared to conventional tillage. Nutrients: More nitrate was found in soils with reduced tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in two of 12 comparisons (in plots with oats or oilseed rape as the winter cover crop: 6 vs 2 mg NO3-N/kg dry soil), and more ammonium was found in one of 12 comparisons (11 vs 2 mg NH4-N/kg dry soil). Methods: Reduced tillage or conventional tillage was used on nine plots each (6 x 4 m plots). Each plot had a winter cover crop (hairy vetch, oats, or oilseed rape).

A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 2012–2013 in a rainfed wheat field in Wadi Madwar, northwestern Egypt, found less erosion of soils with less frequent tillage, compared to more frequent, more erosion of soils with shallower tillage, compared to deeper, and less erosion of soils that were tilled at slower speeds, compared to faster. Soil erosion and aggregation: Less soil was lost in runoff water from plots with reduced tillage, compared to conventional tillage (1.44 vs 1.66 t/ha). More soil was lost in runoff water from plots that were tilled to 15 cm depth, compared to 20–25 cm depth (1.31 vs 1.20–1.22 t/ha).

Methods: No tillage or reduced tillage was used on three plots each (10 x 25 m), in October. A chisel plough and a cultivator were used for reduced tillage (15 cm depth). A mouldboard plough and a cultivator were used for conventional tillage (20 cm depth). Soil and greenhouse-gas samples were collected 1–12 times/month, in November 2010–October 2011, in the vetch phase of a fallow-wheat-vetch-barley rotation (soil cores: 0–15 cm depth, 2.5 cm diameter; closed chambers: 19.3 cm height, 35.6 cm diameter, 20 mL gas samples, 0–60 minutes after chamber closure). The vetch was not fertilized. 
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 2009–2011 in an irrigated eggplant field in central Italy found more nitrogen in soils with reduced tillage, compared to conventional tillage. Nutrients: More nitrogen was found in soils with reduced tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in one of four comparisons (30 vs 24 mg inorganic N/kg dry soil). Methods: A mouldboard plough (30 cm depth) was used on all plots in autumn, before winter cover crops were planted. Cover crops were mown or chopped in spring, before tillage. Reduced tillage or conventional tillage was used on 12 plots each (6 x 4 m plots). A mouldboard plough (30 cm depth) and a disc (two passes) were used for conventional tillage (which incorporated the cover crop residues into the soil). A rotary hoe (10 cm depth) was used for reduced tillage (which incorporated some of the cover crop residues into the soil). Eggplant seedlings were transplanted into the plots in May, and fruits were harvested four times/year in July–September 2010–2011. Soil samples were collected when the seedlings were transplanted and when the last fruits were harvested each year (0–30 cm depth, six samples/plot). All plots were fertilized before the cover crops were grown, but not after. All plots were irrigated.
