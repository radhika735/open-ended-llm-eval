1092: Ponto-Caspian gammarids: Change water temperature
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
The use of warm water in which to dip nets, waders and wetsuits could provide a useful biosecurity tool, and help to reduce the risk of moving gammarids between waterbodies.
 

Key Messages:

A controlled laboratory study from the UK1 found that heating water to &gt;36°C killed all shrimps after 15 minutes exposure and at &gt;43°C all shrimps died immediately.

 

Supporting Evidence:
A controlled laboratory study in 2011, England, UK (Stebbing et al. 2011) found that heating water killed the invasive killer shrimp Dikerogammarus villosus. All shrimp died within a 15 minute exposure period when immersed into water at temperatures &gt;36°C. All shrimps died immediately when immersed into water at temperatures &gt;43°C. For each temperature tested, a container holding five shrimp was filled with water with measured temperatures of 28.4, 31.1, 36.3, 38.9, 43.2°C. A control set of five shrimps was held at ambient temperature (14-15°C). Shrimps were observed over a 15 minute period and then moved to freshwater at ambient conditions (14-15°C) to check for mortality over an 80 minute period.
