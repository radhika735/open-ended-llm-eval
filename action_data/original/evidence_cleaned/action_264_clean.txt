264: Thicken earth wire to reduce incidental bird mortality
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Removing earth wires is not always practical, given their protective nature. However, they can be rendered more visible by thickening the wire.
 

Key Messages:
A literature review found no evidence that thickening the earth wire had any impact on collision mortality of cranes Grus spp.
 

Supporting Evidence:
A literature review (Jenkins et al. 2010) describes how a paired site study in Colorado, USA (Brown et al. 1987), found that replacing 50% of the earth wire from 3.2 km of 115 kV wire with an earth wire three times thicker than normal had no effect on crane Grus spp. collision mortality compared to the span with a normal thickness earth wire.Additional referenceBrown, W.
