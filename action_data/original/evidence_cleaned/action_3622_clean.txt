3622: Modify fishing gear to reduce reptile mortality in the event of unwanted catch
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Reptiles are vulnerable to drowning when caught in fishing gear and unable to escape. Modifying gear to allow reptiles to reach the surface may keep reptiles alive should they be caught incidentally in fishing gear.
For studies describing the effects of modifying the depth at which fishing gear is deployed, see Deploy fishing gear at different depths.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on reptile populations of using modified gear to reduce reptile mortality in the event of unwanted catch. This study was in the USA.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Survival (1 study): One replicated study in the USA found that few diamondback terrapins died in crab pots fitted with mesh chimneys.

BEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)

Supporting Evidence:
A replicated study in 2012–2013 in five estuarine sites in North Carolina, USA (Chavez & Williard 2017) found that pots fitted with a wire mesh chimney led to low mortality of diamondback terrapins Malaclemys terrapin. One of 14 terrapins that were caught in pots modified with the chimney died. Standard commercial crab pots (61 cm × 61 cm × 61 cm) were fitted with a chicken wire chimney (122 × 30.5 cm diameter) to provide trapped terrapins with access to air. Pots were deployed June–July in 2012 (4 sites) and 2013 (2 sites). Pots were baited and submerged for 48 hours at a time.
