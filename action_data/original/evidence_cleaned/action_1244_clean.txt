1244: Sow tree seeds
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Direct seeding of new trees can be used to restore degraded trees community. This can also affect the abundance of other plant species and consequently the composition of the whole forest
 

Key Messages:

One replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after study in Brazil found that sowing tree seeds increased the density and species richness of new trees.

 

Supporting Evidence:
A replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after study in 2004-2005 in subtropical forest in Brazil (Sampaio, Holl & Scariot 2007) found that sowing tree seeds increased the density and species richness of new trees. The increase in stem density (seeded: 2,000/ha; unseeded: 1,000) and number of species/plot (seeded: 3; unseeded: 0) was higher in seeded plots. Data were collected immediately before (January 2004) and one year after treatment (March 2005) in four replicates of adjacent unseeded control and seeded (ten tree species) plots (10 × 10 m).
