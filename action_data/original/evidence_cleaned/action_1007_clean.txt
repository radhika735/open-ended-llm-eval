1007: Control invasive predators
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Introduced predators such as rats, feral cats and snakes can threaten bat populations. For example, the brown tree snake Boiga irregularis which invaded Guam in the 1950s, was responsible for the extermination of two bat species.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of controlling invasive predators on bat populations. The study was in New Zealand.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Survival (1 study): One replicated, before-and-after study in New Zealand found that controlling ship rats resulted in increased survival probabilities for female long-tailed bats.

BEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)

Supporting Evidence:
A replicated, before-and-after study in 1993–2015 in a rainforest in Eglinton Valley, New Zealand (O'Connell et al 2017) found that ship rat Rattus rattus control resulted in increased survival probabilities of female bats within three long-tailed bat Chalinolobus tuberculatus colonies. Average annual survival probabilities for both adult and juvenile female bats were higher in years with rat control (adult female: 0.82; juvenile female: 0.76) than without (adult female: 0.55; juvenile female: 0.55). Population trends were positive for all three bat colonies when rats were controlled, and negative for when rats were not controlled (data reported as statistical model results). Rats within the roosting ranges of all three bat colonies were poisoned using bait stations in 2006–2009 following high beech Nothofagaceae spp. seedfall and an increase in numbers. Bats were captured annually during the breeding season over 22 summers in 1993–2015 (average 6–8 captures/colony/year). Mark-recapture data were used to calculate survival probabilities.
