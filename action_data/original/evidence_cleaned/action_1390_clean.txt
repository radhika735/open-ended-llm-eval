Supporting Evidence:
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 1992–1996 in grazed wetlands in northern California, USA, found no differences in nitrate levels or pH between plots grazed by cattle at light or moderate intensities. Nutrients: There was no difference in nitrate levels or pH in surface water in lightly grazed plots, compared to moderately grazed plots (data not reported). Methods: Three meadows were studied. Three watersheds in each were randomly assigned to a grazing intensity: one with cattle excluded, one with light grazing (leaving 800–1,000 pounds of residual dry matter at the end of the season), and one with moderate grazing (leaving 600–700 pounds). Samples were taken from both the spring and along the creek in each watershed. Water samples were taken monthly.
