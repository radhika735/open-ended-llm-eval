31: Manage land under power lines for wildlife
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:


Key Messages:
One replicated trial in Maryland, USA found more bee species under power lines managed as scrub than in equivalent areas of annually mown grassland.
Â 

Supporting Evidence:
Power line rights-of-way are unfarmed and provide potentially valuable linear strips of habitat for bees and other wildlife. In the USA, they are periodically cleared of vegetation by mowing and/or herbicide treatment. A more cost-effective management method involves removing trees and other tall vegetation, mechanically and with selective herbicides, but retaining a dense scrub. One replicated trial under eight power line strips on a Wildlife Refuge in Maryland, USA (Russell et al. 2005) found significantly more bee species under power lines managed this way (32.5 bee species/site on average) than in equivalent areas of annually mown grassland on the Refuge, representing conventional power line management (23.2 species/site). There was no significant difference between power line scrub and mown grassland in the abundance of bees.
