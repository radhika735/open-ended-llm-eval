1269: Use shading for planted trees
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Shading newly planted trees can decrease evaporation or germination of competing species, and thus increase establishment chances of planted trees.
 

Key Messages:

One replicated, controlled study in Panama found that shading increased the survival rate of planted native tree seedlings.

 

Supporting Evidence:
A replicated, controlled study in 1996-1997 in degraded tropical forest in Panama (Hooper, Condit & Legendre 2002) found that shading increased the survival of planted native tree seedlings. The proportion of seedlings that survived out of those that germinated was higher in 75% shaded (74%) and 95% shaded plots (78%) than unshaded plots (39%). Data were collected in July 1997 in three treatment subplots (1×8 m): 95% shaded, 75% shaded and unshaded, in each of five plots, replicated in five sites. Each subplot was planted with 10 seeds of each of 20 native tree species in July 1996-March 1997. In all plots wild sugarcane Saccharum spontaneum was hand-cut three times during the experiment.
