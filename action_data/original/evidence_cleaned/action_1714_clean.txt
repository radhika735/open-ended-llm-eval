1714: Plant/seed under established vegetation
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Planting or sowing seeds under established vegetation may expose focal plants to less extreme conditions than planting them in unvegetated areas and therefore may result in higher survival and growth.

Key Messages:

A replicated, randomized, controlled study in the USAÂ found that sowing seed under established shrubs had mixed effects on blackbrush seedling emergence.


Supporting Evidence:
A randomized, replicated, controlled study in three blackbrush shrubland sites in California, USA (Jones et al. 2014) found that sowing seeds under established shrubs had mixed effects on blackbrush Coleogyne ramosissima seedling emergence. In one of three cases seedling emergence was higher under shrubs (28 seedlings/plot) than in open areas (21 seedlings/plot), but did not significantly differ under shrubs (25 seedlings/plot) from open areas (31 seedlings/plot) in one of three cases, and was lower under shrubs (15 seedlings/plot) than in open areas (25 seedlings/plot) in one of three cases. Plots measuring 70 cm x 70 cm were placed close to mature shrubs or at least 1 m away from shrubs (number of plots unclear). In January 2010 150 blackbrush seeds were sown in each plot. Seedling emergence was assessed in between March 2010 and May 2012.
