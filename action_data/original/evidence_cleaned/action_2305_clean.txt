2305: (CFT) Soil fauna: Include legumes in crop rotation (15a)
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:


Key Messages:

Microbial biomass (2 studies): One replicated, controlled study from Italy found more microbial biomass in soils with crop rotations, compared to continuous crops, in some comparisons. One replicated, randomized, controlled study from Spain found less microbial biomass in soils with crop rotations, compared to continuous crops, in some comparisons.
Bacteria and fungi (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study from Portugal found more fungi, but similar amounts of bacteria, in soils with crop rotations, compared to continuous crops.


Supporting Evidence:
A replicated, controlled study in 1999–2010 in a rainfed durum wheat field in Sicily, Italy, found less more microbial biomass in plots with wheat-bean rotations, compared to continuous wheat.  Soil organisms: More microbial biomass (measured as carbon) was found in soils with wheat-bean rotations, in two of three comparisons (293–509 vs 208–330 mg C/kg). Methods: Durum wheat Triticum durum was grown continuously or in a two-year rotation with faba beans Vicia faba on four plots each (18.5 x 20 m plots). Fertilizer and herbicide were used on all plots (half were tilled, and half were not). Soil samples were collected after harvest, in June 2009 (three samples/plot, 0–15 cm depth). Carbon dioxide was measured on 36 days in April 2008–April 2009 (closed chambers, 12 measurements/plot, 9–11 am).
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 1994–2013 in a rainfed wheat field near Madrid, Spain, found less microbial biomass in plots with four-year rotations, compared to continuous wheat. Soil organisms: Less microbial biomass (measured as carbon) was found in soils with rotations, compared to continuous wheat, in one of 12 comparisons (200 vs 260 mg C/kg soil). Methods: Continuous wheat crops or four-year crop rotations (fallow-wheat-vetch Vicia sativa-barley) were used on 12 plots each (10 x 25 m subplots). The cereals were fertilized (NPK, 200 kg/ha, twice/year, in October and March). The crop residues were shredded and retained (but some of the plots were tilled). Soil samples were collected in October 2010, April 2011, November 2011, May 2012, October 2012 and April 2013 (50 mm diameter, 0–15 cm depth).
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 2004–2006 in an occasionally irrigated oat field in Portugal found less  fungi in soils with a lupin-oat sequence, compared to an oat-oat sequence. Soil organisms: Fewer fungi were found in soils with a lupin-oat sequence (0.0023–0.0034 vs 0.0036–0.0045 colony forming units/g soil), but similar numbers of bacteria were found in both sequences (data not reported). Methods: Oats or white lupins Lupinus albus were grown in six plots each in 2003–2004 (year 1). Oats were grown in all plots in 2004–2005 (year 2). Each plot was 5 x 10 m. Half were tilled (15 cm depth), and half were not (crop residues were retained). All plots were fertilized with phosphorus (60 kg/ha), and oats were also fertilized with nitrogen (100 kg/ha). The seeds were sown in September and the oats were harvested in May. Soil samples were collected in year 2, in October, November, January, March, May, and July (0–15 cm depth). Bacteria and fungi were cultured from soil samples.
