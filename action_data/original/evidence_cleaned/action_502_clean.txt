502: Repair/support nests to support breeding
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
If nesting sites are limited then birds may use nests which are not suitable. Rather than move the nests or eggs (see ‘Translocations’), it may be more appropriate to repair or support the nests.
 

Key Messages:
A small study from Puerto Rico found that nine Puerto Rican parrot Amazona vittata nests were repaired, resulting in no chicks dying of cold.
 

Supporting Evidence:
A small study on nest success of Puerto Rican parrots Amazona vittata in the Luquillo Mountains, Puerto Rico, between 1973 and 1989 (Lindsey 1992) found that nest guarding and repair work by volunteers and biologists/technicians prevented the failure of nine nests in nest holes that had wet cavities, which, without repair, would have resulted in the eggs becoming chilled. A total of 71 nests were guarded. This study is also discussed in ‘Guard nests to increase nest success’.
