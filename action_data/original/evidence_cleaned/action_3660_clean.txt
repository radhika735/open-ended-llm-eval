3660: Regulate water levels 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Dams or ‘impoundments’ directly influence reptile populations, especially turtles, by fragmenting habitat and causing nest mortality through flooding via artificial stream regulations (e.g. artificially raising water levels in summer for boat navigation purposes; Bodie 2001). Undamming rivers and restoring ecological flow are both management interventions used to increase river health and change water levels (Bednarek 2001).

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of regulating water levels on reptile populations. This study was in France.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Abundance (1 study): One controlled, before-and-after study in France found that autumn–spring marsh flooding with moderate levels of grazing in autumn–winter led to higher numbers of European pond turtles than winter–spring flooding with high levels of grazing in spring–summer.

BEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)

Supporting Evidence:
A controlled, before-and-after study in 1997–2013 in two marshes with canals in Camargue, France (Ficheux et al. 2014) found that autumn–spring flooding along with autumn–winter grazing increased European pond turtle Emys orbicularis abundance. European pond turtle abundance was greater with autumn–spring marsh flooding and moderate-stocking density autumn–winter grazing (192–436 individuals), compared to winter–spring marsh flooding and high-stocking density spring–summer grazing (107–182 individuals) or year-round flooding and low-stocking density grazing (182–227 individuals). In a nearby site with moderate year-round flooding and grazing, European pond turtle abundance was stable over the same time period (29–153 individuals, data taken from graphs). Turtles were live-trapped in April–August 1997–2013 (7,059 total captures of 963 individuals) in two sites (100–250 ha, 1.5 km apart). In 1997–2001, both sites were flooded and grazed year-round at low-moderate stocking density. In one site, in 2002–2006, water levels were modified to create a dry period in summer–autumn, with natural flooding in winter–spring and grazing was changed to high density stocking in spring–summer (see original paper for details). In the same site, in 2007–2013, the flooding period was extended so that autumn–spring were flooded and only summer was dry, and moderate density grazing took place in autumn–winter.
