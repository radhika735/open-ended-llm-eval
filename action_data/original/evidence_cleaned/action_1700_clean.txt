1700: Sow seeds and plant individual plants
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Combining the sowing of seeds and planting of shrubland plants may help to rapidly restore shrubland vegetation as well as increasing colonization by the seedlings of shrubland plants.

Key Messages:

One replicated, controlled study in the USA found that planting California sagebrush and sowing of seeds did not increase cover of native plant species compared to sowing of seeds, or planting alone.


Supporting Evidence:
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in a degraded sagebrush scrubland habitat in California, USA (1) found that planting California sagebrush Artemisia californica plants followed by sowing of seeds did not increase cover of native plant species compared to only sowing of seeds, or only planting. Native plant species cover in areas where California sagebrush was planted and seeds were sown (7–14%) was not higher than areas where either seeds were sown (2–9%) or California sagebrush plants were planted (2%). California sagebrush plants were planted in six randomly located 1 m2 plots which were then sown with seeds, while six plots were only sown with seeds of shrubland plants, and another six plots were only planted with California sagebrush plants. Plant cover was recorded 1 m2 plots, every year between May and July. Year of the study is not provided. DeSimone, S.A.
