128: Take field corners out of management
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:

Field corners can be taken out of management on both arable and livestock farms. This can involve either not managing or planting corners with grass.
See also ‘Plant grass buffer strips/margins around arable or pasture fields’.

 

Key Messages:

A      replicated site comparison study in the UK found that      taking field corners out of management was positively correlated with grey      partridge overwinter survival. However it had no effect on grey partridge brood      size, the ratio of young to old birds or year-on-year density changes.

 

Supporting Evidence:
A replicated site comparison study in 2004 to 2008 in England (Ewald et al. 2010) found that grey partridge Perdix perdix overwinter survival was positively correlated with taking field corners out of management, significantly so in 2007–2008. There were no relationships between taking field corners out of management and brood size, the ratio of young to old birds or year-on-year density changes. Spring and autumn counts of grey partridge were made at 1,031 sites across England as part of the Partridge Count Scheme.
