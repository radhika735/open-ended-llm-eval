485: Provide artificial nesting sites for rails
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:


Key Messages:
A replicated study from across the UK found that common moorhens Gallinula chloropus and common coot Fulica atra readily used artificial islands for nesting.
 

Supporting Evidence:
A replicated study in 1992 reviewed the use of artificial islands and floating platforms in 17 wetland nature reserves across the UK (Burgess & Hirons 1992) found that common moorhens Gallinula chloropus and common coot Fulica atra used both well-vegetated and bare shingle-covered islands and platforms at both inland and coastal sites. The only exception was moorhens not using sparsely covered platforms and islands at northern coastal sites. The review also examines island and platform use by grebes, divers, ground-nesting seabirds, waders and wildfowl.
