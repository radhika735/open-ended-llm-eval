589: Use captive breeding to increase or maintain populations of seabirds
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:


Key Messages:
A study from Spain over five years found that a single pair of Audouin’s gulls, Larus audouinii, successfully bred in captivity.
 

Supporting Evidence:
A small study in a captive-breeding centre in eastern Spain (Martínez-Abraín et al. 2001) found that a pair of captive Audouin’s gulls Larus audouinii successfully bred in captivity each year between 1996 and 2000. This followed a pair of wild gulls nesting inside the centre but outside the cages. Comparisons with the wild pair are made in ‘Artificially incubate and hand-rear birds in captivity’.
