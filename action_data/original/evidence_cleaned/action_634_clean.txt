Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:


Key Messages:
A replicated study from New Zealand found that released black stilts Himantopus novaezelandiae were more likely to move long distances after release if they were released in larger groups.
 

Supporting Evidence:
A replicated study of critically endangered black stilt (kaki) Himantopus novaezelandiae releases in South Island, New Zealand, between 1993 and 2005 (van Heezik et al. 2009) found that birds were more likely to move long distances from the release site when released in large groups, compared to birds released in smaller numbers. This study is discussed in more detail in ‘Release captive-bred individuals’ and ‘Release birds as adults or sub-adults, not juveniles’.
