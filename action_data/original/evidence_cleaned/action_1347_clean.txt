1347: Crop production: Add manure to the soil
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:


Key Messages:
Crop yield (2 studies): One replicated, randomized, controlled study from Greece found higher maize yields in plots with added manure, compared to plots without added manure, in two of three comparisons. One replicated, randomized, controlled study from Italy found similar nectarine yields in plots with or without added manure.

Supporting Evidence:
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 2002–2005 in an irrigated maize field in Greece found higher maize yields in plots with added manure, compared to plots without added manure. Crop yield: Higher maize yields were found in plots with added manure, compared to plots without added manure, in two of three comparisons (11–14 vs 10–12 Mg/ha). Methods: Plots (5.6 x 8 m) had liquid cow manure (80 Mg/ha/year) or no added fertilizer (six plots each). The manure was incorporated into the soil with a disk harrow (12–15 cm depth) within two hours of application. Grain yield was measured at the end of October (two rows/plot, 12.8 m2). 
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 2001–2009 in an irrigated nectarine orchard in Italy found similar nectarine yields in plots with or without added manure. Crop yield: Similar nectarine yields were found in plots with or without added manure (33 vs 38 kg/tree). Methods: Four plots received 5–10 kg dry cow manure/ha, and four plots received no fertilizer. The manure was tilled into the soil (25 cm depth). Yield was measured in four trees/plot/year.
