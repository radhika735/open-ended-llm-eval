1249: Add lime to the soil to increase fertility
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Application of lime (rich in calcium and Magnesium) is used to neutralize soil acidity, and increases activity of soil bacteria. This may increase soil fertility and as a result enhance biodiversity in degraded forest areas.
 

Key Messages:

One replicated, randomized controlled study in the USA found that adding lime increased vegetation cover.

 

Supporting Evidence:
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 1991-1995 in a degraded temperate coniferous forest in Idaho, USA (Walsh & Redente 2011) found that adding lime to the soil before restoration planting increased total plant cover. Total plant cover was higher in lime addition (38-40%) than control plots (17-23%). Control and lime addition treatments (at 11,000 kg/ha  ) were each applied in 1991 to eight plots (3 × 10 m) at each of two hilltop sites. All plots were fertilized with nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium at 112, 56 and 90 kg/ha respectively. Plots were planted with western white pine Pinus monticola trees, shrubs and grasses before treatments in 1991. Data were collected in 1995.
