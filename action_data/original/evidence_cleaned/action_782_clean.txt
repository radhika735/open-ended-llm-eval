782: Modify gully pots and kerbs
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Gully pots along roadside kerbs form effective traps for amphibians. Animals crossing roads reach the kerb and often move along its base, until they fall into a gully pot. Once in the gully pot amphibians cannot climb out. A study found that 63% of 636 gully pots in two areas in Scotland contained wildlife, of which 91% were amphibians (1,087 animals; Muir 2012).
There are a number of ways in which the impact on amphibians could be reduced, such as moving gully pots, modifying the design of their grills, providing escape ladders or changing the shape of kerb stones (angled or indented).

Key Messages:

One before-and-after study in the UK found that moving gully pots 10 cm away from the kerb decreased the number of great crested newts that fell in by 80%.

 

Supporting Evidence:
A before-and-after study in 2005–2006 of gullypots along roads in South Wales, UK (Muir 2012) found that moving the gullypot 10 cm away from the kerb resulted in 80% fewer great crested newts Triturus cristatus falling into the gullypots. Only 65 newts were found in the drains compared to 318 before gullypots were moved. Gullypots were moved in 2005.
