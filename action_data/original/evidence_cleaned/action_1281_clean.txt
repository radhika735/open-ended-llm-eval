1281: <i>Crassula helmsii</i>: Use hydrogen peroxide to control plants
Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Hydrogen peroxide is a chemical that has herbicidal properties, but does not produce harmful chemicals that persist in the environment (Fowler & Barrett 1986). Therefore it could be used to locally control C. helmsii, with the advantage that it is non-toxic and leaves no residue.

Key Messages:

One controlled study in the UK using tank trials found that hydrogen peroxide did not control Crassula helmsii.

 

Supporting Evidence:
A controlled tank trial in 1988-1989 in southern England, UK (Dawson & Henville 1991) reported that hydrogen peroxide did not reduce the biomass of C. helmsii, although no statistical tests were carried out. Tank trials using low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide did not reduce the mass of emergent or submerged C. helmsii (data not given). Treatment with a higher concentration of hydrogen peroxide led to a 24% reduction in emergent vegetation, but a 45% increase in submerged vegetation compared to a control. C. helmsii was grown either in deep water as submerged plants, or in shallow water as emergent plants, in 300 l tanks. In low concentration trials hydrogen peroxide was applied to submerged and emergent vegetation at 20 g/m2 or 100 g/m2 in autumn 1988. High concentration trials used 250 g/m2 in spring 1989. Final biomass was measured after ten weeks.
