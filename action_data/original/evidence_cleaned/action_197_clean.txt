197: Control scrub on farmland
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Scrub on farmland can add complexity and heterogeneity to farmland. However, if scrub dominates non-productive land on farms it may lead to declines in species that require grassland and other farmland habitats.
 

Key Messages:
A replicated study from the UK found a negative relationship between the number of young grey partridge Perdix perdix per adult and a combined intervention of scrub control, rough grazing and the restoration of various semi-natural habitats.
 

Supporting Evidence:
A replicated site comparison study on 1,031 agricultural sites across England in 2004-8 (Ewald et al. 2010) investigated the impact of scrub control on grey partridge Perdix perdix. However, the study does not distinguish between the impacts of scrub control, rough grazing and the restoration of various semi-natural habitats. There was a negative relationship between the combined intervention and the ratio of young to old partridges in 2008. This study investigated several other interventions, discussed in the relevant sections.
