408: Use naphthalene to deter mammalian predators
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Naphthalene is a strong-smelling and potentially harmful organic compound, frequently used to deter many animals, such as moths and rodents.
 

Key Messages:
A replicated, controlled study from the USA found that scattering naphthalene moth balls near artificial nests did not affect predation rates.
 

Supporting Evidence:
A replicated, controlled study in July 1986 in a cord grass Spartina alterniflora marsh in South Carolina, USA (Gawlik et al. 1988) found that eggs placed in 40 abandoned red-winged blackbird Agelaius phoneiceus nests (mostly in southern red cedar Juniperus silicicola or marsh elder Iva frutescens) were as likely to be predated if six moth balls (treated with 100% naphthalene) were scattered in the vegetation within a 2 m radius the nest (50% of 20 nests predated), as if no moth balls were used (35% of 20 nests predated).
