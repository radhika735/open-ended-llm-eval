2901: Use methods to dampen underwater noise emissions (e.g. bubble curtains, screens)
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Activities that produce large amounts of underwater noise, such as seismic airgun surveys, pile driving, dredging, explosives and sonar, may disturb or cause auditory injury to marine and freshwater mammals (Gordon et al. 2003, Bailey et al. 2010). Various methods may be used to dampen underwater noise emissions. This may involve surrounding the sound source with devices to absorb energy, such as screens or physical barriers, bubble curtains (a ‘curtain’ of air bubbles), hydro-sound dampeners (nets with gas-filled balloons and foam attached), cofferdams (insulated sleeves) or a combination of these measures (Verfuss 2014).

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on marine mammals of using bubble curtains or screens to dampen underwater noise emissions. The study was in the North Sea (Germany).

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)

Behaviour change (1 study): One before-and-after, site comparison study in the North Sea found that using bubble curtains or screens during pile driving resulted in harbour porpoise detections within 15 km decreasing less compared to before pile driving than at sites without bubble curtains or screens.


Supporting Evidence:
A before-and-after, site comparison study in 2010–2013 at seven wind farm construction sites in the North Sea, Germany (Brandt et al. 2018) found that using bubble curtains or screens resulted in harbour porpoise Phocoena phocoena detections within 15 km decreasing less compared to before pile driving than at sites without bubble curtains or screens. Compared to 24–48 h before pile driving, porpoise detections at distances of 0–15 km from piling sites decreased less during pile driving with bubble curtains and screens (0–5 km: 63%; 5–10 km: 23%; 10–15 km: 17%) than during pile driving without curtains or screens (0–5 km: 80%; 5–10 km: 55%; 10–15 km: 50%). In 2010–2013, pile driving was carried out at seven wind farm sites with or without bubble curtains (air bubbles released from a hose on the sea floor) or screens (double-wall screen filled with air). One site constructed all of 30 foundations with screens. Five sites constructed most foundations with bubble curtains (30–79 with; 1–11 without), and one site constructed most without (1 with; 80 without). All seven sites also used acoustic deterrents (pingers and seal scarers) prior to pile driving and ‘soft-start’ procedures. Acoustic data loggers attached to moorings recorded porpoise echolocation clicks at multiple locations at all seven sites 24–48 h before and during each of 581 pile driving events.
