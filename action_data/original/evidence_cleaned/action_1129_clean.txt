1129: Floating pennywort: Use of hydrogen peroxide
Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Treatment with hydrogen peroxide offers a potential control method for floating pennywort Hydrocotyle ranunculoides when applied at very high concentrations.
 

Key Messages:

A controlled, replicated pilot study in The Netherlands, found that hydrogen peroxide sprayed on potted floating pennywort plants resulted in curling and transparency of the leaves when applied at the highest tested concentration (30%), but this was still not sufficient to kill the plant.

 

Supporting Evidence:
A controlled, replicated experiment in 2010 in greenhouses at Plant Research International in Wageningen, The Netherlands (Joost van der Burg 2010) found that hydrogen peroxide sprayed on potted floating pennywort Hydrocotyle ranunculoides plants resulted in curling and transparency of the leaves when applied at the highest tested concentration (30%), but this was still not sufficient to kill the plant.  Leaf transparency and curling was visible after three hours.  A 10% concentration also had clear effect but killed few of the leaves, with about half of the leaf surfaces affected.  Lower concentrations had little effect.  Stolones and shoot tips, though all above ground, were not affected in any treatment. The roots were immersed in the mud and not affected either. The higher concentrations (10% and 30%) were reported to be hazardous to people who carry out the spraying.  Test plants were newly grown cuttings 22 days old.  Five treatments were chosen: 0, 0.3, 3, 10 and 30% hydrogen peroxide in water with four replications.
