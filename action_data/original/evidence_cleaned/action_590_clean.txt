Supporting Evidence:
A study on Lord Howe Island, Australia, between 1980 and 1983 (Miller & Mullette 1985) found that Lord Howe Island woodhens, Tricholimnas sylvestris, successfully reproduced in a purpose-built breeding centre. In 1980, the only three healthy adult pairs of woodhen were taken into captivity and they produced 66 chicks which were reared in captivity. This study also describes the impact of predator control (see ‘Control mammalian predators on islands’) and release of captive-bred individuals (see ‘Release captive-bred individuals’).
