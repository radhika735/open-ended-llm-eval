Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:


Key Messages:
A review of northern bald ibis  Geronticus eremita conservation found that a group of birds followed a microlite from Austria to Italy but none made the return journey.
 

Supporting Evidence:
A 2007 review of northern bald ibis (waldrapp) Geronticus eremita conservation (Bowden et al. 2007) found that a group of ibis successfully followed a microlite from Austria to Italy in 2004. However, by 2006, no birds had successfully returned, although several had made northwards journeys of up to 300 km. This study also discusses several other ex situ conservation interventions, discussed in the relevant sections.
