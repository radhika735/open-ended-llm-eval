575: Translocate herons, storks and ibises
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:


Key Messages:
A before-and-after study in the USA found that a colony of black-crowned night herons Nycticorax nycticorax was successfully moved, with the new colony producing chicks the year after translocation.
 

Supporting Evidence:
A before-and-after trial at a coastal site in Long Beach, California, USA (Crouch et al. 2002), found that 423 pairs of black-crowned night herons Nycticorax nycticorax successfully fledged 1,128 chicks in 2000, following the translocation of the colony beginning in 1999. The former colony was threatened by port development, so 50 mature trees were relocated 2 km away near approximately 70 existing trees. In addition, vocalisations of the original colony were played, decoys placed in the trees and public access stopped. Before the translocation, the old colony held up to 500 pairs of herons.
