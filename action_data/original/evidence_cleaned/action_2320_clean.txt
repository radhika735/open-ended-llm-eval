2320: (CFT) Carnivora: Exclude grazers (29c)
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:


Key Messages:
Carnivores (1 study): One replicated site comparison in grasslands in Spain found more mammal species and higher mammal abundance (of which &gt; 60% of individual mammals sampled were Carnivores; white-toothed shrews, Crocidura russula) in areas with cattle or sheep excluded, compared to grazed areas.

Supporting Evidence:
A replicated site comparison in 1999–2001 in grasslands in central Spain found more species and individuals of small mammals in plots from which cattle were excluded, compared to grazed plots. Mammals: More individuals and species of small mammals were found in plots from which cattle were excluded, compared to grazed plots (3–6 vs 0 individuals/plot; species data reported as ordination results). Three species of mammal were found: white-toothed shrews Crocidura russula (61.6% of all captures), common voles Microtus arvalis (31.9%), and wood mice Apodemus sylvaticus (6.5%). Abundances of all three species appeared to be higher in ungrazed plots, although this was not tested. Methods: Six plots to exclude cattle were established in reforestation areas in grasslands grazed at 2–10 animals/ha. These areas were used to move livestock until the 1950s and they were reforested in 1990, but few planted trees survived. Eight live traps were placed in each of 22 trapping plots (11 inside and 11 outside cattle exclosures). Traps were set and vegetation was monitored during autumn 1999 and 2000 and summer 2000 and 2001.
