2310: (CFT) Predatory invertebrates: Add compost to the soil (16a, 18b)
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:


Key Messages:
Invertebrates (1 study): One replicated, controlled study from the USA, found no differences in invertebrate biodiversity, ratio of natural enemy to pest numbers, or numbers of pests between plots with or without added compost.

Supporting Evidence:
A replicated, controlled study in 2014 in 29 organic vegetable fields on the Central Coast, California, USA, found no differences in invertebrate biodiversity between plots with or without added compost. Invertebrates: Similar numbers of invertebrates and invertebrate families were found in plots with or without added compost (data reported as model coefficients). Ratio of natural enemies to pests: Similar ratios of natural enemies to pests (mostly aphids) were found in plots with or without added compost (data reported as model coefficients). Pest numbers: Similar numbers of pests (mostly aphids) and pathogens (Escherichia coli bacteria) were found in plots with or without added compost (one sample from each had E. coli, but neither had shiga toxins; data on pests reported as model coefficients). Methods: In each of 29 vegetable fields, compost was added to one plot, but not to one adjacent plot (5 x 5 m plots), 1–2 months before lettuces were planted (25 t compost/ha, made from cow, chicken, and green manures). Lettuces were planted in spring (5–28 March) and summer (30 May–5 July). Invertebrates (insects, springtails, and spiders) were collected in pitfall traps (three/plot, 7.5 cm diameter) and pan traps (two/plot, blue and yellow, 15 cm diameter) after 48 hours of trapping (one sample when lettuces were seedlings and one when mature).
