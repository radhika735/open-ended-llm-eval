1245: Build bird-perches to enhance natural seed dispersal
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Building perches for birds can be used to enhance seed dispersal and increase species richness and abundance of tree seedlings. This can help to restore tree communities in degraded forest areas.
 

Key Messages:

One replicated, randomized, controlled study in Brazil found that building perches for birds increased species richness and abundance of new tree seedlings.

 

Supporting Evidence:
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 2001-2002 in a degraded subtropical Araucaria forest in Brazil (Zanini & Ganade 2005) found that building bird perches increased species richness and abundance of new seedlings. Species richness (perches: 0.6-2.0; no perch: 0.2-0.8/m2) and abundance (perches: 0.7-2.7; no perches: 0.2-1.7) were higher under perches. Data were collected in 2002 in four pairs of perch and control plots (1 × 1 m) in each of 10 blocks randomly located inside a 2 ha area. Perches were 2 m tall with a 16 cm diameter pole and were placed in the centre of each perch plot.
