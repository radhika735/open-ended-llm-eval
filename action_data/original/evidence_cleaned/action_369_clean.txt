369: Restore or create lagoons
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Lagoons can form important feeding and overwintering grounds for wildfowl and waders, providing a rich supply of invertebrate food. However, they are often drained to provide farmland, or lost due to coastal management and development.
 

Key Messages:
A before-and-after study in the UK found that large numbers of bird species used, and bred, in a newly-created lagoon.
 

Supporting Evidence:
A before-and-after study in Lincolnshire, England (Bradley & Allcorn 2006), found that a 15 ha saline lagoon created as part of a flood defence scheme in 2002 was subsequently used by 38 species of overwintering waterbird, at least ten of which bred.
