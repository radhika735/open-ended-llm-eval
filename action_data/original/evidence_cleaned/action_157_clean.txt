157: Distribute poison bait for predator control using dispensers 
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
If bait is easily visible, birds may be more likely to feed on it opportunistically. Therefore providing it in dispensers, which partially hide bait or make it difficult for non-target species to access it, may reduce incidental mortality of non-target species.

Key Messages:
A controlled study in New Zealand found that survival of South Island robins Petroica australis australis was higher when brodifacoum was dispensed from bait feeders compared to where bait was scattered.

Supporting Evidence:
A controlled study in three southern beech Nothofagus stands on South Island, New Zealand between August and November 1996 (Brown 1997) found that survival of South Island robins Petroica australis australis during predator removal operations was higher when brodifacoum was dispensed from bait feeders than in a site where 3 kg/ha poison was scattered and left exposed on the forest floor (29/30 birds surviving, 97% vs. 12/23 birds surviving, 52%). Survival in a control site, with no poisoning, was higher than in the broadcast site but not significantly different from the bait feeder site (18/21 birds surviving, 86%). Feeders were designed to allow black rats Rattus rattus and house mice Mus musculus to enter and retrieve baits, but not brush-tailed possums Trichosurus vulpecula.
