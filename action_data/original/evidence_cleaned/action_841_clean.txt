841: Use signage to warn motorists
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
The number of amphibians killed by vehicles can be high, particularly where their annual migration routes between overwintering and breeding sites cross roads. Signs to warn motorists of amphibian activity can be installed around the densest migration routes.
 

Key Messages:

One study in the UK found that despite warning signs and human assistance, over 500 toads were killed on some roads.

 

Supporting Evidence:
A study in 1995 of 76 toad patrol projects, 44 with toad warning road signs in the UK (Froglife 1996) found that despite signs and human assistance in the spring some toads were still killed on the roads. Overall, 65% of patrols reported that up to 100 toads were killed on the road, 28% reported 100–500 were killed and 7% over 500 toads. Only 20% of populations were believed to be stable or increasing. A questionnaire survey of most of the known and established toad patrols was undertaken. Seventy-six replies were obtained.
