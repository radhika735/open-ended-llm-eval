2303: (CFT) Soil fauna: Add sewage sludge to the soil (18c)
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:


Key Messages:
Soil organisms (2 studies): Two replicated, controlled studies (one randomized) from Spain found similar amounts of microbial biomass in soils with or without added sewage sludge.

Supporting Evidence:
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 2002–2005 in a barley field in Toledo, Spain, found similar amounts of microbial biomass in soils with or without added sewage sludge. Soil organisms: Similar amounts of microbial biomass (measured as carbon) were found in soils with or without added sewage sludge (86–136 vs 76 mg C/ha). Methods: The sewage sludge was thermally dried at 75oC. There were four plots (10 x 3 m) for each of four fertilizer treatments (20 or 80 t sewage sludge/ha, applied once in three years or once/year) and there were four control plots (no fertilizer). Plots were fertilized in mid-September and planted in mid-October.
A replicated, controlled study in 2004 in a barley field in Spain found more carbon dioxide in soils with added sewage sludge, compared to soils without it. Soil organisms: Similar amounts of microbial biomass (measured as carbon) were found in soils with or without added sewage sludge (179–229 vs 174 mg/kg). Greenhouse gases: Higher rates of respiration (measured as carbon dioxide) were found in soils with added sewage sludge, compared to soils without it, in one of two comparisons (50 vs 15 µg CO2/g/day). Methods: Sewage sludge (40 t/ha) was added to some plots, but not to others (plot size and number of replicates not reported). Soil samples (0–20 cm depth) were taken from each plot, nine and 36 months after adding the sewage sludge.
