950: Change timing of building work
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
To reduce disturbance to bats, building work may be avoided at times of year when they are most vulnerable, such as during hibernation and the maternity season.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of changing the timing of building work on bat populations. The study was in Ireland.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)      

Use (1 study): One before-and-after study in Ireland found that carrying out roofing work outside of the bat maternity season, along with retaining bat access points, resulted in a similar number of brown long-eared bats continuing to use a roost within an attic.


Supporting Evidence:
A before-and-after study in 2004–2008 of one building renovation in Ireland (Aughney 2008) found that carrying out roofing work outside of the maternity season, along with retaining existing bat access points, resulted in a similar number of brown long-eared bats Plecotus auritus using a roost within an attic before and after renovations. Fifteen brown long-eared bats were counted roosting in the attic space of the building before renovation work. After the renovation work, sixteen brown long-eared bats were recorded exiting the roost through the retained access points. The building was an 18th century Georgian house that had the roofing felt and roof slates replaced. Original access points to the roost within the attic of the building were retained by installing four vents in the ridge tiles. The renovations were completed outside of the maternity season (date not reported). The attic was surveyed once in 2004 before the renovations, and once with an emergence survey in September 2008 after the renovations.
