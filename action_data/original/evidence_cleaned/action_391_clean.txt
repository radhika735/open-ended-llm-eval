391: Control predators not on islands for parrots
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:


Key Messages:
A replicated, controlled trial in New Zealand found increased kaka Nestor meridionalis nesting success and lower predation at sites with mammal predator removal than at unmanaged sites.
 

Supporting Evidence:
A replicated, controlled trial in New Zealand (Moorhouse et al. 2003) found that the nesting success of kakas Nestor meridionalis was significantly higher at three sites with control (80–87% of 70 nests successful) than at three unmanaged sites (10–38% of 43 nests). Predation rate of nesting females was also significantly lower at sites with predator control (5% of 38 tracked females vs. 65% of 17). Stoats Mustela erminea, common brushtail possums Trichosurus vulpecula and rats Rattus spp. were controlled with trapping and poisoning with 1080 sodium monofluoroacetate and anticoagulents. Data comes from 1996-2000 for five sites and 1984-1996 for one (unmanaged) site.
