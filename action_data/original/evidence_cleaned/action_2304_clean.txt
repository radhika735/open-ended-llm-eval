Background information and definitions:


Key Messages:
Soil organisms (5 studies)

Microbial biomass (4 studies): Four replicated studies (three randomized and controlled, one site comparison) from France and the USA found more microbial biomass in soils with ground cover, compared to bare or tilled soils, in some or all comparisons.
Fungi (2 studies): One replicated, controlled study from the USA found more symbiotic fungi (mycorrhizae) in soils with seeded cover crops, compared to tilled soils, in some comparisons, but found similar numbers of roots that were colonized by mycorrhizae. One replicated, randomized, controlled study from the USA found inconsistent differences in mycorrhizae in soils with seeded cover crops or tilled soils.
Bacteria (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study from Spain found more bacteria, but similar levels of bacterial diversity, in soils with ground cover, compared to bare soils.
Nematodes (1 study): One replicated site comparison from France found more nematodes in soils with ground cover, compared to bare soils.


Supporting Evidence:
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in a rainfed olive orchard in southeast Spain (years of study not reported, but same study as (5)) found more organic matter and soil organisms in soils with cover crops, compared to soils without cover crops, under olive trees. Organic matter: More organic carbon was found in soils with cover crops, compared to soils without cover crops (8.3–9.9 vs 5.4 g C/kg soil). Soil organisms: More bacteria were found in soils with cover crops, compared to soils without cover crops (950–1,400 vs 32–230 million 16S rRNA copies/g soil). Bacterial diversity was similar in soils with or without cover crops (data reported as Shannon diversity index). Methods: Herbicide was used on four control plots in autumn, but not on eight treatment plots, which had resident vegetation. The resident vegetation was controlled in spring with herbicide (four plots) or mowing (four plots). Plots had 16 olive trees each. Plots were not tilled. Foliar fertilizer was used. Two soil samples were collected in each plot (0–30 cm depth, sampling date not reported)
A replicated, controlled study in 2001–2003 in an irrigated vineyard in the Salinas Valley, California, USA (same study as (6)), found more fungal spores in soils between vine rows with cover crops, compared to those without cover crops. Soil organisms: More fungal spores (mycorrhizae) were found in soils with cover crops, in at least one of three seasons (spring: 110–130 vs 70 spores/g soil). Similar numbers of vine roots were colonized by mycorrhizae in vine rows with or without cover crops (data not reported). Methods: There were nine plots (0.045 ha) for each of two cover crops (Secale cereale Merced rye or Triticosecale triticale, in the central 80 cm of the 240 cm between vine rows, which were disked every year in November, before they were planted, and were mown every year in spring), and there were nine control plots (bare soil between the vine rows, which were disked every month). Soil and vine roots (8 cm root and 10 g soil from 20 vines/plot, 0–30 cm depth) were collected in summer (July 2002), winter (February 2003), and spring (April 2003). Cover-crop roots were collected in winter and spring. Spores and fungal colonies were measured in soil and roots.
A replicated site comparison in 2009 in rainfed vineyards in southern France found more organic matter, phosphorus, and soil organisms in soils with ground cover, compared to bare soils. Soil organisms: More microbial biomass (measured as carbon) was found in soils with ground cover, compared to bare soils, in four of six comparisons (50–140 vs 30–90 mg C/kg soil), and more nematodes were found in one of three comparisons (747–1,371 vs 351 total nematodes/100 g soil). Methods: In 146 plots of three soil types, there was permanent vegetation (4–22% of plots in each soil type), temporary vegetation (48–68%), or bare soil (16–42%) between the vine rows, for at least five years before soil sampling. Soil samples were collected from the interrows in March–May 2009 (10 homogenized samples/plot, 0–15 cm depth).
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 2001–2006 in a vineyard in the Central Coast, California, USA, found more soil organisms in plots with cover crops between the vine rows, compared to tilled soils without cover crops. Soil organisms: More microbial biomass (measured as nitrogen) was found in soils with cover crops, compared to tilled soils, in 15 of 38 comparisons (during the spring and autumn rains: 21–61 vs 4–39 µg N/g dry soil). Methods: There were six plots (84.3 x 2.4 m interrows between vines) for each of two cover crops, and there were six control plots (cultivated every two months to control weeds). The cover crops (1.8 m width) were Triticale x Triticosecale Trios or Secale cereale rye, seeded in November 2001–2005 (interrows disked before seeding), and mown in April 2002–2006. Soil samples were collected every 2–3 weeks in December 2005–November 2006 (19 samples/plot, two cores/sample, 0–15 cm depth). Nitrous oxide was measured in 5.2 litre chambers (13 mL samples, every 30 minutes from solar noon, for 1.5 hours). It was not clear whether these results were a direct effect of cover crops or tillage.
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 2000–2005 in an irrigated vineyard in the Salinas Valley, California, USA, found more microbial biomass in soils with cover crops, compared to bare soils, between vine rows. Soil organisms: More microbial biomass (measured as carbon) was found in soils with cover crops, compared to bare soils, in one of two comparisons (plots that were cover cropped with rye: 105 vs 83 µg C, in vine rows; 190 vs 100 µg C, between vine rows; 0–12 inches depth). More beneficial fungus colonies (mycorrhizae) were found on vine roots in plots with cover crops, compared to bare soils, in two of six comparisons (with rye as the cover crop, and with pre-emergence herbicide or cultivation under the vines: 26–27% vs 21–21% of root length was colonized), but fewer colonies were found in one of six comparisons (with rye, and with post-emergence herbicide under the vines: 17% vs 26%). Methods: There were nine plots for each of two treatments and one control. The treatments were triticale (X Triticosecale) or Secale cereale Merced rye, planted in November 2000–2004 as cover crops (32 inches width) between the vine rows (8 feet width), mown in spring, and disked into the soil in the following November. Bare soils were maintained in the controls through disking in spring and summer (depth not reported). Each plot had 100 vines and the adjacent areas between the vine rows. All plots were drip-irrigated in April–October. Soil samples were collected when the vines were flowering (May 2003–2005, 10 samples/plot, 0–12 inches depth, between the vine rows). Vine roots were collected in April 2003, May 2004, and June 2005 (for mycorrhiza measurements). Runoff was measured with sumps (16 inches diameter, 5 feet depth) at the lower end of each plot. It was not clear whether these results were a direct effect of cover crops or tillage.
