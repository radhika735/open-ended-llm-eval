266: Use raptor models to deter birds and so reduce incidental mortality
Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Models of raptors are used in a variety of situations in attempts to keep smaller birds away from areas, on the basis that they will avoid predators.
 

Key Messages:
A single paired sites study in Spain found no evidence that raptor models were effective in deterring birds from crossing power lines and may even have attracted some species to the area.
 

Supporting Evidence:
A controlled paired sites study in two sites in Andalusia, Spain (Janss et al. 1999), found no effect of raptor models (one golden eagle Aquila chrysaetos and two Accipiter spp.) on the number of flocks crossing power lines in either migration or non-migration areas. In the migration area south of Cadiz, there was no difference in the number of flocks of birds coming within 100 m of the power lines, although there was a higher proportion of raptors in the section with the eagle model (42% of 119 records were raptors vs. 21% of 43 records) and flocks flew above 20 m more frequently in the section with the eagle model. In the non-migration area (the Coto Doñana National Park), more flocks and a higher proportion of raptors, waterfowl and corvids were seen in sections near the eagle model, compared with control sections (the Accipiter models were not tested in the park).
