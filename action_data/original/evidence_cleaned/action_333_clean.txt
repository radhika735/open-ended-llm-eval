333: Use shelterwood cutting instead of clearcutting
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Shelterwood cutting is a management technique designed to avoid clear-cutting, but to provide even-aged timber. It involves cutting trees in a series of cuttings, allowing new seedlings to grow from the seeds of older trees.
 

Key Messages:
A replicated study from the USA found that community composition of birds in shelterwood stands differed from other forestry practices, with some species more abundant and others less so.
 

Supporting Evidence:
A replicated study in 1993-1994 in mixed forests in the Missouri Ozarks, Missouri, USA (Annand & Thompson 1997), found that indigo bunting Passerina cyanea and field sparrow Spizella pusilla were more abundant in 12 shelterwood stands and in 12 clearcuts than in 22 stands under selective logging or 12 mature stands. Six species were more abundant in clearcuts than in shelterwood stands and six were more common in selectively-logged or mature stands.
