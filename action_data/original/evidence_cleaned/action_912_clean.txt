912: Use prescribed burning to control lantana <i>Lantana camara</i>
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Fire can be used as a management tool to control lantana Lantana camara invasions. Fire is considered a low cost method of control and may be used to clear lantana before further management actions, such as herbicide applications, are used (Day et al. 2003).
Lantana is included on the list of ‘100 of the world’s worst invasive alien species’ compiled by the IUCN Species Survival Commission Invasive Species Specialist Group (Lowe et al. 2000). It is classed as an alien invasive species in around 60 countries and its distribution continues to spread (Walton 2006). It is an evergreen shrub in the Verbenaceae family and can grow to a height of 2-5 m (Weber 2003). It has a strong root system and its fruits are dispersed by birds (Walton 2006). Lantana tolerates a wide range of ecological conditions and can rapidly colonize areas of disturbed ground and outcompete native vegetation (Day et al. 2003, Weber 2003). It is problematic in agricultural areas where it may outcompete pasture species, create dense thickets and poison livestock (Day et al. 2003).
Despite being highly invasive, there is evidence that patches of lantana may provide important shelter and food resources for some native bird species where they do not have access to their preferred natural habitat (Walton 2006). It can also provide important nectar resources for butterflies and moths (Day et al. 2003).

Key Messages:

One controlled study from Australia found lantana plants in a fire-treated area were smaller and less abundant than an unburned area. One randomized, replicated, controlled trial from India found burned lantana produced fewer new shoots than plants cut to ground level. One replicated site comparison from Australia found lantana in a forest burned every three years produced fewer fruits and seeds, had higher seedling mortality and slower growth rates but more flowering individuals than plants in other lantana-invaded habitats managed by grazing or mechanical control.
One randomized, replicated, controlled greenhouse trial in India found more lantana seeds germinated and germination rates were higher when seeds were exposed to smoke than seeds not exposed to smoke.
One randomized, replicated, controlled trial from Australia found two native tree species had higher germination and seedling survival when lantana was burned.

 

Supporting Evidence:
A controlled study in a grassy eucalypt forest between 1978 and 1993 in Queensland, Australia (Russell & Roberts 1996) compared an area burned four times with an unburned area and found that after the 14 year study period the density of lantana Lantana camara was lower in the burned area than the unburned area 19% vs. 28%. In the thirteen previous years, lantana density had been low and similar in the two areas. Lantana plants were smaller in the burned area than the unburned area. The larger lantana plants in the unburned area provided shelter for lantana seedlings, which increased the overall density of lantana. Plant diversity was generally similar between burned and unburned plots. A 21 ha area of Sydney blue gum Eucalyptus saligna and blackbutt E. pilularis forest was studied. One half was burned four times over the 14 years. A 350 m transect with seventy 10 m² quadrats was established in the burned area and a 275 m transect with 55 quadrats in the unburned area.  Plant cover and density were recorded seven times over the study period.
A randomized, replicated, controlled trial at two sites in New South Wales, Australia (Gentle & Duggin 1997) studied two native tree species Cryptocarya rigida and Alectryon subcinereus and found higher germination and seedling survival when lantana Lantana camara was burned or removed completely. More C. rigida and A. subcinereus seeds germinated when lantana was burned (68-72% seeds germinated) or uprooted (67-83%) than when the upper branches were clipped (63-67%). More tree seedlings survived when lantana was burned (warm temperate rainforest: 86-89% survival, wet sclerophyll forest: 84-91%) or uprooted (89-90% and 93-97%) than clipped (83-84% and 76-80%). Seedlings were heavier in burned (warm temperate: 2.5-2.7 g/plant, wet sclerophyll: 2.3-2.7) or uprooted (2.7-2.9 g/plant and 2.5-3.1) than clipped plots (2.1-2.3 g/plant and 2.1-2.5). There were three lantana treatments: upper branches cut and left on soil surface, all branches cut and material burned, and all branches and roots removed (uprooting). Litter in the uprooting treatment was replaced with peat moss and activated charcoal to remove lantana toxins. There were two blocks in warm temperate rainforest and two in wet sclerophyll forest at each site, each with nine 2 m² plots. Fifty A. subcinereus or C. rigida seeds/plot were sown after lantana management.
A replicated, randomized, controlled trial assessing the effectiveness of traditional lantana Lantana camara management techniques in 2005 in the Corbett Tiger Reserve, India (Babu et al. 2009) found that burned lantana plants produced more shoots at the base of the plant (average 43 shoots) than control plants (2 shoots) or plants that had the top 25% of the plant removed (13 shoots) but not more than plants that had been cut from the base (62 shoots). There were four treatments in two 2 ha plots: cutting the top 25% of the plant (at about 1.5 m above ground), cutting to the base of the plant, burning and a control of no management. Twenty-five plants were subject to the different management types.
A randomized, replicated, controlled greenhouse trial in Varanasi, India (Raizada & Raghubanshi 2010) found more lantana Lantana camara seeds germinated when they were exposed to smoke (approximately 21 out of 100 seeds germinated) than un-smoked seeds (16 seeds germinated). Seeds exposed to smoke also germinated much earlier (germination began after approximately 18 days) than non-smoked seeds (approximately 74 days). Smoked seeds also germinated faster (0.0145 vs. 0.055 germination velocity index) and had a higher seedling vigour index (average percentage of seeds germinated and average seedling length after 10 days) (approximately 185 vs. 150 vigour index) compared to non-smoked seeds. Seeds were collected from approximately 50 plants. Seeds were de-pulped and surface sterilized in sodium hypochlorite. Seeds were either placed on smoke-fumigated or non-fumigated filter paper on plastic trays to germinate (100 seeds/tray with three replicates). The filter paper had been exposed to smoke from burning forest litter.
A replicated site comparison study in 2005-2008 in Queensland, Australia (Osunkoya et al. 2012) found that lantana Lantana camara plants in a eucalypt forest burned every three years produced fewer fruits  (1,049 fruits/plant) than plants on grazed farmland (7,409), grazed eucalypt forest (1,321) or a hoop pine Araucaria cunninghamii plantation where lantana had been mechanically removed (1,487). In year two the burned forest had the fewest new lantana plants (1 new plant/100 m²), followed by grazed farmland (3), cattle-grazed forest (23) and hoop pine plantation (60). In the third year the grazed forest had the most new plants (9 new plants/100 m²) followed by grazed farmland (3) and burned forest (1). Highest lantana mortality was in the burned forest (0.3-19.4% mortality) followed by the farm (0.5-2.4%) and grazed forest (0.4%). The plantation with mechanical lantana control had no plant mortality in 2009 and no data in 2010. Lantana abundance increased on the farm and the grazed forest. In the burned forest abundance increased from 24.1 to 24.8 plants/100 m² in 2008-2009 and decreased to 21.8 in 2010. There was one 1,500-2,500 m² plot /site: cattle-grazed plot on a farm, hoop pine plantation cleared mechanically once in 20 years, open eucalypt forest burned in 2006 and 2009 and cattle-grazed eucalypt forest. All lantana plants &gt;10 cm high were marked and height and crown size recorded annually.
A replicated site comparison from 2008 to 2010 in Queensland, Australia (Osunkoya et al. 2013a) (same study as (Osunkoya et al. 2012, Osunkoya et al. 2013b)) found that in the first year there were more lantana Lantana camara seeds in soil collected from cattle-grazed farmland (approximately 3,800 seeds/m²) and a grazed eucalypt forest (4,400 seeds) than burned eucalypt forest (359 seeds) and hoop pine Araucaria cunninghamii plantation (mechanically cleared every 20 years) (10 seeds). In the first year, the burned eucalypt forest had the highest proportion of seeds germinating (36%) followed by the hoop pine plantation (31%), grazed forest (24%) and grazed farmland (18%). After two years, seedling survival was lowest on grazed farmland (42%) followed by burned forest (54%), grazed forest (77%) and hoop pine plantation (88%). Relative growth rates were lowest in the burned forest (approximately 0.6 cm/cm/year) followed by grazed farmland (1.0), grazed forest (1.2) and hoop pine plantation (1.8). The methodology follows (Osunkoya et al. 2012) with additional seed collection from 5-10 plants/site in 2008-2010 for germination in the greenhouse. In 2008 seeds from 10 plants were put in mesh bags and buried 5-10 cm deep in plots, five bags were removed every 12 months and tested for germination. Ten soil samples/plot were taken yearly and lantana seeds counted and grown in the greenhouse.
A replicated site comparison from 2008 to 2011 in Queensland, Australia (Osunkoya et al. 2013b) (same study as (Osunkoya et al. 2012, Osunkoya et al. 2013a)) found lantana Lantana camara recruitment was lowest in a eucalypt forest burned every three years (1.0 plants/100 m²), followed by cattle-grazed farmland (2.7), grazed forest (12.7) and a hoop pine Araucaria cunninghamii plantation cleared of lantana using machinery every 20 years (78.2). The maximum proportion of lantana plants flowering was found in the burned forest (0.9 flowering), followed by the grazed farmland (0.9), grazed forest (0.8) and the hoop pine plantation (0.6). The proportion of plants fruiting was highest in the grazed forest (0.9) followed by the grazed farmland (0.8), burned forest (0.8) and hoop pine plantation (0.4). There were four sites: a cattle-grazed area of fodder grass Pennisetum clandestinum, a hoop pine plantation, an open eucalypt forest burned every three years (in 2006 and 2009) and an open eucalypt forest with no fire regime but occasionally cattle grazed. Sampling was carried out using the same methodology as in (Osunkoya et al. 2012).
