3403: Sow seeds of tree species in savanna
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Savanna habitats consist of a mixture of grassland and woodland habitats in which trees do not form a closed canopy. Trees are cleared in many savanna areas often to increase the quality of pasture for livestock. Sowing seeds of tree species may help to increase tree abundance.

Key Messages:

One study examined the effects of sowing seeds of tree species in savanna on grassland vegetation. The study was in Brazil.

Germination/Emergence (1 study): One replicated study in Brazil found that sowing tree seeds in savanna resulted in germination of 52% of the tree seeds.
Survival (1 study): One replicated study in Brazil found that after sowing tree seeds in savanna, 35% of the seeds produced seedlings that survived for more than two years.


Supporting Evidence:
A replicated study in 2010–2012 in an arable field in Brazil (Silva et al. 2015) found that over half of tree seeds sown germinated but fewer than half of seeds resulted in trees which survived for more than two years. After 42 days, 3,200 of the 6,180 tree seeds sown had germinated. After 780 days, 2,144 seedlings of the 3,200 that had germinated were alive. In November 2010, tree seeds of six species were sown in rows one metre apart resulting in 6,180 sown seeds. Seedling germination and survival was recorded for each plant after 42, 84, 126, 217, 398 and 780 days. This experiment was also part of a study testing the effect of fertilizer and plant cover on seedling germination and growth.
