479: Provide artificial nesting sites for grebes
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Like divers/loons, grebes are highly specialised for swimming and diving and are therefore vulnerable on land. Providing artificial islands or floating rafts may increase both the number of birds nesting at a site, and their reproductive success.
 

Key Messages:
A single study from the UK found that grebes used nesting rafts in some areas of the UK but not others, and that the characteristics of used rafts differed geographically.
 

Supporting Evidence:
A 1992 review of the use of artificial islands and floating platforms in 17 wetland nature reserves across the UK (Burgess & Hirons 1992) found that great-crested grebes Podiceps cristatus and little grebes Tachybaptus ruficollis used well-vegetated islands and platforms at inland sites in the south of the UK. In addition, great-crested grebes used sparsely covered islands and platforms at inland sites, and well-vegetated ones at coastal sites. Neither species used either type of nesting site in Scotland. The review also examines island and platform use by divers, rails, ground-nesting seabirds, waders and wildfowl.
