117: Provide other resources for birds (water, sand for bathing)
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:

This intervention involves providing supplementary resources, other than food, for birds on farmland. These resources can include water, or sand for bathing.
See also ‘Provide supplementary food for birds or mammals’ for studies that investigate the effects of providing supplementary food.

 

Key Messages:

A small study in France found that grey partridge density was higher in areas where a combination of supplementary food, water, shelter and sand for bathing were provided.

 

Supporting Evidence:
A small study of feeding as a management option for grey partridges Perdix perdix at an arable farm in France (Westerskov 1977) found that partridge density was higher in an area with ‘partridge cafeterias’, than the area without. In spring 1973 the population on the 424 ha farm was 71 pairs (1 pair/6 ha) and four single birds. In spring 1974, a total of 48 pairs (1 pair/4.7 ha) and four single birds were recorded in the southern section (224 ha), where 27 partridge cafeterias had been constructed. The northern section (200 ha), with no cafeterias, had 24 pairs (1 pair/8.3 ha). Cafeterias comprised a barrel with a feed mixture (grain and weed seeds), a mini-midden to provide maggots and insects and a sand-bath, sheltered by a leaning roof that collected rainwater in a drinking trough. Stoats Mustela erminea and mice Mus spp. were also controlled with traps at the ‘cafeterias’. Small shrubs were planted next to cafeterias to provide shelter. Where possible they were placed one/territory.
