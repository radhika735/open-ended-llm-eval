198: Take field corners out of management
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Field corners can be taken out of management on both arable and livestock farms. This can either involve simply not managing or planting corners with grass (see also ‘Plant grass buffer strips’).
 

Key Messages:
A replicated study in the UK found that overwinter survival of grey partridge Perdix perdix was higher where field corners were taken out of management than on other sites for one of three winters. There was no relationship with the intervention and brood size, the ratio of young to old birds or density changes.
 

Supporting Evidence:
A replicated site comparison study on 1,031 agricultural sites across England in 2004-8 (Ewald et al. 2010) found that grey partridge Perdix perdix overwinter survival was positively correlated with taking field corners out of management, significantly so in 2007-8. There were no relationships with brood size, the ratio of young to old birds or year-on-year density changes. This study describes the effects of several other interventions, discussed in the relevant sections.
