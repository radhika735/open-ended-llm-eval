230: Maintain upland heath/moor
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Unpland heath and moorland is maintained through unenclosed upland grazing. This intervention includes grazing on acid grassland, dry and wet upland heath.
 

Key Messages:
A literature review from the UK found that agri-environment guidelines on moorland grazing were leading to increased bird populations in one region. There were localised problems with overgrazing, burning and scrub encroachment.
 

Supporting Evidence:
A 2009 literature review of agri-environment schemes in England (Natural England 2009) found studies that concluded that Environmentally Sensitive Area management prescriptions were having positive effects on moorland bird populations in Dartmoor Environmentally Sensitive Areas, UK. However, a study warned that localised problems such as overgrazing, burning or scrub encroachment were negatively affecting species such as tree pipit Anthus trivialis, whinchat Saxicola rubetra and ring ouzel Turdus torquatus. This review also examines several other interventions, discussed in the relevant sections.
