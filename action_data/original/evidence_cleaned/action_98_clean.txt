98: Make selective use of spring herbicides
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:


This intervention aims to reduce herbicide inputs in fields which do not contain undesirable weed species. It involves not applying an autumn herbicide and reducing spring herbicide applications to a single treatment of a selective herbicide. Reducing spring herbicide treatment to a single application may allow a diverse weed community to develop.



Key Messages:
A replicated, controlled, randomized study in the UK found that spring herbicides had some benefits for beneficial weeds and arthropods.
 

Supporting Evidence:
A replicated, controlled, randomized study from 2003 to 2005 of arable fields at three sites in the UK (Jones & Smith 2007) found that spring herbicides had some benefits for beneficial weeds and arthropods. Species richness and cover of beneficial weeds tended to be higher with single spring or post-emergence herbicide applications than pre-emergence or combinations of applications; figures were lowest in plots with three annual applications. Cover of undesirable weeds was higher in single spring or pre-emergence applications than combined treatments. Single applications tended to reduce arthropod abundance less than sequences of herbicides, although post-emergence and pre-emergence applications were detrimental to some taxa. There were three or five replicate plots (3 or 4 x 24 m) of each treatment per site: untreated, pre-emergence, post-emergence or spring applications or combinations of each two/all herbicide applications. Vegetation was sampled in five quadrats (0.25 m²) in each plot (June 2003-2005). Arthropods were sampled using a D-Vac suction sampler (five sub-samples of 10s/plot) in a sub-set of treatments (June).
