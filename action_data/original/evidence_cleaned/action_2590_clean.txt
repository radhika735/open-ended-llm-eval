2590: Install barrier fencing along railways
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Collisions with trains can cause substantial numbers of mammal deaths (e.g. Gundersen & Andreassen 1998). Barrier fencing alongside railways may reduce access to railway tracks by mammals and, thus, reduce the number of mammal-train collisions.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on mammals of installing barrier fencing along railways. This study was in Norway.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Survival (1 study): A before-and-after study in Norway found that fencing eliminated moose collisions with trains, except at the fence end.

BEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)

Supporting Evidence:
A before-and-after study in 1985–2003 in forest in southern Norway (Andreassen et al. 2005) found that 1 km of fencing eliminated moose Alces alces collisions with trains along that stretch. The exception was one killed at the fence end. Within the wider study area, there were 0.58 moose/km killed each winter during the study period. In 1995, a 1-km-long wire-mesh fence was erected alongside a railway line. Moose-train collisions along a 100-km stretch of the railway line were recorded from July 1985–April 2003.
