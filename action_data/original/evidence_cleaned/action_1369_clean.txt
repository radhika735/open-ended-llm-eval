Supporting Evidence:
A replicated, controlled study in 1996–1998 in an irrigated tomato field in the San Joaquin Valley, California, USA (same study as (2)), found more soil carbon and earthworms in plots with winter cover crops and no tillage, compared to plots with bare soil in winter and conventional tillage in spring. Organic matter: More soil carbon was found in plots with no tillage, compared to tillage (0.66–0.72% vs 0.62% carbon, 0–0.6 inches depth). Soil organisms: More earthworms were found in plots with no tillage, compared to tillage (2.1 vs 0.6 earthworms/square foot). Methods: There were 12 plots (4.5 x 27.5 m plots) for each of two treatments (two grass-legume mixtures as winter cover crops, sown in October 1996–1997, killed and retained as mulch, with no tillage, in March 1997–1998) and there were 12 control plots (bare-soil fallow in winter, with herbicide, and conventional tillage in spring). Soil carbon was sampled in September 1998 (eight subsamples/plot, 0–0.6 inches depth). Earthworms were sampled in March 1998 (two cylinders/plot, 16.5 inches diameter, 6 inches depth, sprinkled with mustard powder so that earthworms would come to the surface). It was not clear whether these results were a direct effect of cover crops or tillage. 
A replicated, controlled study in 1996–1998 in an irrigated tomato field in the San Joaquin Valley, California, USA (same study as (1)), found less nitrate in winter and spring, but more nitrate in summer, in plots with winter cover crops (and no tillage in spring), compared to plots with winter fallows (and tillage in spring). Nutrients: Less nitrate was found in plots with cover crops, compared to fallows, when measured in winter or spring (19 of 32 comparisons: 0.9–4.1 vs 3.8–7.9 ppm, 0–30 cm depth), but more nitrate was found when measured in summer (27 of 32 comparisons: 21–41 vs 8–14 ppm, 0–30 cm depth). Methods: There were 12 plots (4.5 x 27.5 m plots) for each of four treatments (two grass-legume mixtures, or two legumes without grasses, as winter cover crops, sown in October 1996–1997, killed and retained as mulch, with no tillage, in March 1997–1998) and each of two controls (bare-soil fallows in winter, with or without herbicide, and conventional tillage in spring). Tomato seedlings were transplanted in April 1997–1998. The tomatoes were irrigated (two inches/week) and fertilized (0, 100, or 200 lb N/acre, in March 1997 and May 1998). Soil nitrate was sampled four times in 1998 (0–30 cm depth, three samples/plot). It was not clear whether these results were a direct effect of cover crops or tillage. 
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 1983–1996 in a rainfed wheat field in the Henares river valley, Spain, found that tillage had inconsistent effects on soil stability. Soil erosion and aggregation: Lower soil stability was found in plots with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in one of four comparisons (1–2 mm pre-wetted soil aggregates: 76.3% vs 78.4% water stable), but higher stability was found in two of four comparisons (1–2 mm air-dried soil aggregates: 11% vs 2.9% water stable; 4.38 mm air-dried soil aggregates: 12% vs 1%). Methods: No tillage or conventional tillage was used on four plots each. Each plot had two subplots (20 x 30 m, with or without crop rotation). A mouldboard plough (30 cm depth, in autumn) and a tine cultivator (10–15 cm depth, two passes, in spring) were used for conventional tillage. A seed drill and pre-emergence herbicide were used for no tillage. Fertilizer and post-emergence herbicide were used on all plots. Soil samples were collected in June or July 1996 (0–30 cm, four samples/subplot). 
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 1996–1999 in three rainfed barley fields in the Ebro river valley, Spain (same study as (17,23,24,26)), found less nitrogen in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage. Nutrients: Less nitrogen was found in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in three of nine comparisons (82–165 vs 104–247 kg/ha). Methods: No tillage or conventional tillage was used on 27 plots each (50 x 6 m plots). A mouldboard plough (25–30 cm depth) and a cultivator (15 cm depth, 1–2 passes) were used for conventional tillage, in August–September. Herbicide was used for no tillage. Two-thirds of the plots were fertilized (50–75 or 100–150 kg N/ha). Barley was sown, with a seed drill, in October–November. Soil samples were collected four times/year (0–50 cm in two of three fields, 0–100 cm in one field, two soil cores/plot). 
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 2003–2005 on rainfed farms in the Ebro river valley, Spain (same study as (10)), found less greenhouse gas in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage. Greenhouse gases: Less carbon dioxide was found in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in 18 of 39 comparisons, in the two days after tillage (0.1–2.3 vs 0.1–13.3 g CO2/m2/hour). Methods: No tillage or conventional tillage was used on ten plots each (33–50 x 7–10 m plots), on a total of three farms, with multiple crops. A mouldboard or subsoil plough was used on plots with conventional tillage (25–40 cm depth). Herbicide was used on plots with no tillage. Carbon dioxide was measured with a dynamic chamber (21 cm diameter, 900 mL airflow/minute, two samples/plot), 4–6 times in the 48 hours after tillage. 
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 1993–1997 in a rainfed barley field near Madrid, Spain (same study as (19,37,39)), found more organic matter, phosphorus, and potassium in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage, but tillage had inconsistent effects on nitrogen. Organic matter: More organic carbon was found in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in six of eight comparisons (8–11 vs 4–6 Mg/ha), but less was found in one of eight comparisons (6 vs 7 Mg/ha). Nutrients: More nitrogen was found in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in six of eight comparisons (0.7–1.4 vs 0.4–0.9 Mg total N/ha), but less was found in one of eight comparisons (0.5 vs 0.6 Mg/ha). More potassium and phosphorus were found in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in two of four comparisons (in 1997: 13–17 vs 7–8 kg extractable P/ha; 250–310 vs 150–190 kg extractable K/ha). Similar pH was found in soils with no tillage or conventional tillage (pH 7.8). Methods: No tillage or conventional tillage was used on four plots each (five 10 x 25 m subplots/plot, with barley monocultures or barley rotations). A mouldboard plough (30 cm depth) and a cultivator (10–15 cm depth, when needed for weed control) were used for conventional tillage. Pre-emergence herbicide was used for no tillage. The barley was fertilized (NPK: 200 kg/ha; ammonium nitrate: 200 kg/ha). Soil samples were collected after the harvest in 1994–1997 (0–90 cm depth; organic matter and nitrogen were assessed at 0–30 cm depth).

Tillage had inconsistent effects on potassium. Organic matter: More carbon was found in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in one of two comparisons (in rotations with fallows: 4 vs 3.8 kg total C/m2). Nutrients: Similar amounts of nitrogen were found in plots with no tillage or conventional tillage (450–460 g total N/m2). More potassium was found in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in two of six comparisons (10.3–12.9 vs 6–7.7 mg K/litre), but less was found in one of twelve comparisons (4.8 vs 6.3 mg/L). More phosphorous was found in plots with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in one of six comparisons (27 vs 19 mg P/kg soil). Similar pH levels were found in soils with no tillage or conventional tillage (pH 6.8–7.3). Soil organisms: Similar amounts of microbial and nematode biomass (both measured as carbon) were found in plots with no tillage or conventional tillage (60–80 vs 60 g microbial C/m2; 0.1–0.2 vs 0.2–0.25 g nematode C/m2). Methods: No tillage or conventional tillage was used on six plots each (67 x 4.7 m plots, three beds/plot). Crop residues were incorporated to 20 cm depth, and the beds were shaped, on plots with conventional tillage (disk, lister, and ring roller). Crop residues were flail mown and spread on the plots with no tillage. All plots were fertilized in 2003, but not thereafter (112 kg P/ha phosphorous, 50 kg NPK/ha, and 67 kg N/ha). Cultivation was used to control weeds on plots with conventional tillage. Hand weeding was used on plots with no tillage. Herbicide was used on all plots. Some plots were irrigated. Soil samples were collected in December 2003, and June, September, and December 2004 (0–30 cm depth, three samples/plot).

Soil erosion and aggregation: Lower stability was found in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in two of nine comparisons (0–10 cm depth, in 2002: 31–35% vs 48–58% of aggregates were stable), but higher stability was found in two of nine comparisons (0–10 cm depth, in 2004: 61–69% vs 41–58%). Soil organisms: More microorganisms were found in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in one of three years (0–5 cm depth, in 2004: 437 vs 261 colony forming units/g dry soil). Methods: Conventional tillage or no tillage was used on four plots each (20 x 10 m plots). A mouldboard plough (0–30 cm depth, in October 2001–2003 and March and April 2002–2004) was used for conventional tillage, and maize residues were burned in September–October 2002–2004. Herbicide was used for no tillage (April and May–June 2002–2004), and maize residues were not burned. For organic carbon, nitrogen, and aggregate stability, soil samples were collected in March, June, and October 2002–2004 (three samples/plot, 0–30 cm depth). For microorganisms, soils samples were collected every two months (0–5 cm depth). It was not clear whether these results were a direct effect of tillage or residue burning.

More large water-stable aggregates were also found in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in four of six comparisons (in Peñaflor, 0–10 cm depth, water-stable aggregates &gt;2,000 µm: 0.08–0.15 vs 0.01–0.03 g aggregate/g soil). Methods: No tillage or conventional tillage was used on six plots each (three in Selvanera, 7 x 50 m each; three in Peñaflor, 10 x 33 m each). Herbicide was used for no tillage. In Selvanera, a subsoil plough (50 cm depth) and a cultivator (15 cm depth) were used for conventional tillage. In Peñaflor, a mouldboard plough was used for conventional tillage (30–35 cm depth).

Methods: Earthworms were collected from 11 tomato fields (four fields that were tilled, incorporating the tomato residues into the soil, and seven fields that were not tilled, retaining the tomato residues as mulch), in three 30 cm3 soil pits/field, in February–April 2005. Organic matter and nutrients were measured in horizontal soil cores, collected from the walls of the soil pits (0–15 cm length). All fields were tilled in 2004, after the tomatoes were harvested. All fields were fertilized and irrigated.

Organic matter: More organic carbon was found in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in two of five comparisons (772–815 vs 684–699 g/m2). Nutrients: More nitrogen was found in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in 10 of 20 comparisons (50–180 vs 30–150 g total N/m2). Methods: No tillage or conventional tillage was used on three plots each (five subplots/plot, 10 x 5 m subplots, with different wheat rotations). Mouldboard ploughing, disk harrowing, and/or vibrating tine cultivation was used for conventional tillage (depth not reported). Pre-emergence herbicide was used for no tillage. The wheat phase was fertilized with nitrogen in some sub-subplots (0–150 kg N/ha/year) and phosphorus in all plots (65 kg P/ha/year). Crop residues were retained. Soil samples were collected in October 2008 (0–50 cm depth), before tilling the soil and sowing wheat.

Carbon dioxide was measured with an open chamber (21 cm diameter, 900 mL airflow/minute, 2 samples/plot/day, every 7–14 days, in 2006–2009). 
A meta-analysis in 2013 of studies from multiple Mediterranean countries found a higher percentage of organic matter in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage. Organic matter: A higher percentage of organic carbon was found in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage (in herbaceous crops: 18% higher). Methods: No tillage included herbicide use. The Web of Knowledge database was searched, using the keywords, “Mediterranean”, “soil”, and “conventional”, and 33 data sets from 21 studies of no tillage were found and meta-analysed. The most recent studies included in this meta-analysis were published in 2011. 
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 1996–2008 in a rainfed barley field in the Ebro river Valley, Spain (same study as (4,17,23,24,26)), found more organic matter and more soil organisms in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage. Organic matter: More organic carbon was found in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage (9.25 vs 7.39 g C/kg dry soil). Soil organisms: More microbial biomass (measured as carbon) was found in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage (295 vs 231 mg C/kg dry soil). Methods: There were nine plots (50 x 6 m) for each of two tillage treatments (no tillage: pre-emergence herbicide; conventional tillage: mouldboard plough, 25–30 cm depth). Plots were tilled in October or November. Soils samples were collected in October 2008 (before tillage, three soil cores/plot, 4 cm diameter, 0–50 cm depth).

Nutrients: Less nitrate was found in plots with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage (104 vs 112 kg NO3-N/ha). Methods: No tillage or conventional tillage was used on three plots each (10 x 5 m plots). A mouldboard plough, a disk harrow, and/or a vibrating tine cultivator were used for conventional tillage (depth not reported). A seed drill and pre-emergence herbicide was used for no tillage. Post-emergence herbicide was used on some subplots (which had different wheat rotations), and some subplots were fertilized (0–150 kg N/ha/year). Soil samples were collected before sowing (Eijkelkamp auger, three samples/plot, 0–90 cm depth), in 1993–2010. 
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 2008–2010 in a rainfed wheat-vetch field in southwest Spain (same study as (22)) found more organic matter, soil organisms, and aggregation in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage.

Soil organisms: More microbial biomass (measured as carbon) was found in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in three of five comparisons (in smaller soil aggregates with diameters of 1–2, 0.25–0.5, or &lt;0.5 mm: 504–549 vs 341–346 mg C/kg soil). Soil erosion and aggregation: More large aggregates were found in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage (2–5 mm macroaggregates: 31% vs 24% of soil weight), and fewer smaller aggregates were found, in two of four comparisons (0.5–1 mm aggregates: 21% vs 26% of soil weight). Methods: No tillage or conventional tillage was used on three plots each (300 m2 plots), in 2008–2009. In 1999–2008, no tillage was used on all plots. A mouldboard plough (25 cm depth, in 2008), or a chisel plough (10–15 cm depth, in 2009), and a disk harrow were used for conventional tillage, and crop residues were removed (in 2008 and 2010). A seed drill and herbicide were used for no tillage, and crop residues were retained. Soil samples were collected in October 2010 (0–10 cm depth, five samples/plot). It was not clear whether these results were a direct effect of tillage or residue removal. 
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 1990–2010 in a winter cereal field in the Ebro river valley, Spain, found more organic matter and greater stability in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage. The most organic matter and the greatest stability were found in soils with 11–20 years of no tillage. Organic matter: More organic carbon was found in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in three of sixteen comparisons (0–5 cm depth: 17–24 vs 12 g C/kg soil). Soil erosion and aggregation: More water-stable macroaggregates (0.25–8 mm diameter) and fewer water-stable microaggregates (0.053–0.25 mm diameter) were found in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage (macroaggregates, in eight of 32 comparisons, 0–10 cm depth: 0.12–0.32 vs 0.02–0.04 g aggregate/g dry soil; microaggregates, in six of 16 comparisons, 0–10 cm depth: 0.25–0.41 vs 0.44–0.50). More large, dry macroaggregates (2–8 mm diameter) were found in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in three of 16 comparisons (10–20 cm depth: 0.52–0.56 vs 0.38–0.40 g aggregate/g dry soil).

More large, water-stable macroaggregates (2–8 mm diameter) were found in soils with 11–20 years of no tillage, compared to 1–4 years, at one of four depths (0–5 cm depth: 0.30–0.32 vs 0.02–0.12 g aggregate/g dry soil). More small, water-stable macroaggregates were found in soils with 4–20 years of no tillage, compared to one year, at one of four depths (0–5 cm depth: 0.13–0.16 vs 0.04 g aggregate/g dry soil). More large, dry macroaggregates (2–8 mm diameter) and fewer small macroaggregates (0.25–2 mm diameter) were found in soils with 4–20 years of no tillage, compared to 0–1 year, at one of four depths (10–20 cm depth: large: 0.52–0.56 vs 0.38–0.40 g aggregate/g dry soil; small: 0.30–0.32 vs 0.39–0.41). Methods: No tillage was used on four plots for 1–20 years (beginning in 1990, 1999, 2006, and 2009). Conventional tillage was used on the same four plots, before no tillage began, and also on one control plot for 20 years (1990–2010). Plots were 1,500 m2. Soil samples were collected in July 2010 with a flat spade (0–30 cm depth). 
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 2009–2012 in two irrigated vegetable fields in central Italy found more nitrogen in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage. Nutrients: More nitrate was found in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in three of 12 comparisons (in plots with hairy vetch as a winter cover crop: 10–16 vs 6–12 mg NO3-N/kg dry soil), and more ammonium was found in one of 12 comparisons (in plots with hairy vetch as a winter cover crop: 9 vs 4 mg NH4-N/kg dry soil). Methods: No tillage or conventional tillage was used on nine plots each (6 x 4 m plots). Each plot had a winter cover crop (hairy vetch, oats, or oilseed rape). Cover crops were sown in September 2009–2010 and suppressed in May 2010–2011. A mouldboard plough and a disk harrow (two passes) were used for conventional tillage (incorporating the cover crop residues to 30 cm depth). The cover crop residues were gathered into strips of mulch (50 cm wide, along crop rows) in plots with no tillage. Pepper seedlings were transplanted into these plots in May 2010–2011 and were last harvested in October 2010 and September 2011. After the pepper harvest, endive and savoy cabbage seedlings were transplanted into these plots, and they were harvested in December 2010 and November 2011 (endive) or March 2011 and February 2012 (cabbage). No fertilizer was added while the crops were growing, but the plots were irrigated. Nutrients were measured in soil samples (10 samples/plot, 0–30 cm depth, when these crops were harvested). It was not clear whether these results were a direct effect of tillage or mulch.

Methods: No tillage or conventional tillage was used on three plots each, in each of two fields (2010–2013 in the short-term field, and 1996–2013 in the long-term field; plots size not clearly reported). A mouldboard plough (25 cm depth) and a cultivator (15 cm depth) were used for conventional tillage in the long-term field, and a chisel plough was used in the short-term field (depth not reported), in September–October. For no tillage, the residues were chopped and spread, and pre-emergence herbicide was used. Some plots were fertilized (0–150 kg N/ha). Soil samples were collected in June 2013 in the short-term field (0–75 cm depth). Greenhouse-gas samples were collected every 2–3 weeks in 2011–2013, in the long-term field, and 2011–2012 in the short-term field (closed chambers, 15 mL samples, 0, 30, and 60 minutes after closing).

Organic matter: More organic carbon was found in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage (30.2 vs 11.2 mg dissolved organic C/kg soil). Nutrients: Similar amounts of nitrate and ammonium were found in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage (1–18 mg NO3-N/ha; 0.2–3.5 mg NH4-N/kg). Soil organisms: More microbial biomass (measured as carbon) was found in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage (304 vs 94 mg C/kg soil), but there were similar amounts of bacteria (denitrifying bacteria: 106 gene copies). Greenhouse gases: Similar nitrous-oxide and methane emissions were found in soils with no tillage or conventional tillage (0.05 kg N2O-N/ha; –137 vs –231 g CH4-C/ha). Methods: No tillage or conventional tillage was used on three plots each (10 x 25 m). A mouldboard plough and a cultivator were used for conventional tillage (20 cm depth) in October. A seed drill and herbicide were used for no tillage. Soil and greenhouse-gas samples were collected 1–12 times/month, in November 2010–October 2011 (soil cores: 0–15 cm depth, 2.5 cm diameter; closed chambers: 19.3 cm height, 35.6 cm diameter, 20 mL gas samples, 0–60 minutes after closing). 
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 2009–2011 in an irrigated eggplant field in central Italy found more nitrogen in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage. Nutrients: More nitrogen was found in soils with no tillage, compared to conventional tillage, in one of four comparisons (37 vs 24 mg inorganic N/kg dry soil). Methods: A mouldboard plough (30 cm depth) was used on all plots in autumn, before winter cover crops were planted. Cover crops were mown or chopped in spring, before tillage. No tillage or conventional tillage was used on 12 plots each (6 x 4 m plots). A mouldboard plough (30 cm depth) and a disk (two passes) were used for conventional tillage (which incorporated the cover crop residues into the soil). Cover crop residues were mulched and herbicide was used for no tillage. Eggplant seedlings were transplanted into the plots in May, and fruits were harvested four times/year in July–September 2010–2011. Soil samples were collected when the seedlings were transplanted and when the last fruits were harvested each year (0–30 cm depth, six samples/plot). All plots were fertilized before the cover crops were grown, but not after. All plots were irrigated. It was not clear whether these results were a direct effect of cover crops or tillage.
