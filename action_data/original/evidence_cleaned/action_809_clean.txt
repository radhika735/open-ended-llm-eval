809: Create microclimate and microhabitat refuges
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Refuge habitats can provide amphibians with microclimates that they require to keep them at the correct temperature and humidity, protecting them from extreme temperatures and dehydration. Refuges, such as log piles, vegetation cover or ponds can be created for amphibians to help to reduce exposure to stressful conditions as a result of climate change.
 

Key Messages:

Studies investigating the effects of creating refuges are discussed in ‘Habitat restoration and creation’ and ‘Biological resource use – Leave coarse woody debris in forests’.
