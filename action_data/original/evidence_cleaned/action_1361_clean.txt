Key Messages:
Crop yield (1 study): One replicated, paired site comparison from the USA found similar crop yields in fields with hedgerows and fields with bare/weedy edges.

Supporting Evidence:
A replicated, paired site comparison in 2012–2013 in sunflower fields in the Central Valley, California, USA, found similar crop yields in fields with hedgerows and fields with bare/weedy edges. Crop yield: Similar numbers of sunflower seeds were found in fields with hedgerows and fields with bare/weedy edges (650 seeds/head). Methods: Seeds from three sunflower heads were counted at each of four locations/transect (10, 50, 100, and 200 m from field edges), on two transects/field (2012: 10 fields; 2013: 8 fields). Half of the fields had bare/weedy edges (managed by burning, scraping, or herbicides). Half had hedgerows (3–6 x 250–300 m, 5–12 years old).
