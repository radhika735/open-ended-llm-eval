1149: Apply insecticide to protect seedlings from invertebrates
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
 

Insecticides can be used to eliminate invertebrate herbivores and to help the establishment of planted trees.

 

Key Messages:

One randomized, replicated, controlled study in the USA found that applying insecticide increased tree seedling emergence and survival.

 
 
 

Supporting Evidence:
A randomized, replicated, controlled study in 1989–1990 in a former arable field, in New Jersey, USA (Facelli 1994) found that using insecticides increased the number of emerging tree of heaven Ailanthus altissima seedlings and seedling survival. Plots treated with insecticide had greater seedling emergence (approx. 13 seedlings/plot) than untreated plots (approx. 9 seedlings/plot). Additionally, seedling mortality was lower in plots treated with insecticide (approx. 3 %) than in untreated plots (approx. 7%). Sixteen plots (0.8 × 1 m) were treated with Carbaril dust 5%, dosed at 5 g active ingredient/m2. The other 16 plots were not treated with insecticide. In all plots, 20 seeds had been planted to ensure sufficient regeneration.
