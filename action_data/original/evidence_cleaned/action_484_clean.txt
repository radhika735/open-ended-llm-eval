Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:


Key Messages:
A replicated study in China found that an estimated 36–41% of the local population of Cabot’s tragopans Tragopan caboti used nesting platforms.
 

Supporting Evidence:
A replicated trial in subtropical conifer, deciduous and mixed forests in eastern China (Deng et al. 2005) found that a large percentage of female Cabot’s tragopans Tragopan caboti in the region used some of the 200 artificial nesting platforms erected at 11 sites in 2002-3 (12-16 platforms used, an estimated 36-41% of the local population). Platforms consisted of 30 cm diameter bowls (15 cm deep) made from bamboo strips and fixed to trees across a variety of habitats, with platforms more likely to be used if they were in areas of mixed forest and close to the edge of forest patches.
