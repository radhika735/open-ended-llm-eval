Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:


Key Messages:
Plants (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study from Spain found more plant species in plots with added manure, compared to plots without added manure, in one of three comparisons.

Supporting Evidence:
A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 1998–2001 in a wood pasture in Spain found more plant species in plots with added manure, compared to plots without added manure. Plants: More plant species were found in plots with added manure, compared to plots without added manure, in one of three comparisons (20 vs 17 species). Methods: Plots (1 x 1 m) had added manure (90 g in a 50 x 50 cm section of each plot) or no added manure (40 replicates each). Vegetation was sampled in spring 1998, 1999, and 2001 (20 x 20 cm quadrats). The vegetation consisted of Holm Oak Quercus ilex and dry annual grasses.
