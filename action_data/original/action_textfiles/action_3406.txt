After six years, plots sown with a high diversity local seed mix had on average a greater number and cover of target plant species (28 species, 83% cover) than plots sown with a low diversity non-local seed mix (12 species, 36% cover). In December 2004, three blocks were established on an unvegetated area (240 x 50 m) of boulder clay mixed with sand. In each block, one plot was sown with a high diversity mix of seeds from a local source (11 grass and 40 herb species, sown at 36 kg/ha), and one plot was sown with a low diversity mix of non-local seeds (three grass cultivars, sown at 100 kg/ha).

Four to seven years after seeding, sites sown with seed mixes containing a greater number of species had a higher species richness of sown plants (data reported as statistical model results). However, higher numbers of species in seed mixes did not lead to higher overall plant species richness (data reported as model results). Seeds were sown at all sites in 2004–2008 following removal of all vegetation with herbicide. Information on the seed mixes used were collected from the practitioner who oversaw the restoration projects. In July–September 2011, a 50-m transect was established at each site and a 1 x 1 m quadrat placed every 5 m on the transect.

Cover of seeded species did not differ significantly between areas sown with a high diversity seed mix (3–25 cm) and areas sown with a low diversity seed mix (3–33 cm). Cover of invasive plant species also showed no significant difference (0–1.4 cm vs 0–0.5 cm). Cover of unseeded species was lower in areas where a high diversity seed mix was sown (4–34 cm) than in areas where a low diversity seed mix was sown (12–33 cm). In March–April 2006, twelve 55 x 55 m plots were seeded with a high diversity seed mix containing 97 plant species, and twelve plots were seeded with a low diversity mix containing 15 plant species.
