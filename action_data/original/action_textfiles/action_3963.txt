        "background_definitions": "<p>Livestock prefer to eat different plants, and graze at different heights or in different patterns. For example, sheep graze to a uniform height, while cattle leave heavily trampled areas and eat grass in clumps, leaving patches of taller vegetation (Schultz <em>et al.</em> 2008). These grazing patterns encourage different vegetation communities to develop, with different plants dominating. Therefore, changing the type of livestock used to graze grassland may create differences in the butterfly and moth community, with individual species preferring the landscape created by particular grazers.</p>\r\n<p>This action includes studies comparing the use of different types of livestock alone.

There was no significant difference in the proportion of cattle-grazed (3/9), horse-grazed (2/6), sheep-grazed (0/2), unmanaged (4/8), burned (5/8 sites), and mown (0/1) sites that had &gt;20 caterpillar webs recorded. However, the three largest populations (&gt;200 caterpillar webs) were on sites burned in early spring. Caterpillar webs were present on 28/34 sites where adults had been recorded in May/June. In 1993, nine grasslands were cattle-grazed, six were horse-grazed, two were sheep-grazed, eight were unmanaged, eight were burned, and one was mown. Sites were separated by &gt;1 km of unoccupied grassland, or &gt;0.5 km of unsuitable habitat. From late August–mid-October 1993, caterpillar webs were surveyed on 34 fen grasslands. On sites &lt;2 ha, all devil’s bit scabious <em>Succisa pratensis</em> were searched in 2-m-wide parallel strips until the whole area had been searched. On larger sites, 2-m-wide strips at 10-m intervals were searched, and areas around caterpillar webs were then searched comprehensively.</p>",

Sites had a greater species richness of butterflies and burnet moths if they were currently grazed by horses (13 species) or cattle (12 species) compared to sites grazed by sheep (7 species), and were similar to sites with no grazing (12 species). From 1999–2003, twelve abandoned, semi-natural grasslands were restored by clearing trees and shrubs, erecting fences, and re-introducing grazing animals. Butterflies and burnet moths were surveyed using transects (150 m/ha) six or seven times in May–August 2003 or June–August 2004 on 12 restored grasslands, 12 continuously grazed semi-natural grasslands and 12 abandoned grasslands.

After a year and a half of grazing, the abundance of butterflies and moths was similar on plots grazed by cattle (2–7 individuals/plot), goats (3–7 individuals/plot) or sheep (3–6 individuals/plot), but was lower on all grazed plots than on ungrazed plots (6–22 individuals/plot). Nine 0.3-ha blocks were each divided into four fenced, 0.05-ha plots, 18–20 m apart, to which four grazing treatments were randomly assigned. From July 2007 and 2008, plots were either grazed by two cattle, eight goats, or eight sheep, or left ungrazed. Grazing was conducted for two hours each morning and evening, until 60% of forage was removed (10–15 days/month, number of months not given). From July–October 2008, insects were surveyed four times by walking two 25-m-long transects/plot, twice/day, and taking 15 sweeps/transect through the vegetation with a 40-cm diameter net.
