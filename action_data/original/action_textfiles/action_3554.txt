No statistical tests were carried out. No turtles were caught in lit gillnets, compared to 16 individuals in unlit gillnets (1 turtle/1,000 m net length/12 h). Five turtles died after being caught. Catch rates of commercially-targeted fish were similar between lit nets (15 individuals/1,000 m net length/12 h; 17 kg catch/1,000 m net length/12 hours) and unlit nets (14 individuals/1,000 m net length/12 hours soaking time; 17 kg catch/1,000 m net length/12 hours soak time). Data were collected in June–July 2015–2016 during 18 fishing trials. Fishing gear included bottom-set gillnets (average depth of deployment: 54 m) comprising connected netting panels (mesh size: 140 mm, panel length: 100 m, 3 m stretched drop). UV LED lights were positioned 15 m apart along the top line (‘floatline’) of some of the net panels (70 lights/km). Lit (3 km average net length) and unlit panels (1 km average net length) were randomly distributed along each net. A gap of 150 m was left between lit and unlit panels. Nets deployed from a single fishing vessel (18:00–06:00 h; average soak time: 15 hours). Catch of target, discard and unwanted species was monitored.</p>",
