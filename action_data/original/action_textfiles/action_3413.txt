No statistical analyses were carried out in this study. In seven of 12 comparisons, there were more grass species in plots where soil was rotovated and seeds sown (5–12 species/plot) than in plots where soil was harrowed and seeds sown (4–9 species/plot). In the five other comparisons, the number of grass species did not differ between plots that were rotovated or harrowed before sowing (both 8–13 species/plot). In all of 12 comparisons, there were more forb species in plots where soil was rotovated and seeds sown (7–25 species/plot) than in plots where soil was harrowed and seeds sown (3–21 species/plot). In 1994, at each site, eight 6 x 4 m plots were mown. In four plots/site, the soil was disturbed by rotovating (to give 50% bare ground), while the other four plots were harrowed. Seed mixes (five grass species and 18 forb species) were sown at a rate of 12–14 kg/ha in all plots in early August 1994. In May/June of 1995 and 1996, three 40 x 40 cm quadrats were placed in each plot and the frequency of each grass and forb species recorded.</p><p> </p>",

However, the proportion of planted forb seedlings showing aboveground growth did not differ significantly between disturbed and undisturbed plots (data not reported). In January 1993, five blocks, each with three 7.62 x 7.62 m plots, were established on grass verges.
