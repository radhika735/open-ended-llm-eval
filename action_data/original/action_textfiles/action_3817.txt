        "background_definitions": "<p>Restrictions on the number of permits or licences issued to fish in an area or fishery is often termed ‘limited entry’. This prevents the entry of new fishing vessels and/or fishers operating without vessels (fishing from shore for example), with the aim of controlling fishing effort and capacity of a fleet, and in turn reduce the effects of overfishing on fish populations. However, the effectiveness of permits/licences may depend partly on other mechanisms to prevent increases in capacity by other means, such as increases in vessel horsepower or size, gear changes or improvements or changes in fishing periods or areas (Ward <em>et al</em>. 2004).</p>\r\n<p>Ward J.M., Kirkley J.E., Metzner R. &amp; Pascoe S.
