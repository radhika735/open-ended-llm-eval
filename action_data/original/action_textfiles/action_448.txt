        "background_definitions": "<p class=\"Background\">Oil spills at sea can kill large numbers of seabirds and have the potential to wipe out entire populations where these are small or localised. Oil can stick to birds’ feathers, making them lose their water-proofing and potentially leading to hypothermia. When birds try to clean their feathers they ingest oil and are likely to become poisoned.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">Birds can be taken in and cleaned, but this is an expensive operation, with the cleaning operations after the Treasure oil spill in South Africa in 2000 costing an estimated $100/bird (Whittington 2003). In addition, whereas cleaning may prevent adults from dying, there is evidence that the offspring of rehabilitated birds have lower survival than normal (Barham et al. 2008). This means that the hand-rearing of offspring may be an important intervention after oil spills (Barham et al. 2008, see ‘Artificially incubate and hand-rear birds in captivity’).</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">In addition to the direct effects described in the studies below, one study (Ryan 2003) estimated that the population of African penguins <em>Spheniscus demersus</em> was 19% larger than it would have been without rehabilitation efforts (approximately 163,000 adults, compared to 137,000).</p>\r\n<p>Barham, P.J., Underhill, L.G., Crawford, R.J.M. &amp; Leshoro, T.M.

Hatching success did not differ between groups but the number of chicks produced/egg and fledging success were significantly lower among rehabilitated birds in 1995-6, especially for nests that had a rehabilitated female (with 22% lower fledging success), and laying date was also delayed (eggs in nests from early October for un-oiled birds, but first appeared on the 4 November for rehabilitated birds).

Between 40 and 87% of rehabilitated birds were recorded back at their breeding colonies after being released (with between 101 and 2,962 birds rehabilitated each time). The low number of birds  recorded for one spill (40% after four years) may have been due to penguins being found a long way from their colonies and therefore released in an inappropriate place (72% of birds that were seen were recorded at a different colony).

Productivity of these birds was no different from un-oiled birds (0.32 chicks/egg for 599 oiled birds vs. 0.30 for 558 un-oiled) and their chicks showed identical growth patterns. However, the authors note that during some periods of stress, the rehabilitated birds had significantly lower productivity than un-oiled birds. Of 2,744 birds rehabilitated after the <em>Treasure </em>spill in 2000, 75% were seen two years later, but only 17% had bred. Rehabilitated birds were more likely than controls to change breeding partners (67% keeping mates vs. 80-94%), but this difference appeared to be temporary.
