After two years, grass cover was higher in plots where grass seeds were sown (9.7%) than in plots where they were not sown (0.2%). However, after seven years there was no significant difference in the grass cover in sown (1.9%) and unsown plots (0.4%). In 2001–2002, woody vegetation was removed using a masticator, and in 2005, prescribed burning was carried out. Two weeks after burning, native grass seeds of four species were sown in 15 randomly located 1-m<sup>2</sup> plots at each site, while no seeds were sown in another 15 plots. Grass cover was estimated in each plot in 2006, 2007 and 2012.</p>",

The opposite was true for native vegetation cover (seeded: 48–72%; unseeded: 65–74%). In 1989, ten road verges were sown with a commercial seed mixture containing four non-native grass species at a rate of 7 kg/1,000 m<sup>2</sup>. Commercial fertilizer was also added at a rate of 50 kg/1,000 m<sup>2</sup>. Ten other areas on each of the 10 road verges were not seeded. All sites were grazed occasionally.

Average numbers of native plant species did not differ significantly between plots sown with grass seeds and plots not sown with seeds (both 9–10 species/plot). The same was true for the cover of native plants (sown: 63–77%; unsown: 54–71%) and the cover of non-native invasive plants (sown: 20–29%; unsown: 18–26%). In November 2012, twenty 1 x 1 m plots were sown with 20 seeds of three native grass species (collected onsite 2–3 months prior), while 20 plots were left unsown. All plots were irrigated for 21 days in August 2012. Half of the plots for each treatment were grazed by cattle.

After six years, plant species richness of areas where grass seeds were sown was lower (3.4 species/m<sup>2</sup>) than that in areas where no seeds were sown (7.0 species/m<sup>2</sup>). Cover of grassland species showed a similar pattern (seeded: 5%, unseeded: 16%). Over six years, the plant community both in areas where seeds were sown and areas where seeds were not sown became more similar to that of intact grasslands (data presented as graphical analysis). These results are not based on tests of statistical significance. In autumn 2008, seeds of two grass species <em>Festuca vaginata</em> and <em>Stipa borysthenica</em> were sown, at a rate of 1500 seeds/m<sup>2</sup> and 100 seeds/m<sup>2</sup> respectively, in twenty 1 x 1 m plots, while in 20 plots no seeds were sown.
