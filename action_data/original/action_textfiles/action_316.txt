This difference was mainly due to large numbers of eggs being eaten by ring-billed gulls <em>Larus delawarensis</em> in 1978. The author notes that two eggs in 1978 were crushed by poor placement of the covers. Covers were 38 cm diameter hemisphere made from wood, steel and chicken wire.</p><p> </p>",
