Bird density increased steadily over all months of the study on wild bird cover crops, but remained relatively constant on conventional crops. Wild bird cover crops contained up to 90% more weed species, and 280% more important bird-food weeds, than conventional crops. The wild bird cover crops were composed mainly of kale <em>Brassica</em> spp., quinoa <em>Chenopodium quinoa</em> and triticale <em>Triticosecale </em>spp. and were sown in 20 x 650 m strips.

Four studies reported greater use of wild bird cover crops than of commercial crops during winter (October-March). One study reported an increase in bird abundance when wild bird cover crops were introduced into areas that previously lacked them. Kale <em>Brassica napus</em> and quinoa <em>Chenopodium quinoa</em> were used by the most species. Buckwheat <em>Fagopyron esculentum</em> was rarely used by species in any of the studies. Millet was used by more species than any other cereal. Three other studies also found that the location of wild bird covers within the whole-farm configuration had an effect on bird densities. Wild bird covers located close to hedges were favoured. Four studies found that a mixture of wild bird cover crops will produce the highest bird density and diversity.</p><p> </p>",

In the first two years, the numbers of common butterflies (Lepidoptera) and common butterfly species were higher in plots sown with legumes than in five intensively managed grassland treatments. No more than 2.2 bumblebees/transect were recorded on average on any grass-only plot in any year, compared to over 15 bumblebees/transect in both sown treatments in 2003. The plots sown with legumes generally had fewer butterfly larvae than all grass-only treatments, including conventional silage and six different management treatments. Experimental plots 50 x 10 m were established on permanent pastures (more than five-years-old) on four farms. There were nine different management types, with three replicates/farm, monitored over four years. Seven management types involved different management options for grass-only plots, including mowing and fertilizer addition. The two legume-sown treatments comprised either a mix of crops sown partly for wild birds, including linseed <em>Linum usitatissimum</em> and legumes, uncut, or spring barley <em>Hordeum vulgare</em> undersown with a grass and legume mix (white clover <em>Trifolium repens</em>, red clover <em>T. pratense</em>, common vetch <em>Vicia sativa</em>, bird’s?foot trefoil <em>Lotus corniculatus</em> and black medick <em>Medicago lupulina</em>) cut once in July. Bumblebees and butterflies were surveyed along a 50 m transect line in the centre of each experimental plot, once a month from June to September annually. Butterfly larvae were sampled on two 10 m transects using a sweep net in April and June-September annually. This study was part of the same experimental set-up as (Defra 2007, Pilgrim<em> et al.</em> 2007, Holt<em> et al.</em> 2010).</p>",
