Survival in a control site, with no poisoning, was higher than in the broadcast site but not significantly different from the bait feeder site (18/21 birds surviving, 86%). Feeders were designed to allow black rats <em>Rattus rattus</em> and house mice <em>Mus musculus</em> to enter and retrieve baits, but not brush-tailed possums <em>Trichosurus vulpecula</em>.</p>",
