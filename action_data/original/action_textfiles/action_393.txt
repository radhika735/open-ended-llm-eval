However, the pattern of predation did differ, with fewer birds predated near the release site (predation occurring an average of 3 km from the release site in 1993 vs. 8 km in 1994) and birds surviving for longer on average (average of four days before predation in 1993 vs. 14 days in 1994). The release programme itself is discussed in ‘Release captive bred individuals’, ‘Release birds as subadults or adults, not juveniles’, ‘Use holding pens at release sites’ and ‘Use holding pens at release sites and clip birds’ wings’.</p><p> </p>",
