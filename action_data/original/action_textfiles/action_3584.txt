Lethal strandings of loggerhead turtles reduced by 7% after turtle excluder device use was mandated in the fishery compared to beforehand (results reported as model outputs). There was not enough data to assess the effect on Kemp’s ridley <em>Lepidochelys kempii </em>turtles. Data from the Sea Turtle Stranding and Salvage Network was used to analyse changes in the size and number of stranded turtles before excluder devices were mandated in the shrimp trawl fishery (1986–1990) and afterwards (1995–1999).</p>",

Overall, the interaction rate of dredges with chain mats and sea turtles was estimated to be 86% lower than that of dredges without chain mats (data reported as statistical model results). The author reported a small number of entanglements with dredges with or without chain mats (see original paper). Turtles observed were loggerhead turtles <em>Caretta caretta</em> (47), Kemp’s ridley turtles <em>Lepidochelys kempii</em> (1) or unidentified species (16). Commercial vessels harvested sea scallops<em> Placopecten magellanicus</em> using dredges with and without chain mats attached (fishing effort for each not reported). Chain mats (vertical and horizontal chains hung on the dredge bag) became mandatory from September 2006 in part of the fishing area during May–November each year. Observers onboard the fishing vessels recorded turtles interacting with the dredge gear during a total of 125,658 h (approximately 3% of all commercial fishing trips) in 2001–2008.</p>",

All 11 sea turtles that entered trawl nets modified with an exclusion grid and escape hatch were expelled (downward-facing grid with square mesh net: 6 turtles; upward-facing grid in diamond mesh: 5 turtles) and 9 of 11 turtles exited in &lt;2.5 minutes. Loss of commercially-targeted teleost species from all trawls was 1.2–1.4% of catch. In June–December 2012, the catch (target and unwanted) from three commercial trawl vessels was monitored using in-net and onboard cameras during daylight. Vessels were fitted with either: upward-facing grid and escape hatch with diamond-mesh net (372 trawl hours on 2 vessels), downward-facing grid and escape hatch with diamond-mesh net (559 trawl hours on 2 vessels), or downward-facing grid and escape hatch with square mesh net (389 trawl hours on 1 vessel; see original paper for all specifications). Use of bycatch reduction grids with escape hatches had been mandatory in this fishery since 2006.</p>",
