Hatching success at the highest concentration of glyphosate and the surface-active agent was 73%, compared to hatching success of 80–100% with lower concentrations or no glyphosate. Hatchlings from eggs that had been exposed to the highest concentration of glyphosate and surface-active agent also weighed less both at hatching and after 14 days, compared to those from eggs that had been exposed to lower concentrations. Eggs of red-eared terrapins were exposed to either a single application of glyphosate (68–11,206 ppm wet weight of glyphosate in Glypro, 15 eggs/concentration) with a surface-active agent (LI700) or to no glyphosate (16 eggs). After exposure, eggs were incubated in vermiculite and the number to hatch successfully was recorded. Fourteen days after hatching, size and weight of hatchlings was recorded.</p>",
