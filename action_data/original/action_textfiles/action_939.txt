The ranched, mixed sex diploid group of salmon showed the highest percentage return to fresh water (2.25%). Across the three release groups, the percentage return of triploid mixed-sex and all female stocks (0.81 and 0.75) was significantly lower than diploid mixed-sex and all female stocks (3.42 and 3.95). Weight, length and condition factor were similar between triploid and diploid coastal return fish. Groups of mixed-sex and all female salmon stocks were produced and triploidy was induced in a proportion of fertilised ova in February. Groups of both diploid and triploid mixed-sex and all female fish were released from two sites on the western coast of Ireland; a tidal lake by a hatchery and next to a commercial aquaculture operation on the coast. Capture location and return data of the groups was gathered as part of an on-going Irish programme. Fifteen major salmon landing ports were monitored between May and June 1996.</p>",
