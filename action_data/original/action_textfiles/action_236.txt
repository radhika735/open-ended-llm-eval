Total bird numbers were higher on grazed plots than ungrazed in summer, with no difference in winter (summer: 193 birds counted in ungrazed sites vs. 270 in grazed; winter: 242 birds in grazed vs. 247 in ungrazed). Open-ground foraging species were significantly more abundant in the grazed area, whilst species that prefer grass and shrub cover were the most abundant birds in protected sites, but absent on grazed pasture. The authors argue that the bird communities prevalent in grazed areas were more typical of lower elevations and dry habitats, and may be an indication of desertification of intensively grazed semi-desert and plains grasslands.</p><p> </p>",

Experimental data from placing artificial nests baited with a Japanese quail <em>Coturnix japonica</em> egg and one painted plasticine egg in both areas showed a similar trend (daily survival rates of 55-95% of 120 eggs in grazed area vs. 77-98% of 120 in rested area).

Twenty-four other species (predators, fruit-eaters and insect-eaters) made up a smaller proportion of total bird abundance and did not differ in abundance between grazed and ungrazed sites.
