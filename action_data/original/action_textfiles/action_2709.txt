Some types of bottom trawl, particularly beam trawls, are rigged with ‘tickler’ chains or a chain mat, that spread from one side of the trawl mouth to the other, contacting the seabed. Tickler chains and chain mats physically disturb the seabed to increase the likelihood of animals entering the mouth of the trawl. However, they often cause unwanted species to enter the trawl as well as those targeted commercially. Modifying tickler chain arrangement (such as reducing the size of chain links, or attaching only one end of the chain to the beam; Bergman &amp; Van Santbrink 2000; Broadhurst <em>et al</em>. 2015), or even removing them altogether, may reduce the seabed disturbance and therefore result in fewer unwanted fish species/sizes being retained by the gear.</p>\r\n<p>For related interventions describing other modifications to the overall design of different types or parts of trawl gear is summarized under ‘<em>Fishing gear modification - <a href=\"../../actions/2704\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Modify the design or configuration of trawl gear (mixed measures)</a>’</em>,<a href=\"../../actions/2705\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em> ‘Change the size of the main body of a trawl net’</em></a>,<a href=\"../../actions/2706\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em> ‘Decrease the circumference or diameter of the codend of a trawl net’</em></a>,<a href=\"../../actions/2707\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em> ‘Modify the design or configuration of trawl doors’ </em></a>and<a href=\"../../actions/2708\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em> ‘Modify a bottom trawl to raise parts of the gear off the seabed during fishing’</em></a>.</p>\r\n<p>Bergman M.J.N. &amp; Van Santbrink J.W.

For unwanted fish (undersized commercial target species and all other non-target species), there were no differences in catches between the modified and conventional tickler chain arrangements, except for small whiting <em>Merlangius merlangus</em>, of which fewer were caught by the modified gear (data not reported). Data were collected from a series of beam trawl deployments along six parallel strips on the seabed (2,000 m × 30 m) using two modified and one conventional tickler chain arrangement. In March-April 1999, a total of 72 deployments were carried out with three different configurations of parallel chains (numbers and spacing, connected pairs) hung along the beam. In October 1999, a total of 35 deployments were undertaken with three configurations of chains hung in loops from the beam. In addition, a standard trawl with conventional tickler chain arrangement (attached to the shoe plates on either end of the beam) was towed simultaneously during each deployment. All catch was weighed.</p>",

Overall, trawl gear without a tickler chain decreased the catch of skates/rays (four species) and sharks (three species) compared to a trawl with a tickler chain (skates/rays, without: 198 individuals, with: 625 individuals; sharks, without: 993 individuals, with: 1,357 individuals). For the more commercially valuable species, overall catch rates of three flatfish species (Pleuronectidae) and two cod-like species (Gadidae) were similar between trawls, however, catch rates of two anglerfish <em>Lophius</em> sp. decreased with a tickler chain (see paper for data). Trials took place onboard a commercial fishing vessel in October 2005. A total of 17 paired deployments of standard bottom fish trawls, one with the tickler chain removed, were made, parallel to one another, at 120–170 m depth.</p>",
