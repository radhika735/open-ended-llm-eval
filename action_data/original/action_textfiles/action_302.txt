Bird exclusion devices (BEDs) such as ‘Brickle curtains’ hang around the hauling point and are designed to prevent birds getting to the line, which will only be visible for a short time as it reaches the boat.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

Brickle curtains consisted of two booms extending over the hauling area with streamers attached, the single boom had one or more objects suspended from it. Boats using a third exclusion device consisting of two booms and a line of purse seine buoys (with or without streamers) caught no birds over three years, but the sample size was too small for meaningful comparisons to be made.</p><p> </p>",
