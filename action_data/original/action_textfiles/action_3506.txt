It may include preventing road construction altogether, or changing the road design to avoid key habitats. For example, a case study in North Carolina, USA suggested that a road was moved 100 m to avoid a timber rattlesnake <em>Crotalus horridus </em>rookery and a high density of eastern box turtles <em>Terrapene carolina</em> (Andrews <em>et al</em>. 2006).</p>\r\n<p><sup>Andrews K.M., Gibbons J.W. &amp; Jochimsen D.M.
