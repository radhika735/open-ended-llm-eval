In response to a questionnaire, 32% of respondents said that they would have gone to look for a nesting turtle if they had not been able to join a supervised turtle watch. Loggerhead turtle watches were carried out by six organizations that had been issued permits by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. In 1994, these organisations distributed questionnaires to members of the public that attended turtles watches and were over the age of 15. Of the 1,148 questionnaires given out, 608 were returned and 488 were completed correctly and included in the analysis.</p>",

All 38 people that responded to survey after attending a tour reported that in future, they would be more conscientious of how their behaviours on the beach affected sea turtles. Thirty-six (97%) respondents also reported that they would be more likely to report sightings of turtle nests or injured turtles. In 2009–2014, leatherback turtle ecotours were carried out during April–June. Tours involved a maximum of 10 people visiting a turtle nesting beach with a trained guide to observe nesting turtles. Attendees also received a briefing and education material on sea turtles. In 2014, a survey was distributed to 206 attendees of the tour that had provided contact information.</p>",
