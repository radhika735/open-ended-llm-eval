Bees were sampled in flight using a 'Malaise trap' set for two weeks between June and September in each garden. 'Management intensity' was calculated from scores for weeding, pruning, watering, dead-heading flowers, collecting autumn leaves, and the use of fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides. An index of 'wildlife management' was based on whether householders fed birds, provided bird nest boxes or used other (unspecified) methods to attract wildlife. Results showed that the number of bumblebee species (but not their abundance) was related to management intensity, with more species in gardens managed less intensively. Solitary bee species richness was related to the number of plant species in the garden (both native and alien), but not directly to the interventions relevant to wildlife gardening. The abundance of solitary bees was related to the number of native plant species, but was lower in gardens with a higher index of 'wildlife gardening' (mostly focussed on encouraging birds).</p><p>Additional reference</p><p>Smith R.M., Gaston K.J., Warren P.H. &amp; Thompson K.
