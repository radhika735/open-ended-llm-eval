The repellents tested were: o-aminoacetophenone (OAP), 2-amino-4,5-dimethoxyacetophenone, methyl anthranilate, 4-ketobenztriazine (4KBT) and veratryl amine, all at concentrations of 0.5% by volume. The most effective repellent was OAP and the least effective 4KBT; there were no significant differences between effectiveness of any of the other chemicals. All repellents were effective for five weeks on water which was pH 10.6 and contained 150 ppm sodium cyanide.</p><p> </p>",
