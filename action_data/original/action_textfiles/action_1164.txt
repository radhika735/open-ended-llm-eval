In each of 25 sites (all former wood pastures, abandoned 50–80 years earlier), two 1 ha plots were established. In one of the two plots 26% of the tree basal area was removed during 2002–2003 (all large oaks were retained), whereas the other plot was left unharvested. The number, survival (based on 15 plots) and growth (based on 13 plots) of oak seedlings was recorded using two 100 m transects/plot, containing four subplots (1 × 5 m or 1 × 10 m) each.</p><p> </p>",
