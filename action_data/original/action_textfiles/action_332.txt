Densities of five species were greater in untreated stands. Conservation concern scores and detection rates of 30 species, suggest that the mosaic of treated stands afforded greater community-wide bird conservation value than untreated stands. Bird densities were estimated (distance sampling) within forest subject to variable-retention harvests within a 13-year chronosequence (i.e. a set of forested sites with similar attributes but of different ages), and untreated stands.</p><p> </p>",
