Time spent feeding increased from 14 minutes/hour when pellets were fed to 24 minutes/hour when frozen juice was offered. Inactivity was lower with frozen juice (two minutes/hour) than when just pellets were provided (five minutes/hour). The monkeys (n=63) received frozen juice presented as a 100ml block of sugared drink mix; eight different flavours were used. The frozen juice was presented to individually housed macaques at intervals of 1.5 hours, during which 15 minutes of animal observations were conducted on all monkeys. Frozen juice was presented to each monkey every weekday for six months with control observations, when just pellets were provided, conducted over six months between times when enrichment devices were given.    (CJ)</p><p> </p>",

Significantly more instances of being outside and number of times gibbons were seen foraging were recorded when food was presented in ice pops (times outside: 134; times foraging: 43) compared to when fruit and vegetables were offered alone (times outside: 96; times foraging: 20). A group of gibbons were presented with ice pops for five days, with three ice pops suspended within the animal exhibit each time. The gibbons’ behaviour was recorded every five minutes for five hours per day for 12 days.    (CJ)</p><p> </p>",
