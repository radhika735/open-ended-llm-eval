Forty-three of 67 (64%) eggs hatched successfully, and hatching success was higher for eggs recovered from turtles with intact shells (30 of 35, 86%) compared to those with open shells (13 of 32, 41 %). Of 32 turtles that were found on a road having been hit by a vehicle, nine contained 2–21 unbroken eggs. One turtle survived and was later released after laying eggs. Unbroken eggs were transferred to a laboratory and partially buried in perlite incubation medium in plastic containers (32 x 19 x 10 cm), with aluminium foil layered under the lid. Clutches were incubated separately. A road was searched for turtles hit by vehicles at least twice daily during the nesting season (months not given).</p>",

Hatching success was statistically similar for eggs recovered from harvested turtles and buried in artificial nests (21%) compared to those from relocated nests (58%) and natural nests (41%). In 2005, seven clutches of eggs were recovered from turtles that had been harvested by local people and incubated in artificial nests that were dug into the riverbank. In 2005–2006, a further 24 nests were relocated higher up the beach away from rising river levels and 22 nests were left in place. All nests were covered with wire mesh cylinders (1 x 1 cm) that were 40 cm wide and 50 cm high, with a 3 x 3 cm plastic mesh on top. In February–May 2005–2006, beaches were searched daily, with the aid of dogs <em>Canis lupus familiaris</em>, to locate turtle nests. All nests were inspected daily and excavated after hatching, or after 74 days of incubation.</p>",
