Fifty control nests were not protected. The nests, made in old flowering stems of the grass tree <em>Xanthorrhoea</em>, were set out in groups of four, one protected and one unprotected. Protected nests were more productive, with an average of 3.6 young per adult female, compared to 1.6 young per adult female in control nests.</p>",
