Grazing cattle or sheep on forage crops increased phosphorus loss from fields by approximately 100% (1.3 kg/ha) and 33% (0.9 kg/ha) respectively, compared to normal sheep grazing on pasture (0.6 kg/ha).  Forage grazing by cattle or sheep increased fine sediment loss by 1,000% (0.7 mg/ha) and 500% (0.4 mg/ha), relative to grazing pasture with sheep (0.06 mg/ha). Twenty-eight 10 × 25 m plots included four replicates of combinations of the following treatments: cattle or sheep grazing on winter forage crops (triticale <em>Triticosecale Wittmack</em>, then kale <em>Brassica oleracea</em>), sheep pasture, restricted grazing, or alum addition on the forage crops (20 kg/ha following grazing).</p><p> </p>",

Adding biochar saved more nitrate (12.9 mg nitrate remaining in pot) than adding clay (12.1 mg nitrate/pot). Soil was collected from a crop-pasture rotation including wheat <em>Triticum aestivum</em> or cape weed <em>Arctotheca calendula</em> with annual ryegrass <em>Lolium rigidum</em> and clover <em>Trifolium subterraneum</em>. Biochar and clay were either added at 25 t/ha as a layer at 10 cm depth with soil on top, or evenly incorporated into the top 10 cm of soil. Biochar was produced using jarrah <em>Eucalyptus marginata</em> wood and clay was taken from a clay pit close to the soil collection site. Nitrogen fertilizer was added at 40 kg N/ha. Amended soils were watered with the equivalent of 30 mm rainfall daily for 10 days, then on days 13, 15, 17 and 20.</p>",
