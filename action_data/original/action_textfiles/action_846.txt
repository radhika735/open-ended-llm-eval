Captures decreased significantly after both leave-tree harvesting (before: 8; one year after: 4; three years after: 1 amphibian/search) and clearcutting (before: 10; one year after: 7; three years after: 1/search). Abundance did not differ significantly within the unharvested plot (before: 10; one year after: 10; three years after: 8). Treatments on 2 ha plots were: leave-tree (up to 16 trees/ha retained), clearcutting (up to 12 wildlife and dead trees retained) and unharvested. Salamanders were monitored along 15 x 2 m transects with artificial cover objects (50/plot).</p><p> </p>",

Abundance was similar in the leave-tree and clearcut plots (2 vs 1/30 m<sup>2</sup> respectively). Abundance was significantly lower than unharvested plots (6/30 m<sup>2</sup>). Species composition differed before and three years post-harvest. There was no significant difference in the proportion of females carrying eggs or eggs/female for red-backed salamander <em>Plethodon cinereus</em> (7 eggs) or mountain dusky salamander <em>Desmognathus ochrophaeus</em> (12–13 eggs) in unharvested and harvested treatments (leave-tree, shelterwoods and clearcut with wildlife trees or snags left). The proportion of juveniles was similar except for slimy salamander <em>Plethodon glutinosus</em>, which had a significantly lower proportion in harvested plots. There were five sites with 2 ha plots with the following treatments: leave-tree harvest (up to 50 trees/ha retained uniformly; average 28%), clearcutting, other harvested treatments and an unharvested control. Salamanders were monitored on 9–15 transects (2 x 15 m)/plot at night in April–October. One or two years of pre-harvest and 1–4 years of post-harvest data were collected.</p><p> </p>",
