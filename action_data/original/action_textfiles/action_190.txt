However, in late summer, cereal fields were used more (up to 56% of 506 flights) and field margins less (down to 15%). In 2006, sections of margins around some nests were cut down to the soil. These patches comprised 2.3-2.4% of margin area, and were used for 2.9% of 172 foraging flights in early summer and 34% of 77 foraging flights in late summer. The authors suggest that yellowhammers used cut patches disproportionately as the uncut sections grew taller and so reduced the access to invertebrates.</p><p> </p>",

Although plots with field margins did see more positive population changes (increases or smaller decreases relative to other plots) of rook <em>Corvus frugilegus</em>, starling <em>Sturnus vulgaris </em>and woodpigeon <em>Columba palumbus</em>, the effect was small, with starlings, for example, showing increases of only 0.0002 individuals for every 0.001 km² of margin in mixed farmland plots. Other species expected to benefit from margin provision including corn bunting <em>Emberiza</em> <em>calandra</em>, grey partridge <em>Perdix perdix</em>, kestrel <em>Falco tinnunculus</em>, jackdaw<em> Corvus monedula</em>, reed bunting <em>Emberiza schoeniclus</em>, and common whitethroat <em>Sylvia communis</em> all showed no effect of margin management. Yellowhammer <em>Emberiza citrinella</em>, also expected to benefit from margin creation, showed a positive association in mixed landscapes and a negative association on grassland plots. The 2,046 1 km² lowland plots were surveyed in both 2005 and 2008 and classified as arable, pastoral or mixed farmland. Eighty-four percent of plots included some area managed according to the Entry Level Stewardship or the Countryside Stewardship Scheme. In both survey years, two surveys were conducted along a 2 km pre-selected transect route through each 1 km² plot.</p><p> </p>",
