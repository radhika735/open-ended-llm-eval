        "background_definitions": "<p>Some butterflies, in particular the large blues <em>Phengaris</em> (<em>Maculinea</em>) spp., are parasites of ant colonies of the genus <em>Myrmica</em>, and depend upon just one or two host ant species for their caterpillars to develop. Other species of blue butterfly, such as the chalkhill blue <em>Polyommatus coridon</em>, have mutualistic relationships with ants, whereby the caterpillar excretes a sugary secretion which is eaten by the ants, which in turn protect the caterpillar (Thomas &amp; Lewington 2016). Therefore, effective conservation for these butterflies depends not just on habitat management for the requirements of the butterfly, but also for the requirements of the <em>Myrmica</em> ants and (in some cases) the suppression of the more competitive black ant <em>Lasius niger</em> (Wynhoff <em>et al.</em> 2011, Wynhoff <em>et al.</em> 2017). For example, the translocation of sods from fen meadows to restoration areas encouraged colonization by <em>Myrmica scabrinodis</em> (Wynhoff <em>et al.</em> 2017). <em>Myrmica scabrinodis</em> is further supported by early or late season mowing, while <em>Myrmica rubra</em> nests should be undisturbed in summer, and mown in late autumn (Wynhoff <em>et al.</em> 2011).</p>\r\n<p>Studies are only included here if they record the outcome <em>on a species of butterfly or moth</em>, not just on the host or mutualist species.</p>\r\n<p><sup>Thomas J.A. &amp; Lewington R.
