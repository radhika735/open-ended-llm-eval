Higher straw yields were found in plots with added sewage sludge, compared to plots without it (2.7–4.2 vs 1.2 t/ha). <strong>Implementation options: </strong>Similar grain yields were found in plots with high amounts of added sewage sludge and plots without added sewage sludge (1.5 vs 1.2 t/ha). <strong>Methods:</strong> The sewage sludge was thermally dried at 75<sup>o</sup>C. There were four plots (10 x 3 m) for each of four fertilizer treatments (20 or 80 t sewage sludge/ha, applied once in three years or once/year) and there were four control plots (no fertilizer). Plots were fertilized in mid-September and planted in mid-October. Barley plants were harvested (1 m<sup>2</sup>/plot), in June 2005.</p><p> </p>",
