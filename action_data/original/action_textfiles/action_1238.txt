Percentage cover of herbaceous species was higher in cut than in control plots while their species richness was similar (55 vs 44%, 70 vs 69 species). Species richness of grasses was higher in cut than in control plots while their percentage cover was similar (12 vs 8 species, 15 vs 11%). Species richness and percentage cover of trees 2-10 m were lower in cut than in control plots (15 vs 24 species and 19 vs 29% respectively). For trees 0.5-2 m percentage cover was lower in cut than in control plots while species richness was similar between treatments (50 vs 66%, 39 vs 42 species). Species richness and percentage cover of trees &lt;0.5 m were similar in cut and control plots (44 vs 48 species and 44 vs 43%). Two cutting treatment (chain saw cutting and mechanical brush cutting) and one control plots (4-12 ha) were replicated in four blocks, which had previously been clearcut and planted with white spruce <em>Picea glauca</em> and black spruce <em>Picea mariana</em> 3-4 years before herbicide treatments. Monitoring was five years after treatment.</p><p> </p>",
