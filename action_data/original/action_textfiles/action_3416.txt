The average percentage of seeds that germinated for four grassland plant species was higher in plots where vegetation was removed and seeds sown (7.0–45.5%) than in plots where seeds were sown but vegetation was not removed (0.1–1.8%). In April 1986, all vegetation was removed (cut at ground level) from twenty 7 x 5 m plots, and seeds were sown of either <em>Achillea millefolium</em>, <em>Pimpinella saxifraga</em>, <em>Plantago media</em> or <em>Scabiosa columbaria</em> (five plots sown/species). In twenty other plots, seeds were sown but vegetation was not removed. Plots were monitored for seed germination every 1–2 weeks until September 1986.</p>",

For one sown species, pasqueflower <em>Pulsatilla vulgaris</em>, the average number of seedlings was higher in plots where vegetation and litter were removed before sowing (3 seedlings/plot) than in plots where vegetation and litter were not removed before sowing (0.6 seedlings/plot). The two other sown species, mountain clover <em>Trifolium montanum</em> and prostrate speedwell <em>Veronica prostrata</em>, did not germinate in sown plots with or without vegetation and litter removal. In May–August 2007, at each of five sites, vegetation and litter were removed in four 1 x 1 m plots after which 25 seeds of <em>Pulsatilla vulgaris, Trifolium montanum </em>or <em>Veronica prostrata</em> were sown. In another four plots, seeds were sown but vegetation and litter were not removed. All sites were former forest stands that were clear cut and restored to grassland 3–14 years before the study. In May 2008, the number of seedlings in each plot was counted.</p>",
