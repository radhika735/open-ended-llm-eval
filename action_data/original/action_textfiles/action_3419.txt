However, after two years, species richness was higher in areas that were cut annually, and this remained the case for the following two years (seeded and cut: 22–24 species/m<sup>2</sup>; seeded and grazed: 20–22 species/m<sup>2</sup>). In 1986, topsoil that had been removed during mining was replaced and sown with a temporary cover crop. The cover crop was removed by ploughing in autumn 1987 and soil disturbed using a power harrow in April 1988. Two 1,500 m<sup>2</sup> plots were fenced and cut every year in mid-July, while two plots were grazed by livestock throughout the summer. All plots were grazed in spring.

            "paragraph_text": "<p>A replicated, controlled study in 2011–2012 in a species-poor hay meadow in Germany (John <em>et al</em>. 2016) found that cutting vegetation three times/year after sowing seeds resulted in more species characteristic of hay meadows than cutting once/year after sowing seeds. After one year, the number of species characteristic of hay meadows was higher in areas where seeds were sown and vegetation was cut three times/year (4.5 species/plot) than in areas where seeds were sown and vegetation was cut once/year (3.2 species/plot). In September 2011, four blocks consisting of twelve 4 × 4 m plots were established. All plots were ploughed and vegetation removed, following which they were sown with the seeds of 18 plant species. In each block, vegetation was cut three times/year in six plots and once/year in six other plots. Vegetation cover in a 0.5 × 0.5 m quadrat in each plot was surveyed in autumn 2012.</p>",
