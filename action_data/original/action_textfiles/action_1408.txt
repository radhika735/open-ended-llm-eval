Different bee species were present at remnant and restored sites (36% of bee species were present at both sites in a pair; other data reported as ordination results). <strong>Methods:</strong> Each of five restored sites was paired with a remnant site (5.5–10 km apart). Plots within sites (1 ha) were 0.5–3.7 km apart. Restored sites were previously walnut and almond orchards (6 years before sampling) and were planted with similar vegetation to remnant sites (maple <em>Acer</em> spp., oak <em>Quercus</em> spp., willow <em>Salix</em> spp., and grass). The proportion of native plants (common to both sites: willow <em>Salix</em> spp., mule fat <em>Baccharis salicifolia</em>, lupin  <em>Lupinus</em> spp., California rose <em>Rosa californica</em>, and ash-leaved maple <em>Acer negundo</em>) did not differ between restored and remnant sites (0.49 vs 1.82 individuals, 0.39 vs 0.89 species/flower head). Bees were sampled every six weeks in February–August 2003 (transect walks and pan traps). Flowers were sampled in each plot (60 quadrats, 0<em>.</em>25 x 4 m).</p><p> </p>",
