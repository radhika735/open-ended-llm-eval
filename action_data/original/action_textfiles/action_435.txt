Instead it may be necessary to treat the other hosts or to exclude them from particular habitats or control their numbers.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">While we found studies describing the impact of controlling reservoir species through culling, we found no intervention-based studies describing the impact of excluding reservoir species from an area.  However, a correlative study in Scotland in 2007 found that areas of forest that were fenced to exclude deer had fewer ticks (carriers of louping ill virus which attacks red grouse <em>Lagopus lagopus scoticus</em>) than unfenced areas, but that areas of adjacent moorland (where the grouse were actually found) were not affected (Ruiz-Fons &amp; Gilbert, 2010).</p>\r\n<p>Ruiz-Fons, F. &amp; Gilbert, L.

However, there was a significant increase in the number of chicks produced/female at the treatment site, compared to the control (approximately 1.2 chicks/female in 1991 and 5 in 2001 at the experimental site vs. 3.5 and 3.0 at the control) and a significant reduction of louping ill virus at the treatment site, compared to a second control site. Hare densities were reduced from 8/km<sup>2</sup> in 1993 to 0 in 1998. A comment on this paper in 2004 (Cope et al. 2004) argues that the control sites were not adequate, as they differed in either the pre-existing incidence of louping ill virus or in various environmental conditions.</p><p class=\"\\\">Reference</p><p class=\"\\\">Cope, D.

The authors note that there is some evidence for an effect of culling on the prevalence of louping ill virus (e.g. in Laureson et al. 2003) but that evidence for population-level effects is uncertain, partly due to a lack of understanding of the population dynamics of both hares and grouse.</p><p> </p>",
