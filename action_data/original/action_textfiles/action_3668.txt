The ladder was used by common watersnakes (1–5 individuals/year) in five of eight years that the ladder was monitored. A stainless steel fish ladder (11 m long, 13 cm deep and 41 cm wide with a 50° slope containing a suitable substrate for climbing, see original paper for details), designed to facilitate the upstream passage of the snake-like movements of American eels <em>Anguilla rostrata</em>, was installed from late spring (May–July) to autumn (October–November) in 2007–2014 (106–188 days/year). Numbers of snakes (and eels) were monitored by live catching or photographs when they reached the upstream end of the ladder.</p>",
