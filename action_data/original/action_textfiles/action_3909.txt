Given the poor dispersal ability of many species, and the highly fragmented nature of many landscapes, the transportation of individuals to suitable sites may be the only means by which a species is able to recolonize. Releases could be composed of translocated animals (caught in the wild at another site) or captive-bred animals (bred from captive populations over one or more generations, see “<em>Rear declining species in captivity</em>” and “<em>Release captive-bred individuals to the wild</em>”), and individuals at any life stage (adult, egg, caterpillar or pupa) may be used for capture and release.</p>\r\n<p>Note that restoring habitat quality prior to the release of translocated butterflies and moths is likely to be an important factor determining the success of reintroduction projects (Schultz <em>et al.</em> 2008). Furthermore, for parasitic species such as the large blues <em>Phengaris</em> (<em>Maculinea</em>) spp., which rely on specific hosts (ants <em>Myrmica</em> spp.) for survival, the translocation of ant colonies from the same source site as the butterflies may increase caterpillar survival (Witek <em>et al.</em> 2016).</p>\r\n<p>CAUTION: Before translocating butterflies and moths, the impact of the removal of individuals from the donor site must be considered, to avoid harming existing populations.</p>\r\n<p>For studies on the release of butterflies and moths outside of their known range, see “<a href=\"../../actions/3911\"><em>Translocate to establish populations outside of known range</em></a>”.</p>\r\n<p><sup>Fox R., Warren M.S., Brereton T.M., Roy D.B. &amp; Robinson A.

Three populations of <em>Lycaena dispar rutilus</em> released as adults and/or caterpillars survived for zero, 23 and two years. One population of <em>Lycaena dispar batavus</em> survived for 38 years, but was supplemented by additional releases of captive-bred individuals, and ‘wild’ caterpillars were regularly reared in cages. Another <em>L. d. batavus</em> population died out 13 years after release. In 1909, <em>L. d. rutilus</em> caterpillars (number not given) were released at Wicken Fen, Cambridgeshire. In May 1913, following planting of great water dock <em>Rumex hydrolapathum </em>on a bog in Greenfields, Tipperary, 120 <em>L. d. rutilus</em> caterpillars from Germany were released. The following year, 400 adults raised from 700 caterpillars collected in Germany were released at the same site. In 1926, a total of 550 pupae from Tipperary were placed in cages in Woodbastwick Marshes, Norfolk, and the adults released as they emerged. In 1926, an 8.8-ha area of Woodwalton Fen, Cambridgeshire, was cleared of bushes and great water dock was planted. In 1927, thirteen female and 25 male <em>L. d. batavus</em> from the Netherlands were released at the site. This population was supplemented with captive-bred caterpillars or adults when numbers were low, and from the 1930s, ‘wild’ caterpillars were routinely reared in muslin cages to protect them from predation.

Two years after two grassland plots were cleared, and one year after eggs and caterpillars were released, eight adult moths (7 females, 1 male) were present in a plot which had been stripped of turf and soil, but no adults were present in a plot which had been strimmed and raked. In the summer of the release, caterpillars had been observed feeding in both plots. In winter 2000–2001, vegetation was removed from two 15 × 10 m plots within a 6.5-ha dune grassland. One plot was completely stripped of turf and soil to expose the bare sand, and the other was heavily strimmed to ground level, with cuttings and leaf litter raked off. Both plots were allowed to re-vegetate naturally. In early April 2002, three egg batches and 33 caterpillars were introduced to each plot, and in late April a further 10 caterpillars were added to the stripped plot (source population not specified). Caterpillars were observed in summer 2002, and adults were recorded in April 2003.</p>",
