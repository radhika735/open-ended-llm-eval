        "background_definitions": "<p>Captive breeding involves taking wild animals into captivity and establishing and maintaining breeding populations. It tends to be undertaken when wild populations become very small or fragmented or when they are declining rapidly. Captive populations can be maintained while threats in the wild are reduced or removed and can provide an insurance policy against catastrophe in the wild. Captive breeding also potentially provides a method of increasing reproductive output beyond what would be possible in the wild. However, captive breeding can result in problems associated with inbreeding depression, removal of natural selection and adaptation to captive conditions. The aim is usually to release captive-bred animals back to natural habitats, either to original sites once conditions are suitable, to reintroduce species to sites that were occupied in the past or to introduce species to new sites. Some captive populations may also be used for research to benefit wild populations.</p>\r\n<p>Due to the number of studies found, this action has been split by species group, though no studies were found for amphisbaenians.

In 1979, one female produced four eggs, two of which hatched successfully, though one hatchling was removed from the egg by hand. A second female produced two eggs, one of which hatched successfully, though the hatchling died after one day. Incubation periods ranged from 112–126 days. The remaining three eggs did not develop successfully and were discarded. Five Gila monsters were acquired in 1970–1978, including two females, one male, and two of unknown sex. The lizards were kept together in a glass fronted exhibit (130 x 88 x 140 cm). The average temperature was 28°C, and the lizards were exposed to a UV lamp for 15–20 minutes/day. Eggs were moved to a plastic container (33 x 16 x 8 cm) and incubated in vermiculite (4:1 mixture with water) at 28°C.</p>",

One female lizard produced six clutches of eggs (2 clutches/year) over three years and a total of 18 eggs, 11 of which hatched successfully (61%). One of the female captive-bred offspring went on to breed, producing one clutch of two eggs (hatching data not provided). In 2012, one female and two male lizards were acquired and housed in a number of different enclosures, with temperatures ranging from 18–30°C and 33–38.6°C in basking areas. Eggs were removed and placed in plastic containers, partially buried in water-soaked vermiculite, and incubated at 26°C. Hatchlings were placed in a range of difference enclosure types (see paper for details).</p>",

Six months after bringing wild iguanas into captivity, one young iguana hatched successfully. In the subsequent two years, although gravid females dug burrows and deposited eggs, no hatchlings emerged. A breeding facility was established in May 2012, and eight adult iguanas (3 males and 5 females) were brought into captivity from the wild and housed in an outdoor enclosure (9 x 6 m).</p>",

After 24 years of a captive breeding and head-start programme in one Jamaican zoo, five Jamaican iguanas hatched successfully, of which three were released into the wild and two died prior to release. No breeding took place in zoo exhibit cages. After 19–21 years of a captive-breeding programme in American zoos, 73 iguanas hatched successfully. The first hatchling emerged after 6–8 years, but died. Twenty-four hatchlings emerged after 10–12 years and 48 hatchlings emerged after 16–20 years. The authors reported that Jamaican iguanas were less likely to breed in captivity than other captive <em>Cyclura </em>spp. and that in the USA zoos, almost all female iguanas laid infertile eggs annually. In total, 617 Jamaican iguanas were transferred to one zoo in Jamaica (593 individuals in 1991–2015) and six zoos in USA (24 individuals in 1994–2009, see original paper for details) as part of a head-starting and captive-breeding programme.</p>",

Results were not statistically tested. On Christmas Island, captive populations of Lister’s geckos grew from 50 in 2012 to 500 in 2016, and captive populations of blue-tailed skinks grew from 150 in 2012 to 750 in 2016. At Taronga zoo, populations of Lister’s geckos (70 in 2011 and 70 in 2016) and blue-tailed skinks (100 in 2011 and 220 in 2016) remained relatively stable. In 2009, all Lister’s geckos and blue-tailed skinks that could be found on Christmas Island were brought into captivity. From these wild-caught individuals and their offspring, 56 geckos and 83 skinks were transported to Taronga Zoo, and the remaining 70 geckos and 109 skinks were maintained at facilities on Christmas Island. Captive management aimed to maximise retention of genetic diversity (see paper for more details).</p>",

Females produced 1–4 clutches, with an average of 4 eggs/clutch. Overall hatching success was 60% (66 of 110 eggs) and hatching success was similar across all incubation temperatures (68% at 28°C; 56% at 30°C; 57% at 32°C). In addition, hatching success was higher for eggs laid earlier in the season (data presented at statistical model results). Wild-caught dragons were housed as breeding pairs in cages (50 x 40 x 35 cm) with a sand substrate, basking area, and sandy area for egg laying. Temperatures fluctuated between 15–25°C. Eggs were removed (110 eggs from 19 females) and placed in individual plastic cups (125 ml) in moist vermiculite (1:5 ratio with water by volume), and the cups were sealed with plastic cling wrap and a rubber band. Eggs from each clutch were split evenly between three incubation temperatures: 28, 30 or 32°C (110 eggs overall). Eggs were checked daily and those that failed during incubation were removed.</p>",
