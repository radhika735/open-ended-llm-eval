However, overall survival rates did not differ significantly (37-73% success for marked nests vs 38-66% for unmarked), with some evidence that marked nests were deserted or predated more often. Nests on the marked farms (121 in 2005, 113 in 2006) were marked with two bamboo poles (1 m high) by 151-171 volunteers, and farmers told of their presence. On the control farms, no markers were put in place and farmers were not informed of the nests.</p><p> </p>",
