Abundance was similar between treatments (2 vs 1/30 m<sup>2</sup> respectively). Abundance was significantly lower than unharvested plots (6/30 m<sup>2</sup>). Species composition differed before and three years after harvest. There was no significant difference in the proportion of females carrying eggs or eggs/female for red-backed salamander <em>Plethodon cinereus</em> (7 eggs) or mountain dusky salamander <em>Desmognathus ochrophaeus</em> (12–13 eggs) in unharvested and harvested treatments (clearcut with wildlife trees/snags, shelterwood and leave-tree harvesting). The proportion of juveniles was similar except for slimy salamander <em>Plethodon glutinosus</em>, which had a significantly lower proportion in harvested plots. There were four sites with 2 ha plots with the following treatments: clearcutting with up to 12 wildlife or dead trees retained (small stems felled and left), clearcutting, other harvested treatments and an unharvested control. Salamanders were monitored on 9–15 transects (2 x 15 m)/plot at night in April-October. One or two years of pre-harvest and 1–4 years of post-harvest data were collected.</p><p> </p>",
