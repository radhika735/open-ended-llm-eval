The standards could include, for example, keeping the land in ‘good agricultural condition’ or managing soil to avoid erosion. The Swiss Ecological Compensation Areas scheme, under which farmers have to manage 7% of their land to qualify for area-based payments, was made obligatory in Switzerland under cross compliance in 1998. Studies examining the effects of this scheme are included in ‘Increase the proportion of natural/semi-natural habitat in the farmed landscape’.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p> </p>",
