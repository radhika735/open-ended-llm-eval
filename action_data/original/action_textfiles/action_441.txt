They can have extremely detrimental impacts on bird species, with parasite chicks frequently evicting all host eggs or chicks. However, some brood parasite species, such as common cuckoos <em>Cuculus canorus</em> are themselves declining or threatened, making control or the reduction of parasitism undesirable.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">However, in North America, brown-headed cowbirds Molothrus ater are increasingly abundant and expanding in their range. Brown-headed cowbirds have also been implicated in the near extinction of at least one species, the pale-headed brush finch Atlapetes pallidiceps in South America (Oppel <em>et al.</em> 2004), meaning that their control is seen as a conservation priority.

In addition, parasitism rates appeared lower, with only a single nest being parasitised in 2003 and none in 2005. Between 18 and 69 cowbirds were shot each year at the site.</p><p> </p>",
