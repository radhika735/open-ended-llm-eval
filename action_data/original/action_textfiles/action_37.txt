There were three replicates of each treatment, in 14 ha plots. There were more bees and more bee species in plots that underwent both mechanical shrub control and prescribed burning, compared to plots with mechanical shrub control only, prescribed burn only or no fire control. Mechanical shrub control and burning combined led to hotter fires and increased herbaceous plant cover, providing more forage plants for bees in subsequent years.</p>",
