Soils were disturbed to different depths (conventional tillage: 50 cm with disking, cultivating with a liliston, sub-soiling, bed re-making, and bed-shaping; minimum tillage: 20 cm with a liliston, rollers, and bed-shaping).

Three plots (10 x 15 m) were fertilized with municipal solid waste compost in spring 2010, and three plots were not fertilized. Carbon dioxide was measured once every two weeks (three open chambers/plot, 20 cm diameter, 5 cm deep in the soil). Soil cores were collected (three 100 cm<sup>2</sup> soil cores/plot) for other measurements.</p><p> </p>",

Higher bacteria diversity was found in soils with added compost, compared to soils without added compost, in one of many comparisons (with double compost application: data reported as Chao 1 index). <strong>Implementation options: </strong>Higher bacteria abundance was found in plots with a double application of compost, compared to single application, in one of 16 comparisons (<em>Proteobacteria</em>: 1,658 vs 1,469 sequences), but lower bacteria abundance was found in one of 16 comparisons (another group: 34 vs 111 sequences). <strong>Methods</strong>: Compost was added to eight treatment plots (single application: 130 kg N/ha; double application: 260 kg N/ha), but not four control plots (5 x 8 m plots). After three years of compost addition, plants were dug up (three plants/plot) and soil that was clinging to plant roots was collected for sampling bacteria (through RNA sequencing).</p><p> </p>",

More nitrogen and/or phosphorus were found in soils with added compost, compared to soils without added compost, in some comparisons (up to 50% more nitrogen; number of significant comparisons not reported; percentage increase in phosphorus not reported). <strong>Methods: </strong>There were three plots (approximately 30 m<sup>2</sup>) for each of eight treatments (30 or 60 t/ha of added organic matter, with carbon-to-nitrogen ratios of 15:1 or 2:1, with or without mineral fertilizer) and two controls (no organic matter, with or without mineral fertilizer), on two farms. Composted municipal solid waste was mixed with poplar tree prunings to control carbon-to-nitrogen ratios in the organic matter. Crops were grown in unheated glasshouses (farm 1: lettuce and melon; farm 2: kohlrabi). Organic matter was added in early 2009 and 2010. Soil samples were collected at seven time points in two years (five subsamples/plot, 0–20 cm depth). It was not clear whether these results were a direct effect of adding compost or adding poplar prunings.</p><p> </p>",
