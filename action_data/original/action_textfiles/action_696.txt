Cutting in May, May and September, or June increased the number of plant species from 52/plot (at the beginning of the experiment) to 55/plot after eight years. Never cutting, or cutting every other June, were the only treatments to reduce species richness, to 38 and 49 species/plot, respectively.  Fertilizer treatments (NPK: nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium) (50:20:20 kg NPK/ha and 50 kg N/ha, with a June cut) led to dominance by a few species but did not reduce species richness.  The Arrhenatherion elatioris<em> </em>grassland included false oat grass <em>Arrhenatherum elatius</em>, cock’s foot <em>Dactylis glomerata</em> and Queen Anne’s lace <em>Daucus carota</em>.

Although there were significantly more meadow birds and territories of northern lapwing <em>Vanellus vanellus</em> and black-tailed godwit <em>Limosa limosa</em> on fields managed for meadow bird conservation than on conventionally farmed fields in 1995, these differences were at least partly because those meadows in the bird agreements scheme also had higher groundwater levels.

Impacts of grazing were mixed. One study found that the abundance of small mammals in wet meadows was increased by cattle grazing at intermediate intensities (around 0.5 cattle/ha) and reduced by much higher or lower stocking densities (Schmidt <em>et al</em>. 2005). Another study found that reintroducing cattle in a mosaic landscape with wet sedge meadows and drier grasslands reduced species richness, as the dry sites were overgrazed and the wet sites were avoided and remained ungrazed (Bakker &amp; Grootjans 1991). The review describes six studies that looked at the impact of mowing. Four studies found that hand mowing could be used to maintain sedge/water meadows (or fens) (Hansson &amp; Fogelfors 2000, Øien &amp; Moen 2001, Mitlacher <em>et al</em>. 2002, Billeter <em>et al</em>. 2003) and another found that re-instating mowing increased the population of the fen-orchid<em> Nigritella </em><em>nigra </em>(Moen &amp; Øien 2002). One study found that mowing resulted in higher species richness than grazing on an abandoned fen meadow (Hald &amp; Vinther 2000), while another found that mowing only increased species richness if the species were part of the standing crop, in the seed bank or could disperse to the site (Billeter <em>et al</em>. 2003).</p><p>Additional references:</p><p>Bakker J.P. &amp; Grootjans A.P.
