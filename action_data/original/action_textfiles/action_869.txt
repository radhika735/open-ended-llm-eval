Creation of additional breeding habitat may help to replace some of that lost and therefore help to maintain and increase amphibian populations. Different pond types can be created and some may be beneficial to certain species but not to others.  Also new ponds may promote establishment of non-target species, such as the American bullfrog <em>Lithobates catesbeianus</em> or predatory fish, which can compromise the aims of the project.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">Evidence from studies that monitored colonization of created ponds by amphibians in general is combined. Studies that targeted specific species have been separated into separate sections. Some of the targeted species may have colonized ponds monitored in the general amphibian section and vice versa. Study ‘ponds’ and ‘pools’ have been referred to as ‘ponds’ within this section.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">There is additional literature that shows that 40–75% of garden ponds are used as breeding sites by amphibians (Beebee 1979, 1984; Banks <em>et al.</em> 1986).

Of the 14 ponds used, 43% were used by more than one species for breeding. Ponds supporting three species were significantly deeper and tended to have higher nitrate concentrations than those supporting fewer. Species included American toad <em>Bufo americanus</em>, wood frog <em>Rana sylvatica</em>, mountain chorus frog <em>Pseudacris brachyphona</em> and Cope's grey tree frog <em>Hyla chrysoscelis</em>. Allegheny mountain dusky salamander <em>Desmognathus ochrophaeus</em> and spring salamander <em>Gyrinophilus porphyriticus</em> were present but not breeding. Ponds up to 28 m<sup>2</sup> and 37 cm deep were constructed randomly along an abandoned logging road six months after timber harvest. Monitoring was undertaken monthly in April-September 1993–1994. Dip-netting and funnel traps were used along drift-fences around each pond.</p><p> </p>",

Created seasonal water bodies supported 18 species (at least four were breeding), compared to 11 in created permanent water bodies and 24 in natural seasonal water bodies. The number of fish species was 15–16 in created and 10 in natural water bodies. Three amphibian species made up 99% of captures on golf courses with only permanent water bodies and 64% on those that had permanent and seasonal wetlands. Five golf courses from four to over 25 years old were selected. Three had permanent and two also had seasonal water bodies. Eleven natural seasonal wetlands were also sampled. Monitoring was over four days/three nights at two monthly intervals using minnow and hoop-net traps, dip-netting and visual surveys. Drift-fencing (50 m) with pitfall traps was installed at seasonal water bodies for one year.</p><p> </p>",

In autumn 2005–2007, ponds were created and restored in 27 clusters. Six clusters (46 ponds) were designed for great crested newts, two (31 ponds) for spadefoot toads and 19 (153 ponds) for both. Depths, sizes, slopes and shapes varied. Restoration included clearing vegetation, extracting mud, levelling banks, pond drying and ditch blocking (to eliminate fish). Before management, 405 ponds were surveyed. After restoration in 2006–2008, each pond was visited for 10 minutes of visual counts and dip-netting.</p><p> </p>",
