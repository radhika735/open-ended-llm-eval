Nitrate was usually higher in treatments with fewer crop types. Lower yields were recorded in organic compared to high or reduced input treatments (amounts not specified). Three input (tillage/management) levels (organic, reduced, high) were replicated four times. Within these input levels were three crop diversities: low (fallow/wheat <em>Triticum aestivum</em>/oilseed <em>Brassica juncea</em>); cereal (wheat / mustard <em>Brassica juncea</em> or canola <em>Brassica napus</em>/ lentil <em>Len culinaris</em> rotations; or grain (perennial forage crop (sweet clover <em>Melilotus officinalis</em>, pea <em>Pisum sativum</em>, flax <em>Linum usitatissimum </em>or alfalfa <em>Medicago sativa</em>)/ barley <em>Hordeum vulgare</em>) rotations. Within these were six crop phases, rotating the above species with green manure and fallow phases, which were tested in 40 x 12.8 m plots. Fertilizers and pesticides were not applied to the organic treatment. Crop rotations were six years long. Each year, two soil samples were taken from each crop phase (with a third also taken in 2006) to measure nitrate-N, carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus.</p><p> </p>",

Ten acres of sugarcane <em>Saccharum </em>sp<em>. </em>crop were selected in areas using either low chemical input cultivation or high chemical input cultivation (nitrogen (70 kg/acre), phosphorus (50 kg/acre), potassium (70-80 kg/acre), calcium (7 kg/acre), sulphur (12 kg/acre), magnesium (12 kg/acre) and organic fertilizers (2400-3200 kg/acre)), or low chemical input cultivation (using anything less than the high chemical input treatment).

Broad differences in soil microbial community properties were found between farms classified as high-input, intensive, and low-input systems. The high-input systems were described as intensive cultivation systems under plastic cover, while low-input systems were described as orchards. Soil samples were taken from three plastic tunnels in each high-input system and from one area of orchard in each low-input system, then analysed for biochemical and biological properties in the laboratory.</p><p> </p>",
