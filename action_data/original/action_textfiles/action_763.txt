Frogs treated with trimethoprim-sulfadiazine survived longer than untreated frogs. Juveniles were experimentally infected with the chytrid fungus <em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</em>. Once excessive skin shedding had started, frogs were treated with trimethoprim-sulfadiazine (0.1% solution). Frogs were immersed in the treatment for five minutes each day for 11 consecutive days. Controls were untreated. Frogs were then killed humanely and examined.</p><p> </p>",

At the end of five days’ treatment with chloramphenicol ointment, the infection was significantly reduced (zoospore equivalents: 176–217 to 7). Over the following three months the frog tested negative for chytridiomycosis in five tests. Chloramphenicol treatment did not appear to have any effect on weight, behaviour or health. The frog had 5 mg of chloramphenicol ointment applied to its back for five days. Four other wild caught frogs had chloramphenicol in water (10 mg/L) added to their containers. Containers were disinfected with 70% ethanol and the treatment solution changed daily for five days. They were tested for the chytrid fungus on arrival, at 2, 4, 8, 14 and 19 weeks and at the end of the trial. Behaviour, food consumption and weight gain was monitored daily.</p><p> </p>",

The three terminally infected frogs also received electrolyte fluids and increased ambient temperature from 22 to 28°C. All 18 infected frogs bathed in chloramphenicol solution were clinically normal within 4–5 days and cured by day 13–17. All five terminally infected frogs that did not receive treatment died within 24–48 hours. Treated controls remained uninfected and clinically normal. Frogs were collected from the wild and randomly assigned to treatments. Seventeen frogs experimentally infected with chytridiomycosis and one naturally infected frog received treatment and five infected (one naturally) were controls. Eighteen uninfected frogs were also treated. Treatment was continuous immersion in 20 mg/L chloramphenicol solution for 14 (<em>n</em> = 3) or 28 (<em>n</em>= 15) days. Solutions were changed daily. Three terminally infected frogs also received electrolyte fluids under the skin every eight hours for six days and increased ambient temperature (from 22 to 28°C). Frogs were swabbed for testing every seven days for 34 days and at 102 days.</p><p> </p>",
