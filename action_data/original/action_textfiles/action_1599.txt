        "background_definitions": "<p>Both host-specific insects and grass carp have been used for the biocontrol of parrot’s feather with some success (Moreira <em>et al.</em> 1999; Hill &amp; Coetzee 2017), however, also native vertebrate herbivores and livestock can consume invasive aquatic plants and consequently can contribute to inhibit their establishment, growth and expansion (Gassman <em>et al</em>. 2006).</p>\r\n<p>The potential of host-specific insects to act as biocontrol agents depends on their ability to cause harm to the target plant, and may also be limited by the climatic conditions required by the insect species (Gassman <em>et al</em>. 2006). Although several insects have been suggested as potential control agents for parrot’s feather (e.g. the stem-boring weevil<em> Listronotus marginicollis </em>has been found to show a feeding and host preference for parrot’s feather, often killing its terminal bud (Oberholzer <em>et al.</em> 2007)), none seem to be in use. Grass carp <em>Ctenopharyngodon idella </em>consume large amounts of vegetation, and sterile fish have been used for the management and eradication of invasive aquatic plants (Hussner <em>et al</em>. 2017). However, grass carp are generalist herbivores and will consume all palatable plants available to them (Dorenbosch &amp; Bakker 2011, Pine &amp; Anderson 1991). The introduction of non-native control agents, such as herbivorous insects and grass carp, should only be considered following in-depth studies investigating possible undesired consequences to non-target species (Hussner <em>et al</em>. 2017).</p>\r\n<p>Herbivory by both native vertebrates and livestock is often used as a conservation measure in terrestrial habitats. Depending on the dietary preferences of the animals, herbivory can also affect the competitive advantage of aquatic species such as parrot’s feather, and consequently increase biotic resistance of freshwater ecosystems to invasive plants. As an example, herbivory by North American beavers <em>Castor canadensis</em> reduced the abundance of parrot’s feather by 90% (Parker <em>et al.</em> 2007). The impact of terrestrial herbivores may be restricted to the margins of waterbodies or marshy areas, but aquatic and amphibious herbivores such as beavers can affect plant communities further away from water margins.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Dorenbosch M. &amp; Bakker E.S.

Grass carp favoured soft-tissue native plants relative to parrot’s feather. When presented only with parrot’s feather and water hyacinth <em>Eichhornia crassipes,</em> one year old grass carp consumed parrot’s feather at a daily rate of approximately 3% of their body weight but this increased to 20% by the age of two. Trials were conducted in six 660 l plastic tanks. Five tanks were stocked with carp and one control tank had no carp. Grass carp were presented with a selection of four plants with a total fresh weight similar to the biomass of fish present in the tank. After two days, the biomass of each plant species was weighed.

Although it is possible to skip actions, we encourage you to score them all using the evidence provided.</li>\r\n<li>Open each action in the <strong>Pending</strong> tab in turn by clicking on the title. Start by reading all the summarised evidence we have found. Each action with evidence available will have:</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>a) <strong>Background section</strong>, describing the intervention;</p>\r\n<p>b) <strong>Key messages</strong>, providing an overview of the evidence;</p>\r\n<p>c) <strong>Supporting evidence,</strong> containing summaries of each study that tested the action. Clicking on the link beside the number will take you to the reference details.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong><em>Based on the evidence provided </em>please enter scores</strong> for the effectiveness, certainty and harms of the action, using a scale from 0-100. It is critical that your answers are based on information in the synopsis. Your expertise is invaluable for understanding and interpreting the evidence, but please do not base your assessments on your own personal knowledge or anecdotal evidence about an intervention.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>EFFECTIVENESS</strong>: The ‘effectiveness’ scale is from 0 (ineffective) to 100 (always effective), and should reflect how good an intervention is at benefitting the controlling the target invasive species. This could be evaluated in a variety of different ways. For example, we could measure the decrease in cover of a plant or the percentage mortality of an invasive animal. We would like you to score according to what we know about whether the <em>ultimate objective</em> of the intervention is being achieved, i.e. whether the intervention leads to an reduction of the target invasive species in the natural habitat where they require control.</p>\r\n<p><strong>CERTAINTY</strong>: The ‘certainty of evidence’ is a rating of how confident we can be about the effectiveness of an action, from 0 (no certainty; no useful evidence) to 100 (complete certainty; high quality evidence). To assess this, consider the quality of the evidence for the action. You should think about the number of studies, their coverage and wider applicability (species, geographical), the similarity of results across studies and the robustness of the experimental designs (e.g. randomised, replicated, controlled experiments with a large sample size will give more dependable results than a single before-and-after comparison).</p>\r\n<p><strong>HARMS</strong>:The ‘harms’ scale is from 0 (none) to 100 (major; this equates to an increase in parrot’s feather). For the sake of this assessment, ‘harms’ should be a measure of any negative effects, in terms of the introduction, establishment and spread of parrot’s feathers, that are caused by the action. We are aware that some actions in the assessment are likely to have potential negative impacts on non-target native species (e.g. draining a waterbody to control a non-native plant may also have impacts on native animal and plant species). However, this information was rarely presented in the evidence summarized, and hence is not present in the synopsis. Considering that your assessment should be based only on the information presented in the synopsis, the category ‘harms’ should therefore only consider information relating to the impact of the action upon parrot’s feather. Where relevant, potential harms to native species or habitats will be flagged up in the Background section of an intervention to ensure that the user is aware that these should be considered before implementing this intervention.</p>\r\n<p>Remember, you can exit and return to the survey several times at your convenience. You can also move backwards and forwards between interventions if necessary.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Please add a <strong>Score Comment</strong> for any actions where you feel this is useful. This is particularly important if your score does not follow obviously from the evidence provided, for example if you have given some studies more weight than others because of your knowledge of the system.</li>\r\n<li>Once you have opened an action, and either scored it or skipped it, it will be moved to the corresponding tab. Until you submit your final scores, you can re-open actions that have been moved to these tabs to check them or alter your scores if you need to.</li>\r\n<li>When you have moved all the actions from the <strong>Pending</strong> tab to the <strong>Scored</strong> tab, and you are happy with your scores for the assessment, please submit your final scores. Do this using the link on the left hand side of the assessment page.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><em>N.B.
