She introduced between three and 13 inseminated queens each year over four consecutive years, and found that the small population retained diversity in its sex allele over nine years. It did not increase its production of sterile diploid males or collapse to extinction, as might have been expected. Carvalho recommends exchange of inseminated queens between beekeepers as a way to ensure the survival of small meliponiaries.</p>",
