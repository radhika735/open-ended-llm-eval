For example, in the UK swamp stonecrop <em>Crassula helmsii</em> can out-compete native plant species and form thick mats covering whole ponds. In parts of the USA, invasive reed canarygrass <em>Phalaris arundinacea</em> is widespread and develops dense, tall stands in shallow wetland habitats. Invasive water fern <em>Azolla filiculoides</em> has been found to cause declines in amphibian populations (Gratwicke &amp; Marshall 2003) and Japanease knotweed <em>Fallopia japonica</em> to reduce foraging success of green frogs <em>Rana clamitans</em> (Maerz <em>et al.</em> 2005).</p>\r\n<p class=\"References\">Gratwicke B. &amp; Marshall B.E.

Spawn string counts, which relate to the female breeding population, increased from 15 to 43. Swamp stonecrop was eliminated from two of six new ponds it invaded and controlled in two others. Nine small ponds (&lt; 1,000 m<sup>2</sup>) were created and four restored by excavation. Swamp stonecrop was pulled up and treated with herbicide. In addition, one pond was treated with limestone (1983–1989), scrub was cleared by cutting and uprooting (40 ha) and bracken was treated with herbicide (12 ha). Captive-reared toadlets were released in 1975 (8,800), 1979, 1980 and 1981 (1,000 each). Each year, toads were monitored every 10 days in March and August.</p><p> </p>",

No eggs were laid in unmown plots. Egg mass clusters (1–18 egg masses) were recorded in two of 32 mown plots. Three egg mass clusters (5–20 masses) were also recorded outside study plots in habitat that appeared structurally similar to mown plots. Breeding sites were located using systematic searches within the reed canarygrass dominated wetland. Four of seven sites found were selected and used as the centre of a 30 m diameter circle. Within each circle, eight pairs of randomly located 3 m diameter plots were created. One of each pair was mown close to the ground in August 2000. Breeding was monitored in February–March 2001 using visual encounter surveys.</p><p> </p>",
