Hatching success was similar between caged and uncaged nests in areas of high footfall (caged: 66–67%, uncaged: 66–71%) and low footfall (caged: 75–76%, uncaged: 66–76%). In May–October 1996, fifty-eight paired sea turtle nests were either uncovered or covered with square wire cages (76 cm square, 107 cm tall, 5 x 10 cm mesh) anchored 30 cm in the sand in both low (66 total nests, 4,209 caged eggs, 3,888 uncaged eggs, 20 beach users/hour, two beach zones) and high traffic beaches (50 total nests, 3,678 caged eggs, 4,991 uncaged eggs, 50 beach users/hour, two beach zones. Hatching success was determined by excavating nests three days after hatchlings emerged to count successfully hatched eggs.</p>",

Hatching success for caged nests varied from 44–72%, compared to 56–68% for uncaged in situ nests and 51–75% for nests moved to an on-beach hatchery. From 1988–1995, nests located within 7 m of the sea and in danger of inundation were moved to a beach hatchery (77 nests) as were nests located near invasive plants which had root systems that grow into nests. From 1990, nests located in beach areas with tourists were protected by 50 cm circular metal mesh cages buried 15 cm in the sand (88 nests). A further 313 nests were left uncaged and in situ. Nests were excavated following hatchling emergence to assess hatching success.</p>",
