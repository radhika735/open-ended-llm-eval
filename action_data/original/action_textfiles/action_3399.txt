In six of 12 comparisons, the number of grass species was higher in plots where individual plants had been planted (5–12 species/plot) than in areas where no plants were planted (4–10 species/plot), while in six comparisons the number of grass species was equal to or lower than that found in areas where no plants were planted (5–13 species/plot vs 5–13 species/plot). In 10 of 12 comparisons, forb species richness was higher in areas where plants were planted (7–22 species/plot) than where no plants were planted (4–15 species/plot), while in two comparisons there were equal or fewer numbers of forb species (4–5 species/plot vs 5 species/plot). In 1994, at each site, plants of nine forb species were planted in four 6 × 4 m plots, and no plants were planted in another four plots. In May/June of 1995 and 1996, the frequency of each grass and forb species was recorded in three 40 x 40 cm quadrats in each plot.</p>",

During the year following transplantation, new seedlings emerged up to 4.5 m from transplanted pepper saxifrage plants, although the majority (74%) were recorded within 1.5 m. Forty new seedlings were monitored with 44% surviving for at least four months after germination. In 1998, fifteen pepper saxifrage plants with almost ripe seeds were transplanted to the centre of each of four 10-m<sup>2</sup> plots within a floodplain. The site was managed with grazing and cutting. In May and July 1999, new seedlings were recorded within 50 x 0.25 m<sup>2</sup> quadrats positioned in circles at distances of 1–5 m around each transplant.

After one to four years, areas that were planted and seeded contained more species (16–19) than those that were only seeded (6–12). The number of native species was also higher in the planted and seeded plots compared to the seeded only plots (data not given). Both treatments were carried out on former arable land using locally collected seed. The planting and seeding treatment was applied to a different 14 x 24 m plot each year from 2001–2004. Seedlings of 11 species were planted. The seeding treatment was applied to a different parcel of land each autumn from 1998–2004. No information was provided about the size of seeded areas, seeding rates or timing. Seeded plots were mown in the first year after planting, and invasive plants were treated with herbicide.
