        "background_definitions": "<p>Agricultural land often receives high chemical inputs to control pests, weeds and fungal infections, and to fertilize crops. These chemicals also enter water bodies through spray drift or run off. These chemicals may impact reptiles through reducing plant and insect diversity, direct toxicity, and endocrine disruption.</p>\r\n<p>The toxic effects of many organochlorine pesticides are well-studied in reptiles (e.g. DDT, diazion). Turtle species may be most risk from pesticide use because of their long life-span leading to bioaccumulation effects (Wagner <em>et al. </em>2015). Endocrine disruptors in the environment are usually associated with polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) contamination, both of which have been banned in many parts of the world. There are strong associations between organochlorine contamination and feminisation in alligators <em>Alligator mississippiensis </em>(Guillette <em>et al</em>. 1994) and mortality in turtles (Eisenreich <em>et al</em>. 2009). Despite the bans, problems for wildlife have continued due to the persistence of the contaminants in the environment.</p>\r\n<p>The direct impact of fertilizers on reptiles may very between species (e.g. Marco <em>et al. </em>2004; De Solla &amp; Martin 2007), but by altering plant communities in waterways and other surrounding habitats, they may have important indirect impacts on reptile populations.</p>\r\n<p>Organic farming, an agricultural system that excludes the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides and relies on techniques such as crop rotation, compost and biological pest control, is included within this intervention.</p>\r\n<p><sup>De Solla S.R. &amp; Martin P.A.
