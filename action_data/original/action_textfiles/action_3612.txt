            "paragraph_text": "<p>A replicated study in 2004–2011 in pelagic waters in the Eastern Pacific Ocean (Parga <em>et al. </em>2015) found that using fish instead of squid bait reduced the likelihood of olive ridley turtles <em>Lepidochelys olivacea </em>swallowing hooks in an artisanal surface longline fishery. When fish bait was used, hooks were less likely to be swallowed by olive ridley turtles than when squid bait was used (results reported as odds ratios, see original paper for details). Using fish bait in combination with larger circle hooks lead to the largest proportion of external hookings. In 2004–2011, incidental catch rates of sea turtles on circle hooks (sizes 12/0–18/0), tuna hooks and traditional J-hooks (see original paper for hook details) were compared by placing hooks in alternative sequence along longlines (3.5 million total hooks used in 8,996 line deployments) in an artisanal longline fishery. Bait used was classed as squid (<em>Dosidicus gigas, Illex </em>sp. and<em> Loligo </em>sp.) or fish (<em>Opisthonema </em>spp.,<em> Scomber japonicus, Auxis </em>spp. and<em> Sardinops sagax</em>) and only deployments using one type of bait were included in the analysis (4,838 of 8,996 line deployments). Information on hooking location and entanglement of sea turtles was recorded (1,823 total olive ridley turtles).</p>",

            "paragraph_text": "<p>A replicated, before-and-after study in pelagic longline fisheries in the Atlantic and North Pacific (Swimmer <em>et al. </em>2017) found that using fish bait resulted in less leatherback <em>Dermochelys coriacea</em> and loggerhead <em>Caretta caretta</em> turtle bycatch compared to when squid bait was used. The number of turtles caught on longlines was lower in the Atlantic when fish bait was used (leatherback: 0–6% chance with circle hooks, 13% with J hooks; Loggerhead: 0–5% with circle hooks, 9% with J hooks) compared to squid bait (leatherback: 9% with circle hooks, 20% with J hooks; Loggerhead: 11% with circle hooks, 18% with J hooks). The same was true in the Pacific (loggerhead: circle hook: 1% with fish, 2% with squid; j hook: 5% with fish, 13% with squid). Following the introduction of regulations on bait and hooks, overall turtle bycatch was reduced in both the Atlantic (leatherback: 40% reduction; loggerhead: 61% reduction) and Pacific (leatherback: 84% reduction; loggerhead 95% reduction). Fisheries were closed in 2001 and re-opened with regulations regarding bait (fish or squid) and hook type (circle or J hooks) (see paper for details). Pelagic Observer Program data from before (1992–2001) and after (2004–2015) regulations was used to determine the number of turtles caught/1,000 hooks.</p>",
