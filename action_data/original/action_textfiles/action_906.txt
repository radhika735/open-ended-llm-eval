        "background_definitions": "<p>There are several ways of tilling the soil in preparation for crop planting. Harrowing and ploughing are also known as conventional tillage. Harrowing is the disturbing or breaking up of soil using an agricultural implement with spike-like teeth (tines) or upright discs. Mouldboard ploughing involves using a plough that turns the soil. Both methods plough to 20 cm depth or more. Shallow tillage uses the same techniques as conventional tillage, but involves only tilling to 15 cm or less in depth. Conservation tillage comprises several methods of soil tillage which leave a minimum of 30% of crop residue on the soil surface. No-tillage involves direct drilling of crops straight into the soil, or leaving fields fallow without disturbing the soil.</p>\r\n<p>Many different measures can be used to determine the health of the soil. Soil porosity is a measure of the volume of air in soil (an indicator of good soil structure, which tends to occur in healthy soils). Bulk density is a measure of the density of the soil. Unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is the ability of the soil to transmit water when a hydraulic (water) gradient is applied. Soil microbial biomass is the amount of tiny living organisms in a given amount of soil. Nematodes are tiny, often microscopic worms. Having high numbers of microbes or nematodes in the soil is generally an indicator of good soil health. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are a group of fungi that live around the roots of plants. By living together, the fungi and host plant benefit each other: the fungi can live in a habitat without having to compete for resources and have a supply of carbon from the plant, while they provide an enhanced supply of nutrients to the plant, improving plant growth, the ability to reproduce and tolerance to drought. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonize a wide variety of host plants, including grasses, herbs, agricultural crops and legumes (Bardgett 2005).</p>\r\n<p>Bardgett (2005) <em>The Biology of Soil: A community and ecosystem approach</em>.

Conventional tillage with panicum was less effective (5.2 t/ha, 356 mm) than conventional tillage with palmarosa. Maize <em>Zea mays</em> yield was 43% higher under minimal tillage with palmarosa compared to no vegetation barrier with conventional tillage. The succeeding wheat <em>Triticum aestivum</em> yield was on average 73% higher in the palmarosa relative to panicum treatment, and 99% higher than with no vegetation barrier. It was not clear whether these results were due to organic amendments, mulching or reduced tillage. There were three replications of three treatments in a maize-wheat crop rotation: conventional tillage with no vegetation barrier but applying fertilizers and herbicides; conventional tillage with a panicum <em>Panicum maximum </em>vegetation barrier, fertilizers and herbicides; minimal tillage (30% crop cover retained) with a palmarosa vegetation barrier plus mulching and farmyard manure, vermicompost (produced by worms) and poultry manure applications. Plots were 100 x 20 m.</p><p> </p>",

This was due to the higher levels of soil organic carbon in the no-till (2.3-8.3% organic matter) compared to conventionally tilled plots (1.2-2.4% organic matter). There were four replications of citrus-cropped soil plots (species and plot size not specified).

The trial used four crop rotation and tillage treatments: , rape and rice with full tillage, rape and rice with continuous no tillage, rape without but rice<em> </em>with tillage, and rape and rice without tillage but with mulches. Tillage plots were tilled by hand to 10 cm depth then mouldboard ploughed to 30 cm depth.

There were four replicates (sites). Sugar beet was followed by two years of winter wheat as crop rotations. At each site, one field was chosen and divided into three plots (size not specified). Each plot had a different tillage treatment: conventional tillage (25-30 cm deep), mulch tillage (10-15 cm), no-tillage. In 2010, 15 soil samples were taken from each treatment.
