        "background_definitions": "<p>Spearfishing is a technique of hunting fish underwater, historically with sharpened or barbed sticks, but in current times often using powered metal spearguns. Spearfishing is done by free diving, snorkelling or scuba diving and is one of the few fishing techniques where each target fish is individually selected, and unwanted catch is virtually nil. However, spearfishing is widely used, is an effective and efficient method of harvesting fish and activities may be concentrated at habitats such as reefs. In heavily targeted areas, local fish populations can be severely depleted (Dulvy &amp; Polunin 2004; Godoy <em>et al</em>. 2010) or may suffer other impacts related to the removal of particular sizes or sexes of fish (Alonzo &amp; Mangel 2004). Spearfishing activity is managed throughout the world with a wide range of restrictions ranging from complete bans to prohibiting the use of scuba or spearguns or allowing only recreational spearfishing. Prohibiting spearfishing may often be implemented in marine protected areas with the aim of preventing localised overfishing or selective removal of parts of the fish population.</p>\r\n<p>Alonzo S.H. &amp; Mangel M.

Average abundance of both species was higher inside the reserve (seabass: 3.9 fish/400 m, bream: 0.7 fish/400 m) than outside (seabass: 0.7 fish/400 m, bream: 0.1 fish/400 m). Average length of seabass was higher inside the reserve (381 mm) compared to outside (212 mm). In addition, average length of gilt head bream was lower inside the reserve (379 mm) than outside (400 mm), but this was not tested statistically due to low sample size outside of the reserve. Data were collected in July 1995 over 26 km of coastline with varied habitat types from Cape Bear to Terrimbau Bay. In the centre is the Banyuls-sur-Mer marine reserve (10 km), where spearfishing was banned throughout (year implemented not reported), but other fishing practices were allowed. Snorkellers counted and recorded lengths of all seabass and gilthead bream along 64 transects of 400 m within 5 m of the shore.</p>",

The densities of all sizes of commonly harvested fish differed between protected and non-protected areas at shallow but not deeper depths (data reported as statistical results). Abundance of legal sized (&gt;200 mm), but not small red morwong <em>Cheilodactylus fuscus</em> was higher inside the reserve than outside at both shallow (1.3 vs 0.3/200 m<sup>2</sup>) and deep (2.8 vs 1.2/200 m<sup>2</sup>) reefs, and abundance of legal-sized (&gt;200 mm) yellowfin bream <em>Acanthopagrus australis </em>was higher inside than outside at shallow reefs (0.7 vs 0.3/200 m<sup>2</sup>) but similar at deep reefs (0.2 vs 0.1/200 m<sup>2</sup>). There were no effects of protection on densities of five other groups (see paper for details of groups), but there were differences with depth and sampling time (data reported as statistical models). Spearfishing was banned in January 1992 at the Gordons Bay area (0.1 km<sup>2</sup>) of the Bronte-Coogee Aquatic Reserve. Recreational line fishing and collection of rock lobsters and bait weed were permitted but eastern blue groper <em>Achoerodus viridis </em>may not be taken by any method. Between November 2002–2004, fish were sampled six times by underwater visual census at one location within the reserve and three reference areas outside (10–80 km away).

Individual catch rates were higher inside the no-take zone than the fished zone for all four species in each year: slinger <em>Chrysoblephus puniceus</em> (3.1 vs 0.8 fish/angler/h), Scotsman <em>Polysteganus praeorbitalis</em> (1.2 vs 0.3 fish/angler/h), poenskop <em>Cymatoceps nasutus</em> (0.4 vs 0.2 fish/angler/h) and yellowbelly rockcod <em>Epinephelus marginatus</em> (0.6 vs 0.1 fish/angler/h), and average lengths were also higher (slinger: 293 vs 240, Scotsman: 415 vs 359, poenskop: 417 vs 380, rockcod: 495 vs 435 mm). In addition, three of the four species (slinger, Scotsman, rockcod) showed increases in size over time (data not tested statistically). The Pondoland Marine Protected Area (800 km<sup>2</sup>) was designated in 2004 and comprises a central ‘no-take area’ (400 km<sup>2</sup>) closed to all offshore (vessel based) exploitation. On either side of the no-take zone are two controlled fishing areas where offshore line fishing and spearfishing are permitted. No commercial fishing, such as trawling or long-lining, is permitted anywhere in the protected area. From April 2006 to June 2011, quarterly research angling was conducted at two sites in the no-take zone and two in the nearby exploited zone (6 h angling in each zone) at 10–30 m depth.
