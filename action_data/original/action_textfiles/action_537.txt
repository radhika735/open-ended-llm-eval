Nestlings from fed nests, however, were no heavier than those from controls, when comparing first-hatched with first-hatched etc. Supplementary food consisted of one domestic hen’s egg and five dead hen chicks provided every day from when laying began and increasing to one egg and ten chicks from the seventh day after hatching until fledging. Other experiments in this study found that winter feeding (a hen’s egg and five chicks provided between January and April 1973) led to crows laying clutches earlier but did not affect clutch size (average laying date of April 13<sup>th</sup> and 4.4 eggs/clutch for ten fed territories vs. April 18<sup>th</sup> and 4.3 eggs/clutch for 21 controls). Further experiments examined the effect of moving supplementary food further from nests, but the author argues that these results are confounded by supplementary food being taken by non-target birds. Finally, additional experiments in the study found that crow nesting density did not increase following the provision of supplementary food and additional nesting sites in breeding territories, discussed in ‘Provide artificial nesting sites’.</p><p> </p>",

However, in 1978 clutch size was significantly lower in fed territories (3.4 eggs/clutch, 122 fed clutches vs. 3.6 eggs/clutch for 126 controls), the authors suggest this is due to early-laid clutches being smaller – if clutches laid before April 10<sup>th</sup> were excluded then clutches were not significantly smaller. Fed territories provided with supplementary food also had higher rates of chick mortality than control territories (numbers not provided) and were invaded by non-territorial red-winged and yellow-headed blackbirds <em>Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus</em> at significantly higher rates than controls in 1978 (4.9 intruders/ha in 33 fed territories vs. 1.1/ha for 54 controls), but not in 1977, or when feeder density was reduced in 1978 (0.8 intruders/ha for 17 fed territories vs. 1.3 intruders/ha for 19 controls).

Very few adult magpies visited food stations. Dominant juvenile males, however, established nests significantly closer to food stations. Of seven nests within 100 m of food stations, six experienced nestling starvation while only one farther than 100 m did. Supplementary feeding did not enhance clutch (6.4 and 6.4 eggs/nest) or brood (5.0 and 4.8 nestlings / nest) size between nests closer to food stations (16 nests) and those further away (13 nests). Similarly, mean clutch initiation was not significantly different between treatments.

Parents from fed territories were also more likely to have second clutches than controls (12 of 14 fed pairs attempted second broods vs. seven of 14 control pairs). Fed nestlings were also larger and had higher post-fledging survival rates in 1986 but not 1987 (1986: 14 pairs, linear measurements 1.0-2.7 mm larger than controls, 15 fed fledglings surviving for four to six weeks after fledging vs. seven control fledglings; 1987: 14 pairs, linear measurements 0.2-0.6 mm larger than controls, 19 fed fledglings surviving vs. 16 controls). The authors suggest that differences between years were due to higher levels of natural food occurring in 1987. Supplementary food consisted of 35 g of mealworm <em>Tenebrio molitor</em> larvae and noctuid moth caterpillars supplied every other day from one or two days after hatching until nestlings fledged (approximately 20 days later) and comprised 75% (1986) and 80% (1987) of food delivered to nests.</p><p> </p>",

In drier-than-average years, fed pairs also raised more fledglings to independence (40 days old) than other pairs (1.8 more fledglings than control pairs, 0.7 more than rodent control only pairs). There was no effect in wetter-than-average years. Management in December-March did not increase either measure of productivity.

The authors suggest that this difference is due to broad-leaved oak forests having up to ten times more food for blue tits than holm oak forests. Clutch size did not differ between fed and control territories in any of the sites. Supplementary feeding comprised unlimited access to food in feeders within territories, beginning in mid-January and continuing until egg laying began.</p><p> </p>",
