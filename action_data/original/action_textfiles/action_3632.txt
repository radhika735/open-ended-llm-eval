Three years after woody debris was retained prior to replanting, reptile species richness and abundance were higher (richness: 13 species/trapping array, abundance: 41 individuals/array) than after ground cover was cleared and burned (richness: 9, abundance: 19) and similar to uncut forest (richness: 15, abundance: 52). Overall burrow and refugia-dwelling reptiles and amphibians were more abundant in areas where woody debris was retained compared to where ground cover was cleared and burned or in uncut forest (see paper for individual species abundances). Two of three sites (49–140 ha) were clearcut in 1978 and then managed by retaining woody debris cover (in 1978: 59% harvested by chainsaw, January–August 1979: roller chopped twice) or clearing and burning cover (1978: 74% harvested by feller-buncher, January–August 1979: stump removal, burned, harrowed) prior to replanting in September–November 1979. Reptiles were sampled weekly from August 1981 to October 1982 using four drift fence arrays (four 7.5 x 50 cm galvanised flashing fences in a plus-shape with three aluminium window screen funnel traps on each arm) at all three sites.</p>",

After six and 18 months, overall richness and abundance of immigrating reptiles were statistically similar between clearcutting with debris left in place (average change in richness: 45–66% decline, abundance: 54–79% decline), clearcutting with replanting (27–59% decline, 43–70% decline) and no harvesting (28–72% decline, 51–77% decline) compared to before management was carried out. See original paper for details of groups of and individual species changes in immigration compared to before management. Pine <em>Pinus spalustris </em>plantations (&lt;10 ha each) surrounding five wetlands (0.4–1.1 ha) were divided into three and managed in June 1998 by: clearcutting with residual woody debris/slash left in place, clearcutting with replanting (including mechanical site preparation prior to planting), or no harvesting. Reptile movements from the adjacent wetlands were monitored by enclosing each wetland with a drift fence, with pairs of pitfall traps placed every 10 m along the fence. Pitfalls were checked daily in June–December 1997 (pre-treatment), 1998 (6 months post-treatment) and 1999 (18 months post-treatment).
