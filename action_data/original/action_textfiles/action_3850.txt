This may include walking, cycling or riding trails, adventure sports or camping. These activities are likely to have a detrimental effect on many species of butterfly and moth, by increasing disturbance and making some areas of habitat unsuitable. Restricting recreational activities to specific areas of a park or reserve may help to minimize these impacts, by limiting the area of disturbance and allowing species to survive in the remaining, undisturbed areas.</p>",
