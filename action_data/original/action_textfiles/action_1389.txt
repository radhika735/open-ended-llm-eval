A separate three-year experiment (1999–2001) found higher nitrate levels in streams in ungrazed plots, compared to grazed plots. <strong>Nutrients:</strong> A five-year experiment found no differences between ungrazed and grazed plots in nitrate or pH levels in surface water (data not reported). A three-year experiment found higher nitrate levels in streams in ungrazed plots, compared to grazed plots (81–1,200 vs 23–100 micromoles). <strong>Methods: </strong>A five-year experiment from 1992–1996 was established in three meadows. Within each meadow, three watersheds were randomly assigned to one grazing intensity: cattle excluded, light grazing (leaving 800–1,000 pounds of residual dry matter at the end of the season), or moderate grazing (leaving 600–700 pounds). Samples were taken from the spring and along the creek in each watershed. The second experiment was in 1999–2002 in marshy areas in four meadows. Two plots were established in each meadow: one ungrazed and one with moderate grazing. Water samples were taken monthly.</p><p> </p>",
