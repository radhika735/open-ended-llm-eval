            "paragraph_text": "<p>A study in 1999–2008 on a roadside verge along a river bank in Pennsylvania, USA (Nagle &amp; Congdon 2016) found that when turtles were actively moved off a road after a chain-link fence was installed along a highway and artificial nest mounds were created on the non-road side of the fence, fewer female northern map turtles <em>Graptemys geographica </em>were killed on the road compared to before any interventions began. Results were not statistically tested. In the 2<sup>nd</sup> to 8<sup>th</sup> year after a fence was installed on a new major highway, when turtles were being actively removed from the road, 0–5 map turtles died on the road/year (no data for other species). In the first year after a fence was installed, 10 northern map turtles were killed on the road, and in the years before installation 50 turtles were killed on the road (total included a small number of wood turtles <em>Glyptemus insculpta </em>and snapping turtles <em>Chelydra serpentina</em>).  The authors reported that most deaths were gravid female turtles. In 2000, a fence (1 m high and 1,150 m long) was installed on the river side of the highway to prevent turtles from crossing the road to access nesting habitat. Mounds of sand aimed at providing alternative nesting habitat were added to the river side of the fence in 2000–2001. After the first year, the fence was extended by 300 m to prevent turtles from going around it and crushed shale was added to the sand mounds and turtles were actively moved off the road. Turtle deaths on the road were counted from 1999 (the first year after a new highway opened) to 2008 (excluding 2004).</p>",
