Whilst too small to damage most adult birds, they can have severe impacts on chicks. Due to their huge numbers and adaptability eradication is rarely an option (although see ‘Control invasive ants on islands’). Therefore preventing them from accessing nests may be the best intervention.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

The same effect was seen in 13 experimental and 14 control black-capped vireo <em>V. atricapilla</em> nests, but this difference (13% vs. 7%) was non-significant. The physical barrier was Tanglefoot – a gum resin that traps crawling insects, applied to the branch &gt;25 cm from each nest; the repellent was Arinix™ spiral wrap – a permethrin releasing plastic wrapped around the branch on top of the Tanglefoot.</p><p> </p>",
