        "background_definitions": "<p><strong>Definition:</strong> ‘Controlling or removing non-native or nuisance species’ includes actions taken to reduce the abundance of non-native or nuisance organisms on structures, with the aim of enhancing their biodiversity.</p>\r\n<p>Marine artificial structures often support non-native and nuisance species (Airoldi <em>et al.</em> 2015; Dafforn 2017), especially those built in urban areas with high vessel movement, disturbance from human activity and poor water quality (Airoldi &amp; Bulleri 2011; Mineur <em>et al.</em> 2012). This can have negative effects on native marine biodiversity on and around structures, as well as on humans.</p>\r\n<p>It may be possible to control or remove non-native or nuisance species on subtidal artificial structures to enhance their biodiversity, using mechanical, chemical or biological methods. However, careful consideration must be given to what constitutes a non-native or nuisance species in any given location and scenario, to warrant its control or removal. In this synopsis, species are considered non-native when considered-so in the original study. However, ‘nuisance’ species that are not also non-native only includes those that have a negative effect on native biodiversity (e.g. by dominating space or smothering) – <em>not</em> those that are only a nuisance to society (e.g. by creating slippery surfaces, overgrowing aquaculture species, or fouling infrastructure). Care must also be taken to avoid causing unintended harm to non-target organisms (Locke <em>et al.</em> 2009).</p>\r\n<p>Studies investigating control/removal actions that are indiscriminate and simultaneously remove all biodiversity from structure surfaces (e.g. Novak <em>et al.</em> 2017) or aim to prevent or reduce colonization in the first place for the benefit of humans (i.e. biofouling reduction; Scardino &amp; de Nys 2011) are not included in this synopsis, which focusses on actions to enhance the biodiversity of artificial structures. Studies that only report the effects of actions on the controlled/removed species itself and not on the wider native biodiversity of structures are not included. Studies that report the effects of patch-scale control/removal, where continued presence on surrounding surfaces would be expected to influence conservation outcomes in practice, are not included but are informative (e.g. Dumont <em>et al.</em> 2011). Studies that investigate the effects of actions associated with maintenance or harvesting activities that reduce the likelihood of non-native species occupying bare space made available on structure surfaces following these activities are not considered here, but are included under “<a href=\"../../actions/3447\"><em>Cease or alter maintenance activities on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>” and “<a href=\"../../actions/3457\"><em>Manage or restrict harvesting of species on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>”.</p>\r\n<p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href=\"../../actions/3447\"><em>Cease or alter maintenance activities on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3457\"><em>Manage or restrict harvesting of species on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>.</p>\r\n<p><sup>Airoldi L. &amp; Bulleri F.
