        "background_definitions": "<p>Conversion of grasslands to arable agriculture or pasture often leads to soils with high nutrient content. These high nutrient content soils promote the growth of grass species which can outcompete forb species. In addition, these soils may contain seeds of undesirable plants (e.g. crop seeds). Removing topsoil may help to reduce soil nutrient content as well as eliminating the seeds of undesirable species. Sowing seeds after the removal of topsoil may aid colonisation by grassland plants.</p>\r\n<p>The studies detailed in this intervention are direct tests of the effectiveness of removing topsoil/turf before seeding or planting (e.g. by comparison with a seeded or planted plot with topsoil/turf left in place). Studies that represent comparisons of seeding to unseeded plots can be found in the actions ‘<a href=\"../../actions/3397\"><em>Sow grass seeds</em></a>’, ‘<a href=\"../../actions/3398\"><em>Sow grassland forb species</em></a>’ or ‘<a href=\"../../actions/3432\"><em>Sow native grass and forbs</em></a>’.</p>",

No statistical analyses were carried out in this study. In eight of 12 comparisons, there were more grass species in plots where turf was removed and seeds sown (10–15 species/plot) than in plots where soil was disturbed and seeds sown (4–13 species/plot). In the four other comparisons, the number of grass species was similar in plots that had turf removed or soil disturbed before sowing (both 7–12 species/plot). In 10 of 12 comparisons, there were more forb species in plots where turf had been removed and seeds sown (11–28 species/plot) than in plots where soil was disturbed and seeds sown (3–25 species/plot). In the two other comparisons, the number of forb species was similar in plots that had turf removed (10–12 species/plot) or soil disturbed (8–13 species/plot) before sowing. In 1994, at each site, twelve 6 x 4 m plots were mown. In four plots/site, turf was removed to a depth of 3 cm. In eight plots/site, soil was disturbed by harrowing (four plots) or rotovating (four plots). Seed mixes (five grass species and 18 forb species) were sown at a rate of 12–14 kg/ha in all plots in early August 1994. In May/June of 1995 and 1996, three 40 x 40 cm quadrats were placed in each plot and the frequency of each grass and forb species recorded.</p>",

After three years, average plant species richness was higher in plots where topsoil was removed before seeds were sown (23 species/quadrat) than in plots where topsoil was not removed before seeds were sown (10 species/quadrat). Plant community similarity to an intact steppe site was also higher in plots where topsoil was removed before sowing than in plots where topsoil was not removed (data reported as Bray-Curtis similarity). Vegetation cover did not differ significantly between plots where topsoil was removed (55%) or not removed (67%) before sowing. In 2009, all trees were removed from the site and soils were levelled. Topsoil was removed (to a depth of 20 cm) and seeds of three nurse plants were sown in three randomly selected 10 x 10 m plots. No topsoil was removed and seeds were sown in two 30-ha plots.
