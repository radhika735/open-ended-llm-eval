Pastures and buffers were 40% clover and 60% grass. Four pastures had buffers, and four did not. Half of the pastures (1 ha each) were intensively sprinkler-irrigated and grazed (six cattle, five-day rotation). The other half (3 ha each) were flood-irrigated and grazed (20 cattle, seven-day rotation). The cattle were yearling beef heifers, in rotation from 1 June to 15 October. Runoff was measured during irrigation events (sprinkler: five events, 787 m<sup>3</sup>/ha/event; flood: eight events, 1,642 m<sup>3</sup>/ha/event) in August, September, and October (volume was measured every 15 minutes in a weir; samples were collected every hour).</p><p> </p>",

Buffers trapped twice the amount of nitrogen, compared to unbuffered plots, in the first four weeks. <strong>Implementation options:</strong> Buffers trapped higher amounts of runoff in the first four weeks, compared to the next 10 weeks. <strong>Methods:</strong> Plots (5 x 48 m) were buffered (8 or 16 m) or unbuffered (three replicates each). Fertilizers were applied to plots (170 kg/ha) in May. Five cattle (per 0.2 ha) grazed for two days (faecal matter: 336 kg/ha/plot) every three weeks. Buffer strips had no grazing or fertilizer application. Plots and buffer strips were irrigated in April–October (167 L/s/ha, 3.5 h). Soil berms separated plots. Water samples were collected for 14 weeks following fertilizer (5 kg/ha, traceable potassium nitrate) and water (20 L/m) application. A trough at the bottom of the buffers collected surface runoff and soil solution samplers (45 cm deep) collected subsurface runoff.</p><p> </p>",

Vegetated ditches reduced the amount of soil in runoff (0.1 g/L). <strong>Methods:</strong> Plots (183 m plots; 8–12 plots; number of plots not clearly reported) grew processing tomatoes (in Davis) or lima beans (in Chico). Each plot had 9–10 furrows, spaced 1.5 m apart. Water was added to the plots (12–20 gallons/minute/furrow; 5-6 replicates per growing season). Runoff was collected in a drain at the end of the plots (every 30 mins from beginning of surface runoff until the water was turned off). Flow rate was automatically measured every minute. Runoff was directed into vegetated and non-vegetated ditches. Water samples (500 ml) were taken before and after it passed through the vegetated ditches. Vegetation was planted in ditches (49 x 1.5 m, 0.2 m deep; six replicates: five with tall fescue <em>Festuca arundinacea</em> and one with rye grass <em>Lolium </em>spp.).</p><p> </p>",
