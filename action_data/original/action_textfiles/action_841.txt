Overall, 65% of patrols reported that up to 100 toads were killed on the road, 28% reported 100–500 were killed and 7% over 500 toads. Only 20% of populations were believed to be stable or increasing. A questionnaire survey of most of the known and established toad patrols was undertaken. Seventy-six replies were obtained.</p><p> </p>",
