The abundance of three of six plant species was lower in areas where drill seeding was used (0.2–10.0 plants/m<sup>2</sup>) than in areas where seeds were applied in a slurry (0.3–17.0 plants/m<sup>2</sup>). However, the abundance of two species was higher where drill seeding was used (drill: 2–18 plants/m<sup>2</sup>; seeds in slurry: 1–12 plants/m<sup>2</sup>), and in one case there was no significant difference (drill: 313–370 plants/m<sup>2</sup>; seeds in slurry: 228–368 plants/m<sup>2</sup>). In February 1998, eight blocks each with three 27 × 4.5 m plots were established. In each block, one plot was seeded with a seed drill to a depth of 6–12 mm, and one plot had a slurry of seed, water, and wood fibre applied at a rate of 560 kg/ha. A straw mulch was applied to all plots at a rate of 1,680 kg/ha and a hydromulch slurry of water, wood fibre, and soil stabilizer was sprayed over the straw. In July 1998 and January and May 1999, plant abundance in each plot was estimated using six 4 × 4 m quadrats.</p>",

Two years after seeding, there was no significant difference in species richness between drill-seeded plots (6.3–7.2) and plots seeded by hand (5.1–6.3). However, native warm-season grasses were more abundant in drilled plots (relative abundance: 0.23–0.34) than plots seeded by hand (relative abundance: 0.11–0.28). In spring 2005, seventy-two 12 x 12 m plots across three sites were seeded with a commercial mix of 13 forb and seven grass species at a rate of 430 seeds/m<sup>2</sup>.

At both sites, species richness was similar in drilled (10–15 species) and broadcast-seeded areas (10–18 species). However, at one site, drill-seeded areas had a lower relative cover of native warm-season grasses (16%) and a higher relative cover of non-native species (72%) than broadcast-seeded areas (native warm-season grasses: 54%, non-native species: 35%), while at the other site there was no significant difference (native warm-season grasses: 87% vs 89%; non-native species: 9% vs 7%). At two sites, one area was drill-seeded and another was broadcast-seeded, using the same seed mix in both areas. At Site 1, one 1.9-ha area was drilled, and one 3.5-ha area was broadcast, with a local seed mix of 20 native species (sown at 16–17 kg/ha) in autumn 1999. The site was burned in spring 2004–2006. At Site 2, one 1-ha area was drilled, and one 1-ha area was broadcast, with a seed mix containing 37 forbs and nine grasses (sown at 12 kg/ha) in spring 2003. The site was mowed twice yearly.
