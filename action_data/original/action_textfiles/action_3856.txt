        "background_definitions": "<p>Climate change threatens butterfly and moth species by shifting areas of suitable climatic conditions away from species’ historic ranges. For montane species, this leads to areas at lower elevations becoming less climatically suitable, and areas at higher elevations becoming more suitable (Franco <em>et al.</em> 2006). To survive, butterfly and moth populations must be able to move uphill along elevational gradients, but this movement is hindered by habitat loss and fragmentation. Protecting and connecting habitat along elevational gradients may enable species to move, and adapt their distribution to cope with climate change.</p>\r\n<p>For studies on improving habitat to facilitate latitudinal range shifts, see “<a href=\"../../actions/3857\"><em>Enhance natural habitat to improve landscape connectivity to allow for range shifts</em></a>”.
