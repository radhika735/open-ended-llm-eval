        "background_definitions": "<p>Translocations involve the intentional capture, movement and release of wild-caught reptiles into the wild to re-establish a population that has been lost, or to augment an existing population. This can reduce the risk of inbreeding; help safeguard small populations from extinction due to catastrophic events and/or increase the occupied range. Translocations can also be used to move reptiles to areas where threats have been removed, such as islands where invasive predators have been eradicated. However, translocations are typically expensive and may risk spreading pathogens to previously unexposed areas.</p>\r\n<p>Release techniques vary considerably, from ‘hard releases’ involving the simple release of individuals into the wild, to ‘soft releases’ that involve a variety of adaptation and acclimatisation techniques before release or post-release feeding and care.</p>\r\n<p>This action includes studies which may combine different release techniques, but studies that explicitly test these different techniques are summarized separately under <em><a href=\"../../actions/3724\">Use holding pens or enclosures at release site prior to release of wild reptiles</a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3774\">Use holding pens or enclosures at release site prior to release of captive-bred reptiles</a> </em>and <a href=\"../../actions/3725\"><em>Release reptiles into burrows</em></a>.</p>\r\n<p>This action includes the translocation of wild juvenile or adult reptiles.

In March 2008, translocated tortoises (45 tortoises: 18 females, 27 males) were released into four areas (1.6 km<sup>2</sup> each) between 9–30 km from the point of capture. A further 179 tortoises (72 females, 107 males) resident in the translocated area were monitored that had home ranges within or outside of the release sites (numbers of each not provided). Levels of stress hormone were measured by taking monthly blood samples (1,793 blood samples in total) in April–October, 2007–2009 from translocated tortoises (19–43 individuals/year) and residents from within (34–43 individuals/year) and outside the release areas (19–48 individuals/year).</p>",
