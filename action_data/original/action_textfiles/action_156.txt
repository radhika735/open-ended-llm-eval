Bee species richness increased with increasing age of the unsown set-asides and with increasing plant diversity. Wasp diversity was similar in the different field types (1 to 4 spp./field type). Smaller bee and wasp species inhabited fields with high plant diversity but were absent in fields with low plant diversity. Foraging flights took twice as long in fields with low plant diversity (35 min) than in fields with high plant diversity (15 min) for two investigated bee species (leaf-cutter bee <em>Megachile versicolor</em>, blue carpenter bee <em>Osmia caerulescens</em>). No such effect was found for the European potter wasp A<em>ncistrocerus gazella</em> (ca. 21 min in both sites). Unsown sites with naturally developed vegetation included one- and two-year old mown and unmown set-asides and old meadow orchards.

Three artificial nests (each with two 750 ml cans filled with 180 reed stems) were located in each field centre. Female body length of bees and wasps was measured.

The study compared bees and wasps nesting on set-aside land managed in six different ways with crop fields and old meadows in Kraichgau, southwest Germany. It used reed <em>Phragmites australis </em>stem nest boxes and recorded nesting only, not foraging activity. Set-aside fields were either sown in the year of study, with a grass-clover mix or phacelia <em>Phacelia tanacetifolia</em>, or were in their first or second year of natural regeneration, with or without mowing.</p><p> </p>",

Invertebrate numbers caught in Malaise-traps were highest in rye fields and clover-grass-mixes (around 3000 individuals) and lowest in naturally developed set-asides (1000 individuals). The effect of field type and set-aside age was strongly species- or family-dependent. Up to 11 field types (four to five replicates each) were investigated: one, two and three-year-old naturally developed set-asides (mown and unmown), 1-year-old set-asides sown with either <em>Phacelia tanacetifolia</em> or a clover-grass mix, conventionally managed cereal fields (rye and barley) and low-intensity orchard meadows (&gt;30 years old).
