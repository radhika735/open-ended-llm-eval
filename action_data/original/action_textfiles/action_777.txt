This means that it is vital to engage effectively with landowners so that they manage their land in ways that help to maintain amphibian populations. Volunteers can make a valuable contribution to the management of habitats for amphibians, on private and public land. In some cases the long-term success of habitat management can depend on the involvement of local people.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">As well as the direct effects from habitat restoration, volunteer programmes help raise awareness about amphibians and the threats that they face. For example, a study found that participants with high levels of engagement in conservation projects learned more (Evely <em>et al.</em> 2011). For interventions that involve engaging volunteers to help manage or monitor amphibian populations see ‘Threat: Transportation and service corridors – <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"../../actions/784\">Use humans to assist migrating amphibians across roads</a></span>’ and ‘Education and awareness raising – <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"../../actions/760\">Engage volunteers to collect amphibian data</a></span>’.</p>\r\n<p class=\"References\">Evely A.C., Pinard M., Reed M.S. &amp; Fazey L.

In 2001–2004, habitats were restored with the help of 200 volunteers during 14 work camps. Restoration included reed and scrub removal, mowing (cuttings removed) and implementation of grazing where it had ceased. Sixty-six breeding ponds and natural depressions were cleaned, deepened and restored. The project also involved educational and informational activities.</p><p> </p>",

Only four of 12 previously marked axolotls were recaptured; however, their weight had increased by 16%. Weight gain was greater than that of axolotls in control colonies over the same period. Farmers benefited from better-quality farm products as a result of improved water quality and from the protection of traditional agricultural practices. In 2009, with participation from farmers, a canal used as a refuge by axolotls was isolated from the main system using filters made of wood. Filters excluded fish and improved water quality.</p><p> </p>",
