Threats to nests included the natural deterioration of nest cavities, predation, exoparasites, poor parental care, unviable eggs (replaced with captive-bred eggs), poor growth or unsuccessful fledging of chicks, human intrusion (three nests) and competition from other pairs. Some nests were affected by multiple threats.</p><p> </p>",

In conjunction with intensive trapping and poisoning of rats on a grid system around six nests (see ‘Control mammalian predators on islands’), this ensured that no nests were lost to rats in 1997, compared with potentially unsustainable predation in the years preceding 1997. No adverse effects on kakapos were found.</p><p class=\"\\\"> </p><p> </p>",
