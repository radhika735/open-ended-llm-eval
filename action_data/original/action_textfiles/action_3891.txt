Results were not tested for statistical significance.

The authors reported that this increase followed the spread of the hostplant meadow vetchling <em>Lathyrus pratensis</em> across the site. In early 1991 a 1-ha grassland, where 12 moths were found in 1990, was fenced to exclude sheep. In early 1994 and 1996, some sheep entered the site following damage to the fence, but from 1997–2004, sheep were completely excluded. In 1990, an intensive search for the moth was conducted. In July 1990–1991 and 1994–2003, moths were surveyed 1–15 times/year along a 5-m-wide, 300-m-long transect across the site, and were separately caught, marked and recaptured to estimate population size.</p>",

In 1998–1999, trees &lt;36 cm diameter were thinned in three experimental units (14–16 ha), and sixty Fendler’s ceanothus <em>Ceanothus fendleri</em> shrubs/unit (1–25 upright stems, covering &lt;2 m<sup>2</sup>) were located. In 1999, thirty shrubs/unit were randomly selected, and had 4-m<sup>2</sup>, 1.4-m-high exclosures built around them. Exclosures had a large mesh (5 × 10 cm) on the sides, and open tops. In June 2002–2004, insects including moths were sampled by sweep netting (five sweeps/shrub, 20–50 cm above ground) through a subset of 30–52 shrubs/year (see paper for details), and identified to family level.</p>",

In fenced sites where invasive plants had been removed, both the abundance (5.9 individuals/100 m) and species richness (9 species) of native butterflies was higher than in unfenced sites where no weed removal had been conducted (abundance: 0.3 individuals/100 m; richness: 3 species). From 1986–1996, eight Conservation Management Areas (0.4–6.0 ha) were fenced to exclude non-native pigs and deer, and were regularly hand-weeded (1–3 times/year) to remove invasive plants, primarily strawberry guava <em>Psidium cattleianum</em>, rose apple <em>Syzygium jambos</em>, <em>Ossaea marginata </em>and Christmas berry <em>Ardisia crenata</em>. From April–June 1998, butterflies were surveyed on point counts along four to six 100-m transects in each weeded plot and in adjacent, non-weeded plots with an equivalent number of native canopy trees.</p>",

After 10 days of autumn grazing, fewer caterpillar nests had signs of damage in a fenced area (2/24 nests damaged) than nests in a grazed area (15/25 nests damaged). Two months later, the number of nests with signs of damage was similar in fenced (6/24 nests damaged) and grazed areas (6/25). All 24 nests in the fenced area survived until spring, compared to 22/25 surviving in the grazed area (statistical significance not assessed). In July–August 2009, a grazed 4-ha grassland was searched three times for caterpillar nests. Half of the area with the highest density of nests was fenced to create a 0.15-ha ungrazed area. Twenty-four pairs of the largest, equally sized nests (&gt;1 m apart) in each area were selected, and their location marked on GPS. In September 2009, the unfenced area was grazed by 114 sheep over 1.23 ha for 10 days, after which an expanded 1.76-ha area was grazed by 15 sheep for 50 days. In October and December 2009, nests were checked for damage, and in March 2010 the survival of each nest was recorded.</p>",

The total species richness of macro-moths, and the abundance of rare species, in areas with no deer (richness: 34 species/exclosure; abundance: 84 individuals) or reduced deer density (7.5–15 deer/km<sup>2</sup>: richness: 36 species/exclosure; abundance: 86–113 individuals) was higher than in areas where deer were not controlled (richness: 21 species/exclosure; abundance: 12 individuals). However, the total abundance of macro-moths did not differ significantly between sites (no deer: 113; 7.5 deer/km<sup>2</sup>: 139; 15 deer/km<sup>2</sup>: 122; uncontrolled: 87 individuals/exclosure). In 2001, fenced deer exclosures were built at three sites across a 7,943-km<sup>2</sup> island. From 2002–2007, at each site, all deer were removed from a 10-ha exclosure (0 deer/km<sup>2</sup>), and three deer were stocked in both a 40-ha (7.5 deer/km<sup>2</sup>) and a 20-ha (15 deer/km<sup>2</sup>) exclosure from early spring to late autumn. An adjacent area with uncontrolled deer (26–57 deer/km<sup>2</sup>) was also monitored at each site. Within each exclosure, 70% of the area was harvested for timber just prior to construction in 2001. From June–August 2007, moths were sampled over five 3-day periods, using two Luminoc<sup>®</sup> traps/exclosure (&gt;100 m apart). Traps were placed 3 m high and fitted with a 1.8 W blue light tube and Vapona<sup>®</sup> strips.</p>",
