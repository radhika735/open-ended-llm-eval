Rotational grazing, where livestock are moved between different areas of a site throughout the year, is one option for creating this kind of intermediate habitat, as well as generating a mosaic of more or less recently grazed areas on a larger scale.

Rotational grazing did not affect butterfly community composition compared to other management (data presented as model results). Two out of nine species (meadow fritillary <em>Boloria bellona</em> and regal fritillary <em>Speyeria idalia</em>) were more abundant in rotationally grazed pastures, while two species (small pearl-bordered fritillary <em>Boloria selene</em> and purplish copper <em>Lycaena helloides</em>) were less abundant in rotationally grazed pastures than other management, and five species had a similar abundance between management types (see paper for details). Thirty butterfly species were recorded in rotationally grazed pastures, compared to 25 species in rotationally grazed pastures with mowing, 22 species in season-long grazed pastures and 26 species in patch-burned grazed pastures (statistical significance not assessed). Eight pastures (54–484 ha) managed under one of four management practices (rotational grazing, rotational grazing with lowland mowing, season-long grazing, patch-burn grazing) were selected. Rotational pastures were sub-divided into four paddocks, each grazed twice/season. In mown pastures, sedge-dominated patches were cut once/summer. On season-long pastures cattle were free to select grazing areas. One-third of each patch-burn grazed pasture was burned in the dormant season, but prior to April 2015 these sites were rotationally grazed. All other sites had the same management for at least a decade. Pastures were stocked with cattle (0.5–0.75 cow-calf pairs/ha) from May–October.
