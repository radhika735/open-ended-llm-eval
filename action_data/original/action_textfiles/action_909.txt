        "background_definitions": "<p>Water potential measures the tendency of water to move from one area to another due to osmosis, gravity, mechanical pressure, or other effects. Water potential is useful in understanding water movement within plants, animals, and soil. If possible, water will move from an area of higher water potential (lots of water molecules per given volume) to an area that has a lower water potential (fewer water molecules per given volume).</p>\r\n<p>Most slow-release fertilizers release nutrients gradually over time and at specific soil temperatures. Quick-release fertilizers are useful for plants which require higher amounts of nutrients, or a quick supply due to a nutrient deficiency. They tend to break down in the soil much more quickly than slow-release fertilizers. Ammonium-N is often added to soils as a fertilizer for crops. When added to the soil, soil bacteria convert it to nitrate (nitrification). If plants do not take up the ammonium-N immediately it gets converted to nitrate and can be lost from the soil (leaching). A nitrification inhibitor stops or slows down this conversion, and can reduce the loss of nitrate from the soil.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",
