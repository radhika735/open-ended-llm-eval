In 1964–1970, none of the giant tortoise nests (10–25/year) on one island protected using corrals were predated by pigs. In 1970–1972, one of 262 protected nests were predated by pigs compared to 23 of 29 unprotected nests. The authors reported that corrals did not prevent dogs <em>Canis lupus familiaris</em> accessing and destroying nests elsewhere. In the 1964/1965–1969/1970 nesting seasons, 10–25 giant tortoise <em>Geochelone elephantopus porteri</em> nests/year were protected from pig predation on Santa Cruz using corrals built with lava-rock walls (1.5–2 m diameter, 1 m high). Corral use was extended in the 1970/1971 and 1971/1972 nesting seasons to protect 262 nests of three subspecies of giant tortoise (<em>G. e. porteri, G. e. vicina, G. e. darwini</em>) on three islands (Santa Cruz, San Salvador and Isabela). In 1970, twenty-nine nests were not protected with corrals on Santa Cruz and hatching outcomes monitored. In 1971–1972, introduced mammals (pigs and goats <em>Capra hircus</em>) were also controlled by shooting.</p>",
