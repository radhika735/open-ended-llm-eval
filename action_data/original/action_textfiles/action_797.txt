Signal crayfish reproduce and grow fast and so can reach high densities. Non-native crayfish have direct effects on amphibians through predation of eggs but also affect aquatic communities by consuming aquatic plants and competing with and introducing disease to native crayfish.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">There is additional literature that is not included here examining the success of controlling crayfish, which may be undertaken for the conservation of a range of taxa including amphibians (e.g. Aquiloni <em>et al.</em> 2009; Aquiloni &amp; Gherardi 2010). For the success of control of <em>Procambarus</em> crayfish see the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"../../data/index?synopsis_id%5B%5D=18\">Control of Freshwater Invasive Species synopsis</a>, or click on 'Closely related actions, See also...' to the right.</p>\r\n<p class=\"References\">Aquiloni L., Becciolini A., Berti R., Porciani S., Trunfio C. &amp; Gherardi F.
