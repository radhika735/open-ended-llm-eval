        "background_definitions": "<p>Open habitats, such as grassland, heathland, peatland and fynbos, require disturbance processes to prevent them undergoing succession to scrub or woodland. One option for preventing succession and opening up areas of habitat is to use prescribed burning. However, burning is likely to be destructive in the short-term, because of either direct mortality or a reduction in food availability for butterflies and moths (Glaves <em>et al.</em> 2013). Rotational burning, where sites are burned once every few years, may allow time for habitat patches to recover to the optimal condition for butterflies and moths in the period between burns, while maintaining a dynamic patchwork of suitable habitat across a site. However, the impact of fires can vary depending on their exact characteristics, such as the frequency, temperature, ground surface intensity, time and size of burning compared to the surrounding unburned areas (Swengel 2001, Tucker 2003, New <em>et al.</em> 2010) and caution should be taken before instigating fire in place of alternative management options such as grazing or cutting.</p>\r\n<p>For studies on the impact of single prescribed burns, see “<a href=\"../../actions/3882\"><em>Use prescribed fire to maintain or restore disturbance in grasslands or other open habitats</em></a>”.
