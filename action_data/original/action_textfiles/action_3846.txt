Even on nature reserves, getting the right balance of habitat management can be difficult. For species with particular habitat requirements which are difficult to achieve, such as a structural diversity of grassland swards, training events for land managers and conservation staff may help to improve habitat quality for butterflies and moths (Parsons 2004).</p>\r\n<p><sup>Parsons M.S.

Butterfly Conservation contacted 200 landowners with farms containing known marsh fritillary populations and, with the assistance of the Scottish Agricultural College and Agrimony, assisted 140 landowners in developing management plans for conserving the marsh fritillary and submitting applications for the Rural Priorities agri-environment scheme. Ninety percent of applications were successful and &gt;3,000 ha were managed specifically for the marsh fritillary. The marsh fritillary was a priority species for the Scottish Rural Development Programme’s Rural Priorities agri-environment scheme. From 2008, the organisations contacted owners of 200 farmland sites in Mid-Argyll and Knapdale, Mull, Lorne and Islay, conducted site visits at 170 of the farms, and provided assistance with devising site-specific management plans and making scheme applications for 140 of these.</p>",
