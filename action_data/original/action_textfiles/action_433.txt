We captured one study attempting to reduce the impact of invasive water plant control on snail kite <em>Rostrhamus sociabilis</em> nests, which are built above water in cattail Typha spp. and bulrush <em>Scripus validus</em> and are therefore vulnerable to herbicide applications, which can kill supporting vegetation, collapsing the nests.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

This fledging rate was similar to the overall rate of 0.74 fledglings/nest recorded in other regions of Lake Okeechobee during 1987–1993. Buffer zones were used in the breeding season, whilst water hyacinth <em>Eichhornia crassipes</em> and water lettuce <em>Pistia stratiotes</em> control measures were ongoing. The initiative was expanded to other lakes supporting kite nests in March 1989.</p><p> </p>",
