Low red bulbs emit lower levels of red light than standard bulbs. Attracted birds were mainly songbirds, waders and wildfowl and expected numbers were estimated based on previous observations and calculated from the number of migrating birds recorded on nearby islands, the number observed from the rig and the weather conditions.</p><p> </p>",
