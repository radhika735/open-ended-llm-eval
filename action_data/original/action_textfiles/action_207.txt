However, hatching success on spring crops was lower than on autumn crops (29-50% for 1,236 nests on spring crops vs. approximately 85% for 27 nests on autumn crops).

In addition, 20 bird species showed significant population increases on a 61 ha site where the area of spring-sown wheat and naturally regenerated set-aside was increased over the study period. Increases were lower or absent on an 80 ha area of farmland adjacent to the experimental area and without the land use change. Five species were recorded breeding for the first time after management started. Ten species showed no significant increase on the study site, whilst none decreased significantly. The biggest increases occurred in the first three years of management and were higher for farmland birds than for woodland birds. This study also investigated the impact of reducing pesticide and fertiliser inputs (see ‘Reduce pesticide or herbicide use generally’) and of set-aside (see ‘Provide or maintain set-aside’).</p><p> </p>",
