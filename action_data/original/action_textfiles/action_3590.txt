In May–June 2000–2001 and September–November 2000, hard crab were fished for using pots (60 x 60 x 60 cm) in 21 pairs (with and without excluder devices). Three rectangular excluder devices were tested/season: 16 x 4 cm, 16 x 4.5 cm, and 16 x 5 cm (75 fishing days, 3,150 crab pot days). In April–May 2004, peeler crabs were fished in blocks of four pots with either unmodified, or one of three excluders: 16 x 4.3 cm rectangle, 15.2 x 5.1 cm rectangle, or two vertical wire ties/entrance set 7.8 cm apart (19 fishing days, 1,672 total crab pot days).</p>",

In separate trials, nets modified with an exclusion rectangle captured similar numbers of turtles (0.02 turtles/hour) compared to unmodified nets (0.04 turtles/hour). Catch rates of target fish species were similar in exclusion bar nets (2.9 fish/hour), exclusion rectangle nets (2.6 fish/hour) and unmodified nets (2.9 fish/hour). Standard commercial hooped fyke nets (see original paper for details) were set in a shallow freshwater lake (788 ha) in April–June and September–October 2010 in pairs of modified and unmodified nets. Nets were either modified with exclusion bars made of wooden dowels (8 x 1.3 cm spaced 8 cm apart; set at 30 sites in April–June) or an exclusion rectangle made by attaching a hose clamp at the first funnel of the fyke net (18 x 7.5 cm rectangle; set at 15 sites in September–October).

In a first-year smaller scale trial, nets modified with exclusion devices caught statistically similar numbers of turtles (3–4 turtles) compared to unmodified nets (11). The catch of target and non-target fish was also statistically similar between modified (109–144 individuals) and unmodified nets (224). However, in the second year larger scale trial, unwanted catch of turtles was lower in modified nets (0.03 turtles/trapping effort) compared to unmodified nets (0.13). Target species catch was also lower in modified nets (0.64 individuals/trapping effort) compared to unmodified nets (0.95). In September 2011, two fyke nets connected by an entrance net (7 hoops/net, 0.91 m diameter) were deployed in a shallow lake (2.8 m average depth, 780 ha total area) in threes: unmodified net, modified with a 22.5 x 5 cm copper rectangle, or modified with 5 cm spaced vertically-oriented bars across the mouth of the net (nine groups of nets in one site). In April–June 2012, the set up was repeated twice at 11 sites, but did not include nets with the barred exclusion device. All target and non-target catch was identified, counted and released.</p>",

A vertically-oriented device reduced the number of entries into the pot (2 entries/terrapin) compared to horizontally-oriented devices and no device, which produced similar results (horizontal: 5; no device: 6 entries/terrapin). Vertically-oriented devices increased the average time taken to enter a pot (58 seconds before entry) compared to no device, whereas time to enter horizontally-oriented devices was similar to no device (horizontal: 32; no device: 19 seconds before entry). The proportion of terrapins that entered a pot after investigating it was reduced when a vertically-oriented device was used (0.1 terrapins entered/investigation), compared to a horizontally-oriented device (0.2 terrapins entered/investigation). Both types of device reduced the rate of terrapins entering pots compared to no device (0.3 terrapins entered/investigation). In total, 38 wild terrapins were caught to take part in the study, all of a size where they could enter a crab pot when an opening limiting device was present. Each terrapin participated in three randomly ordered trials: vertically-oriented device fitted to entry holes, horizontally-oriented device fitted to entry holes and no device. Devices were 5.1 x 15.2 cm. Crab pots with chimneys baited with mackerel were used. Terrapins were monitored by webcam in 3 h videos (27 h total footage, 3 h/treatment/study group).</p>",
