Total plant cover was higher in lime addition (38-40%) than control plots (17-23%). Control and lime addition treatments (at 11,000 kg/ha <sup> </sup>) were each applied in 1991 to eight plots (3 × 10 m) at each of two hilltop sites. All plots were fertilized with nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium at 112, 56 and 90 kg/ha respectively. Plots were planted with western white pine <em>Pinus monticola</em> trees, shrubs and grasses before treatments in 1991. Data were collected in 1995.</p><p> </p>",
