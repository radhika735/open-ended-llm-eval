        "background_definitions": "<p>Butterflies and moths often show a preference for areas with more floral resources (Vogel <em>et al.</em> 2007), but such resources are absent from intensive arable landscapes. Sown nectar flower mixtures, or wildflower strips, are common components of agri-environment schemes or conservation incentive programs which aim to increase the availability of flowers for insects. However, there can be many differences in the implementation methods used. For example, the exact seed mixture of species sown often differs between geographic regions and individual studies. Excluding grasses from nectar flower mixtures may reduce competition and aid re-establishment of the flowering species, while the rotation of the location of wildflower strips every 2–3 years may also be beneficial, as not all sown species will persist for longer than this (Heard <em>et al.</em> 2011).</p>\r\n<p>Nectar flower mixes are normally composed of perennial plants, as opposed to annual species sown in wild bird seed mixes (Pywell et al. 2008).

More adult meadow browns were found on margins sown with wildflowers (4–52 butterflies/50 m) than on unsown margins (4–15 butterflies/50 m). Sown margins also had more butterflies if they were left uncut (13–39 butterflies/50 m), or were cut in spring and autumn (16–52 butterflies/50 m), than if they were cut in summer (4–22 butterflies/50 m). There was no difference in the abundance of meadow brown caterpillars between sown and unsown, or cut and uncut, plots (3 caterpillars/plot). There were more meadow browns on all the experimental field margins than on narrow, unmanaged field boundaries of a neighbouring farm (numbers not given). In October 1987, two-metre-wide field margins around arable fields were rotovated, and either sown with a wildflower seed mix in March 1988 or left to regenerate naturally. Within each sown and unsown margin, 50-m-long plots were managed in one of four ways, with eight replicates of each treatment: uncut; cut once in June; cut April and June; cut in April and September. Hay was collected after cutting. From June–September 1989, and April–September 1990–1991, adult meadow brown were monitored weekly. In spring 1991, meadow brown caterpillars were sampled by sweep netting and visual searching.</p>",

The abundance of eight species (including small skipper <em>Thymelicus sylvestris</em>, small heath <em>Coenonympha pamphilus</em>, gatekeeper <em>Pyronia tithonus</em> and meadow brown <em>Maniola jurtina</em>) was higher on a farm with wider (2-m) field margins, including those sown, than on a farm with conventional (0.5-m) margins. No species was more abundant on the conventional farm. In addition, two species (marbled white <em>Melanargia galathea</em> and common blue <em>Polyommatus icarus</em>) were only recorded on the farm with wide margins, resulting in a higher species richness (16 species) than the conventional farm (14 species). In 1988, the margins of 10 fields on one farm were extended from 0.5-m to 2-m wide, and fertilizer application was excluded. Margins were either sown with grasses and forbs or left to regenerate naturally. Margins were either left uncut, or cut in some combination of April, June and September 1989–1991.

The abundance of butterflies in sown wildflower strips (0.29 individuals/m) was higher than in extensively managed meadows (0.12 individuals/m), but the species richness was similar in wildflower strips (0.07 species/m) and meadows (0.05 species/m). The species composition was different between the two habitats, with seven of 25 species occurring only in wildflower strips, and six species observed most frequently in the meadows. None of the five rarest species in the region were recorded in wildflower strips or meadows. See paper for details on individual species. Twenty-five wildflower strips (0.15–1.16 ha) were sown with a standard seed mixture of 24 plant species, and were 1–7 years old. Eleven meadows (0.21–1.64 ha) were cut at least twice/year after mid-June. From May–September 2008, butterflies were surveyed once/month on a transect through the middle of each wildflower strip (70–450 m) or meadow (85–310 m).</p>",

Butterfly abundance was higher under enhanced Entry-Level Stewardship (ELS) (5,400 individuals/60 ha) and standard ELS (2,000 individuals/60 ha) than under conventional farming (1,400 individuals/60 ha). Micro-moth abundance was also higher under enhanced ELS (79 individuals) than standard ELS (32 individuals) or conventional farming (20 individuals). However, the abundance of macro-moths and threatened moths was similar under enhanced ELS (macro: 126; threatened: 6 individuals), standard ELS (macro: 79; threatened: 5 individuals) and conventional farming (macro: 79; threatened: 6 individuals). Species richness of all groups was similar under enhanced ELS (macro: 20; micro: 11; threatened: 3 species), standard ELS (macro: 20; micro: 8; threatened: 2 species) and conventional farming (macro: 18; micro: 5; threatened: 2 species) (butterfly data not presented). In 2005, a 1,000-ha farm was divided into five 180-ha blocks. Three 60-ha areas/block were assigned to three treatments: enhanced ELS (5% land removed from production, field corners sown with four grasses and 25 non-woody broadleaved plants (forbs), nectar flower mixtures sown with four legumes); standard ELS (1% land removed from production); conventional farming (see paper for other details). From May–August 2006–2011, butterflies were recorded four times/year on one 50-m transect/60-ha area, passing through all available habitats. In late-May 2007–2011 and late-July 2006–2011 moths were surveyed using Robinson light traps. One block was surveyed/night, with one trap/treatment.</p>",
