Spraying regimes can be evaluated by assessing the number of occasions on which pests reached economically damaging levels after decisions to spray/not spray. Strategically timing insecticide sprays to coincide with periods of likely pest abundance or natural enemy susceptibility (anticipated in advance based on prior knowledge, experience or predictive models) is included in 'Alter the timing of insectide use'.

The effect lasted for three weeks in 1992 and at least six weeks in 1994, but overall spider numbers were similar between treatments in 1993. More money spiders (Linyphiidae) were found in plots in the threshold-based spraying regime (peaking at 10-20 spiders/3 traps) than conventional plots (9-12 spiders) in all years. Wolf spider (Lycosidae) numbers were only greater in the threshold-based than conventional plots in 1994. At the species level, only one of three species tested (the money spider<em> Erigone atra</em>) was affected by pesticide regime type. In the threshold-based regime, sprays were made when control thresholds were exceeded, resulting in one insecticide (pirimicarb) spray in 1992 and one herbicide spray in 1994. Insecticides (dimethoate and deltamethrin), fungicides (carboxin, imazalil and propiconazole), herbicides and growth regulators were applied annually in conventional plots. Barley <em>Hordeum vulgare</em> was grown in 1992-1993 and wheat <em>Triticum aestivum</em> in 1994. Spiders were captured using pitfall traps monitored weekly (8-10 times between sowing and harvest).</p>",

In the 1994-1997 test, threshold plots received selective insecticides (3-4 applications/year) when pest insect thresholds were exceeded. Conventional plots received broad spectrum insecticides to prevent pest build-up (8-9 applications/year). Treatments were replicated four times in plots of 16 celery rows, 20 m long. In 1997, conventional plots (receiving insecticide and fungicide) were compared with plots receiving either threshold-based insecticide application, threshold-based fungicide application, or both.
