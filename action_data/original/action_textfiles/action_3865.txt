        "background_definitions": "<p>Trees, in particular large, old individuals of native species, provide a range of important resources for butterflies and moths. Many species feed on trees as caterpillars, or nectar from them as adults, and trees also provide perches from which they can defend territories, or shelter where they can rest (Thomas &amp; Lewington 2016). However, trees may take 100 years or more to reach large sizes, making them functionally irreplaceable components of the landscape. Therefore, when harvesting trees for commercial use, legally mandating the protection of large, native individuals may have a disproportionate impact on the conservation of butterflies and moths which rely on them.</p>\r\n<p><sup>Thomas J.A. &amp; Lewington R.
