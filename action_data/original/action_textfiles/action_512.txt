        "background_definitions": "<p class=\"Background\">Natural variations in reproductive output can be detrimental when populations are very small, for example if pairs fail to produce fertile eggs or some pairs repeatedly fail to raise offspring successfully. One way to minimise this problem is to foster eggs and chicks between nests. Eggs and chicks from nests with more offspring than they are likely to be able to raise can be moved to those with infertile eggs. Alternatively, if a pair produces fertile eggs or healthy chicks but consistently fails to raise chicks then it may be possible to transfer offspring to a more successful pair.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">In other circumstances it may be possible to foster chicks with other species (‘cross-fostering’). Studies describing this intervention are discussed in the following section ‘Foster eggs or chicks with wild non-conspecifics (cross-fostering).’</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

Novice pairs normally have lower reproductive success than more experienced pairs. At least one pair with low breeding success was also provided with a fertile egg several days from hatching and successfully raised the chick. This study is also discussed in ‘Use captive breeding to increase or maintain populations’, ‘Release captive-bred individuals’ and ‘Foster eggs or chicks with wild non-conspecifics (cross-fostering)’.</p><p> </p>",
