However, it can also be used as a conservation management practice to restore more natural open woodland. It can also increase structural diversity of young even-aged stands and promote development of late-successional characteristics such as larger trees, multi-level canopies and understory vegetation. Such features are often lost due to active fire suppression or loss of populations of large mammal grazers and browsers.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

Overall, captures were significantly higher in thinned (7/1000 capture nights) compared to unthinned (4) and clearcut forest (4). However, abundance of the dominant species, ensatina, was similar in thinned (148 captures), unthinned (106) and clearcut forests (159). The body condition index of ensatinas was significantly lower in thinned compared to unthinned forests. Five thinned (aged &gt; 10 years) and five unharvested forest stands adjacent to clearcuts (aged 6–25 years) were selected. Forest had been thinned (approximately 50% retained) prior to clearcutting. Amphibians were monitored using seven drift-fences with pitfall traps and artificial coverboards along two 150 m transects/site.
