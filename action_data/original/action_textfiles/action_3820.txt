        "background_definitions": "<p>Fisheries subsidies are direct or indirect financial transfers by the government of a country to its fishing sector, usually to help offset the cost or increase in cost of a critical resource such as fuel, fishing gear or new vessels (Sumaila <em>et al</em>. 2008). It is argued these payments may drive overexploitation of fish populations by providing an economic incentive to continue fishing even when stocks are declining. They may also benefit illegal fishing activities. The elimination of harmful fisheries subsidies may help control fishing effort and prevent declines in fish populations due to fishing.</p>\r\n<p>Sumaila U.R., Teh L., Watson R., Tyedmers P. &amp; Pauly D.
