Downed birds included 59 Manx shearwater <em>Puffinus puffinus</em> (including all birds downed by reduced lighting), one European storm petrel <em>Hydrobates pelagicus</em> and 45 Leach’s storm petrel <em>Oceanodroma leucorhoa</em>. Lighting consisted of outdoor lights and indoor lights left on overnight with no window coverings.</p><p> </p>",
