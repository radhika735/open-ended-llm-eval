        "background_definitions": "<p>The length of time for which fishing gear is deployed, also known as soaking time, can affect the amount of unwanted species caught, catch efficiency, and the condition and survival of released unwanted catch. Shorter gear deployments reduce the amount of time that the gear is in the water and consequently can minimise potential interactions with the wider ecosystem. In longline fisheries, for example, catch rates are initially high after gear deployment, but then decrease (Løkkeborg &amp; Pina 1996), and shorter gear deployments may reduce the amount of unwanted catch. Furthermore, unwanted catch that remains hooked for a shorter amount of time may be more likely to survive after being released. In towed gears such as trawls, shorter gear deployments can reduce the physiological effects of stress and crowding during capture in the gear on unwanted catch, again potentially increasing post-release survival (Heard <em>et al</em>. 2014).</p>\r\n<p>Evidence for similar interventions is summarized under <em>‘Deployment of fishing gear and mode of operation - <a href=\"../../actions/2686\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Reduce duration of fishing gear deployments</a>’ and <a href=\"../../actions/2688\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">‘Reduce the hauling speed of a trawl net’</a>. </em>See also <a href=\"../../data/index?category_id=483\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>‘Handling of Catch’</em></a>.</p>\r\n<p>Heard M., Van Rijn J.A., Reina R.D. &amp; Huveneers C.

Across all three trials, the average fish length was similar between tow durations, for cod (trials 1 &amp; 2, 15 min: 26–32 cm, 30 min: 29–32 cm, 60 min: 32–35 cm; trial 3, 5 min: 50 cm, 30 min: 50 cm), haddock (trials 1 &amp; 2, 15 min: 18–33 cm, 30 min: 17–33 cm, 60 min: 19–32 cm, 120 min 33 cm; trial 3, 5 min: 27 cm, 30 min: 27 cm, 120 min: 33 cm) and long rough dab (trials 1 &amp; 2 only, 15 min: 24–26 cm, 30 min: 24–25 cm, 60 min: 32–35 cm). In addition, in two of two trials there were no differences in catch rates of small haddock between tow durations (5–60 min), however, the catch rates of small cod increased with decreasing shorter tow durations (see original paper for data). Two trials (one and two) were done in the Barents Sea in October 1988 (nine parallel deployments by two vessels: three each of 15, 30 and 60 min) and February 1989 (24 deployments: 16 × 5 mins and 8 × 30 mins). Additional data from a trial on the Georges Bank in January 1985 (trial three)was also analysed (64 deployments: two each of 15, 30, 60 and 120 min at eight stations). Tow durations were based on the standard tow duration for trawl surveys (from 30 min to 2 h).</p>",

Sole of 20–28 cm length and plaice of 20–30 cm length were removed from each catch onboard and placed in seawater tanks (40 × 60 × 12 cm).
