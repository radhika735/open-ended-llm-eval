In the three years of the experiment, comma caterpillars <em>Polygonia c-album</em>, (it is unclear whether these were adults or caterpillars) were found on potted nettle plants in one, eight and four of the gardens respectively. In June 2000 one tub of nettles was placed in each of 20 gardens. To encourage new growth half of the stems were cut at the first visit and all at the end of each autumn. To test whether patch size or age of plant affected caterpillar presence, in April 2002 five gardens had their plant replaced with a new plant, five had their original plant, five had their plant replaced with four new plants, and five had their original plant plus three new plants. During the summer and autumn of 2000, 2001 and 2002 nettles were checked for caterpillars and their presence (feeding damage and webs).</p>",

There was no difference in abundance between gardens that did and did not use fertilizer. Additionally, there were more butterflies in gardens which had more “natural” features, such as fallow plots, nettles, ivy, brambles and dead trees (data presented as model results). Data was obtained from a citizen monitoring scheme across France. Monthly from March–October participants submitted information about their gardens, including the number of butterflies seen, the presence of fallow plots, nettles, ivy, brambles and dead trees, and whether they use chemicals in gardening.</p><p> </p><p> </p>",

Marjoram received the most visits by butterflies (50% of all visits), followed by buddleia (22% of all visits), compared to 0–12% visits for the other nine flower varieties. Meadow brown <em>Maniola jurtina </em>(213 out of 287 visits) and gatekeeper <em>Pyronia tithonus </em>(908/961 visits) were most attracted to marjoram, and peacock <em>Inachis io</em> (312/328 visits), painted lady <em>Vanessa cardui</em> (123/143 visits) and red admiral <em>Vanessa atalanta </em>(9/10 visits) were most attracted to buddleia. However, hemp agrimony <em>Eupatorium cannibinum</em> attracted the highest diversity of butterfly species (data presented as model results). See paper for more details. Eleven varieties of ornamental flowers were grown in 1–5 discrete patches (total: 1–15 m<sup>2</sup>) around a garden. From 8–13th August 2013, butterflies and day-flying moths feeding on each patch were counted 105 times (three times/hour at 20-minute intervals) in good weather.</p>",

The total abundance and species richness of butterflies was similar in plots weeded every two months and plots weeded every two weeks (data presented as model results). In addition, the abundance of adults, eggs and caterpillars of four target species (monarch <em>Danaus plexippus</em>, queen <em>Danaus gilippus</em>, gulf fritillary <em>Agraulis vanillae</em>, and black swallowtail <em>Papilio polyxenes</em>) were similar in plots with reduced weeding and plots with regular weeding (see paper for details). In spring 2013, four fenced, irrigated experimental plots (7.6 × 15.2 m, 20–88 m apart) were established in each of three blocks, 250 m apart. Each plot was planted with 128 plants of 13 species, and was surrounded by mown grass. Plots were assigned to four treatments/block: planting with native or non-native species, and low (every other month) or high (every other week) weed maintenance by hand pulling, trimming, and spot herbicide application. From May–September 2014, adult butterflies were surveyed for 7 minutes/plot, 1–4 times/month, and eggs and caterpillars of four species (monarch, queen, black swallowtail, gulf fritillary) were counted weekly or monthly on 2–14 host plants/butterfly species/plot.</p>",
