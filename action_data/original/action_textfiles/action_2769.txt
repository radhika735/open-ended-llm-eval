        "background_definitions": "<p>Fishing vessel owners are required to register or licence their vessel in a country and it is subsequently deemed the nationality of the vessel, falling under the laws and jurisdiction of that country. This is called its “flag state” (see ‘<em>Enforcement and Compliance to Reduce Illegal Fishing - <a href=\"../../actions/2768\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Use flags to signal the legal nationality of a fishing vessel</a>’</em>). A flag of convenience is a business practice whereby a vessel is registered in a country other than that of the vessel’s owner. Adopting a flag of convenience can make it easier to engage in illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing activity (Gianni &amp; Simpson 2005). Elimination of flags of convenience may thus help prevent illegal fishing and protect fish populations and marine environments from the threat of over exploitation.</p>\r\n<p>Evidence for a related intervention describing the use of the flag on marine vessels is summarized under <em>‘Enforcement and Compliance to Reduce Illegal Fishing - <a href=\"../../actions/2768\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Use flags to signal the legal nationality of a fishing vessel</a>’</em>.</p>\r\n<p>Gianni M. &amp; Simpson W.
