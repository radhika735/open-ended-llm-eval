        "background_definitions": "<p class=\"Background\">Periodic wildfires and grazing/browsing by wild animals maintained open savanna ecosystems in parts of the world, retarding woody plant encroachment and succession to woodland. In some regions where these natural processes have been lost, and where active fire suppression may have also occurred, rotational burning may be used to reinstate and maintain more open habitat conditions amenable. Other methods commonly used include thinning of trees and shrubs, timber harvesting, and livestock grazing.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">There is a continuum between habitats classified as ‘savannas’ and those classified as ‘forests’ and ‘grasslands’. Relevant information for management of habitats with both trees and grasses may, therefore, be found in all three sections.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

Seven units (8-18 ha) were subject to one of seven burn frequencies, ranging from nearly every year to no burning over the previous 31 years. Burns were conducted in spring (except two in late summer). Bird species richness in the two unburned units (17 and 23 species) was lower than that of two frequently burned units (30 and 32) in June 1995 and similar in 1996.<strong> </strong>As woodland became more open, upper tree canopy insectivores declined, whilst omnivorous birds, particularly ground and lower canopy foragers increased. Woodpeckers increased as standing dead tree abundance increased.</p><p> </p>",

Of the 31 bird species analysed, 12 were more common in burned savanna and five more common in unburned forest. Twelve savanna sites maintained by burns (spring, autumn or both, on a 3-5 year rotation, with periodic removal of <em>Acer</em> spp. and European buckthorn <em>Rhamnus catharticus</em>) were paired with 12 forest sites (no burning for over 50 years). Point counts were conducted for 3-5 years (between 25 May-10 July 1995-1999) to assess bird abundance.
