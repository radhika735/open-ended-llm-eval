        "background_definitions": "<p>Habitat fragmentation, as well as destruction, may be an important driver of population declines. Small areas hold fewer species than large ones and if individuals are unable to cross areas of converted habitat then populations in separate habitat patches will become isolated. This potentially makes them more vulnerable to extinction, from natural variations in birth and death rates or sex ratios, from inbreeding depression and from outside pressures, both natural (such as storms or wildfires) and man-made (such as hunting or continued habitat loss), although the precise effects of habitat fragmentation, as opposed to loss, are debated (e.g. Fahrig 1997).</p>\r\n<p>Theoretically, the number of species surviving in a habitat fragment is determined by its size and its effective distance to other habitat patches (MacArthur &amp; Wilson 1967). Maintaining habitat connectivity is therefore often seen as a way to increase the viability of populations, but there is considerable debate as to the effectiveness of such ‘wildlife corridors’ (e.g. Beier &amp; Noss 1998).</p>\r\n<p>Studies describing the effects of creating or restoring habitat, rather than retaining what is already there, are in <em>Habitat restoration and creation</em>.</p>\r\n<p><sup>Beier P. &amp; Noss R.F.

Reptile species composition, richness, total abundance and abundance of leaf litter lizards <em>Ecpleopus gaudichaudii</em> were similar between connected (richness: 1–4 species, total abundance: 10–15 individuals, total leaf litter lizard abundance: 3–15 individuals) and isolated forest fragments (richness: 2–3 species, total abundance: 11–33 individuals, total leaf litter lizard abundance: 2–29 individuals), regardless of fragment size (species composition results reported as model outputs). Forest fragments (2–48 ha) in the Morro Grande Forest Reserve (~9,400 ha) were classified as connected with corridors (four small and four large fragments, corridors included were 25–100 m wide native vegetation) or isolated (three small and four large fragments). Lizards were surveyed along 100 m long transects using drift fences with pitfall traps (11 traps/transect) in January–February 2002 and December 2002–January 2003 (traps open for 16 days/site, lizards individually marked prior to release).</p>",

The similarity of reptile communities in undegraded forest, degraded forest and cultivated areas was higher in the site with hedges than in the site without hedges (result reported as dissimilarity index). Nine species were found in cultivated areas with hedges (1–19 individuals) that were not found in cultivated areas with no hedges, whereas the opposite was true for only two species (1–3 individuals). Two sites were selected that contained undegraded forest, degraded forest and cultivated areas. In one site, hedges (2 m high, containing non-native <em>Opuntia</em> spp. and native vegetation) surrounded cultivated areas and bordered degraded forest. The other site had no hedges. Eight 100 m transects were established in each habitat, and all reptile species were recorded within 1.5 m of the transect line (10 surveys in February–April 2012). In cultivated areas transects followed field boundaries (hedges vs no hedges).</p>",
