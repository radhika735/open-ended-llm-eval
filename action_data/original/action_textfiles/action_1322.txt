The time adults spent feeding on chow decreased from 17 minutes when it was not coloured to 13 minutes when it was coloured. Juveniles averaged 1–2 pieces of plain chow daily, which increased to three coloured pieces, while the adults’ daily consumption increased from 75 pieces to 84 once it was coloured. ‘Purina’ monkey chow was dipped in red, green, blue and orange food colouring and offered to three adults and two juveniles. Equal numbers of differently coloured pieces of chow were offered. Observations took place for 45 minutes/day for eight days with uncoloured chow, coloured chow and then uncoloured chow again.    (CJ)</p><p> </p>",
