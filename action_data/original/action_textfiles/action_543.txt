However, it is worth noting that species that forage in groups can have dominance hierarchies, which alter the relationship between weight and fitness. For example Gentle and Gosler (2001) found that, amongst great tits Parus major in Oxfordshire, England, more dominant birds had a lower mass than subdominants, particularly when perceived predation risk was high. Birds with lower masses are better able to take off and therefore escape predators than heavier birds (Krams 2002). However, because of their dominance, they were able to usurp other birds from food resources when hungry. Care should therefore be taken when interpreting results which do not directly examine survival.</p>\r\n<p>Krams, I.

Feeding was only possible, however, after a switch from ‘Wildbird Mix’ seed – which was eaten by mallards <em>Anas platyrhynchos</em> that then dominated other feeders and chased them off.
