Cut edges also contained more shrub and edge-nesting species (25 vs. 17 species), but contained fewer woodland species (nine vs. 23 species). Whilst 13 of 60 species recorded were only found in cut edges, 23 of 60 were only found in uncut edges. Overall species richness and nesting success estimates were no different between edge types (14 species/site and 54% success for 35 nests in cut edges vs. 15 species/site and 52% for 25 nests in controls). Cut edges consisted on felling trees 15-40 m into each woodlot and leaving the debris in place. This occurred two or three years before bird surveys were conducted.</p><p> </p>",

The authors suggest this difference may be due to increased cover in cut edges.
