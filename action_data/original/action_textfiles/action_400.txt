These must be able to allow chicks and adults to get in and out, but not predators and should be quick to install to minimise the chances of parents abandoning nests (see ‘Can nest protection increase nest abandonment?’).</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">Unfortunately, because each cage is over a nest, it is possible that predators will learn the association and that providing the exclosures will actually increase predation on either adults or chicks (see ‘Can nest protection increase predation of adult and chick waders?’)</p>\r\n<p>The effectiveness score for this intervention included a combined assessment of the evidence for <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"../../actions/397\">chicks of ground nesting seabirds</a></span>, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"../../actions/398\">chicks of waders</a></span>, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"../../actions/399\">chicks of storks and ibises</a></span>, and <span>chicks of songbirds</span>.</p>",

In addition, a single chaffinch <em>Fringilla coelebs</em> (an introduced species) was caged and survived. In 1987-88, all chicks from one of six caged grey fantail <em>Rhipidura fuliginosa </em>nests died, whereas no uncaged nests were lost. Cages were made of wire-mesh, stretched to ensure that food could be passed through by the parents but that birds’ heads could not be caught.</p><p> </p>",

However this increase was not significant (nesting success of 36% for 48 nests in 1990-92 vs. 16% for 42 in 1987-89). This study also investigated the use of predator removal through poisoning, discussed in ‘Control mammalian predators on islands’.
