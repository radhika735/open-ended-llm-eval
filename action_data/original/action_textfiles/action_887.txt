        "background_definitions": "<p>For this synopsis we consider higher numbers and a higher diversity of microorganisms as indicators of healthy soil. Protozoa are single-celled organisms which can move around, feed on organic matter (carbon and nitrogen compounds) and often also photosynthesise, which means they can fix carbon into organic compounds, providing food sources for other organisms. Nematodes are tiny, often microscopic worms. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are a group of fungi that live around the roots of plants. By living together, the fungi and host plant benefit each other: the fungi can live in a habitat without having to compete for resources and have a supply of carbon from the plant, while they provide an enhanced supply of nutrients to the plant, improving plant growth, the ability to reproduce and tolerance to drought. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonise a wide variety of host plants including grasses, herbs, agricultural crops and legumes (Bardgett 2005).</p>\r\n<p>Soil aggregates are groups of soil particles that bind to each other more strongly than to adjacent particles. Aggregate stability is the ability of soil aggregates to resist disintegration when disruptive forces associated with tillage and water or wind erosion are applied. Soil stability can is the ability of a soil to resist damage and chemical and physical change.</p>\r\n<p>Bardgett R. (2005) <em>The Biology of Soil: A community and ecosystem approach</em>.

The panicum without mulch treatment was less effective (5.2 t/ha, 356 mm) than mulched palmarosa. Maize <em>Zea mays</em> yield was 43% higher under minimal tillage with mulched palmarosa compared to no vegetation barrier with conventional tillage. The succeeding wheat <em>Triticum aestivum</em> yield was on average 73% higher in the palmarosa relative to panicum treatment, and 99% higher than with no vegetation barrier. It is not clear whether these results were due to organic amendments, mulching or reduced tillage. There were three replications of three treatments in a maize-wheat crop rotation: conventional tillage with no vegetation barrier but applying fertilizers and herbicides; conventional tillage with a panicum <em>Panicum maximum </em>vegetation barrier, fertilizers and herbicides; minimal tillage (30% crop cover retained) with a palmarosa vegetation barrier plus mulching and farmyard manure, vermicompost (produced by worms) and poultry manure applications. Plots were 100 x 20 m.</p><p> </p>",

There were three compaction treatments in a soybean <em>Glycine max </em>crop obtained using a wheel tractor: strongly compacted (5 passes); moderately compacted (3 passes); and uncompacted (0 passes) soil. There were six replicates. Within each treatment were 1.8 x 2.1 m plots with either no mulch or a straw mulch. Fertilizer was applied uniformly to all plots at 54-70-80 kg/ha NPK. Bacterial numbers and enzyme activities were measured in soil samples taken three times during crop development from the centre of the soybean rows.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>",
