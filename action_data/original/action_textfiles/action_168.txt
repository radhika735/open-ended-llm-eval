Supporting such systems may therefore help declining farmland bird populations. However, whilst we captured many studies describing the distribution of birds across high- and low-intensity agricultural systems, we found no intervention-based evidence for the effects of legislation aimed at supporting and maintaining low-intensity agricultural systems on bird populations.</p>",
