        "background_definitions": "<p>Trawl fisheries are a common type of fishing practice around the world. The codend of a trawl net is designed to retain fish and often leads to large numbers of unwanted fish being caught. This can be reduced by modifying the codend design to increase the size selectivity of the gear. One way this might be done is to change the orientation of the meshes of the net. Standard trawl codends are constructed from diamond shaped meshes. During deployment the diamond meshes close under tension and the size of the opening through which fish can escape is drastically reduced. Rotating or turning the orientation of diamond mesh involves the knots of the meshes being tied in such a way that the mesh is turned through 90 degrees to the water flow (often referred to as T90 mesh). This results in the meshes being held more open under tension and maintains a larger gap through which fish can escape. This may in turn help to reduce the catches of unwanted smaller fish.</p>\r\n<p>Note: Rotated, or T90, diamond mesh is not to be confused with nets made of square mesh, which consist of diamond mesh turned through 45 degrees to the water flow to create a square shape ensuring the meshes remain almost fully open (see <em>‘Fishing gear modification – <a href=\"../../actions/2714\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">‘Use a square mesh instead of a diamond mesh codend in a trawl net’</a></em>.).</p>\r\n<p>Evidence for a similar intervention applied to trawl nets only is summarized under<em> ‘Fishing gear modification – <a href=\"../../actions/2714\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">‘Use a square mesh instead of a diamond mesh codend in a trawl net’</a></em>. For interventions describing the effects of different mesh types in fishing gear more generally, but including trawl nets, see <em>‘Fishing gear modification - <a href=\"../../actions/2697\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Use a larger mesh size</a>’</em>.</p>",

Data were not statistically tested. The length at which cod had a 50% chance of escaping was 32.2 cm in a turned diamond mesh codend and 23.7 cm in a standard diamond mesh codend (both 99 mm mesh size). The review summarised data from 10 studies between 2005–2010 on the effects on cod catch and size selectivity of various modifications to trawl nets targeting Norway lobster <em>Nephrops norvegicus.</em> One of the 10 studies identified provided size selectivity data for diamond mesh codends with and without rotated mesh from 16 trawl deployments for each codend type (original study written in Danish).</p>",

In two of two trials, the length at which cod had a 50% chance of escaping was greater in turned diamond mesh trawl nets (39–42 cm) than standard trawl nets (34–39 cm). Data were collected by research vessel surveys on fishing grounds south of the island of Bornholm in October 2009. Two trawl codends of netting made with the diamond meshes turned 90° relative to the standard (one with 46 and one with 91 meshes circumference) were tested against two standard diamond mesh nets (44 and 92 meshes circumference). Eight deployments of the 90°/46 mesh circumference and seven deployments of each of the 90°/91 mesh circumference and both the standard trawl nets were made.</p>",
