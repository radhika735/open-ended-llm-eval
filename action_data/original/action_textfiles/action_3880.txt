        "background_definitions": "<p>Wildfires are part of a natural disturbance process in many habitats, and help to retain open landscapes such as grasslands and savannas. However, fire is destructive, and in the short-term will destroy habitat and kill butterflies and moths (Glaves <em>et al.</em> 2013). In areas occupied by sensitive and range-restricted species, it may therefore be necessary to suppress or control fires – whether natural or anthropogenic – to reduce their impact to small areas. This may be achieved by using herbicides or manual vegetation clearance to reduce the fuel-load in fire-prone areas, or deliberately burning small areas to reduce the risk of large wildfires.</p>\r\n<p>For studies on creating fire breaks to restrict the spread of wildfires, see “<a href=\"../../actions/3881\"><em>Mechanically remove mid-storey or ground vegetation to create fire breaks</em></a>”.</p>\r\n<p><sup>Glaves D.J., Morecroft M., Fitzgibbon C., Lepitt P., Owen M. &amp; Phillips S.
