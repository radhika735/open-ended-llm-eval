        "background_definitions": "<p>Numerous fishing methods involve the use of panels of meshed netting to harvest the target species. Fishing with a net may be active (or mobile) whereby the net is dragged or hauled through the water, or it may be passive whereby the net is deployed in a fixed or semi-fixed location for a period of time. The size and shape of fish that are caught by the net is determined by the shape and the size of the mesh. As well as the target fish, fishing nets may catch immature and undersized fish or fish of unwanted species. To reduce the amount of unwanted species and/or smaller sizes caught, and thus make the net more selective, a larger size of mesh may allow unwanted individuals to escape capture while retaining the commercially targeted species or sizes (Burgos‐León <em>et al.</em> 2009).</p>\r\n<p>Note: The mesh sizes reported here are typically the ‘nominal’ measurements of the mesh sizes’ given in the studies, i.e. the approximate intended size of the meshes in a net. The actual mesh size, usually measured as the average size of several meshes stretched under tension, may vary depending on factors like the configuration of the knots or twine characteristics. In addition, during use, the effective size (or gap opening) of the meshes may also change with how the net is deployed (e.g. towing speed for trawl nets) and the size of the catch.</p>\r\n<p>Evidence for interventions describing other modifications to fishing net mesh (size and/or shape) is summarized under<em> ‘Fishing gear modification – <a href=\"../../actions/2714\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Use a square mesh instead of a diamond mesh codend on trawl nets</a>; <a href=\"../../actions/2701\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Modify gillnet or entangling (trammel/tangle) net configuration</a>’ and ‘<a href=\"../../actions/2715\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rotate the orientation of diamond mesh in a trawl net’</a></em>.</p>\r\n<p>Burgos‐León A., Pérez‐Castañeda R. &amp; Defeo O.

In January–February 1990, a total of 14 trawl deployments were undertaken in the western English Channel from a 64 m commercial fishing vessel. Nine trawl deployments used an experimental codend of 60 mm square mesh, and five deployments used a conventional 40 mm diamond mesh codend. The experimental codend was 4 m shorter than the conventional codend, with four panels rather than the conventional two. Each trawl design was deployed alternately when shoals of mackerel were visible in the water. All mackerel caught in each trawl were counted and measured.</p>",

For diamond and square meshes, the size at which fish had a 50% chance of escape typically increased with increasing mesh size for five of five species: cod <em>Gadus morhua</em> (diamond, large: 66 cm, intermediate: 59 cm small: 52 cm; square, large: 69 cm, small, 59 cm)<em>,</em> haddock <em>Melanogrammus aeglefinus</em> (diamond, large: 61 cm, intermediate: 55 cm small: 50 cm; square, large: 57 cm, small, 54 cm), long rough dab <em>Hippoglossoides platessoides</em> (diamond, large: 39 cm, intermediate: 40 cm small: 36 cm; square, large: 35 cm, small, 33 cm), yellowtail flounder <em>Limanda ferruginea </em>(diamond, large: 42 cm, intermediate: 40 cm small: 38 cm; square, large: 38 cm, small, 34 cm), and witch flounder <em>Glyptocephalus cynoglossus</em> (diamond, large: 46 cm, intermediate: 43 cm small: 40 cm; square, large: 40 cm, small, 36 cm). For haddock and long rough dab, the difference between the large and intermediate diamond mesh sizes was not significant. Data were collected from 86 trawl deployments on a commercial fishing vessel in May–July 2003. Five codends were tested, three diamond mesh (178 mm, 165 mm and 152 mm mesh size) and two square mesh (178 mm and 165 mm mesh size). The existing minimum mesh was 165 mm for both diamond and square. The five codends were tested randomly in a preselected order with each being tested for up to six consecutive tows. Each codend had a small mesh cover to collect fish escaping through the meshes. Upon hauling, fish were sorted by species and individual lengths recorded.</p>",

Data were not tested for statistical significance. The length at which saithe had a 50% chance of escape was 52.4 cm with the largest mesh size (165 mm), 45.6 cm with an intermediate mesh size (140 mm) and 34.8 cm with the smallest mesh size (114 mm). Data were collected in March-April 2013 from 21 trawl deployments (average 0.5 h duration) on a commercial bottom trawler using a trawl net with two diamond mesh codends (trouser trawl). One of three experimental codends with different diamond mesh sizes (165 mm – the minimum required mesh size, 140 mm, and 114 mm) was fished on one side, and a small diamond mesh (64 mm) codend on the other to sample the whole length range of fish. Each experimental codend was used for three days before being switched for a different mesh size (six to eight hauls of each pairing). Catch weights and the lengths of a random subsample of at least 100 saithe where possible from both codends were recorded each haul. Full gear details are provided in the original study.</p>",

The selectivity of pomfret (measured as the optimum length - the length at which fish were retained by the gear at the highest frequency) was greater with a larger mesh size of 130 mm compared to a smaller 110 mm mesh size (large: 155 cm, small: 131 mm). In addition, the authors noted that a mesh size of 166 mm was the optimum for the release of pomfret at size at first maturity (199 mm). Fortnightly commercial gillnet data were collected between August 2014–April 2015 from vessels fishing out of the landing centre of Satpati, using either 130 mm or 110 mm mesh sizes (see original paper for gear and vessel specifications). The nets were deployed at the surface, in the water column or bottom drifted in depths from 35–50 m. Vessel numbers and fishing duration (soak times) were not reported.</p>",

For both trawl and seine nets, the ratio of undersized individuals/total number of individuals in catches was lower with larger mesh sizes (&gt;109 mm) compared to smaller mesh sizes (90–109 mm) for one of six fish species, and similar between mesh sizes for five (data reported as statistical results). Data were collected in 1997–2012 by a discard sampling programme, from 460 and 285 commercial deployments by bottom trawlers (74 vessels) and seine netters (33 vessels), respectively. The mesh sizes used by each gear type were grouped into two categories: ≥110 mm and 90–109 mm. Regulatory changes during the sampling period included mandatory square mesh panels in trawl nets (2000 and 2011 – see original paper for specifications). After each deployment, the lengths of all fish were recorded.</p>",

Average whiting length was similar in catches between the large mesh trawl and a standard trawl (large: 27.0 cm, standard: 26.9 cm). Data were collected in January 2010 from 38 paired deployments by two 20–24 m commercial trawlers fishing parallel to each other: one rigged with a large mesh trawl net and the other a standard net (see paper for detailed specifications). Weights of commercial and non-commercial portions of the catch and total lengths of individual whiting were recorded. Random sub-sampling was done when catches were large.</p>",
