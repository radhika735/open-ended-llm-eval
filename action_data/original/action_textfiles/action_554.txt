Supplementary feeding ran from early December until early March and consisted of four sunflower seed feeders and a 6 x 3 m area beneath them sprinkled with mixed seed. The species studied were dark-eyed junco <em>Junco hyemalis</em>, Harris’s sparrow <em>Zonotrichia querula</em>, song sparrow <em>Melospiza melodia</em>, American tree sparrow <em>Spizella arborea</em>, northern cardinal <em>Cardinalis cardinalis</em>, black-capped chickadee <em>Parus atricapillus</em> (also known as <em>Poecile atricapillus</em>) and tufted titmouse <em>Parus bicolor</em>. The effects of feeding on songbird body condition are discussed in ‘Provide supplementary food to increase adult survival’.</p><p> </p>",

The restaurant was supplied with approximately 200 kg/week of goat and pig carcasses whilst naturally occurring carcasses consisted of one goat and one yellow-legged gull <em>Larus michaellis</em>. Nests imitated either those of lesser short-toed larks <em>Calandrella refescens </em>or cream-coloured coursers <em>Cursorius </em>cursor and contained two Japanese quail <em>Cortunix japonica </em>eggs.</p><p> </p>",
