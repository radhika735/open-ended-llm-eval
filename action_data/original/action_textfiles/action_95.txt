Summer roost sites where bats rest during the day may be found in buildings, hollow trees, under bridges or in caves (Entwistle <em>et al</em>. 2001). Artificial roost sites in the form of bat boxes can provide additional roosting habitat, they are typically made of wood and may be placed on buildings or trees (Entwistle <em>et al</em>. 2001). Existing roosting sites may be protected from disturbance by installing bat grilles. Grilles allow bats to access their roost sites whilst excluding humans (Mitchell-Jones 2004).</p>\r\n<p class=\"StyleSynopsisBodyTextItalic\">Entwistle A.C., Harris S., Hutson A.M., Racey P.A., Walsh A., Gibson S.D., Hepburn I. &amp; Johnston J.
