This has destroyed habitat and can also lead to less frequent, but far more damaging floods. Using environmentally sensitive flood management may both provide habitats and reduce the damage caused by flooding.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

The experimental stretch had one bank excavated to create a 0.3 m high shelf (a ‘flood beam’) just above the level of the main channel. This meant that the main channel continued to carry water during dry periods (at a rate of 2 m<sup>3</sup>/s) but during heavy rains, the beam would carry water as well (at up to 40 m<sup>3</sup>/s) increasing the width and the flow capacity of the river.</p><p> </p>",
