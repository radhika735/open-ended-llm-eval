        "background_definitions": "<p>Fishing using trawls involves towing trawl gear either through the water column or along the seabed, behind one or more fishing vessels. There are many different types of trawl gear and they vary according to the species being targeted and the characteristics of the fished area. However, in general they consist of the main trawl net – made from one or more panels of netting – held open by either a metal beam (beam trawl) or solid doors (e.g. otter boards), attached to the trawl net by long wires (“sweeps” and “bridles”). Trawls often have floats attached to the rope at the top of the net opening (“headrope”) to help keep the net open while fishing and, in the case of bottom trawls, solid discs (“bobbins” or “rockhoppers”) along the rope at the bottom (footrope) to reduce the likelihood of the net getting caught or damaged on the seabed (Grieve <em>et al.</em> 2014). Some trawl gear may be towed as a single, double, or even triple-net configuration. Individual trawl components can be adjusted or modified to improve efficiency and catch rates of commercially targeted species. However, modifications may also reduce the catches of unwanted fish species or sizes.

For both gear types, extension length affected size-selectivity and increased with decreasing length (data reported as statistical results). Overall, the estimated lengths at which fish had a 50% chance of escape with the shortest extension piece (0 m) ranged from 15–32 cm for haddock, 20–35 cm for whiting and 16–36 cm for cod. For the longest extension length (13.7 m) these were decreased to 11–28 cm for haddock, 15–30 cm for whiting and 12–32 cm for cod. In addition, gear size-selectivity increased with increasing mesh size and narrower diameters of the codend, and their effect was greater than the effect of extension length. Data were collected during three surveys on two commercial vessels between 1986–1988 in the northern or central North Sea. Fishing was conducted with two seine nets and one trawl net configured with three different extension lengths (0, 9.1 and 13.7 m), mesh sizes (80, 90 and 100 mm) and codend diameters (2.2, 3.2 and 4 m). For seine nets, 114 hauls were completed with a 9.1 m extension, 104 hauls with a 13.7 m extension and 110 hauls with a 0 m extension. For the trawls, 37, 35 and 35 hauls were completed for the 9.1, 13.7 and 0 m extensions, respectively. Small mesh covers attached over the codends sampled fish escaping through the meshes. All fish in the codends and covers were identified, and length recorded. No cod were caught in trawl net deployments.</p>",

Catch rates of the target school prawn <em>Metapenaeus macleayi</em> were similar across trawl configurations, (single: 600, double: 750, triple: 900, quadruple: 1,450 ind/ha), although single-rigged trawls retained larger individuals. In March and May 2012, a total of 36 experimental deployments/trawl configuration were made in the Clarence River estuary (3–18 m depth) of four trawl configurations: single, double, triple or quadruple-rigged. All used 45 mm mesh, but each configuration had different technical specifications (see original paper for details).</p>",

In summer (austral) 2013, a total of 36 trawl deployments in Lake Wooloweyah estuary in New South Wales (at 1–2 m depth) were done with each of four trawl designs: an otter trawl, with and without sweep bridles, and a beam trawl with and without a horizontal wire. Sweep wires were removed to test reduction in the herding of fish into the net and the horizontal wire was designed to produce a fish escape response.

Catch rate of only one of seven unwanted fish species, Australian anchovy <em>Engraulis australis</em>, was lower in a short trawl (0–2 fish/ha) than a long trawl (1–3 fish/ha), irrespective of day or night sampling times, and southern herring <em>Herklotsichthys castelnaui</em> catch rate was lower in the short trawl during daylight only (short: 48 fish/ha, long: 68 fish/ha). However, regardless of trawl type, catch rates of forktail catfish <em>Arius graeffei</em>, pinkbreast siphonfish <em>Siphamia roseigaster</em>, and yellowfin bream <em>Acanthopagrus australis</em>, were lower during the day than night, whereas whitebait <em>Hyperlophus vittatus</em> catches were lower during the night. Neither trawl type nor sampling time affected catch rates of Ramsey's perchlet <em>Ambassis marianus </em>(see original paper for species individual data by trawl type/sampling time). In addition, the catch rates (weight and numbers) of the target species school prawns <em>Metapenaeus macleayi </em>were lower in the short trawl than the long trawl (short: 7 kg/ha, long: 9 kg/ha). In March and April 2014, a total of 44 paired deployments (45 min) were made in Lake Wooloweyah, Clarence River estuary, New South Wales, with one short and one long prawn trawl, during six days and four nights.

Overall catch numbers of unwanted fish were reduced in three of the four modified trawls compared to the conventional trawl (diamond mesh wings, both loose and tight: 35 fish/ha, loose square mesh: 37 fish/ha, conventional: 55 fish/ha), but were similar in the tight square mesh trawl (40 fish/ha). By weight, catch rate of all non-target fish species was reduced only with loose diamond wings (0.7 kg/ha) compared to the conventional trawl (1.1 kg/ha), and was similar between the other three designs and the conventional trawl (0.8 kg/ha). In (austral) summer 2013/2014, four novel trawl configurations (35 mm diamond or square mesh wing/side panels, and loose or tight hanging ratios) were tested against a conventional trawl with 41 mm diamond mesh wings. Twenty-four deployments of each trawl design were conducted on a twin-rigged trawler, paired with another design. All trawls also had a size-sorting escape grid.

The length at which fish had a 50% chance of escaping was higher in machine-woven codends than hand-woven codends for: red mullet <em>Mullus barbatus</em> (machine: 8–14 cm, hand: 7 cm); brushtooth lizardfish <em>Saurida undosquamis</em> (machine: 23–28 cm, hand: 8 cm); common pandora <em>Pagellus erythrinus</em> (machine: 12–15 cm, hand: 8 cm); goldband goatfish <em>Upeneus moluccensis </em>(machine: 12–21 cm, hand: 5 cm); and Randall’s threadfin bream <em>Nemipterus randalli</em> (machine: 10–14 cm, hand: 6 cm). In addition, the proportions of undersized fish retained for the five species were lower in machine codends compared to the hand codend design, however, there were also increased losses of commercial sizes for some species (see original paper for full data by species). Trials were done with three alternative machine-woven trawl codends (40 mm square mesh; 44 mm and 50 mm diamond mesh) and a commercial hand-woven codend (44 mm diamond mesh) on fishing grounds in Mersin Bay between January-December 2011. Data were collected from a total of 87 individual deployments (20–23 of each of the four codends) onboard a commercial trawler. Tow duration was 80–220 minutes at a speed of 2.3–2.8 knots. A small-mesh cover was fitted over each codend to collect the escaped fish. Catches in the codends and covers were sampled.</p>",

In addition, target shrimp <em>Penaeidae</em> catches were reduced in all W-trawl designs compared to the conventional, by 27–80%. Trials were carried out by a double-rigged commercial vessel on trawl fishing grounds in Moreton Bay in February 2014. One of four designs of W-trawl were deployed in paired tows with a conventional trawl design (Florida Flyer).

Fishing trials were done in the austral summer in the Clarence River estuary (2–20 m depth) using a local trawler. Knot-force direction in the top and bottom net panels was compared by turning a conventional trawl with a positive angle of attack inside out to create a negative angle of attack (see original paper for full gear specifications). A total of 24 paired deployments (45 min) of both trawl types were completed. The authors reported that altering the knot orientation may have affected the overall geometry of the trawl during fishing (e.g. a lower position in the water column and lower headline height).</p>",
