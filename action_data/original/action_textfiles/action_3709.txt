In July 2001, Texas horned lizards were opportunistically surveyed in 1 km<sup>2</sup> plots reseeded with either a native species mix excluding buffalo grass (4 plots), a native species mix including buffalo grass (4 plots), or non-native grasses (weeping lovegrass <em>Eragrostis curvula </em>or Old World bluestem <em>Bothriochloa ischaemum</em>, 7 non-native grass plots), as well as a single plot of unseeded unploughed native grass (16 total plots).

California king snakes and western fence lizards were observed from two years after restoration took place (in 2001–2003). Gopher snakes were recorded in the year after restoration took place only. Western whiptail lizards <em>Cnemidophorus tigris </em>were recorded before restoration, but not afterwards, although the authors report that they are likely to have persisted in low numbers. In 1999, native plants were introduced to 20 plots (4 ha) in randomized blocks by either seeding or transplanting, with or without surface contouring. Visual encounter surveys (circular plots and transects) and artificial coverboard surveys (4/plot) were undertaken once before restoration in 1999 and at least 12 times thereafter in 2000–2003.</p>",
