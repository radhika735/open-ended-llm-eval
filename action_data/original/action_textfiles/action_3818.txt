In areas or fisheries where permits or licences are required to fish, “buy-back” schemes that purchase the permits/licences from fishers may remove excess capacity (vessels and/or fishers) and reduce fishing effort, thereby potentially reducing unwanted catch and the overall threat to fish from overfishing.</p>",
