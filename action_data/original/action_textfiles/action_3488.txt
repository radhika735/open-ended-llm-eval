        "background_definitions": "<p>Conventional ploughing or tilling disturbs the soil to about 25–35 cm (Tebrügge &amp; Düring 1999). Ploughing can impact reptiles when individuals are buried by ploughing activity (Saumure <em>et al.</em> 2007), or when ploughing destroys nesting sites (Hódar <em>et al.</em> 2000). A number of methods can be used to reduce the depth or intensity of ploughing such as layered cultivation, non-inversion tillage and conservation tillage. Such practices have been found to be beneficial for some farmland biodiversity (Holland &amp; Luff 2000). ‘Conservation agriculture’ attempts to alter the soil profile as little as possible by direct sowing and/or leaving the soil protected with plant residues (García-Torres <em>et al.</em> 2002).</p>\r\n<p><sup>García-Torres L., Martínez-Vilela A., Holgado-Cabrera A. &amp; Gónzalez-Sánchez E.
