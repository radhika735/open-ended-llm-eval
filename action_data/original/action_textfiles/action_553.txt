The most common were New Holland honeyeaters <em>Phylidonyris novaehollandiae</em>, white-cheeked honeyeaters <em>P. niger</em>, yellow-faced honeyeaters <em>Meliphaga chrysops</em>, whiteeared honeyeaters <em>Meliphaga leucotis</em>, Little Wattlebirds <em>Anthochaera chrysoptera</em>. Species showed seasonal variations in use, but these were not consistent across species. Between eight and 14 feeders were distributed across a 4 ha patch of heath, at least 30 m from the centre of any known honeyeater territory. Feeders consisted of commercial hummingbird feeders modified so that they had a wider drinking hole, or larger plastic bottles with a curved drinking tube. Feeders were filled with 25% by weight sugar solution for four 48 hour periods each month. Feeders were also visited (briefly) by Silvereyes <em>Zosterops lateralis</em>, an eastern whipbird <em>Psophodes olivaceus</em> and non-birds (<em>Antechinus –</em> a small marsupial and honeybees <em>Apis mellifera</em>).</p><p> </p>",
