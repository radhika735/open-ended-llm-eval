The species richness of butterflies was also similar in grazed and mown meadows (data not presented). Twenty-two traditionally managed fens were compared. Eleven fens were mown once/year from September onwards, and 11 were grazed with cattle or horses. The mown sites received financial support to maintain management. From June–August 1994, butterflies were surveyed along a fixed transect five times in each meadow.</p>",

From 1–4 years after grazing of the wet grassland began, the number of bog fritillaries using grazed areas (6–10% of recaptures) was lower than before grazing started (17–44% of recaptures). The number of butterflies which emerged on grazed patches was also lower after grazing commenced than before grazing (data not presented). From July 2002–June 2004, Galloway cattle were grazed in a wet grassland reserve (June–September: 0.43–0.75 cows/ha; October–May: 0.11–0.38 cows/ha), but were excluded from four patches of high-quality bog fritillary habitat that were monitored (1.05 ha). In the grazed areas, three patches of low-quality habitat (1.26 ha) were monitored. From 1992–2006, bog fritillaries were monitored by catching, marking, releasing and re-catching individuals in all seven patches (details not provided). Each year, the “use rate” of each patch (number of recaptures within the patch divided by the total number of recaptures across all patches) and “emergence” (number of butterflies caught soon after emergence in each patch) were calculated.</p>",
