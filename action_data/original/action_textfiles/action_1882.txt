The only fertile spawning occurred in spring 1996, which contained 25 eggs, but they were destroyed by fungus. From 1994-1995 , two male and three sub-adult frogs were housed in two outdoor tanks (120 x 60 x 60 cm) with a sub-surface water depth 50-100mm. Males called when they were in outdoor enclosures, but fertile eggs were not produced until animals were moved to indoor tanks. From 1996, 6–7 frogs were housed in each of the five indoor enclosures.</p>",

At Melbourne Zoo from 2006–2009 females were kept in the same breeding enclosure for the season and not moved (average clutch size: 17; egg mortality: 91%). In 2010, females were moved between two breeding enclosures (average clutch size: 20; egg mortality: 78%). In 2011, no female moves are reported, (average clutch size: 40; egg mortality: 70%).  In 2012, females were moved between breeding tanks (average clutch size: 46; egg mortality: 27%). At Taronga Zoo in 2010, the three largest females were moved into other breeding tanks mid-season (average clutch size: 80; egg mortality: 72%). Movement of females is not reported for 2011 (average clutch size: 70; egg mortality: 25.5%), or 2012 (average clutch size: 54; egg mortality: 28%).</p>",
