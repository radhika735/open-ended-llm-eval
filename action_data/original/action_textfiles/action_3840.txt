However, by assessing the risk to species populations in advance, and making changes to the plans, it may be possible for careful planning of necessary developments to minimize these negative impacts. Legal requirements for developers to complete Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs), if independently produced, reviewed and enforced, may be beneficial to butterfly and moth conservation.
