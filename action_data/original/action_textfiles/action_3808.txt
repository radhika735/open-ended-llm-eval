        "background_definitions": "<p>Static fishing nets such as long lines and gill nets, are used to commercially harvest fish or marine invertebrates. They are passive gears that can be left either anchored or drifting and fish are captured by numerous baited hooks or by entanglement in the net. Length of gill nets can vary from 50 to 200 m, and they can be set in ‘fleets’ of up to 2,000 m. Similarly, long lines can be set in lengths averaging 45 km long (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, USA) with thousands of hooks. Limiting the permitted number or length of static nets may reduce effects of overfishing by reducing fishing effort, fish mortality and unwanted fish catch.</p>",
