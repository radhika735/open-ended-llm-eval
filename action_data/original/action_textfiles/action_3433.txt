After 1–5 years, forb density was lower in plots where carbon was added and seeds were sown (seeded forbs: 9–35 plants/m<sup>2</sup>; unseeded forbs: 13–70 plants/m<sup>2</sup>) than in plots where no carbon was added and seeds were sown (seeded forbs: 30–128 plants/m<sup>2</sup>; unseeded forbs: 32–186 plants/m<sup>2</sup>). In autumn 2000, two 2.8 × 2.8 m plots in each of ten blocks were tilled and seeded with a combination of native grasses and forbs at a rate of 25 kg/ha. In spring 2001, carbon was added (granular sugar at a rate of 0.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) to one plot/block, while no carbon was added to the other plot. Vegetation was sampled in August 2002–2006 using four randomly placed 0.25-m<sup>2</sup> quadrats/plot.</p>",

After 10–12 years, the average density of sown forb species did not differ significantly between plots where carbon was applied after seeds were sown (29 plants/m<sup>2</sup>) and plots where carbon was not applied after seeds were sown (40 plant/m<sup>2</sup>). In autumn 1998, two 4 x 3 m plots in each of five blocks were tilled and sown with a seed mixture containing four native grasses and 12 native forbs. In spring 1999, one plot/block had carbon applied (granular sugar at a rate of 0.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), while the other plot had no carbon applied. In July–August 2005–2010, the density of sown forb species was estimated in each of the 10 plots.</p>",
