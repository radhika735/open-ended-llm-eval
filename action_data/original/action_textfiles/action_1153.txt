Experiment one found that three soil enhancers did not affect survival (no data), height (soil enhancers: 0.06–7m; untreated: 4.4–5.2 m), diameter (soil enhancers: 0.3–12.9 cm; untreated: 4.6–7.8 cm) or health class (soil enhancers: 2–5; untreated: 3–4.4) of tuart <em>Eucalyptus gomphocephala</em> and Limestone Marlock <em>E. decipiens</em> seedlings. Experiment two found that adding three soil enhancers with fertiliser tablets did not affect survival (no data), height (soil enhancers: 1.6–6 m; untreated: 1.6–6.8 m), diameter (soil enhancers: 1.5–6.5 cm; untreated: 2–7.9 cm) or health (soil enhancers: 2.3–5; untreated: 3.5–4.5) of tuart, Limestone Marlock and coojong <em>Acacia saligna</em> seedlings. Experiment one consisted of four blocks each containing six plots (6 × 10 m). Experiment two consisted of four blocks each with four plots (5 × 6 m). In experiment one, treated plots received all but one of the following treatments: fertiliser tablets, added topsoil, sewage sludge and micronutrients (details see paper). In experiment two, treated plots received all four treatments. Half the plots in each experiment received one application of broadcast fertilizer (superphosphate: 400 kg/ha and potassium chloride: 100 kg/ha). Five seedlings of each species were planted/plot. After 12 years, the survival, height, diameter and health class (index based on stress, herbivory and nutrient deficiencies, 1: dead; 5: healthy) of all seedlings was assessed.</p><p> </p>",

At one site, seedlings were taller in plots treated with a biological stimulant for soil microbes (approx. 106 cm) than in untreated plots (approx. 82), but smaller where a clay-based amendment was added (approx. 63 cm; data taken from a graph). No other treatments had an effect on height (see paper for additional data).<em> </em>None of the<em> </em>treatments increased survival rate. At a second site, seedlings height and survival were higher in plots with fertilizer + moisture retaining chemicals (survival: 80%; height 39 cm) or fertilizer + moisture retaining chemicals + metal ion retaining agent (survival: 82%; height 37 cm) than in untreated plots (survival: 54%; height 28 cm). However, they did not differ from plots treated with fertilizer tablets (survival: 96%; height 50 cm). None of the other treatments had an effect on survival or height. None<em> </em>of the treatments had an effect on plant health class at either site. Each site had three blocks each with six plots (6 × 10 m) containing 20 tuart seedlings. Each plot received one of the following treatments:  fertilizer tablets, a clay-based amendment, a biological stimulant for soil microbes, fertilizer + moisture retaining chemicals, fertilizer + moisture retaining chemicals + metal ion retaining agent, or was left untreated (for details see study, fertilizer treatments differed).  After one year the survival, growth and health of all seedlings was assessed. Seedling health class was based on general vigour, crown density, colour and amount eaten by herbivores.</p><p> </p>",
