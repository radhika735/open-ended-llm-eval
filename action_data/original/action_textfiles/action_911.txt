        "background_definitions": "<p>Soil microbial biomass is the amount of tiny living organisms in a given amount of soil.  Soil microbial respiration is the production of carbon dioxide (CO<sup>2</sup>) when soil organisms respire (breaking down molecules to produce energy). Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are a group of fungi that live around the roots of plants. By living together, the fungi and host plant benefit each other: the fungi can live in a habitat without having to compete for resources and have a supply of carbon from the plant, while benefit the plant with an enhanced supply of nutrients, improved growth and ability to reproduce, and tolerance to drought. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonise a wide variety of host plants, including grasses, herbs, agricultural crops and legumes (Bardgett 2005). They are associated with less intensively cultivated and undisturbed soils.</p>\r\n<p>Soil aggregates are groups of soil particles held together by moist clay, organic matter (such as roots), organic compounds (from bacteria and fungi) or fungal hyphae (long, branching structures of a fungus). Some soil particles fit closely together (high soil density), some do not (low density), creating different-sized spaces. These spaces (or pores) within and between soil aggregates can store air and water, microbes, nutrients and organic matter. Large aggregations of particles retain the most nutrients. Since organic amendments act as strong binding agents between particles, mean weight diameter (MWD) of the aggregates (in mm) soils are likely to increase with applications of organic material such as manures and composts. Soil penetration resistance MPa is the soil’s ability to withstand penetration by water or roots. Often with low penetration resistance comes higher hydraulic conductivity, which is the ease with which a fluid (usually water) can move through pore spaces in the soil. Higher hydraulic conductivity is an indicator of a healthy soil.</p>\r\n<p>Excess levels of soluble salts in the soil can adversely affect plant life by changing a plant’s water balance and basic function, resulting in wilting or scorching. Electrical conductivity is a general measure of the soluble salt content or nutrient level of a soil (high conductivity values typically indicate high salt levels). Good quality topsoil should have an electrical conductivity value within the range of 100-1500 microSiemens/cm (μS/cm). Ceramic cup sampling measures the electrical conductivity of a soil, using a vacuum is connected to tubes in the soil. On the end of the tubes are small ceramic cups which filter moisture from the soil when suction is applied.</p>\r\n<p>Ammonium-nitrate is often added to soils as a fertilizer and if plants do not take it up immediately, the ammonium-nitrate gets converted to nitrate by soil bacteria (nitrification) and can be lost from the soil (leaching). A nitrification inhibitor stops or slows down this conversion, and can reduce the loss of nitrate from the soil.</p>\r\n<p>Bardgett R.
