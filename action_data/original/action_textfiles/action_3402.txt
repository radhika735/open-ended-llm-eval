Cover of native forbs did not differ significantly between areas where nurse plant seeds were sown alongside seeds of grassland species (2.8–10.6%) and areas where seeds of grassland species were sown without nurse plant seeds (3.5–8.1%). The same pattern was true for non-native forbs (nurse: 3.8–21.4%; no nurse: 2.9–22.7%), native grasses (nurse: 7.8–10.0%; no nurse: 5.3–12.1%), and non-native grasses (nurse: 19.4–24.8%; no nurse: 14.1–29.1%). In summer 1992, after construction of a road, original topsoil was replaced at the five sites. In each site, two blocks containing two 8 × 4 m plots were established. In autumn 1992 or 1993, seeds of the nurse plant <em>Triticum × Agropyron</em> were sown with native seeds in one plot, and native seeds, but no nurse plant seed, was sown in one plot. In October 1992, all plots were sprayed with a mixture of wood mulch, tackifier, and nitrogen fertilizer. Vegetation cover of all species was estimated in July 1995 using five 50 × 20 cm quadrats in each plot.</p>",

Two hundred and twenty days after planting, more grass seedlings planted next to aloe bushes were alive (16%) than those without nurse plants (6%). Survival of buffel grass seedlings in the second and third growing seasons after planting did not differ between seedlings next to nurse plants (84–100%) and those without nurse plants (95–100%). In April 2002, nine rows of 14 holes (14 cm diameter and 25 cm deep) were dug in bare ground. Mature aloe bushes were planted in seven holes in each row, and seven holes were refilled without planting aloe bushes. Buffel grass seeds (0.2 g) were sown in furrows 5 cm deep, 20 cm long and 10 cm away on either side of the rows of holes, and covered with soil. Seedling survival was monitored from April 2002–November 2003, which included three complete growing seasons.</p>",

Three to five years after sowing, plots sown with seed mix with nurse species contained 18–22 species, compared to 24–30 species in plots without nurse species. The composition of plant species in plots sown with nurse species was less similar to the target dry grassland community (19–21%) than plots without nurse species (35–45%) (differences not subject to statistical tests). Vegetation cover was also lower in plots with nurse species than those without nurse species in one out of three years (69% vs 88%).  Fifteen 3 x 3 m plots were established on new verges with a slope of approximately 30° constructed of topsoil. In June 1998, ten plots were sown with a mix of six competitive, stress-tolerant species. Five plots were sown with a mix of 12 species which contained ‘nurse’ grasses (<em>Lolium</em> species) and legumes (<em>Trifolium</em> species) in addition to the stress-tolerant species. Seeds were mixed with organic fertilizers, hay mulch, humic acids and water before seeding (hydroseeded). Plant species and cover were recorded in every plot each June. The target community was dry grassland adjacent to the new motorway.</p>",
