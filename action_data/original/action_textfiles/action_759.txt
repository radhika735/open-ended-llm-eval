Populations persisted at all four sites following development, although numbers were lower than pre-development at two sites. After three or more years, three of the populations were classified as ‘medium’ sized (peak count: 19–86) and the other as ‘large’ (167). Mitigation projects during development work had been carried out at least three years previously. Artificial hibernacula and refugia were created at sites in 1992–1999. Terrestrial habitat management was also undertaken at the sites and two sites received 37–73 translocated newts. Monitoring was undertaken in March–May 2005 using egg searches, torch surveys, bottle trapping and mark-recapture.</p><p> </p>",

Thirty-one frogs and nine smooth newts were captured leaving the hibernacula. Although great crested newt <em>Triturus cristatus</em> were recorded breeding in the adjacent pond, none were found to use the three hibernacula. Six hibernacula were created around a pond in 2002. Drift-fencing with four pitfalls were installed around three of the hibernacula in December 2004. Traps were checked in January–March 2005.</p><p> </p>",

In autumn six common frogs <em>Rana temporaria</em> and nine common toads <em>Bufo bufo </em>were found under tiles at two of the sites (with six hibernacula). In spring six great crested newts <em>Triturus cristatus</em>, six smooth newts <em>Triturus vulgaris</em>, seven common toads and two common frogs were caught in pitfall traps near the two hibernacula at one of those sites. Hibernacula were constructed in 2005–2007 by excavating an area 2 x 1 m and 0.5 m deep. This was filled with rubble and covered with tree cuttings and leaves, a permeable geotextile fabric and then soil and grass turf (total height 1 m). In autumn, amphibians were surveyed using six roofing felt tiles (0.5 x 0.5 m) around each hibernaculum. At one site a combination of drift-fencing and pitfall trapping was used to monitor species in spring.</p><p> </p>",
