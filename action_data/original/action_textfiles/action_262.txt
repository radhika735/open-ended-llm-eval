        "background_definitions": "<p class=\"Background\">In 2008, there were an estimated 65 million km of medium- and high-voltage power lines in use across the world, with the network growing at perhaps 5% a year (Jenkins, Smallie, &amp; Diamond 2010). These power lines are a significant threat to many species of birds, with both direct collision mortality and electrocution (from touching multiple wires at once) killing birds. As well as causing potentially unsustainable mortality, these collisions can be economically costly, especially when large-bodied species are involved.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">Species are most at risk if they are large and heavy, with poor eyesight and limited manoeuvrability (Jenkins, Smallie, &amp; Diamond 2010), but some relatively small species, such as gamebirds, are also very vulnerable (Bevanger &amp; Brųseth 2001). Appropriate planning of power lines to avoid high-risk areas (such as those between feeding and roosting grounds) and to follow features such as roads may well reduce bird mortalities (Bevanger 1994), but in many cases wires are already in potentially dangerous locations and techniques are needed to mitigate the damage they cause.</p>\r\n<p>Bevanger, K.
