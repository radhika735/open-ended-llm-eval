By providing amphibians with prey that have been in reared on a substrate dusted with carotenoids, which may not naturally be present in the prey, nutritional deficiencies could be avoided. Carotenoids are found in the yolk of eggs and are thought to provide a range of benefits, including improving neonate health.</span></p>",

Pairs produced fewer clutches on the supplemented diet (average per pair: 8) compared to the unsupplemented diet (14), however, they produced more tadpoles (unsupplemented: 3; supplemented: 6) and more metamorphs (unsupplemented: 1; supplemented: 3). From August 2009 to January 2011 fruit flies were reared in conditions similar to commercially reared flies, from February 2011 to November 2012 the rearing media was augmented with carotenoid supplements Red phaffia yeast, powdered marine algae and Spirulina. The fruit flies were then fed to 50 male and 52 female poison frogs.</p>",
