Differences were due to higher nest survival on mosaic management sites (50% vs. 33%), as there were no differences in the number of chicks hatching in successful nests (3.4 chicks/successful nest vs. 3.2 chicks/successful nest), or the fledging rate of chicks (11% fledging success on all sites). Nests were equally likely to be predated on scheme and non-scheme sites (32% predated vs. 37%), but were more likely to be trampled or destroyed by mowing on non-scheme sites (6% vs. 29%). Most fields in five scheme sites and about 50% in the sixth, had nests marked (to reduce losses due to farming activities); at non-scheme sites almost 100% of nest were marked in three, some in two, and none in one. The number of nests on different sites was not provided.</p><p> </p>",

Three other species (black-tailed godwit <em>Limosa limosa</em>, common redshank <em>Tringa totanus</em> and Eurasian oystercatcher <em>Haematopus ostralegus</em>) did not show any change in trend after the introduction. When comparing trends on the mosaic management sites with 29 farms using individual conservation management, 46 farms with standard management and 42 nature reserves, only lapwing populations increased significantly more on mosaic management sites, compared to the others. Oystercatcher populations did significantly less well on mosaic management sites, compared to nature reserves.</p><p> </p>",
