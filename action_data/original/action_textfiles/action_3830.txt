Regulation of fishing activity, for example restricting gear types or time fished within an area, and/or fleet controls such as limiting power and capacity, may help to reduce the effects of overfishing (Tidd 2013). However, such regulations may only be successful if they are effectively enforced. Illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing has long been considered one of the greatest threats to marine fish populations and ecosystems (FAO 2006) and undermines national and regional efforts to manage fisheries sustainably and to conserve marine biodiversity (Long <em>et al.</em> 2020). Enforcement may be one tool to help combat this risk, the causes and behaviours behind such crime being complex (Petrossian 2015).</p>\r\n<p>FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations) (2006) The State of World Fisheries.
