Survival rate was lower with lime (lime: 63-66%) than without lime (72-75%). The two treatments, a control and lime addition (at 11 x 10<sup>3</sup>kg /ha) were applied in 1991 to eight plots (3 x 10 m) at each of two hilltop sites. All sites were fertilized with nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium  at 112, 56 and 90 kg/ha respectively and were planted with western white pine  trees, along with shrubs and grasses, before treatments in 1991.
