        "background_definitions": "<p>Many different measures are used to determine the health or structure of soil. Soil porosity is the volume of air in soil (or number of pores) and high porosity indicates good soil structure, as does high microbial biomass, and low penetration resistance. Often with low penetration resistance comes higher hydraulic conductivity, which is the ease with which a fluid (usually water) can move through pore spaces.<strong> </strong>Soil microbial biomass is the amount of tiny living organisms within a given area or amount of soil. Soil penetration resistance is the soil’s ability to withstand penetration by water or roots. Soil aggregates are groups of soil particles held together by moist clay, organic matter (such as roots), organic compounds (from bacteria and fungi) or fungal hyphae (long, branching structure of a fungus). Some soil particles fit closely together, some do not, creating different-sized spaces. These spaces, or pores, within and between soil aggregates can store air and water, microbes, nutrients and organic matter. Large aggregations of particles retain the most nutrients.</p>",
