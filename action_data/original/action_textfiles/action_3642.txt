Different reptile species may tolerate different levels of disturbance, but it may lead to behaviour changes (Nyhof <em>et al</em>. 2015), nest abandonment (Moore <em>et al</em>. 2006), physical damage to reptiles or nests, or the displacement of individuals or populations.  For vulnerable species or nests it may be possible to reduce the impacts of human disturbance using signs or access restrictions in areas subject to high use. Reducing access may also help reduce the risk of human introduction of non-native plants, animals or disease.</p>\r\n<p><sup>Larson C.L., Reed S.E., Merenlender A.M. &amp; Crooks K.R.

Results were not statistically tested. Nests fenced for protection had 76% hatching success (667 of 880 eggs hatched, of which 653 hatchlings reached the sea) compared to 65% hatching success of unfenced nests (3,317 of 5,075 eggs hatched, of which 3,078 hatchlings reached the sea). All nests (12 nests) in a 2.5 km section of the 8 km long Fethiye Beach were fenced (70 × 70 × 150 cm with a 1 cm plastic mesh) with a sign “Do not disturb the turtle nests” in both Turkish and English to prevent human disturbance. Nests on the rest of the beach (72 nests) were unfenced. Nests were monitored from June to September 2000.</p>",
