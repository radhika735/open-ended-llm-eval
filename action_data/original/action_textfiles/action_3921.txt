        "background_definitions": "<p>Agricultural landscapes are often homogenous, with the same crops being grown across a large area. Increasing the diversity of crops within a single farm, or across a farmed landscape, may improve the habitat suitability for butterflies and moths by increasing the availability of resources, or making that availability more consistent over time. For example, differences in flowering time or harvest time may increase the permability of the landscape for butterflies and moths, or mean that nectar resources are available for longer across the summer than if only a single crop type was present.</p>\r\n<p>For studies on increasing diversity within a field, see “<a href=\"../../actions/3983\"><em>Plant more than one crop per field (intercropping)</em></a>”.</p>",

Both the abundance and species richness of butterflies on farms with more different habitats (&gt;3/farm) were similar to farms with fewer habitats (&lt;3/farm) (data presented as model results). A total of 133 farms (17–34 ha, 13–91% arable crops) were managed with “Ecological Compensation Areas” under agri-environment schemes. Management included extensive and low-input meadows with reduced fertilizer and later cutting dates, and the presence of trees, hedgerows and wildflower patches, as well as arable crops and pasture. From May–September 2009–2011, butterflies were surveyed six times on 10–38 transects/farm, totalling 2,500 m/farm. Each transect ran diagonally through a single crop or habitat type, with all available crops and habitats represented. All visits to a farm were completed in a single year, and the species richness was summed across all visits. Total abundance of butterflies was calculated from the number recorded in each habitat, and the availability of each habitat across the farm. Habitats on each farm were mapped between May and August.</p>",
