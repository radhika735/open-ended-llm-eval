        "background_definitions": "<p>Climate change is altering rainfall patterns globally, leading to increasingly frequent or severe droughts in some areas. Access to water is important for some species of butterfly and moth, including those where the adults gather nutrients by “mud-puddling” (Thomas &amp; Lewington 2016). Droughts can also lead to the desiccation of caterpillar food plants, which in turn may kill caterpillars if the drought coincides with their period of growth and reliance on the plant. Managing natural waterbodies, from small pools to larger areas, may help to protect butterflies and moths by maintaining water availability in the environment.</p>\r\n<p>For studies on the creation of scrapes and pools, see “<em>Habitat restoration and creation – <a href=\"../../actions/3951\">Create scrapes and pools</a></em>”.</p>\r\n<p><sup>Thomas J.A. &amp; Lewington R.
