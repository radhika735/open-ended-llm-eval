After quarries and gravel pits become disused, they may offer valuable aquatic, terrestrial and marshland habitats, particularly if they are close to urban areas (Catchpole and Tydeman 1975). These habitats can often be bare immediately after abandonment, so restoring vegetation to them may greatly improve their value as habitats.</p>\r\n<p>Catchpole, C.K. &amp; Tydeman, C.F.
