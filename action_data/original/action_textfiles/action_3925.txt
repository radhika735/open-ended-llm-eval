However, this head-start means that the crop flowers earlier, and may be too early to be beneficial for butterflies and moths. In addition, the disturbance to the previous year’s stubble in autumn may kill butterflies and moths of any life-stage which are overwintering within the harvested crop. Planting crops in spring may, therefore, mitigate these impacts.</p>",
