The increase in number of species/stump for mosses (thinned: 10%; unthinned: 50%) and liverworts (thinned: -50%; unthinned: -10%), and number of species/log for lichens (thinned: 35%; unthinned: 0%), mosses (thinned and unthinned: 30%) and liverworts (thinned: -15%; unthinned: -10%) was similar between treatments. Extinction rate (number of species lost after thinning/total number of species before thinning) for generalist species (living on at least two substrate types) was higher in thinned (43%) than in unthinned plots (16%). Extinction rate was similar between treatments for species living on bark or on both wood and bark (thinned: 75%; unthinned: 65%) and species living on dead wood (thinned and unthinned: 65%).
