        "background_definitions": "<p>Marine fisheries throughout the world are often highly regulated and may be subject to many different international or national laws and byelaws that control what can be caught, where and how much. However, regulations also extend to the landing and recording of catches at ports. Port fisheries controls include limiting the numbers of ports where commercial fishers can land sensitive species or large volumes of fish (sometimes termed as “designated ports”) making it easier to control and accurately record such catches and landings. Other port controls include monitoring licensed vessels and their landings for undersized or illegal fish, and authorisation of documentation to verify or validate landings for ongoing sale or export. Effective enforcement of port controls may act as a deterrent to prevent illegal fishing by making it more difficult to land and sell illegal fish thus helping to protect fish populations from the threat of overexploitation.</p>",
