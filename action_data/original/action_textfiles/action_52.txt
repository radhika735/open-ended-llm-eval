        "key_message": "<p>Seven replicated trials have monitored the success of laboratory-reared colonies of bumblebees introduced to the environment. In four of the trials (three in the UK, one in Canada) colonies were left to develop until new queens were produced or the founding queen died. In two of these (both in the UK), the numbers of queens/colony were very low or zero. In two trials, good numbers of new queens were produced.</p>\r\n<p>Rates of social parasitism by cuckoo bees <em>Bombus </em>[Psithyrus] spp. in colonies released to the wild are variable. Two replicated trials in Canada and the UK found high rates (25-66% and 79% respectively). The UK trial showed that parasitism was reduced by placing colonies in landscapes with intermediate rather than very high nectar and pollen availability, late, rather than early in the season. Five other replicated trials reported no social parasites. We have not found evidence to compare rates of parasitism in artificial nest boxes with the rate in natural nests.</p>\r\n<p>Two replicated trials examined the effects of supplementary feeding for bumblebee colonies placed in the field. One, in Canada, found supplementary feeding improved the reproductive success of captive-reared colonies, but did not reduce their parasite load.

Twenty-one colonies that were fed produced 56% more workers, and were almost four times as likely to produce new queens as those that were not fed. Fed colonies produced between 0 and 19 queens/colony on average, and control colonies between 0 and 14 queens/colony (the paper gives separate averages for each species and each year). Social parasitism by cuckoo bees was high in this study, with between one quarter and two thirds of colonies successfully usurped. The rate was not reduced by supplementary feeding.</p>",

Parasitism is more intense when colonies are sited in areas of high resource availability (92% of colonies parasitized by three cuckoo bees on average among oilseed rape <em>Brassica napus </em>fields, compared to 67% parasitized by one cuckoo bee on average among wheat fields). Parasitism is also more intense if colonies are placed early in the season (early May). This suggests that if captive-reared colonies of native bumblebees are to be reintroduced, they should be placed out later in the season (early June), amongst a heterogenous landscape with intermediate levels of resource.</p>",
