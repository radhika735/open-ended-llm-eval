A number of bacterial species of amphibian skin have been found to inhibit the chytrid fungus in experiments (e.g. Harris <em>et al.</em> 2006; Becker <em>et al</em>. 2010; Lam <em>et al</em>. 2011). There is also some evidence that anti-microbial peptides, which are secreted into mucus and thought to help protect against colonization by skin pathogens, may provide some resistance to chytrid infections (e.g. Pask <em>et al.</em> 2012; 2013). It is therefore possible that adding such anti-fungal species or peptides to amphibian skin or to their environment may reduce the effects of the disease.</p>\r\n<p class=\"References\">Becker, M.

Infected frogs treated with the antifungal skin bacteria all survived, gained 33% body mass and had no chytrid zoospores on their skin. In contrast, five of six exposed to chytrid zoospores alone lost weight and died; the sixth had severe chytridiomycosis. Treatment with <em>Janthinobacterium lividum</em> increased colonization by the skin bacteria and did not result in reduced growth or death. There were three treatments each with six frogs: exposure to chytrid zoospores (300 zoospores/15 ml for 24 h); exposure to antifungal skin bacteria (26 x 106 cells/ml for 30 min) and exposure to skin bacteria and 48 hours later chytrid zoospores. There were also 10 untreated control frogs. Before treatments, animals were rinsed in 3% hydrogen peroxide and sterile Provosoli medium to reduce natural skin bacteria. Frogs were weighed and tested for antifungal skin bacteria and chytrid before and every two weeks after treatment until day 139.</p><p> </p>",
