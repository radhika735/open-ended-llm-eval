Of 16 prairie or pine barren specialist butterfly species, two (arogos skipper<em> Atrytone arogos</em>, Poweshiek skipper <em>Oarisma poweshiek</em>) were more abundant in abandoned, unmanaged sites than in sites managed by haying or rotational burning. However, seven species were less abundant in abandoned sites than in sites managed by haying (Dakota skipper <em>Hesperia dacotae</em>, pawnee skipper <em>Hesperia leonardus pawnee</em>), mowing (Persius duskywing <em>Erynnis persius</em>), cutting (cobweb skipper <em>Hesperia metea</em>), grazing and haying (regal fritillary <em>Speyeria idalia</em>) or rotational burning (ottoe skipper <em>Hesperia ottoe </em>and dusted skipper <em>Atrytonopsis hianna</em>). Seven species had similar abundance between management types. See paper for individual species data. Of 104 prairies (1–2,024 ha), six had not been managed for many years (abandoned), 61 were managed by cool-season burning on a 2–5-year rotation, of which 21 were additionally mown or hayed; 27 were hayed in summer on a 1–2-year rotation, of which two were also grazed occasionally with cattle and 10 were grazed. Of 141 pine barrens, some were burned by wildfires, some were used for off-road vehicle trails, and some were power line rights-of-way (no further detail provided).

Similar numbers of butterfly species were present on mown meadows (mowed annually: 19–21), fallow land (not mowed for about 10 years: 22–29), old fallow land (not mowed for 10–20 years: 25–37) and young forest (not mowed for between 10–20 years: 25–29), but mature forest had fewer species than all other types of land (not mowed for about 50 years: 12–13) (text in paper reports that species richness was higher in old fallow land than mown meadows but this contrasts with graph captions). Numbers of scarce large blue <em>Maculinea teleius</em>, dusky large blue <em>Maculinea nausithous</em> and Alcon blue <em>Maculinea alcon</em> were highest on old fallow, but gypsy moths <em>Lymantria dispar</em> and violet coppers <em>Lycaena helle</em> were highest on mown meadows (results presented as statistical tests). See paper for results for other species. Three replicates of five types of land at different stages of succession were compared (15 sites in total) – meadows mowed annually in summer (mown meadows) and land which hadn’t been mowed for about 10 years (fallow), 10–20 years (old fallow), about 20 years (young forest) and about 50 years (mature forest).

Over seven years after abandonment, species which prefer grasslands declined in abundance, and species which prefer woodland and bramble hedges increased. The abundance of “generalist” butterfly species (which are able to persist in a wide range of habitats) and species with only one generation/year increased in abandoned meadows, while the abundance of “specialist” species (with specific habitat requirements) and species with multiple generations/year decreased. One grassland specialist, the silver-studded blue <em>Plebejus argus</em>, went extinct in some abandoned meadows. There was little change in the butterfly community in the continuously managed meadow. All data presented as model results. In 1997, six traditional hay meadows (0.55–3.71 ha) were managed normally: two were mown in June, and four were mown in June and August and grazed by cows in winter. From 1998–2004, five of the meadows were abandoned, but the sixth meadow continued to be mown in June and grazed by cattle and horses in winter. From March–September 1997–2004, butterflies were surveyed once/week along a fixed 1,122-m transect through the meadows (117–286 m/meadow), and the total number of each species recorded in each meadow each year was compared.</p>",
