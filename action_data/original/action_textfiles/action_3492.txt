Lighter grazed plots had higher abundances of lizards compared to heavier grazing in cottonwood-willow (Light grazing: 1.1 individuals/trap group/night; heavy grazing: 0.6). Species diversity was statistically similar between lightly and heavily grazed sites across all vegetation sites (result presented as diversity index). See paper for details of individual species abundances. Seven lightly grazed and seven heavily grazed plots were established in areas of cottonwood-willow. Lightly grazed sites were characterised by a lack of livestock and good habitat condition. Heavily grazed sites were characterised by cattle trails, presence of livestock and poor habitat condition. Abundance and diversity (Shannon-Wiener Index) were estimated using drift fences with four pitfall traps in March–June and September–November 1978 and March–October 1979.</p>",

Twelve pairs of farms of with either rotational or continuous grazing (cattle or sheep) on native pastures were selected.

Results are reported as statistical model outputs. Two lizard species (Boulenger’s snake-eyed skink <em>Morethia boulengeri</em> and southern rainbow-skink <em>Carlia tetradactyla</em>) were more likely to colonize patches with modified low or high rotational grazing than prolonged high rotational or continuous grazing. The opposite was true for straight-browed ctenotus <em>Ctenotus spaldingi</em>, which was more likely to become extinct in patches with modified high and low rotational grazing. Colonisation and extinction probabilities for three other lizard species (ragged snake-eye skink <em>Cryptoblepharus pannosus</em>, Victoria three-toed earless skink <em>Hemiergis talbingoensis</em>, marbled geckos <em>Christinus marmoratus</em>) were not significantly affected by the grazing treatments. A total of 97 sites were surveyed on 29 farms (2–4 sites/farm with different grazing treatments) within a grazing-dominated landscape. Each site used one of four grazing treatments: modified low rotational grazing (&lt;5 years of long-duration rotational grazing following previous continuous grazing); modified high rotational grazing (&lt;5 years of high intensity short-duration grazing following previous continuous grazing); prolonged high rotational grazing (high-intensity short-duration grazing for &gt;10 years); continuous grazing for &gt;10 years. Grazing was mainly by sheep <em>Ovis aries</em> and cattle <em>Bos taurus</em>.

Five farms had a rotational grazing regime (livestock moved between paddocks every few days and not returning to the same place for weeks or months), and seven had a continuous grazing regime (livestock left in same paddock for extended periods). Surveys were carried out using drift fences, pitfall traps and funnel traps set at 20, 50 and 80 m intervals along 180 m transects that extended from the native woodland into the grazing pasture.
