        "key_message": "<p>We have captured 22 trials from 13 countries documenting captive rearing of bumblebee colonies by confining mated queens alone (eight trials), with one or more bumblebee workers (seven trials), honey bee workers (one trial), male bumblebee pupae (three trials) or following anaesthetisation with CO2 (four trials). One trial found that over four years of artificial rearing, <em>Bombus terrestris</em> queens gradually decreased in weight.</p>\r\n<p>Three trials have tried to rear North American bumblebees now declining or thought to be declining. Two induced spring queens of the half-black bumblebee <em>B. vagans</em> to rear adults in captivity, one trial induced queen yellow-banded bumblebees <em>B. terricola</em> (attempted in all three trials) and red-belted bumblebees <em>B. rufocinctus</em> (only attempted in one trial) to rear adults in captivity. All three trials tried to rear the yellow bumblebee <em>B. fervidus</em> and in all cases the queens laid eggs but the larvae died before becoming adults. One trial found the same pattern for the rusty-patched bumblebee and the American bumblebee <em>B. pensylvanicus</em>. One study reports rearing the large garden bumblebee B. ruderatus, a Biodiversity Action Plan species in the UK.</p>\r\n<p>Two trials have reported laboratory rearing of a pocket-making bumblebee, the Neotropical <em>B. atratus</em>.</p>\r\n<p>Three replicated trials demonstrated that the pollen diet of captively reared bumblebees influences reproductive success. In one trial, buff-tailed bumblebee <em>B. terrestris</em> colonies fed on freshly frozen pollen produced larger queens that survived better and produced larger colonies themselves than colonies fed on dried, frozen pollen. Two replicated trials demonstrated that <em>B. terrestris</em> workers can produce more offspring when fed types of pollen with a higher protein content.</p>\r\n<p>Two replicated experiments showed that an artificial light regime of eight hours light, 16 hours darkness, can reduce the time taken for artificially reared queen <em>B. terrestris</em> to lay eggs, relative to rearing in constant darkness.</p>\r\n<p>We have captured two replicated trials examining the effect of different artificial hibernation regimes in <em>B. terrestris</em>. One showed that hibernation of queens at 4-5<span class=\"st\">°</span>C for 45 days enhanced egg-laying and colony formation rates, but hibernated queens produced smaller colonies than non-hibernated queens. The second showed that queens should weigh more than 0.6 g (wet weight) and be hibernated for four months or less to have a good chance of surviving.</p>",
