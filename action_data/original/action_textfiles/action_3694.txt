Results were not statistically tested. Almost all artificial Hermann’s tortoise nests were predated within four days whether they were protected with chemical repellent (carnivore repellent: 63 of 64, 98% nests predated, carnivore and wild boar <em>Sus scrofa </em>repellent: 78 of 80, 98%) or not (143 of 144, 99% nests predated). Unprotected nests were generally predated more quickly than protected nests. Wild boar predated 85% of nests when wild boar and carnivore repellent were used together compared to 99% of nests when carnivore repellent only was used. Other predators included common genet <em>Genetta genetta</em>, beech marten <em>Martes foina </em>and fox <em>Vulpes vulpes. </em>Artificial nests (three quail <em>Coturnix coturnix </em>eggs, buried and watered with 15 ml of diluted tortoise urine and excrement) were created in eight plots (625 m<sup>2</sup>/plot) in a Hermann’s tortoise breeding colony. In June 2006, Schwelger© carnivore repellent was distributed in four plots (25 devices/plot; 16 nests/plot). In September 2006, wild boar repellent (Stop Jabali © Hagopur GmbH) and fresh carnivore repellent were distributed to the same four plots (20 nests/plot). Nests in experimental and untreated plots were checked for predation daily for the first 15 days and weekly for up to 3 months.</p>",

The number of predated nests was lower for surface pepper treated nests (2 of 10, 20%) compared to nests with pepper under the surface of the sand (5 of 10, 50%) and nests with no pepper (6 of 10, 60%). A similar number of surface pepper treated nests were predated compared to nests covered with a screen (7 of 33, 21%). Nests were covered with 15 ml of habanero pepper powder on the surface of the nest (10 nests), below the surface and 3 cm above the eggs (10 nests) or were given no pepper powder (10 nests). A further 33 nests were covered with a plastic or metal screen (1 x 1 m). In June–July 2010, nests were monitored for complete or partial predation every 1–3 days, and a further 12 visits were made until September.</p>",

The number of days until predation was also not affected by pepper treatment (10 g pepper: 1.3 days; 20 g pepper: 1.8 days) or no pepper (1.4 days). In addition, nests covered with pepper and a mesh cage had similar hatching success to nests covered with just a mesh cage (all doses of pepper: 78–83%; no pepper: 55–93%). In June–July, 30 nests were covered with habanero pepper powder (10 g: 15 nests; 20 g: 15 nests) and 18 nests received no pepper powder. A further two nests received 10 g of pepper and were covered with a metal mesh cage (buried 15 cm deep), and nine were covered with cages but received no pepper. All nests were monitored daily: uncaged nests for a minimum of seven days, and caged nests until mid-November, at which point they were excavated to determine hatching success.</p>",
