Lines set with and without the scarer were not analysed separately (with 15 birds caught on six sets without a scarer and six with, as well as three with a streamer line), although the authors observed changes in behaviour when a scarer was first used, but that birds quickly got used to the noise. The scarer emitted periodic bursts of compressed gas. This study is also discussed in ‘Set longlines at night to reduce seabird bycatch’ and ‘Use streamer lines to reduce seabird bycatch on longlines’.</p><p> </p>",
