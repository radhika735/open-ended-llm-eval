In June 1993, a total of 189 bell miners were removed from the experimental site and the surrounding area (2.7 ha), by mist netting and culling. The tree health index was based on the visual assessment of the health of 10 trees at each plot (50 x 50 m), following a standardized protocol.</p><p> </p>",
