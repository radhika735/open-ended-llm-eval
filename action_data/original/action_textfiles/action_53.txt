Some workers were lost and queens began foraging for nectar. Two queens were killed as a result of returning to the wrong nest. Colonies that were moved raised an average of four new queen cocoons (range 4-9), while colonies that were not moved raised on average 22 new queen cocoons (range 17-27).</p>",

Apart from the smallest translocation distance, some foraging workers were lost due to each translocation.

An empty box with a one-way door was placed on the old site for two hours the following morning. On one occasion, half the workers from a colony of <em>B. californicus </em>were out when the colony was moved and captured in the trap. On the other six occasions, few workers were left behind. Several queens (at least eight) were killed after translocation by re-entering the wrong nest box. The authors recommend delaying translocation until the second brood has emerged and the queen no longer forages.</p>",
