        "background_definitions": "<p><strong>Definition:</strong> ‘Groove habitats’ are depressions with a length to width ratio &gt;3:1 and depth 1–50 mm (modified from “Crevices” in Strain <em>et al. </em>2018).</p>\r\n<p>Groove habitats provide organisms refuge from desiccation and temperature fluctuations during low tide in intertidal rocky habitats (Williams &amp; Morrit 1995). They also provide shelter from predation or grazing (Menge &amp; Lubchenco 1981) and some species preferentially settle into them (Chabot &amp; Bourget 1988). The size and density of grooves is likely to affect the size, abundance and variety of organisms that can use them. Small grooves can provide refuge for small-bodied organisms but may exclude larger organisms, limit their growth and get rapidly filled-up (Firth <em>et al.</em> 2020). Large grooves can be used by larger-bodied organisms but may not provide sufficient refuge from predators for smaller organisms.</p>\r\n<p>Grooves are sometimes present on boulders used in marine artificial structures as a result of quarrying processes (MacArthur <em>et al.</em> 2020). They can also form on structures through erosion, but will often be filled or repaired during maintenance works (Moreira <em>et al.</em> 2007), and are absent from many structures (Aguilera <em>et al.</em> 2014). Groove habitats can be created on intertidal artificial structures by adding or removing material, either during construction or retrospectively.</p>\r\n<p>There is a body of literature investigating the effects of creating groove habitats on experimental artificial substrates on the recruitment and survival of intertidal rocky shore species (e.g. Savoya &amp; Schwindt 2010; van Tamelen <em>et al.</em> 1997). These studies are not included in this synopsis, which focusses on <em>in situ</em> conservation actions to enhance the biodiversity of marine artificial structures.</p>\r\n<p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href=\"../../actions/3466\"><em>Create textured surfaces (≤1 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3435\"><em>Create natural rocky reef topography on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3475\"><em>Create pit habitats (1–50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3467\"><em>Create hole habitats (&gt;50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3437\"><em>Create crevice habitats (&gt;50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3474\"><em>Create groove habitats </em>and<em> small protrusions, ridges or ledges (1–50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>.</p>\r\n<p><sup>Aguilera M.A., Broitman B.R. &amp; Thiel M.
