Grazing may be less damaging to natural enemies and more suitable for some pest- or disease-resistant crop varieties than cutting. Direct effects of domestic livestock on pests (e.g. mortality by grazing and trampling) are not considered part of the natural ecosystem service of pest control but are summarised here if studies measured these effects while carrying out the intervention. The intensity of grazing and frequency of cutting are often important factors and the actions ‘Reduce grazing intensity on grassland’ and ‘Reduce frequency of cutting on grassland or grass margins’ will be covered in future synopses. Ground-living invertebrates can be sampled by suction sampling, using a vacuum to suck-up and collect specimens for a given time or area of ground.</p>",

Mowing, windrowing (piling cut vegetation in rows on the field) and baling lucerne before collection had little effect on pest or natural enemy numbers compared to harvesting directly into a trailer. Treatments included grazing (84 cattle for 1 day on 0.45 ha), cutting with a forage harvester and collecting the crop immediately (0.3 ha), and mowing and windrowing before baling and collection (0.3 ha).
