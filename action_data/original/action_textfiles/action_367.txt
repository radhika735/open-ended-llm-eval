At the second site (Orplands, 42 ha), the number of common redshank, dunlin and grey plover <em>Pluvialis squatarola</em> increased during the first winter and then the community composition changed across the site, with higher areas holding similar species to adjacent saltmarsh and lower areas being similar to mudflats.</p><p> </p>",

This followed the breaching of the sea wall at the site, allowing the flooding of 66 ha of land in 2002. By September 2005, 70% of the area was covered in salt marsh plants. However, the number of waders at the site decreased from 11,012 to 7,799 over the same period, and the authors note that the regular inundation with salt water prevents waders from breeding. Songbirds showed mixed responses: Eurasian skylarks <em>Alauda arvensis </em>increased from an average of 16 birds to 121; four species increased by smaller amounts; three species showed uncertain trends; meadow pipits <em>Anthus pratensis </em>declined.</p><p> </p>",

In addition, total density was as high or higher in four restored sites (although responses varied between species) and behaviour was similar across restored and controlled sites, with over 85% of three of the four species groups observed feeding. Densities of willets <em>Catoptrophorus semipalmatus</em> were often higher in restored sites whereas densities of marbled godwits <em>Limosa fedoa</em> were often denser in control sites.
