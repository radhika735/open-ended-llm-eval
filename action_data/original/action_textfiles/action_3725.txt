Results were not statistically tested. Success of translocations of tortoises placed in abandoned burrows or artificial burrows without release pens was low (Abandoned: 1 of 5 successful; artificial: 0 of 3), as was success of releases without a burrow or pen (0 of 11). When translocated gopher tortoises were initially held in release pens with artificial burrows, 17 of 21 translocations were successful. Forty individually-marked adult gopher tortoises (some may have been captive-bred) were translocated in spring–summer 1980–1982 (one tortoise = one translocation). Tortoises were released into either abandoned existing burrows (5 tortoises), artificial burrows (1 m deep; 3 tortoises), artificial burrows in circular release pens for 2–4 weeks (4–7 m diameter pens; 21 tortoises) or were directly released with no specific management (11 tortoises). Tortoises were monitored until late summer or early autumn in the release year and translocations were judged successful if previously abandoned burrows became active and a translocated tortoise was found in them, or new tortoise burrows were dug in areas without pre-existing tortoise populations.</p>",
