Capture data from pre-burn (May 1978; 31 net-days) and post-burn (May 1979; 37 net-days) mist-netting was used to monitor birds. In May 1979, 83 individuals of 15 species were captured, comparable to the 66 individuals of 12 species caught in May 1978 (allowing for difference in catch effort).</p><p> </p>",

Two species were more abundant in the dry season burned compared to unburned sites, while one was more abundant in the dry season burned areas than under other treatments and two species were less abundant after burns. Two other species’ responses varied depending on which forest type they were in. Follow-up surveys in 2004 found no differences in species richness between fire treatments.</p><p> </p>",
