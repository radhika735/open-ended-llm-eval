However, it may be possible to foster chicks and eggs to a similar, but more abundant species, if one is present. This can increase the reproductive output of the wild population of the endangered species, or even allow for the reintroduction of a population into parts of its former range.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

This is similar to the highest recorded rates for Manx shearwaters <em>P. puffinus </em>and slightly higher than those of wedge-tailed shearwaters. The main cause of mortality was egg predation by introduced common mynas <em>Acridotheres tristis</em>, with only one chick being evicted by foster parents. Fostered chicks were slightly heavier and larger than Newell’s shearwaters raised by their natural parents. Data was not available on the return rates or breeding success of fostered chicks.</p><p> </p>",
