Removal of male fish known to guard nests or protect their young during the breeding season not only kills the adult but may prevent successful spawning or rearing of the young and limit the overall reproductive potential of the population. Examples include black bream <em>Spondyliosoma cantharus</em> (Pinder <em>et al</em>. 2017) and lingcod <em>Ophiodon elongatus </em>(Withler <em>et al</em>. 2004). Releasing male fish of these species during breeding may help reduce fishing pressure and the effects of overexploitation and protect the hatching or rearing of young fish.</p>\r\n<p>Pinder A.C., Velterop R., Cooke S.J. &amp; Britton J.R.
