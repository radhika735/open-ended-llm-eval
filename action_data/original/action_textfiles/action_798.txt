        "background_definitions": "<p class=\"Background\">Cane toads <em>Bufo marinus</em> have been introduced to many places including Australia and Pacific and Caribbean islands. The species can have significant effects on native species, particularly those that prey on the cane toads as they contain a lethal toxin. They may also affect native amphibians through competition at the tadpole stage and through predation of eggs or tadpoles.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">There is additional literature that is not included here examining the success of controlling cane toads, which may be undertaken for the conservation of a range of taxa including amphibians (e.g. Nakajima <em>et al.</em> 2005; Shanmuganathan <em>et al. </em>2010; Ward-Fear <em>et al.</em> 2010; Wingate 2011).</p>\r\n<p class=\"References\">Nakajima T., Toda M., Aoki M. &amp; Tatara M.
