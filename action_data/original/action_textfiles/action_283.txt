Some species, however, do hunt at night and so night-setting is unlikely to be an effective mitigation measure. An adequate knowledge of bycatch species’ ecology is therefore important in determining whether to promote night-setting.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">Many of the studies in this section do not explicitly say whether night-setting was done for conservation purposes or not.

This result was consistent across all species, except for wandering albatross <em>Diomedea exulans</em>, which was only caught on 12 occasions. The authors note that whilst the number of white-chinned petrels <em>Procellaria aequinoctialis</em> caught was half that caught during the day, these levels may still be unsustainably high: they quote an unpublished figure of 340 petrels caught during a single line set off Kerguelen Island. The study took place on three Ukranian and one Japanese longliners fishing for Patagonian toothfish <em>Dissostichus eleginoides </em>off Kerguelen Island (France).
