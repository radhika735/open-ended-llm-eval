Sea turtles in particular are at risk of becoming entangled in ‘ghost’ gear, such as nets, lines and ropes resulting in injury or death (Stelfox <em>et al.</em> 2016).</p>\r\n<p>Potential options for reducing the amount of discarded fishing gear include: offering incentives for recovering, reusing or recycling gear; equipping ports with dedicated fishing gear disposal facilities; improving methods for locating abandoned gear; establishing fishing gear registration programmes to encourage responsible use of gear; and informing fishers of the impacts of derelict fishing gear on reptiles to encourage its responsible disposal.</p>\r\n<p>For studies on the recovery of fishing gear that has already been discarded see <a href=\"../../actions/3567\"><em>Recover lost or discarded fishing gear</em>.</a></p>",
