After four years, crested wheatgrass <em>Agropyron desertorum</em> density did not differ significantly between plots sprayed (0.35–0.40 plants/m<sup>2</sup>) and not sprayed (0.35–0.70 plants/m<sup>2</sup>) with herbicide before sowing. In one of two comparisons, native forb density was lower in sprayed plots (0.48 plants/m<sup>2</sup>) than unsprayed plots (0.31 plants/m<sup>2</sup>), and in one comparison there was no significant difference (sprayed: 0.34 plants/m<sup>2</sup>, unsprayed: 0.46 plants/m<sup>2</sup>). Total shrub density was higher in sprayed plots (112–148 shrubs/1,000m<sup>2</sup>) than unsprayed plots (74–84 shrubs/1,000m<sup>2</sup>). In October 1972, eight 12 x 12 m plots were sown with seeds of crested wheatgrass and intermediate wheatgrass <em>Agropyron intermedium.</em> Four of the plots were sprayed with herbicide (2,4-D), while the other four plots were left unsprayed. The number of grass, forb and shrub plants was counted in each plot in 1973, 1974 and 1976.</p>",

After one year, the average percentage of seedlings that emerged for five of eight wildflower species was higher in plots sprayed with herbicide before seeds were sown (22–35%) than in plots not sprayed with herbicide before seeds were sown (11–22%). For the other three species, seedling emergence did not differ significantly between sprayed (14–20%) and unsprayed plots (13–20%). In 1998, blocks were established at the site (replication unclear from study). The herbicide glufosinate was sprayed on vegetation in 0.5 × 0.5 m plots and six weeks later wildflower seeds were sown, while in other plots seeds were sown but herbicide was not sprayed (number for each not reported).

After two years, the average number of seeded plant species was higher in areas where herbicide was applied and seeds were sown (7.8 species/plot) than in areas where no herbicide was applied but seeds were sown (5.0 species/plot). The same pattern was true after 3–6 years (with herbicide: 2.4–7.2 species/plot; without herbicide: 1.7–5.1 species/plot), although statistical significance was not reported. In 1998, the landfill site was decommissioned and covered with clay to a depth of 1 m to which topsoil and compost were added to a depth of 15–20 cm. In June 2001, herbicide was applied and dead vegetation raked from six 10 × 10 m plots, while herbicide was not applied to six other plots. In June 2001, a commercial seed mix of 22 species was sown at a rate of 1.8 g/m<sup>2</sup> in all plots.

After three years, the average cover of sown grass species was higher in plots where herbicide was sprayed and seeds were sown (57–70%) than in unsprayed plots where seeds were sown (1%). The opposite was true for unsown grass species (sprayed plots: 1–3%; unsprayed plots: 59%). In 2005, four 3 x 10 m areas were established in two fields where soybeans <em>Glycine max</em> were previously grown. Herbicide (‘Roundup’ containing imazapic and glyphosate) was randomly applied to three areas, while in one area herbicide was not applied. Two weeks later, a seed mix containing native grass seeds was sown in all areas.
