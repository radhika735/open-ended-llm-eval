Nature conservation aims include retaining valuable old forest features such as older trees with cavities and dead wood affording nest site and foraging opportunities for woodland birds. A similar intervention is ‘Ensure connectivity between habitat patches’, discussed in ‘Habitat protection’.</p>",

After initial increases in bird densities (30-70%) in all strips in the year after cutting, the 20 m- and 40 m-wide strips exhibited greatest decreases. Three years after cutting, forest species were less abundant (four songbirds becoming virtually absent) than habitat generalists in the 20 m strips (the thinned 20 m strip had densities around 20% less than the unthinned 20 m-wide strip).</p>",
