One potential solution, to reduce conflict whilst maintaining the populations of geese is to provide ‘sacrificial grasslands’ – areas set aside for geese to feed on, which keeps them away from agricultural fields.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">To be useful, such areas need to be more attractive than neighbouring fields. Management to attract geese to these areas can include re-seeding grasslands with grass species or legumes such as clover Trifolium spp., or fertilizing grasslands to increase productivity so that these areas can support more birds.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">Madsen J., Cracknell G. &amp; Fox A.D.

However, fewer geese used fertilized fields than re-seeded ones. Fertilizers were either 34.5% nitrogen in pellet form (at 125 kg/ha), or ‘nitrochalk’ – 25% nitrogen in granular form – (at 175 kg/ha) and spread in October (wet and dry fields) and March (dry fields only). However, increases in barnacle geese were due to a redistribution of local birds, rather than new birds visiting the reserve. The author therefore suggests that improving the reserve grasslands will only minimally reduce conflict with farmers elsewhere on the island.</p><p> </p>",
