One such method is <em>selective logging</em> (removing one or two trees and leaving the rest intact)<em> that </em>maintains an uneven-age forest structure and creates openings typically smaller than 0.4 ha, and often considered a sustainable alternative to clear-cutting. However, predators and avian nest parasites are often most common in edge habitat, thus potentially reducing reproductive success of birds breeding near forest edges.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",
