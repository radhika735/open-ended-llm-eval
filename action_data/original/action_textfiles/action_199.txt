Damage reduced from 6.0 kg/ha to 1.1 kg/ha, and 18.2 kg/ha to 4.8 kg/ha. There was no change in three paired sites without broadcasts. Orchards were 16-30 ha in area and monitored in June-August. Broadcasting units were deployed at onset of crow damage until almond harvest (1 unit/1.6 ha; hung in trees at 1-2 m) throughout the orchard, moved to a new tree every two weeks, switched to a different call every 3-4 days, broadcast dawn to dusk, each 25 seconds long with approximately 12 min between calls.</p><p> </p>",
