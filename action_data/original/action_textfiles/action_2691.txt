        "background_definitions": "<p>Releasing protected or other threatened fish species alive after incidental capture should, in theory, protect the released individuals and wider populations, particularly weaker ones, from fishing mortality and overexploitation. However, the effectiveness of live release relies on a range of factors affecting the survival of fish post-capture, including: the extent of damage from the gear, fishing duration, catch size, exposure to the air and temperature changes, depth of capture and behavioural impairments that increase the chance of predation after release (Davis 2002). In some countries where commercial fish catches are managed by quota limits, there are policies that state fish cannot be returned to the sea unless certain conditions are met, such as evidence of the species having a high likelihood of survival (Ellis <em>et al.</em> 2016). Survival may depend on multiple factors including species vulnerability, capture method (and depth of capture), duration of time exposed to the air and handling techniques.</p>\r\n<p>For related interventions, see <a href=\"../../data/index?category_id=483\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>‘Handling of catch’</em></a>.</p>\r\n<p>Davis M.W.

In commercial trawl catches, average catshark survival was 78% (range 47–91%). In addition, increases in sorting time during sorting of catches had a weak effect on survival (i.e. slightly decreased it), however there was no influence of haul duration (3–6 h; data reported as graphical analysis). In all but one haul there was no difference in survival between male and female catsharks (data reported as statistical results). Data were collected from otter trawl deployments during commercial fishing trips (16 hauls). For each deployment, groups of twenty catshark (10 of each sex) were selected and were exposed to air for roughly six different intervals between 18–85 min. After each interval, catshark were transferred to onboard tanks and survival was assessed after 1 h.</p>",

Across all tow durations, overall survival of unwanted thorny and smooth skates after 72 h was 81% and 41% respectively. For the two commercial skates, overall survival was 92% (winter) and 86% (little). In addition, for all skates combined, species was the only significant factor affecting survival (out of other factors include catch biomass, temperature, tow duration). Individually, there were no significant predictors of 72 h mortality detected for thorny skate (data reported as statistical results; insufficient data for smooth skate). Data were collected from skates caught in 71 otter trawl deployments. Immediate mortality of skates was assessed before randomly selected live skates were transferred to deck tanks, then to sea pens that were lowered to the seafloor. Sea pens were retrieved after 72 h to assess mortality and all live skates released.</p>",

Four rays died within 1–2 days of release, indicated by rapid descents in the data to ~1,800 m. All three rays that survived had been brought onboard from the purse-seine in a convey net, or brailer, and released directly from the convey net or using a rope and winch. All rays that died had been entangled in a part of the net (bunt) and hauled onboard in the final section of the main purse-seine net. Rays were tagged by observers aboard commercial skipjack purse-seine vessels after being lifted on deck. Only rays hauled onboard were tagged as those released whilst in the water were all expected to survive. Satellite-archival tags were anchored in the central part of the wing musculature using an umbrella anchor with eight plastic barbs. Anchors were attached to tags by 10-11 cm monofilament nylon or stainless-steel tethers.
