In 2006, thread trailing revealed that all female turtles explored or had been placed on each plot type before choosing where to nest. Eight sites around the edge of a fenced 12 ha wetland were monitored for turtle nesting activity. Two plots (5 x 7 m each) were established at each site, and one/site was either mowed to 5 cm height or tilled to a depth of 15 cm (treatment randomly applied in 2006 and 2008).

The effect of removing canopy or shrubs cannot be separated. Estimated rattlesnake densities were greater in 0-year-old (0.072–0.141 snakes/100 m<sup>2</sup>), 1-year-old (0.045 snakes/100 m<sup>2</sup>) and 3-year-old (0.133 snakes/100 m<sup>2</sup>) cut plots than uncut plots (0.003–0.009 snakes/100 m<sup>2</sup>). Rattlesnake densities in 4-year-old cut plots (0.013 snakes/100 m<sup>2</sup>) were similar to uncut plots.
