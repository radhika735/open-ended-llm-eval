For example, 12% of all British butterfly and moth species were recorded in a single summer in three small, traditionally managed orchards (Smart &amp; Winnall 2006). However, the dual threats of intensification and abandonment have led to the loss of many traditionally managed orchards. Restoring and maintaining extensive, low-input management of orchards – including pruning trees, occasional mowing or light grazing between the trees, and limiting the application of pesticides and herbicides – may benefit a large number of butterfly and moth species.</p>\r\n<p><sup>Smart M.J. &amp; Winnall R.A.

Three to five years after establishment, the number of species and diversity of leaf-eating arthropods (e.g. insects and mites) in an unmanaged (23–27 species) and a partially managed (21–33 species) orchard were higher than in a conventionally managed orchard (7–11 species, see paper for diversity data). Over five years, the diversity increased in the reduced management orchards, but in the conventionally managed orchard diversity decreased in the third year and remained low (see paper for details). In spring 1984, three orchards (0.30–0.35 ha) were planted with young trees (1–2 cm diameter). Two reduced management orchards had five apple cultivars at 5 × 4-m spacing. One conventional orchard had one apple cultivar at 5 × 7.5-m spacing. The unmanaged orchard was mown three times/year in 1984–1985, but unmanaged thereafter. The partially managed orchard was pruned commercially, with four annual herbicide applications and monthly mowing. The conventionally managed orchard was pruned and fertilized, mown every 3–4 weeks, and received regular herbicide and pesticide applications, which increased in the third year. From April–September 1984–1988, all leaf-eating arthropods were recorded on 5–10 randomly selected trees/orchard, 4–5 times/year.</p>",

In managed orchard meadows, the abundance of 35 species of farmland butterflies and burnet moths (16–36 individuals) and 20 species of woodland butterflies and burnet moths (17–20 individuals) was lower than in abandoned orchards meadows (farmland: 25–59; woodland: 36–39 individuals). However, the species richness of both farmland and woodland species was similar in managed (farmland: 4–7; woodland: 4 species) and abandoned (farmland: 4–9; woodland: 4–6 species) orchards. The community composition was also similar in managed and abandoned orchards (data presented as model results). Twenty orchard meadows (0.85–3.34 ha) were surveyed. Eight were managed by summer grazing (May–September, &lt;1 animal/ha, with cattle, sheep, goat, horse or donkey), two were managed by mowing, and 10 were abandoned (not grazed or mown). From May–August 2015, butterflies and burnet moths were surveyed three times along a 20-minute transect on a 0.8 ha patch at each site. Butterflies and burnet moths were classified as 35 farmland and 20 woodland species.</p>",
