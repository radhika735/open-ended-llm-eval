        "background_definitions": "<p>Although intensive grazing or regular mowing of grasslands is often seen as a threat to butterflies and moths, increasing management intensity can be an important option for controlling dominant plant species and encouraging beneficial plants, such as caterpillar host plants. For example, Goodenough &amp; Sharp (2016) found that increasing autumn and winter grazing intensity led to an increase in the abundance of <em>Primula</em> species, the sole food plant of the Duke of Burgundy <em>Hamearis lucina</em>. Therefore, increasing grazing intensity could, in some cases, be beneficial for butterflies and moths. Alternatively, increased cutting or grazing frequency may be applied to a landscape by the introduction of agri-environment scheme (AES) prescriptions to land previously managed at very low intensity (e.g. Konvicka <em>et al.</em> 2008).</p>\r\n<p>For studies on the effects of reducing management intensity, see “<a href=\"../../actions/3959\"><em>Reduce grazing intensity on grassland by reducing stocking density</em></a>”, “<a href=\"../../actions/3960\"><em>Reduce grazing intensity on grassland by seasonal removal of livestock</em></a>”, “<a href=\"../../actions/3961\"><em>Reduce cutting frequency on grassland</em></a>” and “<a href=\"../../actions/3958\"><em>Reduce management intensity on permanent grasslands (several interventions at once)</em></a>”.</p>\r\n<p><sub>Goodenough A.E. &amp; Sharp M.H.

A meadow which was grazed throughout the summer had fewer butterflies of all species, and of threatened species alone, than meadows grazed for a few weeks/year or mown once/year (data not presented). However, the extensively managed meadows had a higher abundance and species richness of butterflies than three abandoned meadows. Nineteen meadows, which had been managed in the same way for at least 5–20 years, were compared. One former hay meadow was grazed by sheep throughout the summer (intensive management), nine meadows were extensively grazed with sheep, cattle or horses for a few weeks each summer, six traditionally managed hay meadows were mown once/year in July or early August, and three meadows were not managed (abandoned).

Results were not tested for statistical significance. In the first year of increased cutting, only 11 observations of 26 individual Danube clouded yellows were recorded, compared to 2,345 records in the eight years immediately prior to increased cutting, and 3,838 records in the previous 15 years. In the second and third years of increased cutting, only five and two individuals were recorded, respectively, and these observations were from abandoned pasture outside of the reserves. From the 1970s to the mid-1990s, infrequent mowing and scrub removal were used to prevent succession on 2,457 ha of grassland reserves. From the mid-1990s to 2004, reserves were mown uniformly using national funding, and since 2004 this was increased to two cuts/year on all but 355 ha of grassland. Historical butterfly records were compiled for 1980–1994 and 1995–2002, and butterflies were recorded 3–6 times/year on systematic surveys at prescribed sites.</p>",

In 2005, half of each prairie was randomly assigned to one of two treatments: grazing and rotational burning, or rotational burning only. Each half was sub-divided into three plots (20–34 ha), which were randomly assigned to be burned in either March 2005, 2006 or 2007. The grazed sites were stocked with cattle (2.2 ha/animal unit) annually from April–August. From June–July 2006–2007, butterflies were surveyed three times/year on a transect through each plot.</p>",
