Only four of 12 previously marked axolotls were recaptured; however, their weight had increased by 16%. Weight gain was greater than that of axolotls in control colonies over the same period. Farmers traditionally created canals linking lakes and wetlands. Working with farmers in 2009, one canal used as a refuge by axolotls was isolated from the main system using filters made of wood to exclude fish and improve water quality.</p><p> </p>",
