The chance of recapture after nine months was similar for hatchlings released in their mother’s home range (22% recaptured) and wild alligators (23%), whereas hatchlings released outside their mother’s home range had a lower chance of recapture (15%). Hatchlings released in their mother’s home range were shorter (42 cm) than wild hatchlings (45 cm) nine months after hatching, but hatchlings released outside their mother’s home range were similar in length to both other groups (42 cm). Clutches of alligator eggs were collected in summer 1998 from three lakes and artificially incubated at 32°C and hatched. Hatchling alligators were held in captivity for 2–4 weeks before being tagged and released either near to the original nest site (34 clutches) or more than 1 km outside the mother’s home range (14 clutches). Wild hatchlings (22 clutches) were collected by hand from boats in September to November 1998, tagged, measured and released.  Clutches ranged from 8–41 hatchlings.

Survival rates of released hatchlings was similar to that of tortoises during head-starting over six months (released: 15 of 20, 75% survived; during outdoor head-starting: 20 of 20, 100%; during indoor head-starting: 29 of 30, 97%). After six months, released tortoises in the wild were a similar size compared to tortoises during outdoor headstarting (released: 49 mm long; during outdoor head-starting: 51 mm long), but were smaller than tortoises during indoor head-starting (78 mm long). The relative weights and body conditions of tortoises were similar after six months, regardless of rearing approach (see original paper for details). Eggs from 25 wild adult female tortoises were collected, incubated in artificial burrows outside and hatched in August–September 2015. In September 2015, seventy hatchlings (21–46 days old) were either released directly into the wild (20 hatchlings) or moved to either an indoor enclosure (30 hatchlings) or outdoor enclosure (20 hatchlings). Direct-release hatchlings were released in a 0.7 km<sup>2</sup> unfenced area and monitored using radio telemetry twice weekly until November 2015, once a week in winter and twice weekly from March 2016. The indoor enclosure was climate controlled and hatchlings were fed five times/week and watered weekly (see paper for details). The outdoor enclosure (30 x 30 m) was semi-natural, predator-proof and hatchlings were provided supplemental food and water weekly until the end of the active season (November 2015). Hatchling morphometrics were assessed prior to their release or before being moved to their head-starting enclosure in September 2015 and again at least once in March–April 2016.</p>",
