Typical wastes include faeces, excess feed and nutrients, and chemicals, such as disinfectants, antifoulants, pesticides, herbicides, and drugs for disease control. Current water quality regulations at aquaculture systems vary widely between different countries, and some have no or very few regulations in place. Introducing and enforcing water quality regulations for aquaculture systems may reduce pollution and harmful impacts on reptile populations.</p>",
