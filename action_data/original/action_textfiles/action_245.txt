        "background_definitions": "<p class=\"Background\">Predation by birds at aquaculture facilities (e.g. fish ponds, raceways and shellfish farms) can cause significant commercial loss (Draulans 1987). With increasing protective wildlife legislation, demand for non-lethal, environmentally safe methods of bird exclusion and scaring have increased. Most fish farmers now rely primarily on non-lethal techniques to accomplish control (i.e. to reduce abundance or exclude fish-eating birds in and around the vicinity of fish farms). Control efforts may be optimized by compiling evidence relating to deterrent or exclusion device efficacy, taking into account costs, practicality of use and the possibility of developing integrated strategies (i.e. combining more than one deterrent method). Avian deterrents can be categorised as auditory, visual, chemical, exclusion, habitat modification and lethal (Bishop et al. 2003). Lethal deterrents are not considered here (except where, very rarely, used as part of an integrated approach).</p>\r\n<p>Bishop, J., McKay, H., Parrott, D. &amp; Allan, J.

Catfish farmers within an area of intensive roost harassment also reported a reduction in fish predation by cormorants. Significantly fewer cormorants used intensely harassed night roosts than less intensely harassed or roosts that were not harassed. Pyrotechnics (designed to scare birds) were fired at roosting cormorants and those flying towards the roost during the two hours before sunset. Cormorants were counted on or near ponds and comparisons made between intensely harassed, less intensely harassed and non-harassed roost sites.</p><p> </p>",

The time required to achieve success varied (the most effective was 16 min to achieve 100% success at one roost; the least effective 113 min to achieve 94% success at another), but cormorants typically abandoned roosts after three nights of harassment. Six trials (at six sites) were conducted using a Desman™ Laser and five using a Laser Dissuader™. From sunset to 1 hour after sunset (on one to three consecutive evenings), a laser beam was directed at roosting cormorants, from 100-1,000 m distant. Birds were counted before and after treatment. (Note: Laboratory trials found no ocular damage to cormorants exposed to the Desman Laser at distances to the minimum of 1 m tested).</p><p> </p>",
