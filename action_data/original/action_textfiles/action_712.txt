Wheat <em>Triticum aestivum</em>, barley <em>Hordeum vulgare</em> and rye <em>Secale cereal</em> were grown at two locations. A ryegrass <em>Lolium perenne</em>/clover<em> Trifolium repens </em>ley mix was used, undersown with spring barley on areas 126 m<sup>2</sup>. Within these were two sampling plots 11 m<sup>2</sup> (at Jyndevad) and 15 m<sup>2</sup> (Foulum). There were five treatments: autumn ploughing with wheat followed by rye; autumn ploughing – wheat/barley; autumn ploughing – barley/rye; autumn ploughing – barley both years, spring ploughing – barley/rye. Soil samples were taken at the start and end of each treatment. Soil water, organic carbon and total nitrogen were measured.</p><p> </p>",
