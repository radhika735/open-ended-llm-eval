Therefore, raising awareness of the impact of individual actions on species conservation may improve butterfly and moth conservation outcomes. Behaviours and beliefs which create threats, and which awareness raising should aim to minimize, could include the use of insecticides, the release of non-native animals and plants into the wild (for example from gardens), and a general fear of invertebrates or of moths specifically. Conversely, behaviours which awareness raising may wish to encourage could include planting nectar and pollen-rich native plants, or reducing weeding or mowing, in gardens. Awareness raising programmes could include education and outreach events, as well as citizen science projects (Dennis <em>et al.</em> 2017, Richter <em>et al.</em> 2018).</p>\r\n<p><sup>Dennis E.B., Morgan B.J.T., Brereton T.M., Roy D.B. &amp; Fox R.
