There was no change in the behaviour of waders, and grebes dived, rather than dispersing. A follow-up, before-and-after experiment found that the number of wildfowl and hoary-headed grebes <em>Poliocephalus poliocephalus </em>on toxic and acidic tailing ponds were over 66% lower in the 12 months following the installation of a slowly rotating beacon with an intermittent, low-angled beam that floated in the centre of the ponds, compared to the 12 months before installation. Over half of the casualties were when the device was not fully operational and mortality rates were reduced to one-sixth of post-installation levels in the 12 months after the device became fully operational.
