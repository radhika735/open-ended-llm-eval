After 42 days, 3,200 of the 6,180 tree seeds sown had germinated. After 780 days, 2,144 seedlings of the 3,200 that had germinated were alive. In November 2010, tree seeds of six species were sown in rows one metre apart resulting in 6,180 sown seeds. Seedling germination and survival was recorded for each plant after 42, 84, 126, 217, 398 and 780 days. This experiment was also part of a study testing the effect of fertilizer and plant cover on seedling germination and growth.</p>",
