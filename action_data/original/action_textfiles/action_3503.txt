Blanding’s turtles showed similar levels of use of roads closed (0.9 crossings/individual) and open to vehicle traffic (1.1 crossings/individual). Twenty-four of 52 turtles crossed roads. Fifty-two Blanding's turtles (22 females, 24 males, 6 juveniles) were captured by hand or using hoop nets and a radio transmitter was attached to their shell. All turtles were tracked every 2–4 days from May to August 2010.</p>",
