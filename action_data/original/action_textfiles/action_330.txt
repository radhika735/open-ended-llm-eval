Typically, around 10% of mature and/or immature trees are retained in patches within an otherwise, clear-cut harvest compartment, with ‘prompt reforestation’ subsequent to timber extraction in the other 90%. These retained patches could help maintain characteristic forest species and act as reservoirs for re-colonisation by forest dependant species.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

Of ten abundant forest species in patch group stands, five restricted-range species declined in modified clear-cut and two-story harvested stands, whilst nine mostly habitat generalists species increased in these two treatments. Seven to 11 stands of each treatment were studied, with birds surveyed in the breeding season prior to, and in the two years after, timber harvest (1989-1993).</p><p> </p>",

Species lost from the clearcut plot were mostly forest specialists. Estimated bird density in the patch-retention area fell from c.3.5 pairs/ha in 1999 to 17 in 2000, recovering to around 34 in 2001. In the clear-cut area, it fell from 3.3 pairs/ha before harvest to around three in 2000 and 14 in 2001. Densities in the control remained relatively constant (c.3.2 pairs/ha). Estimated bird density in the patch-retention area fell from 3.5 pairs/ha in 1999 to 1.7 in 2000, recovering to around 3.4 in 2001. In the clear-cut area, it fell from 3.3 pairs/ha before harvest to around 0.3 in 2000 and 1.4 in 2001. Densities in the control remained relatively constant (3.2 pairs/ha).</p><p> </p>",
