Traditional woodland management, such as small scale wood harvesting, which created these habitats has declined, leading to the closure of woodland canopies (Bubová <em>et al.</em> 2015). Creating young plantations within mature woodland may help to temporarily open up patches within the forest, and create new habitat for butterflies and moths by encouraging the growth of food plants on the woodland floor, or by creating sheltered, sunny sites for basking and territory defence.</p>\r\n<p><sub>Bubová T., Vrabec V., Kulma M. &amp; Nowicki P.

Woodlands with larger areas of young plantations or active coppicing were more likely to have retained populations of either fritillary species than woodlands with larger areas of mature conifer (data presented as model results). For pearl-bordered fritillary, woodlands with larger areas of young plantations were more likely to have retained populations than woodlands with larger areas of mature conifer wood or mature deciduous wood. Butterfly records from six data sources were used to identify 52 woods which had contained fritillary populations since 1970. The area of four habitat types was mapped in each wood: young plantation on a previously wooded site, established coppice cut within the last four years, mature deciduous woodland and mature conifers. In 1990–1991, all but one of the woods were visited to record whether fritillary populations were still present.</p>",
