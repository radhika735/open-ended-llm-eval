        "background_definitions": "<p>Like all insects, butterflies and moths are attracted to colours, but show greater attraction to some colours than others (Kevan 1983). Common wind turbine colours (white and grey) have been found to attract more insects, including butterflies and moths, than other colours such as purple (Long <em>et al.</em> 2011). Therefore, painting turbines in less attractive colours may reduce the disturbance caused to butterfly and moth behaviour.</p>\r\n<p><sup>Kevan P.G.
