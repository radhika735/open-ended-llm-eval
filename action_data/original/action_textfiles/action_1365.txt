Similar pH levels were found in plots with or without added slurry (pH 8.3–8.4). <strong>Soil organisms: </strong>Similar numbers of oribatid mites were found in plots with or without added slurry (2,404–5,448 vs 4,304 individuals/m<sup>2</sup>). <strong>Methods:</strong> Plots (11 x 12.5 m or 7 x 12.5 m) had slurry (pig: 30 or 55 t/ha/year; sow: 25, 55, or 80 t/ha/year) or no fertilizer (12 replicates of each, but three replicates with sow slurry at 25 t/ha/year). Plots had reduced tillage (disc-harrowing, 15 cm depth) or no tillage (with herbicide). Straw was removed from all plots. Soil samples were collected in October 2011, February 2012, and May 2012 from plots without fertilizer and plots with 25 t/ha/year (three cores/plot, 0–5 cm depth). The other plots were sampled in May 2012.</p><p> </p>",
