Four–five years after the completion of a highway, 70 of 284 (25%) temporarily relocated and released Hermann’s tortoises were recaptured. The first-year survival rate was estimated to be 51% and annual survival rate was estimated to be 78%. Most recaptured tortoises were discovered in the vicinity of their release location. While in temporary captivity, 16 of 300 tortoises died. In May 1989, a total of 300 tortoises were captured and held in an enclosure until the completion of a highway in October 1990. Tortoises were provided with supplementary food several times a week while in captivity. The new highway was fenced to limit tortoise access to the road and two culverts and a road underpass were constructed to facilitate tortoise movements. Visual searches for tortoises were carried out either side of the highway in April–October 1993–1994.</p>",

Six months after release following vegetation cutting, five Hermann’s tortoises had been observed in cleared plots compared to four tortoises before clearance (whether they were the same tortoises is not known) and single nests were laid in two of 50 cleared plots. Eighteen months after cutting, single nests were laid in five of 50 plots. In February 2013, fifty plots (100m<sup>2</sup> each) at three sites were cleared of shrub cover using a brush cutter. Fifteen tortoises were removed before cutting using trained detection dogs <em>Canis lupus familiaris</em> and put back afterwards. Plots were monitored for tortoises once a week in March–August 2013 and checked for nests in August 2013 and 2014.</p>",
