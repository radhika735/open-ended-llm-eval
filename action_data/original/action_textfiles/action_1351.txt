            "paragraph_text": "<p class=\"Interventionparagraph\">A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 2012–2013 in two irrigated tomato fields in central Italy (same study as (22)) found that cover crops had inconsistent effects on tomato yields. <strong>Crop yield: </strong>Higher tomato yields were found in plots that had been cover cropped and mulched with hairy vetch, compared to plots that had not (6.4–7 vs 3.2–5.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Lower tomato yields were found in plots that had been cover cropped and mulched with lacy phacelia (in one of two comparisons: 4.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) or white mustard (2.1–3.5), compared to plots that had not (3.2–5.3). <strong>Implementation options: </strong>The highest tomato yields were found in plots with hairy vetch (6.4–7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and the lowest were found in plots with white mustard (2.1 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). <strong>Methods: </strong>Three species of winter cover crops (<em>Vicia villosa </em>hairy vetch, <em>Phacelia tanacetifolia </em>lacy phacelia, or <em>Sinapis alba </em>white mustard) were sown on three plots each, but not on three control plots (plot size not reported), in September. The cover crops were mulched in May, and the control plots were tilled (depth not reported). Tomato seedlings were transplanted in May (transplanted into the mulch) and harvested in August. All plots were tilled in September. It was not clear whether these results were a direct effect of cover cropping, mulching, or tillage.</p><p> </p>",

Crop residues were chopped in March. Reduced tillage or conventional tillage was used on half of these plots, in 1999–2009. The plots (9 x 82 m) had six raised beds each. Different numbers of tillage practices were used for conventional tillage (19–23 tractor passes, including disk and chisel ploughing) and reduced tillage (11–12 tractor passes, not including disk and chisel ploughing). Tomato seedlings were transplanted in April 2000–2009. Fertilizer and herbicide were used on all plots, and the tomatoes were irrigated. Tomatoes were grown in rotation with cotton.</p><p> </p>",

Higher eggplant yields were found in plots with oilseed rape as the winter cover crop, compared to oats, in two of three comparisons (20–25 vs 7–14 Mg/ha fresh weight). <strong>Methods:</strong> Three species of winter cover crops (<em>Vicia villosa </em>hairy vetch, <em>Brassica napus </em>oilseed rape, or <em>Avena sativa </em>oats) were sown on three plots each (6 x 12 m plots) in September 2009–2010, and no cover crops were sown on three plots (weeded, bare soil). The cover crops were mown and used as mulch (50 cm wide) in eggplant rows, in May 2010–2011. Eggplant seedlings were transplanted into the plots in May, and fruits were harvested four times/year in July–September 2010–2011. All plots were fertilized before the cover crops were grown, but not after. All plots were irrigated.</p><p> </p>",
