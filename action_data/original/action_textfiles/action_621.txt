Of the 22 mortalities, 16 (73%) occurred during the first year after release, with three during each of the second and third years. Predation and human-caused mortality were the main causes. Birds were bred in captivity and parent-raised before being rendered temporarily flightless with wing brails and moved to acclimatisation pens.

Food was provided until the birds no longer returned to the enclosure. Greater sandhill cranes are migratory, whilst Florida sandhill cranes are not.

Reintroductions of Siberian cranes <em>G. leucogeranus</em> has not increased wild flock size, with no reintroduced birds being seen after migration and high mortality during rearing, high poaching levels and few wild birds to guide migration. Releases of semi-wild red-crowned cranes <em>G. japonensis</em> and white-naped cranes <em>G. vipio</em> in southeast Russia found that four of ten released birds migrated successfully, and at least two pairs nested, one successfully. At least 84% of 38 greater sandhill cranes <em>G. canadensis tabida</em> survived for a year after release in Michigan, USA, 74% returned after migration and four males nested. Non-migratory releases generally had higher success: first-year survival of non-migratory whooping cranes <em>G. americana</em> has increased from approximately 34% (1993-4) to 71% (1996), although the population remains very small and may rely on continued releases. Captive-reared Mississippi sandhill cranes <em>G. c. pulla</em> had an overall first-year survival of 70%, an adult survival over 91% following release and in 1992 represented 80% of the wild population. In 1996 there were 13 nesting pairs (the most recorded), with 60% of known pairs having at least one captive-reared individuals. The population, however, remains dependent on releases. The author argues that post-release monitoring is vital to identify causes of mortality.</p><p> </p>",

Birds were released either in mixed flocks (both hand-reared and parent-reared birds) or non-mixed flocks (with just one rearing type). Survival rates over four years were highest for hand-reared birds in mixed flocks (approximately 95% survival for 17 birds), followed by parent-reared birds in mixed flocks (89% of 31 birds), hand-reared in non-mixed flocks (78% of 39 birds) and were lowest in parent-reared, non-mixed flocks (56% of 45). By the end of the study, however, differences between parent and hand-reared birds were no longer statistically significant, although mixed flock birds still had higher survival. Birds were kept in ‘cohorts’ for four to five weeks, before being moved to the release site and kept for a month in uncovered pens before wing brails (which prevent flying) were removed in December.

Average first-year survival of 71 winter-released juvenile birds was 87%, and was higher in later years as techniques improved. Birds were reared by humans wearing costumes (to avoid imprinting on human carers, see ‘Use puppets to increase the survival or growth of hand-reared chicks’ for studies on this intervention) and guided to the release site by an ultralight aircraft. Once there they were kept in holding pens by costumed caretakers. When the habitat prevented this, the juveniles were vulnerable to bobcat <em>Lynx rufus</em> predation, but this problem was overcome by vegetation clearance. Winter releases of this type were advantageous because the intensive care reduced predation by bobcats, juveniles were kept away from harassment by adult birds and juveniles did not lose their fear of humans through contact with tame sandhill cranes <em>G. canadensis</em>. Once released, juveniles showed ordinary migratory and summer behaviour.</p><p> </p>",
