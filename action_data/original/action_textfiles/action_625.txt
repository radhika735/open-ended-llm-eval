The following section includes studies describing the overall effects of release projects. Studies that compare specific release techniques are described elsewhere (‘Use holding pens at release sites’, ‘Use ‘anti-predator training’ to improve survival after release’ etc).</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

This represents an increase of almost 100% on the previous Colombian population, estimated at ten pairs. The three birds that died did not appear to be affected by human activity. Releases were at three sites, using birds bred in zoos in the USA, with acclimatisation periods of between 17 and 103 days. After releases, food was provided irregularly at multiple sites (to encourage birds to search for carrion). Birds ranged over nearly 200 km<sup>2</sup> over two years, which is less than ranges for reintroduced condors in arid habitats in Peru.</p><p> </p>",
