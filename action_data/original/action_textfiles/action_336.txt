However, the treatment area contained significantly lower species richness and abundance than the control area in summer. At the guild level, bark-feeding insectivores were more abundant in the treatment area; whereas foliage-gleaning insectivores and arboreal seed-eating species were less abundant in the treatment area. In December 1998, terrestrial insectivores were less abundant in the treatment. Birds were surveyed four times at 30 points within each area. In the treatment area, saplings of species that form the tree layer were not removed.</p><p> </p>",
