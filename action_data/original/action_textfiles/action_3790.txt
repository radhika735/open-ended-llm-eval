Fewer turtle carcasses were found at the base of the cliff after the fence was installed (2 carcasses) compared to before installation (60 carcasses). Fencing totalled 100 m of modified aluminium pool fencing (50 cm high with vertical bars at 30 cm intervals), which was installed in three areas around the tops of small cliffs on the eastern end of the island in November 2011. The fencing blocked off the cliff edges but kept open natural ramps for entrance and egress of turtles to the centre of the island. Surveys of the number and location of sea turtle carcasses on the island occurred in November 2011 (before installation) and December 2011 and February 2012 (after installation). </p>",
