Hatching success on rafts was 80%. Rafts had a wooden frame and Styrofoam centre, an arching roof of wire mesh with two anchors of different weights allowing the raft to float up and down with changing water levels. The authors estimate the cost at $0.85/duckling (in 1979 dollars).</p><p> </p>",

Ducks (12 species) nested at densities of 1.8-29.1 nests/ha, with 43-59% success. Canada geese <em>Branta canadensis</em> nested at densities of 0.2-7.1 nests/ha, with 70% success (144 nests). Islands were most productive when small, far from shore and with high vegetation cover. Islands were created before flooding of the impoundments by raising some areas about to be flooded or isolating peninsulas with ditches and were between 0.13 ha and 6.6 ha in size.</p><p> </p>",

This pattern was strongest at inland northern reserves, where all 11 species used well-vegetated sites, but none used sparsely covered ones. At coastal sites and southern reserves the pattern was weaker, but well-vegetated sites were always used by more species. The species studied were eight species of ducks, Canada geese <em>Branta canadensis</em>, feral greylag geese <em>Anser anser </em>and mute swans <em>Cygnus olor</em>. At four sites, the provision of vegetated islands or rafts resulted in the establishment of new populations of five duck species. The review also examines island and platform use by grebes, divers, ground-nesting seabirds, waders and rails.</p><p> </p>",
