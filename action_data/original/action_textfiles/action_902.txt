Microbial biomass (indicated by carbon levels) was 28% and 52% higher under mixed and organic amendments respectively compared to chemical inputs. Ginger <em>Zingiber officinale</em> was grown in 3 × 1 × 0.15 m raised beds cleared of weeds. Treatments included organic amendments (farmyard manure, pressed neem <em>Azadirachta indica</em> waste, ash, vermicompost), chemical amendments (NPK – nitrogen/phosphorus/potassium at 75-50-50 kg/ha, urea, rock phosphate and potash), mixed (integrated) amendments (farmyard manure and NPK combined) and no fertilizer (control). There were five replicates. Four soil samples/bed were taken immediately after ginger harvest.</p><p> </p>",

Levels were similar in the remaining treatments but higher than in the untreated control (by 34-45%). Microbial biomass was higher under mixed amendments (466 mg C/kg) compared to nitrogen/phosphorus (211 mg C/kg), NPK (247 mg C/kg) and the control (161 mg C/kg).  Three management treatments included land abandonment, bare fallow (both in 14 x 7 m plots) and a wheat <em>Triticum aestivum</em>-maize <em>Zea mays </em>system (14 x14 m plots). Within the wheat-maize system were fertilizer treatments: control (no addition), nitrogen only, nitrogen/potassium, phosphorus/potassium, nitrogen/phosphorus, NPK, NPK plus straw, NPK plus 13.7 t/ha manure, NPK plus 20.6 t/ha manure. All fertilizers were incorporated into the soil to 20 cm depth. Soils were sampled to 20 cm depth at the end of the experiment.</p><p> </p>",
