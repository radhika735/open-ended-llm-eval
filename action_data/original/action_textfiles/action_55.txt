Of 90 translocated adult bees, only three remained at the new site. Around 40% of bees translocated as young (90 stems moved with young bees inside) stayed after emergence at the new site; 63-70% of these translocated females stayed and began provisioning nests, whereas most males left the site after territorial fights.</p>",
