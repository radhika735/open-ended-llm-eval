More bee species were found in managed orchards, compared to abandoned orchards (19 vs 13 species/site), but similar numbers of individuals were found (231 vs 122 individuals/site).<strong> Methods: </strong>Three managed orchards were compared to three abandoned orchards (1 ha each). Bees were surveyed three times/site in March–May (three transects/site, 20 minutes/transect). Pollen grains were counted on 100 plants from each of two wildflower species (<em>Asphodelus ramosus</em>, a tall, perennial herb, and <em>Cistus salvifolius</em>, an evergreen shrub, both with large white flowers), which were collected after each bee survey.</p><p> </p>",
