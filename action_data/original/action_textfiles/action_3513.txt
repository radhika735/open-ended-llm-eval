High vegetation can provide more complex environments and more habitats, while short vegetation may increase the risk of predation. Cutting of crops or pasture can kill or maim reptiles causing mutilations, crushing, and other lethal injuries. It is possible that mortalities and injuries could be reduced by raising the height of cutting machinery above the soil (Saumure <em>et al.</em> 2007).</p>\r\n<p><sup>Saumure, R.A., Herman, T.B., &amp; Titman, R.D.

In long native or exotic pastures or in wheat <em>Triticum vulgare</em> or canola <em>Brassica napus</em> crops, marbled geckos did not orient directly towards a target tree, but did in short native or exotic pasture (results reported as statistical model outputs, see original paper for details). Individual wild arboreal geckos were released into fields with an isolated tree surrounded by different pasture or crop fields and direction of travel was recorded. The field types included long (average sward height &gt;20 cm) and short (average sward height &lt;10 cm) pastures dominated by either native or exotic plants, or one of two cereal crops (wheat or canola; 6 total field types). Lizards were released in three fields/type (&gt;2 km apart; 18 total fields). Geckos were caught from the same landscape but &gt;5 km away from the study site. Individual animals were marked with fluorescent powder and tracked for 6 hours after release.</p>",
