Catch limits may be implemented for stocks that are shared and jointly managed between countries and can be exchanged between them.

Data were not tested statistically. In the period after the introduction of catch limits in 1975, total catch rates of Cape hake between 1976–1984 steadily increased, from 0.6 to 1.0 (data reported as an index of catch/unit effort). In the years prior (1965–1975), when there were no catch limits, catch rates declined from a maximum of 2.5 in 1966 to 0.8 in 1975. In addition, for three of the four areas hake stock biomass was assessed to have attained levels required for maximum sustainable yield in the years when quotas were set. Catch limits for hake were introduced in 1975 for four management areas (International Commission for the Southeast Atlantic Fisheries Divisions) covering major hake trawling grounds extending along the coasts of South Africa and Namibia. Catch rate indices were derived from catch and effort statistics data collected for the four areas between 1965 and 1984.</p>",

In addition, compliance was generally poor and between 19–37% of swordfish landed from various countries fishing in the Atlantic in 1998 were under the recommended size (125 cm). In 1994, total allowable catches and minimum size limits for swordfish were recommended by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas. However, the recommendations were enforced by some, but not all member states, and following the limits some vessels relocated to other regions and an increase in discarded swordfish was reported.

Data were not tested statistically. During the period after new total allowable catches were set (at 60,000 t), total hake biomass increased from 500,000 t in 1990 to 900,000 t in 1992. Biomass gradually declined in the years following, to 550,000 t in 1997, but increased again between 1998–2000 (1,000,000–1,300,000 t). During the same period, total allowable catches increased to 87,000 t in 1992 and to 160,690 t in 1999, and numbers of vessels participating in the fishery rose from 55 (1991) to 105 (2000). The authors noted that the decline in hake biomass between 1992–1997 was probably the result of anomalous environmental conditions in 1993–1995. New, conservative catch limits were imposed from 1990 following Namibian Independence. From 1992–1997, catch limits were set as 20% of the fishable biomass. However, conflicting estimates of abundance – research survey vs commercial indices – lead in 1997 to the introduction of new methodology to calculate abundance (see paper for details). Biomass data was estimated from 18 research surveys between 1990–1999. Bottom trawl transects were done 20 miles apart to assess bottom-dwelling hake. Mid-water hake were assessed using acoustics.</p>",

Data were not tested statistically. Herring spawning stock biomass (for which the target for sustainable catches was 800,000 t) increased between 1997–2003 after the implementation of total allowable catches, compared to the previous period 1987–1996 of declining biomass (after: 600,000–1,750,000 t; before: 500,000–1,250,000 t). Compared to the years 1970–1978, following a similar decline in biomass, total allowable catch (TAC) management resulted in higher levels of stock biomass than with no management (TAC: 600,000–1,750,000 t; no TAC: 50,000–450,000 t). Fisheries data and scientific advice for North Sea herring were compared for two, 17-year periods with similar trends (1962–1978 and 1987–2003) encompassing two years (1970 and 1995) with critically low levels of depleted spawning stock biomass and high fishing mortality. During the second period in 1997, an EU/Norway agreement on management actions (implementation of total allowable catches) was introduced. During the first period of excess fishing, no management action (limited scientific advice and failure to implement total allowable catches) and a rapidly declining stock biomass resulted in 1978 in total collapse and closure of the entire fishery.</p>",

For otter trawl fleets, corresponding changes in fishing effort with changing TACs (i.e. decrease or increase in effort with decreasing or increasing TAC) were found between four of eight comparisons: cod <em>Gadus morhua</em> TACs and the English and Scottish, but not German trawl effort; whiting <em>Merlangius merlangus</em> TAC and English trawl effort; and saithe <em>Pollachius virens</em> TACs and Norwegian, but not German, trawl effort.

Across all catches, the proportion of total megrim catch discarded decreased in years with higher quotas (2011–2012, average 20% in 2012) compared to years with lower quotas (2008–2010: data reported as statistical results, average 54% in 2009). However, the reduction was mainly the result of a lower proportion of fish categorized by the crew as ‘small’, and discarded, as quota increased (2012: 0.1, 2009: 0.39) even though &gt;99% were above minimum landing size. The likelihood of a fish being discarded decreased with increasing quota (data reported as statistical result) indicating catch limits were only regulating the amount of megrim landed but had no effect on fishing mortality, particularly of smaller sizes. Megrim total allowable catch was reduced in the North Sea between 2004–2007 in response to low biomass. However, increasing megrim biomass and low catch limits led to high discarding and limits were increased again between 2010–2013. Data were collected by on board sampling of catches on eight demersal (bottom) fishing vessels based in the Shetland Islands, Scotland, and working in the mixed demersal fishery in the northern North Sea/North Atlantic Ocean (International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) Division IVa). Observer trips (2–8 d) were undertaken between May 2008 and March 2012. A total of 25 trips (22 twin trawl and 3 seine) and 407 hauls were sampled. Megrim length was recorded from the retained and discarded portions of the catch. Discards were categorized as “small” or “bruised”.</p>",

Data were not tested statistically. During the period of management activity from 1988–2009, both a steep increase in fishing mortality and a sharp decline in halibut spawning stock biomass since 1984 were halted: fishing mortality decreased to below targeted levels for sustainable harvest, while biomass gradually increased to well above target limits for sustainable harvest (data reported as trends in the ratios of fishing mortality and biomass to the target sustainable fishing mortality and biomass). In 1988, the first halibut total allowable catch limit was set (3,200 t) for fishing on the Scotian Shelf and southern Grand Banks and reduced in small steps to 850 t in 1994. A minimum size limit (81 cm) was introduced in 1988, fully implemented by 1994. Following signs of population recovery, the total allowable catch was increased again in small steps beginning 1999. Halibut size and age data were obtained from commercial catches and catch-rate data from groundfish and halibut surveys. The data were used in a stock assessment model that estimated population dynamics and exploitation rates over the period 1970–2010.</p>",
