Results were not statistically tested. When translocated gopher tortoises were initially held in release pens with artificial burrows, more tortoises were resighted or dug burrows during the 3–4-month monitoring period (17 of 21 recaptured or dug burrows, see paper for details) than when tortoises were released without a holding pen (directly released: 0 of 11; released in abandoned burrow: 1 of 5; released in artificial burrow: 0 of 3). Forty individually-marked adult gopher tortoises (some may have been captive releases) were translocated in spring–summer 1980–1982. Tortoises were released into artificial burrows in release pens (21 tortoises), directly released with no specific management (11 tortoises), into abandoned existing burrows (5 tortoises) or into artificial burrows (3 tortoises). Artificial burrows were 1 m deep and 45 degrees to the surface. Most tortoises (35 of 40) were released into areas with existing tortoise populations. Release pens were circular (4–7 m diameter), with translucent vinyl sheet walls (buried 10 cm into the ground) attached to wooden posts. Most tortoises were held in release pens for 2–4 weeks. Tortoises were monitored until late summer or early autumn in the release year.</p>",

Annual survival was 71% and was not affected by spending time in a holding pen, neither was survival to two years (pen: 33%; no pen: 34%) or five years (pen: 27%; no pen: 24%). Post-release direction of dispersal (result presented as a bearing) and initial dispersal speed (days to disperse 100 m: average of 24–85 days) were also not affected by being in a holding pen prior to release. Nineteen gravid females, 11 clutches of 1–9 eggs, and 10 offspring were discovered following releases. In 1987–1990, a total of 335 turtles were collected from development sites or while crossing roads in suburban areas. Fifty-three turtles were fitted with radio trackers, and were either released immediately, or held in a pen for 15 days prior to release. The remaining 282 turtles were held in pens for 30 days before release. Originally a saltmarsh, the release site was created by dredge spoil deposition during 1928–1945. Radio tagged turtles were located daily for the first three days, then weekly until 1993. In 1993–1995, a trained dog <em>Canis lupus familiaris</em> was used to locate turtles.</p>",

Activity levels, movements, burrow switching, and agonistic interactions were similar between lizards confined for one or five days (see original paper for details). In October 2009, sixteen pygmy bluetongue lizards were captured in the wild and released into one of four predator-proof cages in a zoo enclosure (4 lizards/cage). Each cage included a central grassy circle (4 m diameter) with artificial burrows, surrounded by a strip of bare ground (5 m wide), encircled by a strip of marginal habitat (0.5 m wide) containing artificial burrows (see original paper for details of burrows). When lizards were released, all cages had a holding pen around the central grass areas. The pen was removed from two cages after one day and from the remaining two cages after five days. Lizard activity was monitored by video cameras over 10 days and analysis of lizard behaviour was based on observations from days 6–10 of the study.</p>",
