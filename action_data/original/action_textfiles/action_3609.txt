Tie-downs are lines that are shorter than the height of the net and connect the floatline (top) and leadline (bottom), causing the net to billow out, potentially increasing the chance of entanglement. Lower profile (narrower) nets without tie-downs may reduce the number of reptiles that become entangled.</p>",
