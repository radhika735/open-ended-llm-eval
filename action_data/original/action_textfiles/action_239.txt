Open strips were created in a grid pattern, 25 m apart, using a tine-cultivator in November 1995. Experimental fields were still significantly more open in May 1996, but the swards had closed entirely by February 1997. This study is also described in ‘Revert arable land to permanent grassland’ and ‘Habitat restoration and creation’.</p><p> </p>",
