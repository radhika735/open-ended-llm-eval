        "background_definitions": "<p><strong>Definition:</strong> ‘Hole habitats’ are depressions with a length to width ratio ≤3:1 and depth &gt;50 mm (Strain <em>et al.</em> 2018). </p>\r\n<p>Hole habitats provide organisms refuge from predation in subtidal rocky habitats (Nelson &amp; Vance 1979). The size and density of holes is likely to affect the size, abundance and variety of organisms that can use them. Small holes can provide refuge for small-bodied organisms but may exclude larger organisms, limit their growth and get rapidly filled-up (Firth <em>et al.</em> 2020). Large holes can be used by larger-bodied organisms but may not provide sufficient refuge from predators for smaller organisms. By default, holes contain shaded surfaces, which can be associated with the presence of non-native species (Dafforn 2017).</p>\r\n<p>Holes are sometimes present on boulders used in marine artificial structures as a result of quarrying processes or engineering tests (Firth <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, these are sparse when present and are normally absent from other types of structures. Holes sometimes form on artificial structures through erosion, but are often filled or repaired during maintenance works (Moreira <em>et al.</em> 2007). Hole habitats can be created on subtidal artificial structures by adding or removing material, either during construction or retrospectively.</p>\r\n<p>There is a body of literature investigating the effects of creating hole habitats on artificial reefs (reviewed by Morris <em>et al.</em> 2018). These studies are not included in this synopsis, which focusses on <em>in situ</em> conservation actions to enhance the biodiversity of structures that are engineered to fulfil a primary function other than providing artificial habitats.</p>\r\n<p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href=\"../../actions/3446\"><em>Create natural rocky reef topography on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3455\"><em>Create pit habitats (1–50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3448\"><em>Create groove habitats (1–50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3454\"><em>Create crevice habitats (&gt;50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3436\"><em>Create small adjoining cavities or ‘swimthrough’ habitats (≤100 mm) on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>;<a href=\"../../actions/3456\"><em> Create large adjoining cavities or ‘swimthrough’ habitats (&gt;100 mm) on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3452\"><em>Create groove habitats </em>and<em> small protrusions, ridges or ledges (1–50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>.</p>\r\n<p><sup>Dafforn K.A.

After 24 months, the macroalgae and invertebrate species diversity was higher on blocks with added habitats than without (data reported as Shannon index) and the community composition differed (data reported as statistical model results). Thirty species (7 mobile invertebrates, 14 non-mobile invertebrates, 9 fishes) recorded on and around blocks with added habitats were absent from blocks without. Species abundances varied on blocks with and without added habitats depending on the species group (see paper for results). It is not clear whether these effects were the direct result of creating holes, pits, grooves, or using environmentally-sensitive material. Hole habitats were created on breakwater blocks (1 × 1 × 1 m) using a formliner. Each block had multiple cube-shaped (60 × 60 × 60 mm), cylindrical (diameter: 30 mm; depth: 100 mm) and hemispherical (diameter: 150 mm; depth: 100 mm) holes (T. Hadary <em>pers. comms</em><em>.</em>) amongst multiple pits and grooves (number/spacing not reported). Five blocks of each of three patented ECOncrete<sup>TM</sup> materials (lower pH and different cement/additives to standard-concrete) were placed at 5–7 m depth on a concrete-block breakwater during construction in July 2012. Five standard-concrete blocks (1.7 × 1.7 × 1.7 m) without added habitats were placed on a similar breakwater 80 m away.
