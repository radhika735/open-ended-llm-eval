Post-construction, many species were found migrating between wetlands under the viaduct. No remains of amphibians were found on the road post-construction, compared to thousands during some periods pre-construction. For example, after a night rainstorm in July 1997, over 6,500 newly emerged Italian edible frog <em>Rana hispanica</em> juveniles were counted on a 100 m stretch of road. A viaduct 215 m long was constructed in 2003 to raise the road. The supports of the viaduct (1.6 m high) were built on a bank 1 m higher than potential flood waters to prevent mixing of wetlands. Drift-fencing was installed for 300 m from each end of the viaduct along both sides of the road. Amphibian road kills were monitored before and after construction.</p><p> </p>",
