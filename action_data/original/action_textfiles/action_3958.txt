The study sampled 315 low-input grasslands managed as “Ecological Compensation Areas” and 216 conventionally managed grasslands.

In extensive, unfertilized plots cut in July, or not cut all summer, the abundance of butterflies (1–6 individuals/transect) was higher than in intensively managed plots (0–4 individuals/transect), but the number of species was similar (extensive: 1–2; intensive: 0–2 species/transect). The number of caterpillars in extensive plots (1–8 caterpillars/transect) was higher than in one intensive treatment (0–4 caterpillars/transect), but did not differ significantly from other intensive treatments (0–7 caterpillars/transect). In April 2002, experimental plots (50 × 10 m) were established on permanent pastures (&gt;5-years-old) on four farms. There were seven treatments, with three replicates/farm. Three extensive treatments were not fertilized or grazed, and were either cut to 10 cm once/year in May or July, or topped in early spring and undisturbed in summer. Four intensive treatments included modifications to conventional silage management (reducing fertilizer application or grazing, or raising cutting height), but were all cut twice/year. From June–September 2003–2006, butterflies were surveyed once/month on a 50-m transect through the centre of each plot. In April, June, July and September 2003–2006, caterpillars were counted (but not identified) on two 10-m transects/plot using a sweep net (20 sweeps/transect).</p>",

After Environmentally Sensitive Area management began, the total abundance (1,000–1,450 individuals) and species richness of large moth species was higher than before (800–1,250 individuals, richness data not presented). One of the five most abundant moth species (lunar underwing <em>Omphaloscelis lunosa</em>) and five of 23 butterfly species (meadow brown <em>Maniola jurtina</em>, brown argus <em>Aricia agestis</em>, common blue <em>Polyommatus icarus</em>, small copper <em>Lycaena phlaeas</em> and red admiral <em>Vanessa atalanta</em>) increased in abundance after the change in management. However, two butterfly species became less abundant (green-veined white <em>Pieris napi</em> and large white <em>Pieris brassicae</em>, data presented as model results). Overall butterfly abundance and species richness increased over the entire monitoring period, but the increase did not just happen after the management change. In 2002, the farm entered the Environmentally Sensitive Areas agri-environment scheme. Fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides were no longer used, the total number of livestock dropped from 180 cows and 1,000 sheep to 120 cows and 850 sheep, and the proportion of grassland increased. Butterflies were monitored weekly from April–September on a fixed 3.6 km transect divided into 13 sections. Moths were monitored nightly from dusk to dawn using a light trap in a fixed position in the middle of the farm.</p>",

In low intensity grasslands, the abundance (156 individuals) and species richness (24 species) of micro-moths, the species richness of all macro-moths (46 species), and the abundance of declining macro-moths (44 individuals) were all higher than in improved grasslands or crop fields on conventional farms (micro-moths: 43 individuals, 19 species; all macro-moths: 33 species; declining macro-moths: 21 individuals). However, the abundance of all macro-moths (366 individuals) and species richness of declining macro-moths (10 species) on low intensity grasslands was not significantly different from improved grasslands or crop fields (all macro-moths: 271 individuals; declining macro-moths: 9 species). In 2004, sixteen farms enrolled in agri-environment schemes, and were paired with 16 similar but conventionally-managed farms, &lt;8 km away. On agri-environment scheme farms, species-rich grassland was created on former arable or improved grassland fields by sowing a low productivity grass and herb seed mix, and managed with fertilizer and pesticide restrictions, and no summer cutting or grazing. Improved pastures and crop fields on conventional farms had no management restrictions. From June–September 2008, moths were collected for four hours, on one night/farm, using a 6 W heath light trap located in one field on each farm. Paired farms were surveyed on the same night.</p>",

The abundance, species richness and diversity of moths on grasslands managed with lower grazing intensity, less frequent cutting and/or less fertilizer input was similar to more intensively managed grasslands (data presented as model results). However, less intensively managed grasslands did support more specialist moth species, and species of greater conservation concern, than more intensively managed grasslands (data presented as model results). Of 87 individual species monitored, 24 species preferred less intensively managed grasslands, and 12 preferred more intensively managed grasslands (see paper for individual species data). From 2006, across three regions, nine grasslands were managed by grazing (by cattle, sheep or horses at 26–520 livestock units/ha/year), nine by mowing (1–2 cuts/year, often with nitrogen fertilization), and eight were grazed and mown (76–163 livestock units/ha/year; 1–2 cuts/year). Eleven of the mown or mown and grazed grasslands were fertilized with 1–138 kg nitrogen/ha. Moths were collected once/month from nine grasslands in each of two regions (May–August 2014), and from eight grasslands in one region (June–July 2014). Each night, a 12 V actinic and black-light trap were placed in the centre of each of three grasslands for 138–317 minutes/night. Moths were classified as specialists based on the number of food plants eaten by their caterpillars.</p>",
