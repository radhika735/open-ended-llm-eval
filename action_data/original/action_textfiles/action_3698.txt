In coastal sites there was a gradual increase from the year of eradication (3 lizards/100 trap nights) to six years after eradication (70 lizards/100 trap nights). On a nearby predator free island, lizard abundance was 4 lizards/100 trap nights in forested areas and 15–60 lizards/100 trap nights in coastal areas. Rats and rabbits were eradicated in 1986–1987 from one island (rodenticide and shooting) and a nearby island was historically free of invasive mammals.

Ten horse-removed and nine horse-occupied plots (135 x 135 m) were chosen that had no recent fires (&lt;15 years); were unused by cattle for at least 20 years; and were dominated by sagebrush (<em>Artemisia tridentala</em>). Only low elevation sites were included in analysis for reptiles (5 horse occupied plots; 6 horse removed plots across 7 sites). Horses were removed 10–14 years prior to the study.

At high vegetation density, small skink abundance increased over four years in fenced areas, but decreased in unfenced areas, whereas at medium-density vegetation the reverse was true (results reported on log scale). At low-density vegetation, small skink numbers remained stable over four years in both fenced and unfenced areas. In fenced low and medium-density vegetation sites, adding coarse woody debris (particularly 20 tonnes/ha clumped) lead to an increase in small skink abundance over time compared to when no debris was added (see paper for details). Reptiles were monitored in 96 plots (1 ha) in 24 sites across two nature reserves (4 plots/site). In October 2007, coarse woody debris was added to 72 plots (either 20 tonnes/ha evenly dispersed, 20 tonnes/ha clumped, 40 tonnes/ha dispersed and clumped) and none added to 24 plots.
