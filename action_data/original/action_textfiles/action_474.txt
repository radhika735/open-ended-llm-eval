Other interventions included: erecting signs highlighting the presence of nesting birds, vegetation control, preventing gulls <em>Larus </em>spp. from nesting, destroying gull nests and shooting particular ring-billed gulls <em>L. delawarensis </em>that were heavily predating tern eggs. Gulls were only culled at the site with population increase, whilst the authors attribute declines to continued high levels of disturbance, vegetation growth and mammalian predators.</p><p> </p>",
