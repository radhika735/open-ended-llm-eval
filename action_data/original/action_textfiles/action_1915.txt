Stereotypical pacing was lower when food was hidden around the enclosure (median 20 minutes/day) compared to being placed on the floor of the indoor area (median 125 minutes/day) as was walking whereas exploring/foraging was higher (mean values not reported). One black bear was fed once or twice daily before the study and during baseline data collection (8 days). During the first condition (6 days), the bear was still given the morning feed as well as a feeder tree containing snacks. The feeder tree released snacks at scheduled times of day, releasing food at six different locations. The second condition (8 days) included hiding all food apart from the meat around the enclosure, under rocks, in logs and in Boomer balls. Video recordings were taken for 12 hours starting 06:00 each and continuous focal sampling method was used.</p>",

Four cats were singularly housed and baseline data was collected for eight days before the treatment, when fed their regular diet of 0.25 kg of a commercial meat diet, an egg and one or two dead mice once daily.

The male lynx and first female lynx showed a reduction in time spent sleeping (1.1%) when food was hidden around the enclosure compared to when food was not hidden (30%). Before the study, the lynxes were fed each morning (processed feline meat, supplemented with dead day-old chicks, trout and mice). During the treatment phase, processed meat was fed each morning and dead prey items were hidden within the enclosure. Food was hidden daily for 17 days and hidden for two to three days a week for 10 days. Video recordings were taken and continuous sampling was used for four 30-minute sessions per day during public opening times. There were two study periods 26-months apart, only the first period showed significant results but this may have been due to the death of the original female lynx.</p>",

Eleven bush dogs in two enclosures were involved in the experiment. Their regular feeding regime consisted of meat chunks being thrown into the enclosure twice daily (chicken on bone, week old chicks, horse meat or unskinned rabbit). Instantaneous sampling with 15 second intervals was used for 30-minutes per day for each dog. During enrichment phase the entire daily food allowance was chopped into small chunks and hidden in the vegetation, rock crevices, under logs and within specially constructed wood-piles.
