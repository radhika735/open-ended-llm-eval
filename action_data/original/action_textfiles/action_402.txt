Therefore there is the possibility that predators will learn to associate boxes with nests and target them specifically. This could even lead to nest boxes acting as ‘ecological traps’ – with birds using them preferentially but having very low reproductive success in them. Therefore, ‘anti-predator’ devices and boxes may be desirable.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",
