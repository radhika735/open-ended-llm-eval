        "background_definitions": "<p>Fly-ash (flue ash, pulverised fuel ash) is a by-product of coal combustion and is often stored on or near coal fired power stations either in water impoundments (ponds) or underground in landfill. Fly-ash contains a number of metals and other trace elements and is known to contaminate groundwater. Metals and trace elements from fly-ash may be accumulated in the bodies of a range of reptile species with potentially harmful effects (Rowe <em>et al. </em>2002). Removing the waste from coal combustion may help to reduce the exposure of reptiles to these harmful pollutants.</p>\r\n<p><sup>Rowe C.L., Hopkins W.A. &amp; Congdon J.D.
