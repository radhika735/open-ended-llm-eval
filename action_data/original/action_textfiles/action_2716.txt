Factors that may affect the species and/or sizes of fish that are able to successfully escape through the meshes include: whether they are square- or diamond-shaped, mesh size, where they are placed in the trawl net (top or bottom, near or further away from the codend), the number of windows/panels and the behaviour of the fish. For example, top square mesh escape windows/panels have been used extensively in commercial prawn trawl fisheries to try and allow non-target fish to escape while retaining the target prawn/shrimp catch. Mesh escape windows/panels in trawl nets should thus reduce the amount of unwanted (non-target and/or non-marketable species) fish captured and allow the release of smaller individuals.</p>\r\n<p>Evidence for a related intervention is summarized under <em>‘Fishing gear modification - <a href=\"../../actions/2717\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Modify the configuration of a mesh escape panel/window in a trawl net</a>’. </em>Evidence of this intervention when used in combination with other interventions to reduce unwanted catch in trawl nets is summarized under ‘<em>Fishing gear modification - <a href=\"../../actions/2724\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fit mesh escape panels/windows to a trawl net and use square mesh instead of diamond mesh codend</a>’</em> and <a href=\"../../actions/2727\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>‘Fit mesh escape panels/windows and a size-sorting grid (rigid or flexible) to a trawl net’</em></a>.</p>",

Data were not statistically tested. Overall, trawl codends fitted with a square mesh escape panel retained 84% fewer undersized (&lt;27 cm) whiting than conventional trawls.

The overall size composition of both whiting and <em>Nephrops</em> was similar for each trawl design. Data were collected in September and October 1990, from 19 valid paired trawl deployments, 3 to 11.5 h duration, performed under commercial fishing conditions. Two 70 mm diamond mesh trawls were fished simultaneously: one fitted with a square-mesh panel and one without.

In June and July 1998, a total of 54 valid fishing deployments were done from a commercial trawler towing a twin trawl rig around the Danish island of Bornholm. Three modified standard codends, with 110, 125 and 135 mm square mesh escape windows, and three standard codends of 105, 120 and 140 mm diamond mesh size, were tested. The escape window was a single panel of square mesh, 3.5 m long and 1.4 m wide, inserted in the upper panel of the codend section. Covers were attached over each codend to collect escaping fish. Codend and cover catches were sorted and weighed by species. Sub-samples of cod were measured for length.</p>",

Trawl designs were alternated via the addition or removal of a small-mesh panel zipped over the large mesh window. The escape window was 5 × 7 m large diamond mesh (330 mm) inserted in the lower panel of the trawl near the codend. The trawl net was small-mesh (50 mm) and equipped with a mandatory Nordmøre-type escape grid of 50 mm bar spacings. All catch was sorted and weighed for each tow.</p>",

            "paragraph_text": "<p>A replicated study (year not stated) of a seabed area in the Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy (Brčić <em>et al.</em> 2016) reported that fitting a square mesh escape panel to a bottom trawl net allowed only a small proportion of the undersized and non-target fish to escape capture. Data were not tested for statistical significance. For four of four fish species (target: Atlantic horse mackerel <em>Trachurus trachurus</em>, European hake <em>Merluccius merluccius</em>, red mullet <em>Mullus barbatus</em>; non-target: poor cod <em>Trisopterus minutus capelanus) </em>total percentage escape of fish through the square mesh was 0.8–5.3%. For fish below the minimum landing size, a total of 8.6% horse mackerel, 0.9% hake and 7.7% of red mullet escaped through the panel, representing 9.1, 1.3 and 25.0% for mackerel, hake and red mullet respectively, of the total escape of undersized individuals (panel and codend combined). Losses of marketable sizes through the panel were 0.5% for horse mackerel, 0% for hake and 0.9% for red mullet. A standard commercial Italian trawl net was fitted with a 50 mm square-mesh panel in the top of the final tapered section trawl body, 8 m in front of the codend. The codend was 6 m long and 50 mm diamond mesh. Eight trawl deployments were carried out (sampling times/year unspecified). Small-mesh (20 mm) covers installed over the square mesh panel and codend collected the escaping individuals. Both the cover and codend catches were weighed and sorted and the length of the three target fish species measured to the nearest 0.5 cm.</p>",

            "paragraph_text": "<p>A review in 2016 of bottom trawl size selection data from fishing trials in the northeast Atlantic Ocean (Fryer <em>et al.</em> 2016) found that the effect of fitting a square mesh panel in a diamond mesh trawl on improving size selectivity of the gear for haddock <em>Melanogrammus aeglefinus</em> depended on panel mesh size and position, and time of year, and in diamond mesh trawl nets without square mesh panels haddock selectivity increased with larger mesh size codends, smaller codend circumference and thinner twine thickness. The length at which 50% of haddock are likely to escape from the gear increased by 3.8 cm for each 10 mm increase in panel mesh size, but the effect of square mesh panels on the overall (panel plus codend) size selectivity of the gear for haddock varied with panel mesh size, position (greater closer to the codend), and time of year (data reported as statistical results). The length at which 50% of haddock are likely to escape from the gear increased by 3.4 cm for every 10 mm increase in codend mesh size, 1.3 cm for every decrease in codend circumference by 10 meshes and by 1.4 cm for every 1 mm decrease in twine thickness. This study presents a meta‐analysis of haddock size‐selection data collected on 24 vessels between 1991–2009, by Marine Scotland Science (formerly Fisheries Research Services). The final dataset was based on 614 fishing deployments from 18 trials (one excluded) of the combined size selection of a diamond mesh codend and a square mesh escape panel in the upper part of the codend or extension, and 20 trials (one excluded) of diamond mesh codend selection.</p>",

Average discard ratios were reduced by 1–18% for nine of 12 trawlers, four of which tested mesh escape panels (test: 4–474 kg/tow, standard: 8–665 kg/tow); were similar for one vessel using a mesh panel (test: 3kg/tow, standard: 3kg/tow); and were 2% higher (test: 23–46 kg/tow, standard: 5–24 kg/tow) for two vessels that did not test a mesh panel. Twelve trawlers (six in the North Sea and three in each of the Skagerrak and Baltic Sea) were challenged to reduce discards/unwanted catch of fish and invertebrates in a six-month trial of modified (test) and standard/regulated trawl net gears. Vessels had free choice of gear modifications, which included mesh escape panels, changes to the codend circumference, coverless trawls, separator panels and increases in mesh size (see paper for specifications). Vessels were either twin-rig, towing test and standard nets at the same time, or single-rig and switching between test and standard gears between fishing trips.</p>",

In two of two comparisons, the numbers of whiting caught were lower in nets with square mesh cylinders (maximum 1,500–3,000 whiting) than standard nets (maximum 4,200–5,000 whiting) (data presented as selectivity distributions), but the average length of the whiting caught was not statistically different (square mesh cylinder: 24.7–25.6 cm, standard: 23.3–25.0 cm). Trials were done in April and November 2013 by commercial trawlers fishing parallel to each other: one rigged with a modified net and the other a standard net. In the first trial on 20–24 m vessels, 15 paired deployments were done with a standard (80 mm diamond mesh with mandatory 80 mm square mesh panel) net modified with an 80 mm section of square mesh around the circumference and a standard net with just the mandatory 80 mm square mesh panel. In the second trial, 13 deployments on 16–20 m vessels tested a net with a square mesh cylinder alone and a standard diamond mesh net without any square mesh (see paper for specifications). Both commercial and non-commercial fish catches were sampled. Total length per fish and weight per species were recorded. Random sub-sampling was done when catches were large.</p>",
