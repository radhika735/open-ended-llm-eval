A total of 437 birds collided with the fences, 92% of which were gamebirds (red grouse <em>Lagopus lagopus scoticus</em> accounted for 42%, black grouse <em>Tetrao tetrix</em> 29% and western capercaillie  <em>Tetrao urogallus</em> 20%). Collision rates in marked sections were 91% lower for black grouse and 64% lower for capercallie than in control sections. A total of 20 km of ten different fences was tested, with two 1 km stretches of each fence being randomly assigned to treatments.</p><p> </p>",
