Engaging fishers to collect scientific data may improve the coverage of data and help give fishers a better understanding of the information underpinning management plans. This in turn may improve compliance and buy-in to proposals and help reduce the impacts of fishing.</p>\r\n<p>Mackinson S., Wilson D. C., Galiay P. &amp; Deas B.
