Together with releases of captive-bred individuals, the programme resulted in the population increasing to 6,000 birds by 1991, compared with fewer than 1,000 in the 1970s, and birds were breeding on eight fox-free islands. The effects of different release techniques are discussed in ‘Release captive-bred individuals into the wild to restore or augment wild populations’, ‘Release birds as adults or subadults, not juveniles’ and ‘Clip birds’ wings on release’.</p><p> </p>",
