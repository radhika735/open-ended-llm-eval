Successful reproduction was documented for 16 of the 29 species. However, species diversity was lower in the restored compared to natural site. Planting regimes and treatment (burning or herbicide application) had little effect on species assemblage. Restoration included tree planting in 1993–1995 (549–1078 trees/ha). In some areas herbicide application and prescribed burns were undertaken to control scrub. Approximately 25% of the restoration area was left as unmanaged (control) strips.

A total of 1,456 amphibians were recorded (average density: 0.025 m<sup>2</sup>). Cricket frog <em>Fejervarya limnocharis</em> was the most common species (62%), followed by ornate narrow-mouthed frog <em>Microhyla ornate</em> and spot-legged treefrog <em>Polypedates megacephalus</em>. These three species accounted for 97% of the relative frequency and abundance. Abundance varied with habitat type and within ponds was positively correlated with vegetation cover. From December 2002 to April 2003, a concrete pond was demolished, the hole filled with soil and replanted to restore a 0.5 ha semi-natural permanent wetland. Amphibians were monitored by visual survey within six habitat areas. Surveys were undertaken twice a month from May 2003 to April 2004.</p><p> </p>",

Spring peeper <em>Pseudacris crucifer</em> colonized and bred in one pond and American toad <em>Bufo americanus</em> visited but did not breed in two ponds. Reproductive success varied between ponds for wood frogs (0.2–48.4 juveniles/egg mass) and spotted salamanders (1.8–5.4). Metamorphosis of these species was only completed in one pothole before drying. In 1997, two ponds were excavated within the original wetland (350 and 600 m<sup>2</sup>) and one dry detention basin was converted to a pond (900 m<sup>2</sup>). Approximately 200 small potholes (0.3–110 m<sup>2</sup>) were also created. Amphibians were monitored in the three ponds in March–October using enclosure drift-fencing. Pitfall traps were installed in pairs every 10 m either side of fences (9–18 pairs/pond). Eggs were counted within ponds and 50 potholes.</p><p> </p>",

Species richness was significantly higher in restored compared to non-restored (8 vs 5–6) wetlands and similar to natural (7–8) wetlands. Abundance was significantly higher in restored compared to non-restored wetlands one year (27 vs 10) but not four years after restoration (18 vs 17). Abundance was highest in natural wetlands (28–35). Species assemblages differed between wetland types. Overall, five species of tadpole were found in restored wetlands (mainly 1/wetland) compared to none in non-restored sites. Natural wetlands contained six species (mainly 1/wetland). Restoration within a failed residential development site involved plugging canal systems to restore previous water levels. Permanent ponds and ephemeral wetlands were created. There were two areas, restored either one or four years previously, each with three replicates of three wetland types: restored, non-restored and natural. Amphibians were monitored during six call surveys in May–September and monthly dip-netting in June–August 2008.</p><p> </p>",
