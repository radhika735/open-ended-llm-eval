The level of restrictions on human activities, including fishing, within such areas varies. Some areas have multiple users and may previously have been a source of food and income for fishers. Including fishers in the groups that set out the design and management of protected areas may improve compliance and help to create more effective management zones (Weigel <em>et al</em>. 2014)</p>\r\n<p>Weigel J., Mannle K.O., Bennett N.J., Carter E., Westlund L., Burgener V., Hoffman Z., Da Silva A.S., Kane E.A., Sanders J., Piante C., Wagiman S. &amp; Hellman A.
