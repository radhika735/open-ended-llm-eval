The similarity of reptile communities in cultivated areas, undegraded forest and degraded forest was higher in the site with hedges than in the site without hedges (result reported as a dissimilarity index). Nine species were found in cultivated areas with hedges (1–19 individuals) that were not found in cultivated areas with no hedges, whereas the opposite was true for only two species (1–3 individuals). Two sites were selected that contained undegraded forest, degraded forest and cultivated areas. In one site, hedges (2 m high, containing non-native <em>Opuntia</em> spp. and native vegetation e.g. <em>Euphorbia stenoclada</em>) surrounded cultivated areas and bordered degraded forest. The other site had no hedges. Eight 100 m transects were established in each habitat, and all reptile species were recorded within 1.5 m of the transect line (10 surveys in February–April 2012). In cultivated areas transects followed field boundaries with or without hedging.</p>",
