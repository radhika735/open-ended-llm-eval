Adding browse to food in boxes more than doubled (to 79%) the percentage of observation periods when at least one lemur was active. It also increased the percentage of active behaviours during that period from 4% of observations to 13% of observations. Spatially separating the four boxes reduced the amount of food that lemurs stole from other animals in the mixed enclosure by half (0.2% of observations to 0.1% of observations). The lemurs were presented with four treatments: food was added to four open boxes placed together and browse scattered on the floor of the enclosure; food scattered in the browse and added to boxes placed together; food added to boxes placed apart and browse scattered on the floor; food scattered in the browse and added to boxes placed apart. A group of eight lemurs, living in a mixed enclosure with hyrax and porcupine, were scanned every 60 seconds for two hours per day over six days and behaviours recorded. Boxes were given to the lemurs every day, with a different treatment given each day.    (CJ)</p><p> </p>",
