        "background_definitions": "<p class=\"Background\">Well-fed animals are likely to be in better physical condition than those with too little food: having greater muscle mass and larger fat supplies to help them survive lean periods. However, it is worth noting that species that forage in groups can have dominance hierarchies, which alter the relationship between weight and fitness. For example Gentle and Gosler (2001) found that, amongst great tits Parus major in Oxfordshire, England, more dominant birds had a lower mass than subdominants, particularly when perceived predation risk was high. Birds with lower masses are better able to take off and therefore escape predators than heavier birds (Krams 2002). However, because of their dominance, they were able to usurp other birds from food resources when hungry. Care should therefore be taken when interpreting results which do not directly examine survival.</p>\r\n<p>Krams, I.

There was no such effect in male skuas (average loss of 2.1% of body weight for 27 fed males vs. 5.5% for 27 controls) or if females raising single chicks were included in results (loss of 6.9% of body weight for 27 fed pairs vs. 4.5% for 27 controls). Supplementary food consisted of 25-100 g of fish provided to adults every other day, corresponding to approximately 20% of a chick’s daily energy needs. This study also includes the impact of feeding on chick growth and survival, see ‘Provide supplementary food to increase reproductive success’.</p><p> </p>",
