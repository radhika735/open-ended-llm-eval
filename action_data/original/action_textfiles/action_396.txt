        "background_definitions": "<p class=\"Background\">As well as direct predation on adults (see previous section), predators can have a devastating impact on bird populations through predating eggs and chicks too young to defend themselves or run away. Species ranging from hedgehogs to pigs to other birds can all affect bird populations in this way and in many cases it is not desirable or practical to remove these species. Therefore the use of barriers and cages to prevent predators from attacking nests is widespread.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">These can take the form of barriers or cages around individual nests, fences around groups of nests or suitable nesting areas, or repellents to either disguise the presence of eggs or discourage predators from approaching. We found one systematic review (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2010) which compares these approaches and also investigates potential adverse effects of nest protection.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">As in the section on predator removal, several studies perform experiments using artificial nests: either man-made or genuine nests that have been filled with false or real eggs (normally from quail Corturnix spp.) and placed in experimental areas to estimate predation rates.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

Individual barriers appeared to be slightly (non-significantly) more effective than fences, but some studies found that they increased predation on adults (see ‘Can nest protection increase predation of adult and chick waders?’).</p><p> </p>",
