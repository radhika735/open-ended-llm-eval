        "background_definitions": "<p>The process of fish being lifted out of the water in fishing nets and on to a vessel for sorting can create extreme stress (Ashley 2006). In trawl nets there is also an increased likelihood of crush or puncture injuries under the weight of the catch. In addition, depending on the duration of time exposed during the catch sorting process , fish survival is decreased, not only due to factors such as oxygen deprivation, but also to the drying out of the fishes’ protective layer. Using different methods to move and sort fish (e.g. using water) may help improve the survival of discarded fish that after sorting are returned to the sea, by minimising air exposure and overall damage, including disruption to their mucus layer and scales (Hürlimann <em>et al. </em>2014). One potential sorting method to reduce discard mortality, using a water-filled sorting tray instead of a conventional dry tray, led to fewer deaths of discarded fish during longer sorting times (Broadhurst <em>et al</em>. 2008).</p>\r\n<p>For related interventions, see <a href=\"../../data/index?category_id=483\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>‘Handling of catch’</em></a>.</p>\r\n<p>Ashley P.J.
