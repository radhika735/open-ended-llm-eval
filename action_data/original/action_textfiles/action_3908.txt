Across two remnant prairie reserves (320 and 1,800 ha) and surrounding land, 28 management units (10–167 ha) were managed consistently for ≥4 years. Six units were lightly grazed on rotation (1 cow-calf pair/4 ha). Ten units were burned during autumn or spring every 1–6 years. Twelve units were burned and grazed. From June–August 2004–2005, butterflies were surveyed for 30 minutes twice/year at 69 sites (50 × 50 m, &gt;150 m apart) across the 28 units.</p>",
