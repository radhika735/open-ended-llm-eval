Push-pull systems can also be designed to suppress weeds at the same time as controlling pests.

Damage to maize plants by cereal stem borers (Lepidoptera) was lower in push-pull cropping systems (0.4-6.7% plants damaged/plot) than in maize-bean intercrop (11-18% plants) and maize monoculture (10-28%) controls at 12 weeks after planting. Maize yields were higher in push-pull systems (4.6-5.6 t/ha) than intercropped (2.6-3.1 t/ha) and monoculture (2.8-3.5 t/ha) controls. Economic benefits were also greater in the push-pull system (US$639-1,532/ha) than in intercropped (US$45-129/ha) and monoculture controls (US$-176/ha loss to a US$91/ha gain). Push-pull systems of maize and beans provided similar weed and stem borer control, as well as similar yields and benefits, to push-pull systems of maize only. The push-pull systems comprised silverleaf desmodium <em>Desmodium uncinatum</em> grown between rows of maize or rows of mixed maize and beans. Three rows of Napier grass <em>Pennisetum purpureum</em> were planted around the plots. Treatments were replicated four times at two sites in 6 x 6 m plots.</p>",

Mortality caused by other factors (such a microbial disease) was similar between the push-pull system (range of 13.0-15.2% larvae and pupae killed) and the monoculture (9.6-11.4%). Similar proportions of stem borer eggs were parasitised in the push-pull and monoculture systems (21 vs. 18-25% eggs parasitised). Push-pull and monoculture treatments were tested in 40 x 40 m plots. Push-pull plots contained silverleaf desmodium <em>Desmodium uncinatum</em> between rows of maize and Napier grass <em>Pennisetum purpureum</em> trap crops around plot margins (spaced 1 m from the crop). Treatments were replicated four times at each site. Stem borer eggs, larvae and pupae were sampled from 10 maize plants in each of four 15 x 15 m areas/plot. Samples were assessed for parasitism by parasitoid wasps (Hymenoptera) in a laboratory. A separate laboratory study found that the common parasitoid wasp <em>Cotesia sesamiae</em> was attracted to silverleaf desmodium flowers.</p>",

Stem borer (Noctuidae and Crambidae) larvae densities were low, but fewer occurred in the push-pull system (0.05 borers/plants) than control (0.18 borers/plant) in 2005. Numbers were similar between treatments (0.3-0.4 borers/plant) in 2004. Cob damage was also similar between push-pull (0.3-0.7% cob surface damaged) and control (0.4-0.8%) systems in both years. Stem tunnelling by stem borers was scarcer in the push-pull (0.8%) than control (1.9%) system in 2005, but similar in 2004 (0.3 vs. 0.5%). Yield was similar between the push-pull (2.4-3.3 t/ha) and control (2.0-4.6 t/ha) systems in both years. The push-pull system used greenleaf desmodium <em>Desmodium intortum</em> between maize rows and three rows of Napier grass <em>Pennisetum purpureum</em> (of 50 cm width) along plot margins. The control comprised maize only. The push-pull system and control were tested at seven sites (0.5 ha) in 0.25 ha plots each.
