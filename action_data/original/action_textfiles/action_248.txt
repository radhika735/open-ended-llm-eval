        "background_definitions": "<p class=\"Background\">Predation by birds at aquaculture facilities (e.g. fish ponds, raceways and shellfish farms) can cause significant commercial loss (Draulans 1987). With increasing protective wildlife legislation, demand for non-lethal, environmentally safe methods of bird exclusion and scaring have increased. Most fish farmers now rely primarily on non-lethal techniques to accomplish control (i.e. to reduce abundance or exclude fish-eating birds in and around the vicinity of fish farms). Control efforts may be optimized by compiling evidence relating to deterrent or exclusion device efficacy, taking into account costs, practicality of use and the possibility of developing integrated strategies (i.e. combining more than one deterrent method). Avian deterrents can be categorised as auditory, visual, chemical, exclusion, habitat modification and lethal (Bishop et al. 2003). Lethal deterrents are not considered here (except where, very rarely, used as part of an integrated approach).</p>\r\n<p>Bishop, J., McKay, H., Parrott, D. &amp; Allan, J.

String barriers were ropes laid parallel across the water, 0.3 to 2 m apart; netting had 10 cm mesh size; and stumble ropes were also tested.

Effects on fish stocks are not reported. In 1981 nylon lines (forming 20 x 20 m squares) were placed over a 5 ha pond; in winter 1981-1982, 10 x 10 m squares were tested, and four ponds fitted with 20 x 20 m squares, with an irregular pattern over another; in 1983 over a 5 ha pond, ropes were stretched downwards from 10 m towers in the pond centre to the sides, with spacing between lines of 14-15 m).

However, the largest numbers of entangled (dead) birds were found in two, thin monofilament net types, even though they had small mesh sizes (35 birds equivalent to 34/ha and 30 birds, equivalent to 25/ha). Ponds with slack, horizontal nets also had fewer dead birds, probably because they were more visible (flapping in the wind) than tight-strung nets. Entrapment within some ponds was attributed to poor net maintenance (e.g. holes/tears). A total of 327 dead (entangled) and 4,575 live birds (under nets) of 31 species were recorded.</p><p> </p>",
