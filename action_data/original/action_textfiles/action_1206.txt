        "background_definitions": "<p class=\"Background\">Livestock grazing changes the habitat indirectly by changing soil properties and directly by the removal of vegetation. High grazing pressure may change plant diversity mainly by decreasing the abundance of palatable herbaceous species. It can also cause degradation of forest understory and reduce tree regeneration. Moderate grazing has less negative effects and may increasing shrubby vegetation height. Removing livestock grazing from forests may increase species diversity (Rook <em>et al. </em>2004). Other studies that aim to reduce the detrimental effects of grazing are discussed in ‘Use wire fences within grazing areas to exclude livestock from specific forest sections'.</p>\r\n<p class=\"References\">Rook, A.

The average mortality over two years of five shrub species was higher in grazed (7.7-11.7%) than in ungrazed plots (4.5%). The number of tree seedlings (&lt;0.5 m height) was similar in grazed (1.9-5.2 seedlings/m<sup>2</sup>) and ungrazed plots (5.8 seedlings/m<sup>2</sup>). Mortality of five selected shrub species: <em>Lippia microphylla, Croton rhamnifolius, Calliandra depauperata, Cordia leucocephala </em>and<em> Bauhinia cheilantha</em>, was calculated for 1980-1982 and for 1982-1984. Mortality data were collected in 6-10 plots (20 × 5 m) in each of three grazed (0.150, 0.100 and 0.075 cattle/ha) and one ungrazed treatment area (40-100 ha). Density of tree seedlings was determined annually in 1979-1984 in five quadrats (2 x 0.5 m) in each plot.</p><p> </p>",
