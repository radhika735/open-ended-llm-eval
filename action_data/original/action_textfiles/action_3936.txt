            "paragraph_text": "<p>A site comparison study in 2009 in four forest fragments in São Paulo, Brazil (Sant’Anna et al. 2014) found that an old restored forest had fewer species and a lower diversity of fruit-feeding butterflies (Nymphalidae) than younger restored forests, but the proportion of forest species and overall species community at the older site was the most similar to a remnant forest. A 54-year-old restored forest had fewer species (25) and lower diversity of butterflies than 11–22-year-old restored forests (29–35 species) or remnant forest (28 species; diversity data presented as model results). However, the proportion of forest species in the 54-year-old forest (79% of individuals; 72% of species) was higher than in the younger forests (36–46% of individuals; 60–65% of species), and more similar to the remnant forest (92% of individuals; 89% of species). The species community in the old forest was most similar to the remnant forest (data presented as model results). In 1955, 1987 and 1998, three areas of forest (30–50 ha) were restored using seedlings of &gt;70 native tree species and some non-native species. From January–April 2009, butterflies were surveyed in three plots (200 m apart) in each restored forest, and in a 245-ha remnant forest. At each plot, five baited Van Someren-Rydon traps were placed 30 m apart. Traps were left open for 8 days/month. Every 48 hours, butterflies were identified and released, and bait was replaced. Butterfly species were classified according to habitat preference as “forest”, “edge” or “grassland”.</p>",

Butterfly species richness was higher at sites which had been regenerating naturally for &gt;5 years (5–13 years: 10–18 species; 20–60 years: 12–22 species) than at newly regenerating sites (&lt;3 years: 6–7 species). However, species richness in all regenerating sites was lower than in isolated (20–40 species) or intact (48–66 species) primary rainforest. In August 2003, twenty-one open plots (two × 100 m<sup>2</sup> each) on the edge of five types of forest stand (2,772–4,917 m<sup>2</sup>) were selected. Six plots were next to old regenerating forest, where 20–60 years had passed since the land was last cultivated; three were next to young regenerating forest where 5–13 years had passed since cultivation; three were next to newly regenerating forest where one year had passed since cultivation; six were next to isolated primary forest stands, and three were next to intact primary forest. Butterflies were surveyed twice/plot in August 2003, September 2003, January 2005 and June 2006.</p>",

In young secondary forest, the species richness of both geometrid (90 species) and arctiine (96 species) moths was higher than in oil palm plantations (geometrids: 31; arctiines: 35 species), but not significantly different to old-growth forest (geometrids: 113; arctiines: 81 species). The abundance of geometrid moths was higher in secondary forest (314 individuals) than in oil palm (135 individuals), but lower than in old-growth forest (570 individuals). The abundance of arctiine moths was similar between habitat types (secondary forest: 668; oil palm: 529; old-growth forest: 581 individuals). Species composition was different in the three habitats (see paper for details). Fifteen sites, &gt;200 m apart, were selected: five 3–10-year-old secondary forests; five even-aged oil palm plantations (&gt;1 ha); and five old-growth primary or 80-year-old secondary forests. From February–July 2013, moths were sampled overnight once/month, using an 8 W, UV-emitting funnel trap installed 1–2 m above ground at up to three sites/night in different habitats.</p>",

The number of butterfly species in regenerating (69 species) and replanted (47–102 species) forest was not significantly different from in pastures (52–59 species) or remnant forest (57–79 species). However, out of 213 butterfly species recorded, 33 were found only on restored sites (regenerating or replanted), compared to 18 species unique to pastures and 66 species unique to remnant forests. Eight sites, all &gt;40 ha, were studied: one former pasture ungrazed for 14 years and naturally regenerating from the surrounding remnant forest, two former pastures planted with 15–20 species of native trees 12–14 years before the study, two grazed open pastures, and three intact forest remnants. In January, March and April 2011, butterflies were sampled once/month. Four baited butterfly traps were placed 1–2 m above ground, 50 m apart, in the centre of each plot, for three consecutive days/month, and checked daily. In addition, butterflies were counted on two 1-hour transects/month at each site.</p>",
