One statutory closure reduced lethal strandings of both loggerhead and Kemp’s ridley turtles for the 6–8-week duration of the closure compared to when it is not in effect (data reported as model outputs). When the second statutory closure was in effect, 6–8 Kemp’s ridley turtles were stranded inside the closed area, compared to the 13 turtles in the year prior to the closure taking effect (results were not statistically tested). Two statutory closures were implemented to restrict shrimp trawling within designated distances of Texas shores. The first excluded shrimping from all Texan Gulf of Mexico shores to 200 nm in 15 May–15 July each year (dates variable based on shrimp stocks; effective from 1981, updated in 1990). The second prohibited shrimp fishing within five miles of Padre Island on the south Texas coast from 1 December–15 July, effective from December 2000. Data from the Sea Turtle Stranding and Salvage Network (1980–2000) were used to analyse the effect of closures. Incidental turtle catch, captive-reared/head-started turtles and turtles below &lt;10 cm were excluded from analysis.</p>",

Results were not statistically tested. In the first year after the fishery re-opened with a turtle catch limit, nine loggerhead turtles (0.004–0.049 turtles/1,000 hooks) were caught, but in the second year the catch limit of 17 turtles (0.013–0.044 turtles/1000 hooks) was reached and the fishery was closed for the rest of the year. In the third year, 12 turtles were caught (0.0–0.028 turtles/1,000 hooks). In late 2004, the fishery re-opened after a two-year shut down due the high number of loggerhead turtle catch levels. After re-opening, a catch limit of 17 turtles/year was established, after which the fishery would close for the rest of the year. In January–March 2005–2007, line deployments (2005: 520; 2006: 842; 2007: 797), hooks put out (2005: 429,580; 2006: 670,914; 2007: 689,486), and loggerhead turtle interactions were monitored. In January–March 2007, fishers were also provided daily information in electronic and paper format from a ‘TurtleWatch’ tool that recommended areas to avoid to reduce turtle interactions (see original paper).</p>",

The effect of different aspects of the management programme cannot be separated. Turtles were more abundant in areas with CBM (321 individuals) than in areas without CBM (33 individuals). For<em> Podocnemis sextuberculata</em>, abundance was higher in areas with CBM (14 individuals/1,000 m<sup>2</sup> netting/12 hours) than in areas without (2 individuals/1,000 m<sup>2</sup> netting/12 hours), and turtle biomass was also greater (with CBM: 20 kg/1,000 m<sup>2</sup> netting/12 hours; no CBM: 3 kg/1,000 m<sup>2</sup> netting/12 hours). The fishing agreement that formed the CBM programme had been in place for 20–30 years. While 13 communities in the area were a part of the fishing agreement, only two implemented the agreement. Turtle numbers were sampled at 14 sites (7 with CBM; 7 without CBM) in August–October 2009 using gill nets (15 nets/site; 215 m<sup>2</sup> nets; 3 each of 5 mesh sizes) with help from local fishers.</p>",
