However, a higher turnover in species was found between unplanted margins than between planted margins (data reported as beta-diversity). <strong>Methods:</strong> In each of eight tomato fields, plants were sampled in each of two field margins (one with flower strips, one without, 3 x 25 m each), in five 1 x 1 m quadrats/field margin, in early August.</p><p> </p>",

Six species persisted for three years. <strong>Implementation options:</strong> Over the two years that followed planting, a higher percentage of species persisted in plots that were planted with two to four times as much seed (2x–4x) as the plots that were planted with the least seed (1x: 17–60%; 2x: 33–74%; 4x: 35–77%), but there was not a significant difference between the plots with 2x and 4x. The amount of seed planted had a significant effect on the percentage cover of plants, but it was not clear which treatments were significantly different from one another (data reported as log aggregate forb cover). <strong>Methods: </strong>Nine plots (1 x 8 m) were sown with the seeds of nine flower species in each of six hedgerows.</p><p> </p>",

A lower density of seedlings emerged after no tillage, compared to shallow tillage, in <em>Coriandrum sativum</em> in 2011 (16 vs 314 plants/m<sup>2</sup>), but not in 2012 (0 vs 2).
