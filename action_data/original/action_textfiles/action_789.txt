A number of methods can be used to reduce the depth or intensity of ploughing, such as layered cultivation, non-inversion tillage and conservation tillage. Such have been found to be beneficial for some farmland biodiversity (Holland &amp; Luff 2000).</p>\r\n<p class=\"References\">Holland J.M. &amp; Luff M.L.
