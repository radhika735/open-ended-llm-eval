Payments may be offered by Governments or inter-Governmental schemes to compensate landowners for these costs, and encourage more wildlife-friendly habitat management and creation on private land. In Europe, agri-environment schemes (AES) are an integral part of the European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and Member States devise their own AES prescriptions to suit their agricultural economies and environmental contexts. In the United States, these are often called conservation incentive payments and are mostly implemented through the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (known as the Farm Bill, for example Kleintjes Neff &amp; Mader 2013). Most schemes focus on reducing the intensity of farm management, or creating other habitats within the farmed landscape, but payments may also be made for managing other habitats such as woodland (in the USA often called agroforestry) or heathland on private land. As well as attempting to provide more favourable habitat, coordinated planning of the schemes may be important to ensure that a variety of habitats are created across the farmed landscape throughout the year.</p>\r\n<p>This intervention includes any studies where landowners were paid to carry out an action in any habitat, but excludes studies testing AES options which were conducted outside of an AES (e.g. on research farms or nature reserves). Since AES represent many different specific interventions relevant to conservation, where a study’s results can be clearly assigned to a specific intervention, the study is also summarized in the appropriate section. This section, meanwhile, includes evidence about the success of agri-environment or conservation incentive policies overall.</p>\r\n<p><sup>Kleintjes Neff P. &amp; Mader E.

In spring 2009, fields (average 6.8 ha) on eight farms enrolled in a set-aside program were pre-treated with glyphosate and seeded with a mix of six grasses and 11 forbs using a no-till seed drill. They were compared with two native dry sand prairies in a powerline right-of-way, managed to suppress woody vegetation. From May–August 2009–2012, butterflies were surveyed 2–4 times/year on one 200-m transect/farm. In 2013–2014, just four farms and the two native prairies were surveyed twice/year.</p>",

The abundance of butterflies on farms with more land managed under AES was higher than on farms with less land managed under AES, but there was no difference in butterfly species richness (data presented as model results). A total of 133 farms (17–34 ha, 13–91% arable crops) were managed with “Ecological Compensation Areas” under AES. Management included extensive and low-input meadows with reduced fertilizer and later cutting dates, and the presence of trees, hedgerows and wildflower patches. From May–September 2009–2011, butterflies were surveyed six times on 10–38 transects/farm, totalling 2,500 m/farm. Each transect ran diagonally through a single crop or habitat type, with all available crops and habitats represented. All visits to a farm were completed in a single year, and the species richness was summed across all visits. Total abundance of butterflies was calculated from the number recorded in each habitat, and the availability of each habitat across the farm. Ecological Compensation Areas on each farm were mapped between May and August.</p>",

Eastern eggar moth caterpillars were most often found in patches 5–10 years after the last coppice, and their abundance peaked after 5–7 years (data presented as model results). Scarce fritillary caterpillars were most often found in patches 10–12 years after the last coppice, and their abundance peaked after 12–15 years (data presented as model results). Coppicing commenced in 2005 at nine sites (23–310 ha), and in 2012 at a tenth site (80 ha) under a Government-funded scheme. From 2000–2016, caterpillars of Eastern eggar moth and scarce fritillary were surveyed in early May and late July–early August, respectively, by counting their silk-woven webs, in both coppiced and non-coppiced areas at each site. Each site was surveyed 0–5 times before coppicing (2000–2004) and 1–12 times after coppicing (2005–2016).</p>",
