It develops as a result of an imbalance of vitamin D3, phosphorous or calcium. Amphibians cannot process calcium without vitamin D, which is activated by ultraviolet light. If the correct lighting is not provided, animals can suffer from brittle or deformed bones. Health problems may affect reproduction in captive animals.</span></p>",

Two clutches were laid from two females in the background UV group (number eggs laid: 118), and four clutches from seven females in the UV boost group (184). There was no statistically significant effect of UV treatment on clutch size (background UV: 59; UV boost: 74). Frogs given the UV boost had significantly more fungal colony forming units (CFU’s) in comparison to frogs that were not UV-boosted (background UV: 2-3 CFU’s; pre-UV boost: 2 CFU’s; post-UV boost: 13 CFU’s). Forty frogs were used in four treatment groups, which started three months after their metamorphosis: background UV, 5% calcium diet; background UV, 10% calcium diet; background UV with UV boost, 5% calcium diet; background UV with UV boost, 10% calcium diet. Frogs receiving the “UV boost” treatment were put under a 300-watt Osram™ Ultra Vitalux mercury vapour sun lamp suspended 40cm above the base of the tank for 20 minutes. Breeding trials were conducted immediately after the UV boost trials.</p>",
