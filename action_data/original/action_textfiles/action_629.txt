The following section includes studies describing the overall effects of release projects. Studies that compare specific release techniques are described elsewhere (‘Use holding pens at release sites’, ‘Use ‘anti-predator training’ to improve survival after release’ etc).</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

Conservation measures are also discussed in: ‘Release captive-bred individuals’, ‘Artificially incubate or hand-rear birds in captivity’, ‘Foster eggs or chicks with wild conspecifics and ‘Use education programmes and local engagement to help reduce pressures on species’. For releases, birds were kept in large outdoor aviaries at the release site and released when either 18 or 30 months old. Food was placed outside aviaries twice daily for 15 days after release and once daily for another 15 days. At least ten of 12 birds released survived for at least a year and integrated into wild groups five days to nine months after release. At least three birds scouted nest holes and one nested and fledged two chicks. The programme is estimated to have cost US$2,800 for each bird.<strong> </strong></p><p> </p>",

In 1997, five birds died within five days of release, however all birds released in 1998 survived at least ten weeks. Mortality in 1998 may have been affected by Hurricane Georges hitting the release site in September 1998. Birds were held in training cages at the release site for a quarantine period of at least 40 days before release. This study is also discussed in ‘Use ‘flying training’ before release’.</p><p> </p>",

First-year survival ranged from 60% to 90% and survival was higher for birds released in larger groups and in areas with birds already present. Pairs formed at all three sites, with at least four chicks fledged at the Peruvian site. Birds began to breed at four to seven years old. Birds were not raised in isolation from humans and did not show fear of humans after release. Five former pets released all survived for at least two years, but they appeared to socialise less with other released macaws. At the two Costa Rican sites, birds were kept in aviaries at the release sites for at least six months, there was little pre-release training at the Peruvian site.</p><p> </p>",
