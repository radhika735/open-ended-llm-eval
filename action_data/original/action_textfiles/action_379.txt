Two introduced predators (small Indian mongoose <em>Herpestes auropunctatus</em> and feral cat <em>Felis catus</em>) were trapped near some wild nests and at all artificial nestboxes. The authors provide no data on the numbers of predators trapped or experimental data on the effects of their removal.</p><p> </p>",
