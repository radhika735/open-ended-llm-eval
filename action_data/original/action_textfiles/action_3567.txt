        "background_definitions": "<p>Abandoned, lost or otherwise discarded fishing gear (or ‘ghost’ gear) is a major threat to aquatic reptiles. Sea turtles in particular are at risk of becoming entangled in ‘ghost’ gear, such as nets, lines and ropes resulting in injury or death (Stelfox <em>et al.</em> 2016). Recovering derelict fishing gear from marine and freshwater environments may reduce the risk of mammal entanglement. However, derelict gear may be difficult to locate and retrieve. Specialist techniques may be required, such as acoustic sonar surveys, aerial surveys, or underwater diver and camera surveys (Drinkwin 2018).</p>\r\n<p>For studies on the avoidance of losing or discarding gear see <a href=\"../../actions/3566\"><em>Prevent the loss and discard of fishing gear and related debris</em></a>.
