All data presented as statistical model results. In the Pacific, by-catch of leatherback <em>Dermochelys coriacea</em> and loggerhead <em>Caretta caretta </em>turtles was not affected by the number of hooks between floats. In the Atlantic, the chance of catching leatherback turtles was lower with fewer hooks between floats, whereas loggerheads were less likely to be caught when there were fewer (&lt;3 hooks) or more (&gt;5 hooks) hooks between floats (see paper for details).  Pelagic Observer Program data from (1992–2015) was used to determine the number of turtles caught/1,000 hooks, and variation in the number of hooks between floats (majority were 3–5 or 4–5 hooks/float) was used to test its effect on bycatch.</p>",
