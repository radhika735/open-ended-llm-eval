However, meadows mown once/year had a higher abundance of both adults and caterpillars than abandoned, unmown meadows (adults: 6–33; caterpillars: 1–2 individuals/transect). Four meadows at the edge of oak-hornbeam forests and four open meadows were mown once/year in late June or July. Four further meadows were mown twice/year in late May–early June and from late July–September, and four abandoned meadows had not been mown for 15 years.
