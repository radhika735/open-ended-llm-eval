        "background_definitions": "<p><strong>Definition:</strong> ‘Crevice habitats’ are depressions with a length to width ratio &gt;3:1 and depth &gt;50 mm (modified from “Crevices” in Strain <em>et al.</em> 2018).</p>\r\n<p>Crevice habitats provide organisms refuge from predation in subtidal rocky habitats (Nelson &amp; Vance 1979). The size and density of crevices is likely to affect the size, abundance and variety of organisms that can use them. Small crevices can provide refuge for small-bodied organisms but may exclude larger organisms, limit their growth and get rapidly filled-up (Firth <em>et al.</em> 2020). Large crevices can be used by larger-bodied organisms but may not provide sufficient refuge from predators for smaller organisms. By default, crevices contain shaded surfaces, which can be associated with the presence of non-native species (Dafforn 2017).</p>\r\n<p>Crevices are sometimes present on marine artificial structures such as cable mattresses (Lacey &amp; Hayes 2020) but are often absent from other types of structures. Crevices sometimes form on structures through erosion, but are often filled or repaired during maintenance works (Moreira <em>et al.</em> 2007). Crevice habitats can be created on subtidal artificial structures by adding or removing material, either during construction or retrospectively.</p>\r\n<p>There are bodies of literature investigating the effects of creating crevice habitats on artificial reefs (e.g. Briones-Fourzán <em>et al.</em> 2007) and the use of crevice units to sample small/cryptic fauna (e.g. Baronia &amp; Bucher 2008). These studies are not included in this synopsis, which focusses on <em>in situ</em> conservation actions to enhance the biodiversity of structures that are engineered to fulfil a primary function other than providing artificial habitats.</p>\r\n<p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href=\"../../actions/3446\"><em>Create natural rock reef topography on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3455\"><em>Create pit habitats (1–50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3434\"><em>Create hole habitats (&gt;50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3448\"><em>Create groove habitats (1–50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3436\"><em>Create small adjoining cavities or ‘swimthrough’ habitats (≤100 mm) on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3456\"><em>Create large adjoining cavities or ‘swimthrough’ habitats (&gt;100 mm) on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>;<a href=\"../../actions/3452\"><em> Create groove habitats </em>and<em> small protrusions, ridges or ledges (1–50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>.</p>\r\n<p><sup>Baronio M. de A. &amp; Bucher D.J.
