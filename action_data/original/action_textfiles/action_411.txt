        "background_definitions": "<p class=\"Background\">If populations are reduced to extremely low levels and continue to be threatened by nest predation, then extremely intensive monitoring can be used to ‘guard nests’ and protect nests from predators through direct interference. Due to the intensive nature of this work it is only likely to be viable if there are volunteers to do it, and the population being monitored is very small.  Nest guarding can be used as a response to range of threats and is therefore discussed in ‘General responses to small/declining populations’.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",
