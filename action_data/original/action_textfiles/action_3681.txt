During the four years of a community turtle monitoring project, no egg collection (122 nests were laid/year on average) or hunting of female turtles was recorded. The authors reported that prior to the turtle monitoring project beginning, egg collection and hunting of adult female turtles was common within the local fishing community. Following the formation of two fishing village committees to manage local fishing resources and implement regulations, the committees created a turtle sanctuary around the north-east of the island to protect turtle breeding and feeding grounds. Three nesting beaches were monitored nightly for several months/year by 15 local turtle monitors supervised by a marine biologist in January–July 2003–2007.</p>",

The effect of different aspects of the management programme cannot be separated. Overall, turtles (including <em>Podocnemis</em> <em>sextuberculata</em>, <em>Podocnemis unifilis</em> and <em>Podocnemis </em><em>expansa</em>) were more abundant in areas with CBM (321 individuals) than in areas without CBM (33 individuals). <em>Podocnemis sextuberculata</em> abundance and biomass was higher in areas with CBM (14 individuals and 20 kg biomass/1,000 m<sup>2</sup> netting/12 hours) than in areas without (2 individuals and 3 kg  biomass/1,000 m<sup>2</sup> netting/12 hours; data of other species not provided). The fishing agreement that formed the CBM programme had been in place for 20–30 years. While 13 communities in the area were a part of the fishing agreement, only two implemented the agreement. Turtle numbers were sampled at 14 sites (7 with CBM; 7 without CBM) in August–October 2009 using gill nets (15 nets/site; 215 m<sup>2</sup> nets; 3 each of 5 mesh sizes) with help from local fishers.</p>",

Results were not statistically tested.

Egg collection rates were also lower under Indigenous management (Indigenous management: 1,416 eggs harvested/year; external management: 2,359 eggs harvested/year). Saltwater crocodile eggs were collected and incubated as part of a regional government-led sustainable harvest initiative. In 1989–1997 an external management company ran the programme. In 1998–2015 it was run by a local Indigenous management company. In 1996–1997 eggs were harvested by the external company and incubated by the Indigenous management company. There was no harvest in 2007–2008. Annual quotas were 2,700–3,000 eggs/year (total limit of 70,000 eggs/year across the territory). Eggs were incubated at a constant temperature of 32°C and ≥99% humidity. Local workers were paid based on the number of eggs collected and hatchlings produced.</p>",
