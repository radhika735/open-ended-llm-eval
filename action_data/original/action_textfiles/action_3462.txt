        "background_definitions": "<p><strong>Definition:</strong> ‘Small protrusions’ are elevations with a length to width ratio ≤3:1 that protrude 1–50 mm from the substratum (modified from “Small elevations” in Strain <em>et al.</em> 2018).</p>\r\n<p>Small protrusions create vertical or horizontal (i.e. overhangs) relief in intertidal rocky habitats. They can provide organisms refuge from desiccation and temperature fluctuations during low tide (Williams &amp; Morrit 1995) and also shelter from predation or grazing (Wahl &amp; Hoppe 2002). Some species preferentially recruit to habitats with high vertical or horizontal relief (Harmelin-Vivien <em>et al.</em> 1995). The size and density of protrusions is likely to affect the size, abundance and variety of organisms that can use them. Small habitats can provide refuge for small-bodied organisms but may exclude larger organisms and limit their growth. Large habitats can be used by larger-bodied organisms but may not provide sufficient refuge from predators for smaller organisms. By default, horizontal protrusions (overhangs) create shaded and downward-facing surfaces, which can be associated with the presence of non-native species (Dafforn 2017).</p>\r\n<p>Protrusions are sometimes present on quarried boulders used in marine artificial structures (MacArthur <em>et al.</em> 2020) but are often absent from other types of structures. Small protrusions can be created on intertidal artificial structures by adding material, either during construction or retrospectively.</p>\r\n<p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href=\"../../actions/3466\"><em>Create textured surfaces (≤1 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3435\"><em>Create natural rocky reef topography on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3463\"><em>Create large protrusions (&gt;50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3464\"><em>Create small ridges or ledges (1–50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3465\"><em>Create large ridges or ledges (&gt;50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3474\"><em>Create groove habitats </em>and<em> small protrusions, ridges or ledges (1–50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>.</p>\r\n<p><sup>Dafforn K.A.

After 13 months, macroalgae and invertebrate species richness was higher on settlement plates with small protrusions (8 species/plate) than without (3/plate), while abundances were statistically similar (88 vs 178 individuals/plate). Community composition was similar on plates with and without protrusions (data reported as statistical model results). Settlement plates (200 × 200 mm) were moulded with and without small protrusions. Plates with protrusions were concrete with 36 cylindrical protrusions/plate with either regular (16 mm width, height and spacing) or variable (4–28 mm) arrangement. Plates without protrusions were granite fragments set in cement. Granite may be considered an environmentally-sensitive material compared with concrete (see “<em>Use environmentally-sensitive material on intertidal artificial structures</em>”). Eight of each design were randomly-arranged at both lowshore and highshore on each of two granite boulder seawalls in November–December 2009.

After 13 months, macroalgae and invertebrate species richness was higher on settlement plates with protrusions, grooves, ridges and pits than without at lowshore (13–23 vs 6–10 species/plate) and highshore (5–9 vs 2–3/plate). Richness was higher on plates with variable habitats than regular ones at lowshore (22–23 vs 13–16/plate), but not highshore (6–9 vs 5–6/plate). Abundances were higher on plates with added habitats than without in four of eight comparisons (9–833 vs 3–208 individuals/plate), while community composition differed in three of four comparisons (data reported as statistical model results). In all other comparisons, results were similar (abundances: 104–1,957 vs 49–1,162/plate). It is not clear whether these effects were the direct result of creating protrusions, grooves, ridges or pits. However, plate quarters with protrusions had similar richness (8 species/quarter) and abundances (88 individuals/quarter) to quarters with the other habitat types (6–11 species and 97–231 individuals/quarter). Settlement plates (400 × 400 mm) were moulded with and without small protrusions, along with grooves, small ridges and pits. Plates with added habitats were concrete. Each 200 × 200 mm quarter contained either 36 cylindrical protrusions, four-to-five grooves and ridges, 12 ridges or 36 pits. All habitats had either regular (16 mm width, depth/height and spacing) or variable (4–28 mm) arrangement. Plates without added habitats were granite fragments set in cement.
