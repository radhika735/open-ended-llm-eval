These must be able to allow chicks and adults to get in and out, but not predators and should be quick to install to minimise the chances of parents abandoning nests (see ‘Can nest protection increase nest abandonment?’).</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">Unfortunately, because each cage is over a nest, it is possible that predators will learn the association and that providing the exclosures will actually increase predation on either adults or chicks (see ‘Can nest protection increase predation of adult and chick waders?’)</p>\r\n<p>The effectiveness score for this intervention included a combined assessment of the evidence for <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"../../actions/397\">chicks of ground nesting seabirds</a></span>, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"../../actions/398\">chicks of waders</a></span>, <span>chicks of storks and ibises</span>, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"../../actions/400\">chicks of songbirds</a></span>.</p>",
