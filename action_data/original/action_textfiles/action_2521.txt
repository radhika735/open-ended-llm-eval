In 1999, six years after initial releases, the population was estimated at 263–301 bettongs, with 340 individuals born between 1995 and 1999. The population died out due to fox incursion in 1994, but was re-established with further releases. In 1990, a 1.6-m tall wire mesh fence (with an external overhang, an apron to prevent burrowing and two electrified wires) was erected to enclose a 12-km<sup>2</sup> peninsular, within which foxes <em>Vulpes vulpes</em> and cats <em>Felis catus </em>were eliminated by poisoning in 1991 and 1995, respectively. Outside the fence foxes were controlled by biannual aerial baiting with meat containing 1080 toxin, distributed at 10 baits/km<sup>2</sup> over 200 km<sup>2</sup>. From October 1993, an additional 200 baits/month were distributed along the fence and roads across the study area. Cats were controlled by trapping and poisoning in a 100 km<sup>2</sup> buffer zone. In May 1992 and September 1993, twenty-two wild-caught bettongs were transferred to an 8-ha <em>in-situ</em> captive-breeding pen. In September 1993 and October 1995, 20 wild-caught bettongs were translocated to range freely in the reserve. From 1993–1998, one hundred and fourteen captive-bred bettongs were released. Artificial warrens, supplementary food and water were provided in 1993, but not for later releases. Eighty released bettongs were radio-tagged. From 1991–1995, European rabbits <em>Oryctolagus cuniculus </em>were controlled within the fenced area using 1080 ‘one shot’ oats. Bettongs were monitored every three months using cage traps set over two consecutive nights, at both 100-m intervals along approximately 40 km of track, and at warrens used by radio-collared individuals.</p>",

At each of seven sites (88–500 ha), 50–129 captive-bred eastern barred bandicoots were released between 1990 and 1999. Combinations of regular predator control methods were employed (e.g. poisoning, shooting, destruction of red fox <em>Vulpes vulpes </em>dens) differed between the sites (1 site: no predator control; 1 site: 2 methods used; 2 sites: 3 methods used (including 1 site with partial fencing); 3 sites: 4 methods used (including 1 site with full predator-proof fencing). Bandicoot signs (fresh diggings and scats) were collected at 10 randomly distributed 5-m<sup>2 </sup>quadrats/site on two occasions in 2000–2001.</p>",

After release into a fenced enclosure where red foxes <em>Vulpes vulpes</em>, cats <em>Felis catus </em>and rabbits <em>Oryctolagus cuniculus </em>had been eradicated, greater stick-nest rats <em>Leporillus conditor</em>, burrowing bettongs <em>Bettongia lesueur</em>, western barred bandicoots <em>Perameles bougainville </em>and greater bilbies <em>Macrotis lagotis</em> were detected for eight years, increased their distribution within five years and reproduced within two years. Numbats <em>Myrmecobius fasciatus </em>were only detected for three years and did not produce a second generation. Burrowing bettongs released into a fenced enclosure with cats and rabbits but no foxes survived and increased their distribution over at least three years and produced a second generation within two years. Greater bilbies and burrowing bettongs released into an unfenced area with some predator management did not survive to produce a second generation or increase their distribution. In 1998–2005, five numbats, 106 greater stick-nest rats (6 captive-bred individuals), 30 burrowing bettongs, 12 western barred bandicoots and nine greater bilbies (all captive-bred) were released into a 14-km<sup>2</sup> invasive-species-free fenced area. Rabbits, cats and foxes were eradicated within the fenced area in 1999. All western barred bandicoots and greater bilbies, and some greater stick-nest rats (8 individuals) and burrowing bettongs (10 individuals) were put into a 10-ha holding pen before full release after a few months. All other animals were released directly into the larger fenced area. In 2004-2008, thirty-two greater bilbies and 15 burrowing bettongs were translocated to an unfenced area (200 km<sup>2</sup>) where invasive predators (cats and foxes) were managed with lethal controls and dingoes <em>Canis</em> <em>lupus</em> <em>dingo</em> were excluded by a fence on one side. In 2008, sixty-six burrowing bettongs were translocated to a 26 km<sup>2</sup> fenced area which contained small cat and rabbit populations as a result of previous eradication attempts. Between 2000 and 2010, animals were monitored using track counts, burrow monitoring and radio-tracking.</p>",

Open each action in the <strong>Pending</strong> tab in turn by clicking on the title. Start by reading all the summarised evidence we have found. Each action with evidence available will have:</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>a) <strong>Background section</strong>, describing the intervention;</li>\r\n<li>b) <strong>Key messages</strong>, providing an overview of the evidence;</li>\r\n<li>c) <strong>Supporting evidence,</strong> containing summaries of each study that tested the action. Clicking on the link beside the number will take you to the reference details.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong><em>Based on the evidence provided </em>please enter scores</strong> for the effectiveness, certainty and harms of the action, using a scale from 0-100. It is critical that your answers are based on information in the synopsis. Your expertise is invaluable for understanding and interpreting the evidence, but please do not base your assessments on your own personal knowledge or anecdotal evidence about an intervention.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>EFFECTIVENESS</strong>: The ‘effectiveness’ scale is from 0 (ineffective) to 100 (highly effective), and should reflect how good an intervention is at benefitting the conservation of terrestrial mammal species. This could be evaluated in a variety of different ways. For example, we could measure the increase in numbers of a population following the introduction of a specific intervention, the reduction in mortality or the establishment of a new population following translocation. We would like you to score according to what we know about whether the <em>ultimate objective</em> of the intervention is being achieved, i.e. whether the intervention leads to an increase in the conservation of terrestrial mammals. </p>\r\n<p><strong>CERTAINTY</strong>: The ‘certainty of evidence’ is a rating of how confident we can be about the effectiveness of an action, from 0 (no certainty; no useful evidence) to 100 (complete certainty; high quality evidence). To assess this, consider the quality of the evidence for the action. You should think about the number of studies, their coverage and wider applicability (species, geographical), the similarity of results across studies and the robustness of the experimental designs (e.g. randomised, replicated, controlled experiments with a large sample size will give more dependable results than a single before-and-after comparison).</p>\r\n<p><strong>HARMS</strong>: Harms in this context refers to any undesirable effects for terrestrial mammal species as a consequence of these interventions. Harms on other species groups are not included as we did not search the literature specifically for this purpose. If there is no evidence of harms please score this 0. </p>\r\n<p>Remember, you can exit and return to the survey several times at your convenience. You can also move backwards and forwards between interventions if necessary.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Please add a <strong>Score Comment</strong> for any actions where you feel this is useful. This is particularly important if your score does not follow obviously from the evidence provided, for example if you have given some studies more weight than others because of your knowledge of the system.</li>\r\n<li>Once you have opened an action, and either scored it or skipped it, it will be moved to the corresponding tab. Until you submit your final scores, you can re-open actions that have been moved to these tabs to check them or alter your scores if you need to.</li>\r\n<li>When you have moved all the actions from the <strong>Pending</strong> tab to the <strong>Scored</strong> tab, and you are happy with your scores for the assessment, please submit your final scores. Do this using the link on the left hand side of the assessment page.</li>\r\n<li>Please complete the scoring by the end of 8<strong>th of December</strong>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><em>N.B. If you know about any evidence relating to specific interventions for the conservation of terrestrial mammal species that is missing from the synopsis, please email to let us know the reference details. This will be valuable in putting together future versions of the synopsis and ‘What Works in Conservation’.</em></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROUND 2</em></strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Your task is to review the group’s category of effectiveness for each action, based on the group median scores from the first round.</li>\r\n<li>You will receive a spreadsheet containing both your scores and the group median score for each action that has been assessed. Each of these will have been used to put the action into a category, one based on your scores, and one based on the group median score (see Table 1 above). <strong>The Group Category is the one you need to consider</strong> <strong>whether you agree with or not</strong>, as that will be the published assessment. This decision should be based on whether the category for an action reflects the evidence provided for its effectiveness, certainty and harms. Comments made by reviewers in the first round of the assessment are also available in the final columns next to each action. The URL for the evidence for each action is also provided if you wish to go back and check the evidence available.</li>\r\n<li>Please go through each of the actions in turn, and check if you are happy with the Group Category. It may be useful to read the reviewers’ comments to see if they aid in interpreting the scores that have been given, as well as checking the evidence online by following the URL. If there are any actions that you believe have been placed in the wrong category by the group please indicate this in the “<strong>Strongly disagree?</strong>” column. For any actions where you disagree you need to provide a <strong>Supporting comment</strong> in the next column to explain why you disagree with the category. Please remember that <strong>all assessments must be based solely on the evidence presented on the Conservation Evidence website</strong>.</li>\r\n<li>Please complete the scoring by the end of <strong>21st of December</strong>.<u></u></li>\r\n<li>Actions which at least two reviewers believe have been placed in the wrong category will be sent out for re-scoring in Round 3.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROUND 3</em></strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You will receive an email alerting you when the third round of the assessment opens.</li>\r\n<li>All the actions to be re-scored will be sent to you in a spreadsheet. Only a subset of actions, where a proportion of assessors have disagreed with the category, will be included in this round.</li>\r\n<li>Look at each action in turn. Each action will show your scores and the group’s median scores that the action received in the first round, as well as the Group Category of effectiveness (calculated from the median group score in Round 1). Next to this you can see the comments that were made by the reviewers who flagged this action for re-scoring, so please make sure you read them.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>You are now given the opportunity to adjust your scores for Effectiveness, Certainty and Harms if you feel that they do not reflect the evidence well. If you wish to do this please just type over your original scores in the spreadsheet. Alternatively, if after reading the comments, you are happy with your original scores please leave them.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Once you have checked your scores for all actions that have been flagged for re-scoring please finalise your scoresheet.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Thank you very much for your help, we know that this is a substantial task. We expect that this will be a very influential piece of work. We will inform you when the results of the assessment have been made available online, and also when the new edition of <em>What Works in Conservation</em> is published.</p>\r\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>QUERIES: </strong>If you have any questions about the process, please don’t hesitate to get in touch: <a href=\"mailto:sop21@zoo.cam.ac.uk\"><strong>sop21@cam.ac.uk</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>",
