More rove beetles (Staphylinidae), adult ground beetles (Carabidae) and money spiders (Linyphiidae) also occurred when plots were sprayed late (42 rove beetles, 6 ground beetles and 33 money spiders/0.9 m²) rather than at recommended (19, 3 and 28, respectively) or early dates (18, 3 and 22). Rove beetles and money spiders showed similar patterns in mid-June. Groups that did not show an effect were not presented. Some pest groups such as planthoppers (Delphacidae) and leaf beetles (Chrysomelidae) were also more numerous in plots sprayed late. Plots treated later had more weeds (0.2-52.3 weeds/m²) than plots treated at recommended or early dates (0.6-18.8 and 0.1-5.7 weeds, respectively). Beet <em>Beta vulgaris </em>yields were similar between treatments (870-970 t root/ha). Glyphosate was sprayed in three timing treatments: early application (25 ­May and again 27 June), recommended application (14 June and 5 July) and late application (27 June and 16 July).</p>",

Two experiments found lower root damage in plots sprayed at six-leaf (damage rating of 2.5) rather than four-leaf (2.3 rating) and two-leaf (2.2 rating) stages in one of two canola cultivars, when averaged across sites, years and other treatments. Another experiment found this effect for two out of three cultivars and a fourth experiment found plots sprayed at the six-leaf stage had lowest damage in 1999 and 2001 (ratings of 2.7-3.2, 3.1-3.4 and 3.0-3.4 in six-, four- and two-leaf stages, respectively) but no effect in 2000. One experiment found less root maggot eggs in plots treated at the six-leaf (0.8 eggs/plant) rather than four- (1.4 eggs) and two-leaf (1.6 eggs) stages for one of two cultivars, but another experiment found only slight differences. Canola seed yields varied but were slightly lower in the six-leaf (392-3,265 kg/ha) than the two-leaf (672-3,458 kg/ha) stage treatments in three experiments. Glufosinate was sprayed in three timing treatments replicated four times. Root damage was scored 1 to 5.</p>",

Survival of green twig-mining moths was similar in herbicide-treated plots vs. untreated controls when herbicides were applied 23 days (51-61 vs. 48% of larvae survived to become adults) after moth egg laying, but survival was lower in the herbicide-treated plots when treated at 9 days (0-8% vs. 49%) or 16 days (5-30% vs. 80%) days since eggs were laid. Green twig-mining moth survival was similar for the three types of herbicide. Adult green twig-mining moths were released on 29 August to lay eggs on mimosa plants. Fluroxypyr, tebuthiuron and metsulfuron methyl herbicides were then applied at 9, 16 and 23 days after egg-laying. Treatments were tested in 5 x 5 m plots, each containing 20 mimosa plants grown in 30 cm-diameter pots. The number of larvae found before herbicides were applied was estimated from the number of leaflets mined by larvae. After herbicide treatment all emerging adult moths were collected using nets placed over the plants.</p>",
