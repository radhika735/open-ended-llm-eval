It involves harvesting trees in a series of partial cuttings, with trees removed uniformly over the plot, which allows new seedlings to grow from the seeds of older trees. This can help maintain characteristic forest species and increase structural diversity of stands.<strong> </strong></p>\r\n<p> </p>",

Relative abundance did not differ significantly before and after harvest in the shelterwood (4 vs 4–5) and unharvested sites (7 vs 8). However, numbers declined within clearcuts (5 vs 1). Similarly, population estimates varied over time within the shelterwood (12–50) and unharvested sites (40–103), but declined steadily within clearcuts (from 43 to 8). The proportion of juveniles increased in the unharvested plot (8 to 30%), whereas the proportion remained lower in the shelterwood (4 to 13%) and clearcut sites (3 to 12%). Growth and movement rates were similar between treatments. Treatments were randomly assigned over 12 sites (0.6–1.2 ha): shelterwood harvest (33–64% removed), clearcut and unharvested. Harvest was in May 1994. Salamanders were surveyed up to eight times a year within one 5 x 5 m plot/site. Mark-recapture was undertaken at one site.</p><p> </p>",

Overall, partial harvest produced declines 24% smaller than clearcutting. Average reductions in populations were lower following partial harvest (all studies: 31–48%; &lt; 5 years monitoring: 51%; &gt; 10 years monitoring: 29%) compared to clearcutting (all: 54–58%; &lt; 5 years: 62%; &gt; 10 years: 50%). There was no significant effect of the proportion of canopy removed in partial harvests. Sampling methodology influenced perceived effects of harvest. Salamander numbers almost always declined following timber removal, but populations were never lost and tended to increase as forests regenerated. Twenty-four site comparison and before-and-after studies that compared salamander abundance in harvested (partial or clearcut) and unharvested areas were analysed.
