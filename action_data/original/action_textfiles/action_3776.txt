Results were not statistically tested. At least 41% (51 of 124) of head-started hatchlings kept in outdoor seaside pens died within the first 18 months compared to 18% (31 of 172) reared indoors or in a bespoke rearing facility. From two releases of head-started individuals, 20 of 20 (100%) and 25 of 51 (50%) tortoises survived 8–10 month, and 12 of 20 (60%) survived at least 17 months. Authors reported no instances of ill health; that all recaptured tortoises had increased in size and weight; and that individuals from the first release were heavier five and 10 months after release than equivalent captive animals (see paper for details). In 1965–1971, giant tortoise hatchlings were reared in captivity (including some captive-bred and some wild caught hatchlings; see paper for subspecies). The 1965/1966–1967/1968 cohorts (124 hatchlings) were reared in outdoor fenced seaside pens. The 1968/1969 cohort (50 hatchlings) were reared indoors. From 1970 onwards all cohorts were reared in a bespoke facility (122 hatchlings). Twenty tortoises were released in December 1970, and 51 were released in May 1972, and all were monitored for up to 19–17 months.</p>",

Larger head-started turtles had higher annual survival in the first year following release (&lt;65 mm: 36%; 66–95 mm: 66%; ≥96 mm: 92%), but in year 2–3 after releases survival was similar for all sizes (60–100%). Three of five additional turtles raised in captivity for one year were re-captured 13 years later.  Hatchling turtles were collected from a nearby pond and raised in a head-starting facility for around 9–12 months. In 1979–1988, a total of 68 head-started turtles were released (5 in 1979, 62 in 1985–1988), and in 1982, fifteen wild hatchlings were translocated immediately after capture. In 1985–1992, turtles were trapped annually over a 4–6-week period from May–June or August–September using basking traps and fyke nets.</p>",

            "paragraph_text": "<p>A replicated, randomized study in 2013–2016 in two sites in a mixed pine forest in Georgia, USA (Quinn <em>et al. </em>2018) found that less than half of released head-started gopher tortoises <em>Gopherus polyphemus </em>that were held in pens prior to release survived one year after release. In two consecutive years, less than half of head-started gopher tortoises survived for one year after release (year one: 5 of 12, 42% tortoises survived; year two: 13 of 30 43%). The authors reported that the primary cause of mortality was predation by mammals or fire ants and that 71% of all mortalities occurred in the first 30 days after release. In 2013–2014, wild tortoise eggs were collected and incubated in captivity, and hatchlings were head-started for 8–9 months indoors. In total, 145 tortoises (July 2014: 12 individuals; July 2015: 133 individuals) were released into two sites in a protected area (3,127 ha). Survival estimates were based on a subset of tortoises (2014: 11 individuals; 2015: 30 individuals) that were radio tracked for one year after release. Tortoises were placed in predator-resistant, enclosed holding pens (5–6 tortoises/pen, random groupings) for 4–47 days prior to release. Each pen contained 5–10 artificial burrows (30–40 cm deep). Release sites were sprayed with insecticide (AMDRO®) to remove fire ants up to a 3 m perimeter around the edge of release pens.</p>",
