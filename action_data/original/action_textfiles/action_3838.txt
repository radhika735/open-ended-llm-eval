For species which are otherwise able to survive in cities, higher temperatures may cause problems for survival and reproduction. Planting trees within cities provides shade, and actively cools the environment by increasing evapotranspiration (Kleerekoper <em>et al.</em> 2012). This may provide benefits for temperature-sensitive butterflies and moths, but could be detrimental if the trees replace other important habitats.</p>\r\n<p><sup>Kleerekoper L., van Esch M. &amp; Salcedo T.B.
