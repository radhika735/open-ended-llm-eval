The cut and grazed areas were used at the same rate as areas of eight areas of salt marsh grass <em>Puccinellia maritima </em>(32-695 droppings/30 m<sup>2</sup>). The grazed areas contained large amounts of unpalatable rank fescue. Sheep were used to graze the marsh in May-September, but were removed before the arrival of wigeon in winter. Areas were cut short in September so that they resembled the areas of salt marsh grass.</p><p> </p>",
