        "background_definitions": "<p>Incubation temperatures (for example warmer or cooler, constant or fluctuating) can influence the sex, size, shape, colour, behaviour, movement ability and post-hatching growth of reptile hatchlings and newborns (Booth <em>et al</em>. 2006). Practitioners carrying out conservation activities aimed at maximising hatching success, such as relocating eggs for artificial incubation or to on-beach hatcheries, will therefore need to consider the potential impact of temperature during incubation on hatchlings and populations. Human-induced climate change may also influence the sex ratios of some species of reptiles and limit the viability of populations over time.  It may be possible to counter the impacts of climate change on affected populations by managing temperatures during incubation to create appropriate sex ratios.</p>\r\n<p>This action includes studies that test the impact of different temperatures on the sex ratio of reptile hatchlings or newborns. For studies that discuss the effectiveness of relocating snake and lizard nests/eggs for incubation more generally, see <em><a href=\"../../actions/3797\">Relocate nests/eggs for artificial incubation: snakes</a> </em>or <a href=\"../../actions/3798\"><em>lizards</em></a>, <a href=\"../../actions/3769\"><em>Relocate nests/eggs to a nearby natural setting (not including hatcheries)</em></a>, and <a href=\"../../actions/3792\"><em>Relocate nests/eggs to a hatchery</em></a>.

When pregnant female garter snakes were maintained at 26.6°C, embryo survival rate was higher than at lower (21–24°C) or higher temperatures (28–33°C; data reported as model outputs). Rates of male offspring stillbirths reduced at intermediate and higher temperatures (data reported as model outputs). Incubation temperature did not affect the sex ratio of live offspring (see paper for details). Seventy-four wild pregnant female garter snakes were brought into captivity and maintained at one of nine constant temperatures (21, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32, and 33°C; 2–14 females/temperature) until giving birth.

The ratio of males to females varied from 2:5 to 13:6 and was not influenced by temperature (result presented as statistical test).
