Intertidal hole habitats do not retain water during low tide – those that do would come under the action “<a href=\"../../actions/3476\"><em>Create ‘rock pools’ on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>”. The two actions can be combined (e.g. pools created in holes).</p>\r\n<p>Hole habitats provide organisms refuge from desiccation and temperature fluctuations during low tide in intertidal rocky habitats (Williams &amp; Morrit 1995). They also provide shelter from predation or grazing (Menge &amp; Lubchenco 1981). The size and density of holes is likely to affect the size, abundance and variety of organisms that can use them. Small holes can provide refuge for small-bodied organisms but may exclude larger organisms, limit their growth and get rapidly filled-up (Firth <em>et al.</em> 2020). Large holes can be used by larger-bodied organisms but may not provide sufficient refuge from predators for smaller organisms. By default, holes contain shaded surfaces, which can be associated with the presence of non-native species (Dafforn 2017).</p>\r\n<p>Holes are sometimes present on boulders used in marine artificial structures as a result of quarrying processes or engineering tests (Firth <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, these are sparse when present and are normally absent from other types of structures. Holes sometimes form on artificial structures through erosion, but are often filled or repaired during maintenance works (Moreira <em>et al.</em> 2007). Hole habitats can be created on intertidal artificial structures by adding or removing material, either during construction or retrospectively.</p>\r\n<p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href=\"../../actions/3435\"><em>Create natural rocky reef topography on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3475\"><em>Create pit habitats (1–50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3473\"><em>Create groove habitats (1–50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3437\"><em>Create crevice habitats (&gt;50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3476\"><em>Create ‘rock pools’ on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3468\"><em>Create small adjoining cavities or ‘swimthrough’ habitats (≤100 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3438\"><em>Create large adjoining cavities or ‘swimthrough’ habitats (&gt;100 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3474\"><em>Create groove habitats </em>and<em> small protrusions, ridges or ledges (1–50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>.</p>\r\n<p><sup>Dafforn K.A.

After 12–14 months, holes supported 2–31 macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate species groups/site (highshore: 2–10/site; midshore: 16–18/site; lowshore: 27–31/site), while seawall surfaces without holes or pools supported 2–21/site (highshore: 2–3/site; midshore: 7–11/site; lowshore: 19–21/site) (data not statistically tested). At least 14 species (≥5 macroalgae, ≥9 non-mobile invertebrates) recorded in holes were absent from surfaces without. Limpet abundances varied by shore level and site (see paper for results). It is not clear whether these effects were the direct result of creating holes or rock pools. Hole habitats were created during July–September 2006 by replacing seawall blocks with water-retaining troughs during construction of a vertical sandstone seawall. Six cuboidal holes (length: 600 mm; height/depth: 300 mm) were created at highshore, midshore, and lowshore in each of three sites along the seawall. Hole surfaces were sandstone and concrete. Water pooled to 50 mm in the base of holes but wet surfaces were not surveyed. Holes were compared with six seawall surfaces (length: 600 mm; height: 300 mm) at each shore level and site.
