        "background_definitions": "<p>Escape grids are frames of metal, plastics or mesh that are inserted in or near the codend of trawl nets to try and prevent unwanted species or sizes of catch from entering the codend. They are size selection mechanisms, with the sizes at which individuals are sorted dependent on the type of grid and the spacing between the bars of the grid. In some types of grid such as those used in multi-species fish trawls, the aim is to allow smaller fish to escape through the grid and keep the larger marketable sizes of fish. However, in some industrial trawl fisheries (such as for Norway pout), the grid has an opposite purpose of aiming to sort out large fish from the smaller-sized target fish catch. Behaviour of individual fish species may also influence how effective the grid is at allowing escape.</p>\r\n<p>When the fitting of size-sorting escape grids is implemented in prawn/shrimp trawl nets, the evidence has been summarized under ‘<em>Fishing gear modification - <a href=\"../../actions/2721\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fit a size-sorting escape grid (rigid or flexible) to a prawn/shrimp trawl net’</a></em>.

Grids of three different designs allowed 8–51% (average 20%) of mackerel of all sizes to escape relative to codend catches (grid: 134–44,000 kg, codend: 128–157,000 kg). The mackerel sorted out by grids had lower average weights (52 to 108 g less) than mackerel retained in the codend and the proportion of mackerel less than 400 g was reduced in all hauls by 4–14% by weight. Data were collected from 12 deployments during separate trials on three commercial and one research vessel from October–December in 1992, 1997, 1998 and 1999. Pelagic mackerel trawl nets were fitted with grids of varying size and construction and either 38 mm (eight tows), 40 mm (two tows) or 42 mm (two tows) bar spacing grid (see paper for specifications). Nets were deployed at 40–142 m depths for 45–140 min. Covers fitted over the grids collected fish escaping through them and a small-mesh inner net in the codend collected the fish that did not escape. Total catch weights in the covers and codend were recorded and subsamples of fish lengths measured.</p>",

Data were not tested for statistical significance. Catches of whiting and haddock were reduced in weight by 57% and 37% respectively by the grid. Almost all whiting sorted out were above the minimum landing size (23 cm), whereas for haddock the main sizes of the fish sorted out were below the 32 cm minimum landing size (data reported as length frequency distributions). Relative to retained catch, losses of fish above the minimum landing size were estimated as 46% for whiting and 9% for haddock. Catches of the target species Norway pout were reported to be reduced by 7%. Data were collected in November/December 2000 from 27 valid trawl deployments on a major Norway pout fishing area in the northern North Sea. An industrial trawl fitted with a hinged grid of 24 mm bar spacing was inserted in front of the codend. The top of the grid was covered by a square mesh window of 108 mm mesh to retain larger marketable fish (see paper for specifications).

The length at which fish have a 50% chance of escape was higher in codends with a grid compared to conventional codends for haddock <em>Melanogrammus aeglefinus</em> (with: 37.2 cm, without: 35.5 cm), but was not statistically different for saithe <em>Pollachius virens </em>(with: 49.1 cm, without: 46.4 cm) and Atlantic cod <em>Gadus morhua </em>(with: 45.6 cm, without: 40.9 cm). In addition, for haddock, but not saithe or cod, this value increased with increasing catch size in the grid codend but was similar for all catch sizes in the standard codend (data reported as statistical models). Fishing trials were carried out in October 2001 on The Patch and Alle Bank fishing grounds off Bergen. Seven hauls were done with each of two codends: a 120 mm diamond mesh codend fitted with a 35 mm rigid sorting grid and 40 mm guiding panel (Sort V system), and a standard 120 mm diamond mesh codend. Selection (i.e. sizes of fish of each species caught) of each codend was calculated by comparing catch to that caught in a small mesh (50 mm mesh) codend trawled simultaneously.</p>",

In addition, salmon escape through the grids was higher than square mesh panels, for flat and backward-sloping orientations at both light conditions and towing speeds (grids: 47–100%, square meshes: 0–67%) whereas escape through the forward-sloping grids was higher than escaping through the forward-sloping square meshes in the dark at the higher towing speed only. Six trials were conducted for each grid orientation at each towing speed (1 and 1.5 knots), three in dark and three in light conditions. For each trial, five juvenile salmon (12–14 cm length) were released into a circular canal 75 cm wide and 50 cm deep and forced to swim inside a framed net driven around the canal by a motor, to simulate a trawl deployment. The rigid sorting grid (38 mm bar spacing) was fixed to the bottom net frame at three orientations: flat, forward facing or backward facing. Fish were forced to swim for a maximum of 30 min and escapes monitored by video camera. The same trials were done with a square-mesh (60 mm mesh size) panel.

            "paragraph_text": "<p>A replicated, paired, controlled study in 2009 of a seabed area in the southern North Sea, France (Vogel <em>et al.</em> 2017) found that a fish trawl net modified with a flexible size-sorting escape grid caught less whiting <em>Merlangius merlangus</em> overall but did not reduce the amount of undersized whiting compared to a standard trawl net without a grid, in a mixed-species bottom trawl fishery. Catch numbers of whiting across all lengths were generally lower with a grid, and the most caught of any given length was 7,000 fish with a grid and 10,000 fish without (data not statistically tested). However, average whiting length was not statistically different between nets (grid: 27.3 cm, no grid: 27.5 cm). In February 2009, trials were done on two 20–24 m commercial trawlers fishing parallel to each other: one rigged with the test net and one with the standard net (see paper for specifications). A total of 13 paired deployments were completed. Nets were identical apart from the test net had a 1.25 x 0.75 m flexible grid, and vertical bars with 20-mm spacing, and the standard net had no grid but a mandatory 80 mm square mesh panel. Both commercial and non-commercial fish catches were sampled. Total length/fish and weight/species were recorded. Random sub-sampling was done when catches were large.</p>",
