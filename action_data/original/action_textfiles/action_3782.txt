The number of eggs infested by invertebrates and fungi was statistically similar for relocated and artificial nests (34%) and natural nests (35%). In 2005–2006, twenty-four nests were relocated higher up the beach away from rising river levels, and seven artificial nests were dug for eggs recovered from turtles that had been harvested by people. A further 22 nests were left in place. All nests were covered with wire mesh cylinders (1 x 1 cm) that were 40 cm wide and 50 cm high, with a 3 x 3 cm plastic mesh on top. In February–May 2005–2006, beaches were searched daily, with the aid of dogs <em>Canis lupus familiaris</em>, to locate turtle nests.
