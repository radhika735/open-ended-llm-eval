Average body weight increased from 135g to 500g over a three month period. A lower condition factor was detected in salmon fed the control fish meal diet (1.35) compared with the genetically modified soybean (1.37). Over 12 weeks, 1,200 smolt salmon were fed one of three diets for 12 weeks using automated feeders: a diet containing non-genetically modified soybean, genetically modified soybean or a standard fish meal diet. Soybean is a replacement protein for fish meal. Growth rates and weights were measured at the start of the experiment then after 6 and 12 weeks.</p><p> </p>",

For 3 months, groups of salmon were fed one of three diets containing 172g per kilogram genetically modified full-fat soybean meal, an unmodified soybean meal or a reference (control) diet with fish meal as the protein source. Fish were acclimatised for 6 weeks before being fed the experimental diets using automatic feeders. Seven fish were randomly sampled from each tank after 12 weeks for sampling.
