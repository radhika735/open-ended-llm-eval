Waterfowl used the rye grass plantings extensively, often in preference to other green browse, as it added a distinct microhabitat to mud flats exposed during winter draw-down of the reservoir. Rye grass was the only crop able to withstand periodic flooding and silting over the winter period and thus became a reliable food source for waterfowl. Experimental, small-scale plantings began in 1946. Large-scale plantings began in the fall of 1947. Higher mud flats are preferable as planting sites and the rate of seeding is 50 pounds per acre.</p>",

Whooping cranes significantly preferred hegari <em>Sorghum vulgare</em>, corn and wheat. Whooping cranes preferentially fed along the tidal flats in good weather. However, the crops (especially wheat, corn, legumes, peanuts and peas) were extensively used by sandhill cranes <em>Grus canadensis</em>, snow geese <em>Chen hyperboreanI</em> and Canada geese <em>Branta canadensis</em> (181 000 goose and 233 000 crane use-days in total from 1964-1967).</p><p> </p>",

Experimental owls on food-enriched territories did not show a difference in home-range size and patchiness of spatial use compared with control owls. However, the distances of owl locations to treatment blocks were significantly closer to experimental centre-points than expected by chance (on average, 0.6 km closer). At a larger scale, no owls vacated their territories to use experimental plots and no owls switched to a nomadic strategy. The authors speculate that territorial behaviour prevents large aggregations of predators at an intermediate spatial scale. Experimental blocks were provided with commercial rabbit chow added weekly all year; snowshoe hare <em>Lepus americanus</em> densities were 2.8-10.3 times higher than in control blocks.</p><p> </p>",
