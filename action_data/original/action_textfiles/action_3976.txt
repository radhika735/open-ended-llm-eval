Hedgerows also reduce the temperature fluctuations experienced in open farmland, which may facilitate greater species survival or movement through the landscape. The presence of hedgerows in an agricultural landscape has been found to increase both the abundance and species richness of butterflies recorded (Luppi <em>et al.</em> 2018), therefore planting new hedgerows may help butterfly and moth populations on farmland to recover.</p>\r\n<p>For studies on managing existing hedgerows, see “<a href=\"../../actions/3975\"><em>Manage hedgerows to benefit wildlife (e.g. no spray, gap-filling and laying)</em></a>”.</p>\r\n<p><sup>Luppi M., Dondina O., Orioli V. &amp; Bani L.

Sessile oak supported the most diverse group in terms of arthropod orders, with 13 out of 15 orders recorded, two of which were not found on any other plant species. Hawthorn and common gorse were the next most diverse, each with one unique arthropod order. Common gorse, sessile oak, blackthorn and rowan between them had representatives of all 27 families of moths and butterflies (Lepidoptera), beetles (Coleoptera) and true bugs (Hemiptera) recorded in the study. Planting was undertaken in 1996 within the fenced (2 m wide) margins of two fields. Margins were divided into eight 6-m plots, which were planted with a double row of 30–40 plants of each species, replicated across three blocks. Arthropods were sampled by tree beating at five points/plot in June, August and September 1998–1999.</p>",
