Fish that had undergone aerobic interval training showed higher survival rates (74%) compared with those that had undergone aerobic continuous intensity training or the non-trained control group (64% and 61% survival, respectively). Mortalities began to occur 11 days after exposure and continued until the end of the 31 day experiment. 120 fish were split into the three treatment groups; control untrained fish swimming in tanks with a constant average water speed of 0.05 body lengths/second, continuous intensity training salmon exposed to a constant average water speed of 0.8 body lengths/second and interval trained fish exposed to an average speed of 0.8 body lengths/second for 16 hours per day (including 4 h light–12 h dark). After training, fish were maintained for 6 weeks at a constant average water speed of 0.05 body lengths/second before cohabitation with 60 salmon infected with infectious pancreatic necrosis. Mortality levels were recorded daily for 31 days.</p>",
