The similarity of the vegetation community to that of the target community did not differ significantly between areas sown with seeds at rates of 10, 25 or 40 kg/ha (data presented as similarity coefficients). In 1997, seeds of eight grass species were sown in varying proportions onto bare soil in each of three 15 x 15 m plots at rates of 10, 25 or 40 kg/ha. Cover of all species in each of the nine plots was estimated within 10 randomly placed 1-m<sup>2</sup> quadrats in June 1997–1999.

The results of this study did not allow for statistical significance to be assessed. After 1–3 years, average grass cover was higher in plots where grass seeds were sown at high density (35–78%) than in plots where grass seeds were sown at a low density (23–64%). There was a similar pattern for average forb cover (high density: 38–57%; low density: 24–34%) and forb species richness (high density: 7–8 species/plot; low density: 5–6 species/plot) when forb seeds were sown at high and low densities. The field surrounding the experimental area was sown with native species in May 2001. A few days later, the experimental area was sown with forb and grass seeds at three combinations of densities: low grass/low forbs, low grass/high forbs, high grass/low forbs. Each seeding density was sown in six 2 x 2 m plots. Seeds were hand sown and raked into the bare soil. The entire field was mown in June–July 2001 and 2002, and burned in March 2003. Plant species cover was estimated using a 1-m² quadrat in the centre of each plot in May/June and August/September 2001–2004.</p>",
