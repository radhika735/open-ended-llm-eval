However, unlike their relatives oilbirds feed entirely on fruit and nest and roost in caves in northern and central South America. It is thought that the availability of nesting and roosting sites in these caves may limit populations, although increasing habitat destruction is also threatening the species (Thomas 1999).</p>\r\n<p>Thomas, B.T.
