        "background_definitions": "<p class=\"Background\">Zooplankton such as water fleas (Cladocera), copepods (Copepoda) and seed shrimps (Ostracoda) consume the aquatic zoospores of the chytrid fungus <em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</em> (e.g. Buck <em>et al.</em> 2011). They may therefore play a role in regulating the fungus and so could help to reduce the risk of amphibian infection in aquatic environments. Copepods have successfully been used as biological control agents in other disease systems (Marten 2000).</p>\r\n<p class=\"References\">Buck J.C., Truong L. &amp; Blaustein A.R.
