Results were not tested for statistical significance. Over two months, more butterflies and moths were recorded in two sown grass margins (58–75 individuals) than in two uncultivated margins (38–44 individuals), but the number of species was similar (sown: 6 species; uncultivated: 7 species). Fewer butterflies (24 individuals) of more species (8 species) were recorded in a species-rich pasture. Four existing field margins and a species-rich pasture were compared. Two margins were sown (one with a mixture of legumes dominated by white melilot <em>Melilota alba</em>, the other with clover and ley grasses dominated by red clover <em>Trifolium pratense</em>) and two were uncultivated (one with diverse weeds, the other with diverse herbs and grasses on a ditch bank). From 19 June–22 August 1989, butterflies and moths were recorded in the morning and evening at each site, three times/week.</p>",
