Salt is often used for fungal diseases in aquaculture and for veterinary treatments of fish and amphibians (Wright &amp; Whitaker 2001; Mifsud &amp; Rowland 2008) and has been found to kill the chytrid fungus (Johnson <em>et al.</em> 2003).</p>\r\n<p class=\"References\">Johnson M.L., Berger L., Philips L. &amp; Speare R.

Thirty-three of 40 green and golden bell frog tadpoles released survived to juvenile frogs in the salted pond. However, growth appeared slower in salt water than fresh water (first metamorph: 49 vs 43 days; last metamorph: 123 vs 76–80 days). Following addition of salt, the two striped marsh frogs<em> Limnodynastes peroni</em> tested were negative for chytridiomycosis. Striped marsh frogs had introduced chytridiomycosis to the pond and it had killed all but one of the previous green and golden bell frog population.  Following the initial outbreak of chytridiomycosis, uniodized table salt was added to the pond to achieve 1 parts per trillion (ppt) sodium chloride (3% sea water) in December 2000. Forty tadpoles were then released into the pond and were monitored weekly.</p><p> </p>",
