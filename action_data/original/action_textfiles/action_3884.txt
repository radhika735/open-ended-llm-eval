The ideal conservation outcome is often to entirely remove non-native species, but this may not be possible if the species has become too widespread or abundant, or is difficult to catch and kill. However, where removal is not possible, on-going control of the non-native species may allow native butterflies and moths to persist alongside them.</p>",
