These physical structures range from relatively temporary systems such as sandbags to permanent structures such as rock walls, seawalls, living seawalls and offshore breakwaters. Armouring shorelines may benefit reptiles if it leads to the protection of habitats used by reptiles (e.g. nesting beaches) that would otherwise be lost to erosion.</p>",
