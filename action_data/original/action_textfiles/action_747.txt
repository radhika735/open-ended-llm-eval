Three of six species showed no changes in capture rates after total clearcutting and no significant differences in captures in riparian buffers and upslope areas (rough-skin newts <em>Taricha granulosa</em>, Dunn's salamanders <em>Plethodon dunni</em> and red-legged frogs <em>Rana aurora</em>). Capture rates of ensatinas <em>Ensatinae schscholtzii</em> and Pacific giant salamanders <em>Dicamptodon tenebrosus</em> decreased after clearcutting and tended to be lower in buffers than upslope. Western redback salamanders <em>Plethodon vehiculum</em> increased the first year after logging and then decreased. Herbicide treatment had no effect on species. Each site had plots (&gt;8 ha) with each treatment: unharvested control; clearcut and broadcast burned; and clearcut, broadcast burned and sprayed with herbicide (1.3 kg/ha). Clearcuts had 20 m wide untreated riparian buffer strips. Cut sites were planted with fir seedlings. Amphibians were monitored one year before and for two years after treatments using pitfall trapping. Traps were checked daily for eight days in dry and wet seasons.</p><p> </p>",

Densities were significantly higher with buffers than without for tailed frogs <em>Ascaphus truei</em> (0.4 vs 0/m<sup>2</sup>) and cascade torrent salamander <em>Rhyacotriton cascadae</em> (0.5 vs 0.2). For both species, densities were significantly higher in unharvested forests (0.7 and 1.5/m<sup>2</sup> respectively) but not secondary forests (0.2 and 0.6). In contrast, giant salamander <em>Dicamptodon </em>spp. densities were significantly lower in buffered (0.2/m<sup>2</sup>) than unbuffered streams and secondary forests (0.3/m<sup>2</sup>). Densities in unharvested forests (0.2) were significantly lower than the average for managed forests. Nine to 12 streams in each of four management types were sampled: clearcuts (≤10 years old) with 5–23 m wide buffers or without buffers, second-growth forest (≥35 years old) and unharvested forest. Amphibians were monitored within six 2 m long plots within 45–55m sub-sections of streams in June–August 2001.</p><p> </p>",

Western red-backed salamanders <em>Plethodon vehiculum</em> and ensatinas <em>Ensatina eschscholtzii</em> appeared to benefit from riparian buffers. However, coastal tailed frogs <em>Ascaphus truei</em> declined significantly immediately after harvest at sites with wide buffers and 10 years after treatment the species was almost locally extinct at narrow and wide buffered sites. For other species there was suggestion of treatment effects, but analyses were confounded by patterns of natural population changes. In 1992, 18 sites (33–50 ha) were selected and assigned to three treatments: forest harvested with a riparian buffer of approximately 8 m or a wider buffer (plus wildlife reserve trees/logs) and control sites of previously logged second-growth forests. Streams were 2–6 m wide and had clear-cutting of 15 ha either side. Amphibians were monitored in October–November before harvest (1992–1993), 2-years after (1995–1996) and 10-years after harvest (2003–2004). Eighteen pairs of pitfall traps were placed in buffers and adjacent habitat.</p><p> </p>",
