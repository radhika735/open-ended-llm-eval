Yield of potato in rotation with one year of rye <em>Secale cereale</em>, one or two years of maize <em>Zea mays</em> and one or two years of a sorghum hybrid <em>Sorghum halepense x sudanense</em> was not significantly different to continuous potato. Populations of wilt fungus <em>Verticillium dahliae</em> and root lesion nematode <em>Pratylenchus penetrans</em> were not affected by crop rotations. The experiment used five replicates of ten rotation treatments. Plots were 15 m long and four crop-rows wide. Crop management followed local recommendations for conventional potato production. Wilt fungus and root lesion nematode were sampled at the beginning, middle and end of each growing season using eight to twelve 600 cm³ soil cores in each plot.</p><p> </p>",

In 1996, Colorado potato beetle populations were much smaller and not significantly different between plots rotated with cotton <em>Gossypium</em> sp. or left fallow and non-rotated plots. In both years, more insecticide sprays were required in non-rotated plots, and in 1995 rotated plots had a return of US$2,342.50/ha compared to US$552.50/ha for non-rotated plots. The experiment used 7.6 m long, three row wide plots in 1994-1995 and 6.1 m long, four row wide plots in 1995-1996. In 1994 rotation crops were wheat or wheat-soybean double crop, and in 1995 rotation crops were cotton or fallow. Unrotated control plots were replicated four times, whilst each rotated plot  was replicated twice. Rotated and non-rotated plots were a minimum of 150 m apart. Insecticides were applied based on threshold beetle numbers.</p><p> </p>",
