The boxes each had twelve 10 cm-deep holes, 0.65 cm in diameter. Boxes were placed in pairs. One on each tree excluded crawling earwigs <em>Forficula auricularia</em> using the sticky barrier Tanglefoot. The treatment substantially reduced the number of earwigs found in the boxes and allowed a greater total number of bee cells (during the peak bee nesting week, there were 134 cells in boxes with Tanglefoot, 45 cells in untreated boxes). The majority of nesting bees in this study were native species of the leafcutter bee genera <em>Megachile</em> and <em>Osmia</em> although introduced species of <em>Megachile </em>were also present.</p>",
