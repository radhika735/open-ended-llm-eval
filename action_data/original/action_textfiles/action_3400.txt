After six years, plots sown with a high diversity local seed mix had on average a greater number and cover of target plant species (28 species, 83% cover) than plots sown with a low diversity non-local seed mix (12 species, 36% cover). In December 2004, three blocks were established on an unvegetated area (240 x 50 m) of boulder clay mixed with sand. In each block, one plot was sown with a high diversity mix of seeds from a local source (11 grass and 40 herb species, sown at 36 kg/ha), and one plot was sown with a low diversity mix of non-local seeds (three grass cultivars, sown at 100 kg/ha).

In areas where local grass and forb seeds were sown 18–20 years previously, plant cover was higher (20–24%) than in areas sown with non-native grass seeds (12–19%) but there was no significant difference for areas where local seeds had been sown 2–9 years ago (8–12%).

After one year, areas sown with local seeds had higher average plant species richness (16 species/plot) than areas sown with a commercial seed mix (10 species/plot). The average height of herbaceous plants was similar between areas sown with local seeds (100 cm) and a commercial seed mix (93 cm).
