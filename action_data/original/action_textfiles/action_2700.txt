        "background_definitions": "<p>Some static (non-mobile) fishing gears typically attract fish using bait, as opposed to mobile gears that move through the water column to capture fish, or other static gears that passively allow fish to swim into the gear. The use of bait exploits a species’ natural feeding behaviour to increase the chances of capture, for example by encouraging entry into traps where exit is limited, or by taking bait from hook and line and becoming caught on the hook. Static gear fishing is highly dependent on the feeding ecology of the target species (Løkkeborg <em>et al</em>. 2014) and changing the type or size of bait may influence fishing efficiency and the amount of unwanted species or sizes caught. For example, the size of prey consumed is limited by fish gape size (Mittelbach &amp; Persson 1998), and using larger bait may therefore limit the capture of smaller fish, whilst one type of bait may be less attractive to non-target and unwanted species over another and reduce their capture.</p>\r\n<p>Evidence for similar interventions affecting the capture of fish on hook and line is summarized under <em>‘Fishing gear modification - <a href=\"../../actions/2698\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Use a different hook type</a>’ </em>and<a href=\"../../actions/2699\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em> ‘Modify longline configuration’</em></a>.

When bait appeared larger, fewer small and undersized (&lt;46 cm) haddock were caught (26 fish) than with standard sized bait (45 fish). However, catches of larger, legal sized (&gt;46 cm) haddock were similar for each bait type (large: 67, standard: 74 fish). Total catch of torsk was similar between bait types, across all sizes (large: 173, standard: 160 fish) (no ling data presented.) In addition, the mean size of fish caught on experimental and standard baits was similar for torsk (54 vs 54 cm) and ling (91 vs 95 cm). Trials were carried out in November 1990 (western Norway, 120–370 m depth), and in July 1991 (northern Norway, 373–415 m depth). Experimental bait was made from a piece of plastic attached to the shank of a circle hook around which the bait was wrapped, giving it a larger appearance. Hooks were baited with mackerel (Scombridae) in western Norway, and mackerel and squid (Cephalopoda) in northern Norway. Hooks were left for 4–14 h in western Norway and 11–12 h in northern Norway.

Numbers of sharks and rays caught on bait that had been dyed blue were similar to those caught on traditional, non-dyed bait (data reported as graphical analysis). Three global databases were searched, and publications identified that reported the numbers of sharks and rays caught in fishing gears with and without devices to reduce unwanted catch (‘bycatch reduction devices). A meta-analysis was carried out on 44 studies, two of which two contained data on the effects of using different bait types.</p>",

Data were reported as graphical analyses (see review). When using fish instead of squid for bait, catch rates of sharks and rays were higher for seven of nine unwanted elasmobranch species, and lower for two species. Fish bait increased the incidence of deep-hooking injury in one of one unwanted species compared to squid bait. In addition, wider circle hooks baited with fish bait caught more of three of four species and fewer of one of four species, compared to narrow hooks (of all designs). The study performed a meta-analysis of 41 studies globally on the effects of different hook and bait types in pelagic longline fisheries on unwanted elasmobranch catch rates, survival and deep-hooking injury (see original paper for full search methods).</p>",

The average length of hooked fish was greater with larger bait size than smaller bait for: cod <em>Gadus morhua </em>(large: 55–72 cm, small: 46–70), haddock <em>Melanogrammus aeglefinus </em>(large: 47–53 cm, small: 45–52,), tusk <em>Brosme brosme </em>(large: 47 cm, small: 43 cm), ling <em>Molva molva </em>(large: 65 cm, small: 63 cm) and wolffish <em>Anarhichas lupus </em>(large: 48–64 cm, small: 45 cm). Six fishing trials were conducted from commercial longliners between November 2008 and December 2009 (five trials off the northwest coast of Iceland, one trial off the southwest) at depths of 50–140 m. Large (30 g) and small (10 g) sizes of bait made of Pacific saury <em>Cololabis saira </em>were alternated every 100 hooks (up to 4,800 hooks/set) and gear fished for one hour. Hooked fish were recorded and their lengths measured.</p>",

In the second trial, unwanted fish catch again was similar using barracouta <em>Thyrsites atun</em> bait (3.7 fish/trap) compared to squid bait (2.2 fish/trap). Bait species were tested in two trials on grounds fished for New Zealand scampi <em>Metanephrops challengeri</em>. In November/December 2014, a total of 140 traps baited with squid and 139 baited with mackerel were deployed at Chatham Rise. In April 2015 at Cape Palliser, 46 traps baited with squid and 45 with barracoota were deployed. Four types of traps were used, equal numbers baited with each bait species. All traps were deployed on the seabed and left for 18 hours before retrieval. All unwanted catch was identified and counted.</p>",
