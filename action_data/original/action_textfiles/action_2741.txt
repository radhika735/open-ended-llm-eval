        "background_definitions": "<p>Marine fisheries throughout the world are often highly regulated and may be subject to many different international or national laws and byelaws. Compliance with these measures is important to protect commercially targeted and non-targeted species and their habitats: non-compliance has been shown to have a negative impact on the biomass of targeted species in no-take marine reserves (Bergseth <em>et al</em>. 2015). One way to improve compliance and help enforce regulations may be to ask citizens/the wider public (as opposed to government/state or scientific organisations) to provide surveillance or information on fishing activity. In practice, this may be via the provision of a dedicated system for reporting illegal activity (e.g. a telephone hotline).</p>\r\n<p>Bergseth B.J., Russ G.R. &amp; Cinner J.E.
