For many fish species the reproductive potential (e.g. the annual numbers of eggs/young produced by the females) increases with size and/or age. Removal of the larger fish from a population thus reduces the overall reproductive potential and may also apply a genetic selection pressure that favours fish that mature at a smaller size that may continue breeding (Borrell 2013). Setting a maximum landing size (i.e. the largest fish measurement – usually total length – at which it is legal to retain a fish) may protect the largest fish with the highest reproductive potential, thus helping to maintain the population.</p>\r\n<p>For similar interventions, see <em>‘Protect Reproductive Individuals - <a href=\"../../actions/2735\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Set a minimum landing size for commercially fished species</a>’</em> and <a href=\"../../actions/2737\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>‘Specify a size range of capture for commercially fished species’</em></a>.</p>\r\n<p>Borrell B.
