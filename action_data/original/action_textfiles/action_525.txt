Average clutch size of unfed gulls on Flat Holm was also lower in 1989 than in previous years, whilst unfed clutches on Skomer were similar to the national average. This suggests that the population on Flat Holm was to some extent food limited in 1989, although laying date did not differ between fed and unfed clutches. Birds were provided with 200 g of fish each day.</p><p> </p>",
