No statistical analyses were carried out in this study. In 11 of 12 comparisons, strip seeded plots had more grass species (5–14 species/plot) than unsown plots (4–13 species/plot), while in one comparison, there were fewer grass species in strip seeded plots (7 species/plot) than unsown plots (8 species/plot). In eight of 12 comparisons, forb species richness was higher in strip seeded plots (7–25 species/plot) than unsown plots (4–15 species/plot), while in four comparisons, forb species richness in strip seeded plots was equal to or lower than that in unsown plots (both 5–8 species/plot). In August 1994, at each site, strip seeding (at a spacing of 23 cm and depth of &lt;2 cm) was carried out in four 6 x 4 m plots, while four plots were left unseeded. Seed mixes contained seeds of five grass species and 18 forb species. In May/June of 1995 and 1996, three 40 x 40 cm quadrats were placed in each plot and the frequency of each grass and forb species recorded.</p>",

The review used keyword searches to identify studies where semi-natural grassland restoration was carried out. All studies of strip seeding used machinery to drill seeds into the soil.</p>",
