The seven frogs were recaptured 27 times by June 1993. There was no control and so the frogs may have survived without the exclosure. In May 1992, frogs were translocated 40 m to a new habitat (a rock-filled pit 72 m<sup>2</sup>) created in May-October 1991 in a nearby forest remnant. A predator-proof fence was built around the new habitat to exclude tuatara <em>Sphenodon punctatus</em> and the area was ‘seeded’ with invertebrate prey. Frogs were surveyed regularly from November 1990 to May 1992 (90 visits).</p><p> </p>",

In 2008–2009, abundance was 5–7/20 m in the treatment area compared to 4–6/20 m in the non-treatment area. Snout–vent lengths were also similar (treatment: 9–45 mm; non-treatment: 11–45 mm). The rat abundance index decreased from eight in 2002 to three in 2009. Abundance in the non-treatment area was 73. Poison bait was placed at 50 m intervals along lines spaced 100 m apart over the entire 200 ha treatment area. These were restocked with 125 g of brodifacoum in spring and autumn. Rats were monitored at seven locations using 60 tracking tunnels in the treatment area and three locations using 20 tunnels in the non-treatment area. Frogs were sampled on two 20 m transects along five small streams/site in summer 2008–2009.</p><p> </p>",
