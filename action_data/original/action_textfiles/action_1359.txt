A mouldboard plough was used for conventional tillage (30 cm depth). A chisel plough was used for reduced tillage (10 cm depth). Peas were planted in November 2005–2008 and harvested in June 2006–2009. The peas were not fertilized.</p><p> </p>",

Higher cover crop biomass was found in plots with reduced tillage, compared to conventional tillage (4,098 vs 3,609 t/ha). <strong>Methods: </strong>Reduced tillage or conventional tillage was used on eight tomato plots each, in 1999–2009. The plots (9 x 82 m) had six raised beds each. Winter cover crops (triticale, rye, and vetch) were planted on half of the plots, in October 1999–2008, and crop residues were chopped in March. Different numbers of tillage practices were used for conventional tillage (19–23 tractor passes, including disc and chisel ploughing) and reduced tillage (11–12 tractor passes, not including disc and chisel ploughing). Tomato seedlings were transplanted in April 2000–2009. Fertilizer and herbicide were used in all plots. Tomatoes were grown in rotation with cotton.</p><p> </p>",

Lower wheat yields were found in plots that were tilled to 15 cm depth, compared to 20–25 cm depth (1,392 vs 1,516–1,518 kg/ha). <strong>Implementation options:</strong> Higher wheat yields were found in plots that were tilled at slower tractor speeds (0.69–1.25 m/s: 1,454–1,528 kg/ha), compared to the fastest speed (1.53 m/s: 1,397 kg/ha). <strong>Methods:</strong> Reduced tillage or conventional tillage was used on three plots each (0.45 ha plots). A chisel plough was used for both reduced tillage (one pass) and conventional tillage (two passes). Each plot had three subplots (0.15 ha subplots, tilled to 15, 20, or 25 cm depth). Each subplot had four sub-subplots (size not reported; tilled at 0.69, 1, 1.25, or 1.53 m/s). Wheat was planted in December 2012, fertilized, and harvested in May 2013.</p><p> </p>",

Cover crops were mown or chopped in spring, before tillage. Reduced tillage or conventional tillage was used on 12 plots each (6 x 4 m plots). A mouldboard plough (30 cm depth) and a disc (two passes) were used for conventional tillage (which incorporated the cover crop residues into the soil). A rotary hoe (10 cm depth) was used for reduced tillage (which incorporated some of the cover crop residues into the soil). Eggplant seedlings were transplanted into the plots in May, and fruits were harvested four times/year in July–September 2010–2011. All plots were fertilized before the cover crops were grown, but not after. All plots were irrigated.</p><p> </p>",
