Effective management relies on accurate information on fishing activity and the level of compliance. One way to encourage compliance and to increase enforcement may be to require commercial fishers to provide detailed information on their fishing operations, including the amount of time spent fishing, catches and landings, to the relevant fisheries administrations. Many countries already have in place schemes to enable catch data reporting (e.g. logbooks) and publish annual fishing effort data that is increasingly freely accessible via the worldwide web. Some countries (e.g. Brazil) have developed online logbooks to increase transparency in reporting compared to paper logbooks that are not widely accessible.</p>",
