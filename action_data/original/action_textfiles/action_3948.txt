        "background_definitions": "<p>Large areas of peatland have been deliberately or unintentionally drained (for example extracting drinking water from below ground lowers the water table over a large area) for human activities. Drained peat can be too dry and chemically unsuitable for peatland plants (Lamers <em>et al.</em> 2002), reducing the suitability of habitat for specialist butterflies and moths. Peatland restoration typically involves raising the water table to rewet the surface peat. This creates more suitable conditions for recolonization by peatland plants (Money &amp; Wheeler 1999; Ritzema et al. 2014), such as bog myrtle <em>Myrica gale</em>, which could benefit butterflies and moths which depend upon them as a caterpillar food source (Fowles <em>et al.</em> 2004). However, the rate at which water levels are raised may need to be controlled, so as not to submerge overwintering caterpillars (Joy &amp; Pullin 1997, 1999). It may also be necessary to rewet the area around a peatland (creating a ‘hydrological buffer zone’) to prevent water simply draining away from the peatland.</p>\r\n<p>A range of techniques may be used to raise the water table to restore peatlands, for example blocking drainage ditches, planting flood-resistant vegetation to slow water flow, blocking underground channels, building raised embankments to retain water, inserting dams below the peat surface to slow subsurface drainage, switching off drainage pumps, felling trees, or restoring inflows. These interventions are all considered in this action. For studies of specific actions for creating, restoring, or managing peatlands, see “<a href=\"../../actions/3933\"><em>Replant native vegetation</em></a>” and “<a href=\"../../actions/3944\"><em>Employ areas of semi-natural habitat for rough grazing (includes salt marsh, lowland heath, bog, fen)</em></a>”.</p>\r\n<p>Habitats within this action include peatland, bogs, mires, and wet heathland, where the water table is close to the ground surface. For studies on restoring wet grasslands, fenland and floodplains, see “<a href=\"../../actions/3949\"><em>Restore or create wetlands and floodplains</em></a>”.

Caterpillars on cotton-sedge tussocks <em>Eriophorum vaginatum</em> in plots with high water levels resulting from restoration activities had lower winter survival (0–35%) than caterpillars on tussocks where the restoration had not affected water levels (54–63%). Prior to the study (years not given) drains were blocked at Fenn’s and Whixall Mosses to raise water levels as part of a site restoration programme to create wetter areas of the sites. In winter 1996–1997 one dry study plot was located at Whixall and one wet plot at Fenn’s, but in 1997–1998 both the wet and dry plots were located at Whixall. In September 1996 and 1997, twenty captive-reared large heath caterpillars were put on each of four low-lying cotton-sedge tussocks in that year’s plots (two plots/year and a total of 80 caterpillars/ plot).</p>",

One–three years after restoration, the moth community on restored mires was intermediate between the communities found on drained and pristine mires (data presented as model results). One of three mire specialist micro-moths (rush marble <em>Bactra lancealana</em>) and one of two specialist macro-moths (Manchester treble-bar <em>Carsia sororiata</em>) were more numerous in restored than drained sites, but were most abundant in pristine sites. However, one specialist micro-moth (<em>Crambus alienellus</em>) and one specialist macro-moth (<em>Arichanna melanaria</em>) were more abundant in the drained sites than restored sites. A third specialist micro-moth (pearl-band grass-veneer <em>Catoptria margaritella</em>) did not differ in abundance between restored, drained and pristine sites (see paper for details). In the 1960s and 1970s, parts of nine mires were drained for forestry. From 2003–2006, some drained areas were restored by filling ditches with peat, damming the ends with logs and peat, and cutting trees. Each mire also contained a pristine, undrained area. In 2007, moths were sampled along two 250-m transects in each restored, drained and pristine area (six transects/mire). From May–August, micro-moths were sampled weekly using 100 sweeps/transect of a 28-cm diameter net at all nine mires.
