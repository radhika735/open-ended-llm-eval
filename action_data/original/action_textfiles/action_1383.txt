Similar amounts of water were used by cereals, in plots with or without rotations (wheat phase: 335–345 vs 300 mm; barley phase: 288–297 vs 293 mm). <strong>Implementation options:</strong> There was no difference in the water-use efficiency of cereals between wheat-barley-rapeseed and wheat-barley-vetch rotations (wheat: 7.2 vs 7.5 kg grain/mm water/ha; barley: 10.3 vs 10.9). <strong>Methods:</strong> Continuous wheat (one plot), continuous barley (one plot), a wheat-barley-rapeseed <em>Brassica napus</em> rotation (one plot/phase), or a wheat-barley-vetch <em>Vicia sativa </em>rotation (one plot/phase) were grown in each of three blocks. Each plot was 50 x 8 m. Wheat and barley were sown in early November (450 seeds/m<sup>2</sup>). Vetch and rapeseed were sown in late September to early October (150 and 80 seeds seeds/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively). Fertilizer was used on all plots (except vetch phases) in January and February. Herbicide was used in all plots.</p><p> </p>",

Each plot was 5 x 15 m. All plots were fertilized. Before the experiment, these rotations had been used for 21 years in this field. The wheat was harvested in July. Soil moisture was measured with a neutron probe (0–90 cm depth) and soil water storage was calculated from the change in soil moisture.</p><p> </p>",
