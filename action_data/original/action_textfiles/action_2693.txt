        "background_definitions": "<p>Fishing catch limits (sometimes called quotas) set a maximum limit on the seasonal or annual quantity of fish that can be caught by a vessel in a given area or fishery and may apply to one or more species. One such type of quota (termed individual transferable quota or ITQ) is used to restrict the overall amount of fish a fishing fleet can catch. As the name suggests, transferable quotas can be bought, sold or leased between vessels. However, another type of quota (termed individual vessel bycatch quota or ITBQ) can be implemented. Unlike ITQs, ITBQs are not transferable and put a limit on the unwanted/discarded proportion of fish a vessel can catch that isn’t retained for market (fish may not be kept for market for a variety of reasons, including the species being of no value and/or target species that are undersized or exceed the quota). They aim to reduce unwanted catches of fish by not only limiting overall fishing mortality, but by also encouraging active avoidance of unwanted catch by fishers that may have to stop fishing once their non-target quota is reached (O’Keefe <em>et al. </em>2014).</p>\r\n<p>O’Keefe C.E., Cadrin S.X. &amp; Stokesbury D.E.

Data were not statistically tested. Programmes that used technology to provide near real-time catch information to fishers resulted in reduced unwanted catch or discards in two of three cases compared to no use of real-time technology. Catch limits or quotas were evaluated as having reduced unwanted catch in two of three cases: of Pacific halibut <em>Hippoglossus stenolepis</em> in the British Columbia groundfish (bottom) trawl fishery, Canada; and in the mixed species fisheries in New Zealand. A cap for unwanted yellowtail flounder <em>Limanda ferruginea</em> in the USA scallop <em>Pectinidae</em> fishery was evaluated as having not reduced unwanted flounder catch across all affected regions even though it was successful in some areas (data not reported, see paper for references to original studies). The review summarized peer-reviewed evaluations (see paper for details of original studies) of programmes implementing unwanted catch mitigation techniques, including the setting of catch limits or quotas for unwanted or non-commercially targeted fish catch.</p>",

In the period 1996–2006 following the introduction of a “bycatch” quota system for individual vessels in 1996, halibut catches fell by 219% (data reported as statistical model results). Conversely, when individual transferrable catch quotas had been implemented in 1990, it resulted in a 40% increase in unwanted halibut catches (data reported as statistical model results). Authors noted that this increase was due to individual transferrable quotas tending to only consider the conservation of a single species rather than multiple species caught at the same time. Fisheries data from the British Columbia groundfish fishery for the period 1962–2006 were analysed, provided by The International Pacific Halibut Commission and Fisheries and Oceans Canada. The British Columbia Groundfish fishery implemented an individual vessel bycatch quota system in 1996 whereby trawl license holders received a quota representing a percentage of the species-specific total allowable catch.</p>",
