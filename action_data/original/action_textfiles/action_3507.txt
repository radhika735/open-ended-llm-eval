Two of the most common ones, installing barrier fencing and providing routes for reptiles to travel underneath or over roads, are often employed within the same scheme. This may entail regular roadside fencing with entrances to underpasses set further back away from the road or fencing may be designed to adjoin the sides of under or overpass entrances. Sometimes, fencing may be installed to form a funnel leading towards under or overpass entrances.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\" style=\"text-indent: 0cm;\">This intervention includes studies where these two actions are in place at the same site. In most studies, all under or overpasses (where there are multiple crossings) are beneath stretches or roads that have barrier fencing. In a minority, just some of the under or overpasses monitored are along stretches with barrier fencing. Studies included use of either conventional fencing, electric fences or other barriers, such as walls. Most studies report solely on the use of crossings or trends in numbers of reptiles killed on roads. There is an absence of studies reporting on wider population-level effects of the presence of these structures.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\" style=\"text-indent: 0cm;\">See <a href=\"../../actions/3508\"><em>Install tunnels/culverts/underpasses under roads/railways</em></a> or<a href=\"../../actions/3510\"><em> Install overpasses over roads/railways </em></a>for studies where under or overpasses are either installed without use of barriers or where it is not clear from the study that barriers were installed.

Lizards and snakes were recorded making 112 crossings, or 7 crossings/100 passage-days on average across 15 underpasses and two overpasses. Reptiles preferred culverts 2 m wide and used culverts or underpasses more frequently than overpasses. Fencing did not significantly affect relative crossing rates (data presented as statistical model result). Reptile crossing rates were lower in autumn–early spring and varied with habitat types. Fifteen dry culverts and passages (e.g. small roads and two overpasses, 13–64 m long, 1.2–6.0 m wide, 1.2–3.5 m high) along a 25 km section of high-speed railway, were monitored. The railway was fenced with 2 m high wire netting in July 1991–March 1992. Tracks in sand were monitored at each passage for 15–22 days/month between September 1991 and July 1992.</p>",

During the study &gt;200 individual turtle tracks and &gt;25 alligator tracks were observed in the culvert. There was no evidence of predation of turtles at the culvert. In 2000, vinyl fences (600–700 m long, 0.6 m high) were installed along each side of a four-lane causeway to divert animals towards a culvert (diameter: 3.5 m, length: 46.6 m, built in 1963–1965). The bottom fence edge was buried approximately 20 cm underground and fence ends curved away from the road after &gt;80–100 m. The highway and culvert were monitored using visual searches two–four times/day before (February–April 2000) and after (April 2000–November 2003) the construction of the fence (1,367 total survey days).</p>",
