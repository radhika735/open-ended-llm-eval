The banks are often managed to reduce vegetation cover, either by spraying with herbicide or by mechanical cutting (Giuliano <em>et al.</em> 2018). However, reduced management may enable vegetation cover to develop and flower abundance to increase, which may benefit butterflies and moths.</p>\r\n<p><sup>Giuliano D., Cardarelli E. &amp; Bogliani G.

On unmanaged banks, the abundance (1.2–12.2 individuals/100 m) and species richness (0.7–2.6 species/100 m) of butterflies was higher than on mown (abundance: 0.5–6.1 individuals/100 m; richness: 0.4–2.0 species/100 m) or sprayed banks (abundance: 0.1–2.3 individuals/100 m; richness: 0.1–1.1 species/100 m). Endangered large copper <em>Lycaena dispar </em>butterflies were present on more unmanaged banks (48 individuals) than on sprayed banks (10 individuals). See paper for other species results. Banks (1–2 m wide) between paddy fields on three farms were managed in one of three ways: sprayed with herbicide (Glyphosate) in April, mown 1–3 times between late April and August, or left unmanaged with permanent herbaceous cover. From April–September 2016, butterflies were surveyed monthly on 160–440-m-long transects on 30 field banks (13 sprayed, 13 mown, four unmanaged).</p>",
