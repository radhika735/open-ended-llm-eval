        "background_definitions": "<p><strong>Definition:</strong> ‘Natural rocky reef topography’ refers to the full fingerprint of substrate topography found in natural rocky habitats.<strong> </strong></p>\r\n<p>Topography influences the settlement and survival of marine organisms on intertidal rocky substrates. Variation in topography generates variation in the physical environment and plays an important role in sustaining biodiversity and ecological functioning (Levin 1974). On rocky reefs, many habitat features that offer refuge from physical stressors and predation, such as bumps, crevices and holes, are generated as a function of substrate topography and geomorphology. The full fingerprint of natural rocky reef topography encompasses a variety of habitat features of different scales interacting within a mosaic.</p>\r\n<p>Marine artificial structures often have much lower topographic variability than natural rocky reefs, which is thought to be a key reason for their reduced biodiversity (Firth <em>et al.</em> 2013; Moschella <em>et al.</em> 2005). Natural rocky reef topography can be created on intertidal artificial structures by moulding or casting material during construction or retrospectively (see Evans <em>et al.</em> 2021).</p>\r\n<p><strong>See also: </strong><a href=\"../../actions/3466\"><em>Create textured surfaces (≤1 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3475\"><em>Create pit habitats (1–50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3467\"><em>Create hole habitats (&gt;50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3473\"><em>Create groove habitats (1–50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3437\"><em>Create crevice habitats (&gt;50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3476\"><em>Create ‘rock pools’ on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>; <em><a href=\"../../actions/3462\">Create small protrusions (1–50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3463\">Create large protrusions (&gt;50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3464\">Create small ridges or ledges (1–50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</a></em>; <a href=\"../../actions/3465\"><em>Create large ridges or ledges (&gt;50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3474\"><em>Create groove habitats </em>and<em> small protrusions, ridges or ledges (1–50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>.</p>\r\n<p><sup>Evans A.J., Lawrence P.J., Natanzi A.S., Moore P.J., Davies A.J., Crowe T.P., McNally C., Thompson B., Dozier A.E. &amp; Brooks P.R.

After 18 months, macroalgae and mobile invertebrate species richness was similar on settlement plates with and without natural rocky reef topography (both 1 species/plate). Barnacle (Cirripedia) and mobile invertebrate abundances were higher on plates with topography than without at one site (barnacles: 72 vs 34% cover; mobiles: 3 vs 1 individuals/plate), but were statistically similar at two sites (barnacles: 48–93 vs 22–83%; mobiles: 1 vs 2–3/plate). Concrete settlement plates (150 × 150 mm) were made with and without natural rocky reef topography moulded from digital scans of a natural boulder surface. Eight plates with topography and eight without were randomly arranged at upper-midshore on each of three vertical concrete seawalls in April–May 2016. Macroalgae and invertebrates on plates were counted from photographs over 18 months.</p>",

Over four months, green macroalgae and adult and juvenile limpets were recorded on settlement plates with natural rocky reef topography. Limpets were seen using shaded grooves and water-retaining depressions created by the natural topography. Concrete settlement plates (250 × 250 mm) were made with natural rocky reef topography moulded from digital scans of natural reef surfaces. Natural surfaces were selected based on the biodiversity they supported and measured features of the underlying topography. They were designed to target high species richness, rare species, or species that were common on natural reefs but not on artificial structures. Plates with natural topography were attached on horizontal surfaces of two granite boulder breakwaters in August 2019 (A. Evans, <em>pers. comms.</em>). Macroalgae and invertebrates on plates were counted during low tide over four months.</p>",
