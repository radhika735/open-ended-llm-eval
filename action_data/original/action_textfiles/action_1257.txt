The average total height growth of both species was lower in cleared than control plots and highest following a spring burn (piled: 61 cm; autumn burn: 66; chopped: 71; pulled off site: 71; piled and burned: 72; control: 75; spring burn: 90). In 1989, seven treatment plots (0.3-3.2 ha) were established in each of four sites: control (untreated); woody debris pulled off site (using a cable system); chopped (debris mechanically chopped); debris piled and burned; debris piled; spring burn (low intensity spring broadcast-burn); autumn burn (low-to-medium intensity autumn broadcast-burn). All plots were clearcut in 1988 and planted with Douglas-fir or lodgepole pine seedlings in 1990. The height of 100 seedlings in each plot was measured at the end of the first and fifth growing seasons.</p><p> </p>",
