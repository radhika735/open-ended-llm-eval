Only four of 12 previously marked axolotls were recaptured; however, their weight had increased by 16%. Weight gain was greater than that of axolotls in control colonies over the same period. After four months, water was significantly lower in ammonia (77%), nitrates (87%) and turbidity (15%) compared to control canals. Working with farmers in 2009, a canal used as a refuge by axolotls was isolated from the main system using filters made of wood to exclude fish and improve water quality. Farmers benefited from improved farm products with the improved water quality and the protection of traditional agriculture.</p><p> </p>",
