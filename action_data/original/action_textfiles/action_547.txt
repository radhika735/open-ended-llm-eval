However, it is worth noting that species that forage in groups can have dominance hierarchies, which alter the relationship between weight and fitness. For example Gentle and Gosler (2001) found that, amongst great tits Parus major in Oxfordshire, England, more dominant birds had a lower mass than subdominants, particularly when perceived predation risk was high. Birds with lower masses are better able to take off and therefore escape predators than heavier birds (Krams 2002). However, because of their dominance, they were able to usurp other birds from food resources when hungry. Care should therefore be taken when interpreting results which do not directly examine survival.</p>\r\n<p>Krams, I.

This followed the establishment of an artificial feeding station in 1952, and the author attributes the population rise to supplementary food reducing winter mortality, although no data is provided for the use of the feeding station, any reduction in starvation or increase in reproductive productivity.

These were red-crowned cranes <em>Grus japonensis</em> in Hokkaido, Japan (Masatomi 1991); hooded cranes <em>G. monachus</em> and white-naped cranes <em>G. vipio</em> wintering at Izumi, Japan; common cranes <em>G. grus</em> at Lake Hornborga, Sweden; and demoiselle cranes <em>Anthropoides virgo</em> at Khichan in India. It is also possible that winter feeding of whooping cranes <em>G. americana</em> in 1993-4 may have encouraged population growth. The author recommends that supplementary feeding is viewed as a potential short-term practice, but that the risks from spreading disease and increased human disturbances may make it unsuitable as a long-term strategy.</p><p> </p>",
