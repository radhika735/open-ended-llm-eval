It could involve increasing the diversity or area of flowering crops or conserving aspects of the landscape, such as flower-rich meadows, woodlands or river banks, which provide important floral resources.</p>\r\n<p class=\"StyleSynopsisBodyTextItalic\">In Europe, recent research has shown that higher coverage of the mass-flowering crop, oilseed rape <em>Brassica napus</em>, in the landscape is associated with higher numbers of foraging worker bumblebees <em>Bombus</em> spp. at focal sampling points, but not with enhanced bumblebee reproductive success or colony densities (Westphal <em>et al.</em> 2003, Herrmann <em>et al</em>. 2007, Westphal <em>et al</em>. 2009). This work is not summarized by Conservation Evidence because the evidence is correlative, the area of flowering crops was not increased as a conservation measure.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"StyleSynopsisBodyTextItalic\">Westphal C., Steffan-Dewenter I. &amp; Tscharntke T.
