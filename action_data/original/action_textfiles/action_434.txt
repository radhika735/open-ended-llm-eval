The authors note that this may be due to the small sample size in the study. This study also discusses other interventions, in ‘Add perches to electricity pylons to reduce electrocution’, ‘Bury or isolate power lines’, ‘Use signs and access restrictions to reduce disturbance at nest sites’ and ‘Foster eggs or chicks with wild conspecifics’.</p><p> </p>",

This was despite the fact that the medicated areas did not have larger broods or higher hatching success (medicated areas: 9.6 eggs/clutch, 90% hatching success for 161 clutches; control areas: 9.4 eggs/clutches, 94% hatching rate for 153 clutches).

Across both symptomatic and asymptomatic chicks, treated chicks had higher survival rates than untreated chicks (62% survival of 129 treated vs. 27% of 123 untreated).

Across sites on both the island and mainland Mauritius, survival of treated birds (both juveniles and adults) was significantly higher than untreated birds (74% survival of 19 treated birds vs. 25% survival for 24 untreated). Providing medicated water to all individuals on Ile aux Aigrettes did not reduce the incidence of trichononiasis in the subpopulation, with birds becoming re-infected after treatment stopped.</p><p> </p>",
