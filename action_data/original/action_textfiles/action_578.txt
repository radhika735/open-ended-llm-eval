However, reproduction was extremely low, with only two young reared to independence and a third hand-reared in captivity. Between 1974 and 1992, 65 kakapo were translocated from Stewart Island (1,746 km<sup>2</sup>, South Island) to Maud Island (300 ha, South Island; 1974-81: nine birds; 1989-91; six birds), Little Barrier Island (3,055 ha; 1982: 22 birds), Codfish Island (1,480 ha; 1987-92: 30 birds) and Mana Island (217 ha; 1992: two males). Translocations occurred because kakapos were suffering extremely high mortality rates due to predation by introduced mammalian predators (particularly cats <em>Felis catus </em>and stoats <em>Mustela erminea</em>) on Stewart Island. Such predators were removed from target islands prior to translocations.</p><p> </p>",

Survival two months after release was significantly higher for wild birds caught as adults, compared to parrots caught as juveniles or captive-bred birds, either parent- or hand-reared (6.3% survival for 16 captive-bred, parent-reared birds vs. 0% for four hand-reared birds, 0% for four wild birds caught at juveniles and 43% for 65 wild birds caught as adults). Translocated birds were known to fly more than 110 km away from the release site, with small groups returning each autumn to the Chiricahua Mountains, where at least one pair producing two fledglings.

In addition, birds have dispersed to other nearby islands and have bred on them. A further 18 birds were released in 2009, but were not monitored. One bird translocated in 2008 died before release due to trauma and disease, and one female caught in 2009 was very weak and was therefore returned to Little Barrier Island without being released. It is not clear how the other birds died (or if they were just not seen during surveys). Parakeets were caught using mist nets and held in aviaries on Little Barrier Island for up to six days before transport to Motuihe Island by helicopter. Birds were supplied with fruit, water and grains in excess and released immediately upon arrival at a forest fragment on Motuihe.</p><p> </p>",
