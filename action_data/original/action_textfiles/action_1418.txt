            "paragraph_text": "<p class=\"Interventionparagraph\">A replicated, randomized controlled study in 1993–2002 in wetlands in central California, USA, found lower plant diversity in one of two habitats in lightly, compared to moderately, grazed plots. Herbaceous plant cover increased in lightly, but decreased in moderately, grazed plots. Species composition of plant communities differed, but variability did not, between lightly and moderately grazed plots for one of two habitats. <strong>Plants: </strong>Two measures of plant diversity were lower in lightly, compared to moderately, grazed plots alongside creeks, but not at springs (data reported as model results). Herbaceous plant cover increased over time in lightly grazed plots, but decreased in moderately grazed plots (data reported as model results). The species composition of plant communities varied between lightly and moderately grazed plots (data reported as ordination results). Plant community variability did not differ between lightly and moderately grazed plots (data presented as coefficients of variation). <strong>Methods: </strong>In 1993, three wetlands in each of three watersheds were assigned to either light grazing (reducing dry matter to 250 g/m<sup>2</sup>) or moderate grazing (reducing dry matter to 150 g/m<sup>2</sup>). Plots of 2–5 ha were established at springs and creeks in each wetland. Vegetation biomass was sampled each year in 1993–1998 from three 0.0625 m<sup>2</sup> quadrats in each plot and plant communities sampled with transects in 1993–2002.</p><p> </p>",

Cover of native species was higher in plots with medium, rather than high, grazing intensity in plots sown with native perennial grasses (17% vs 22% cover), but there was no difference in plots sown with two types of non-native assemblages (2–3%). <strong>Methods: </strong>In 2007 four experimental blocks were established across two pastures. Each block was split into three areas, sown with one of three vegetation types: native perennial grasses, non-native annual forage grasses, or a non-native, non-edible annual weed. These were then divided into six plots, which were subjected to one of three treatments, each replicated twice: no manipulation, mowing and trampling by cattle to simulate medium cattle grazing, or mowing and trampling by cattle to simulate heavy cattle grazing. Plants were surveyed in a 1 m<sup>2</sup> quadrat in May 2008–2010.</p><p> </p>",

The cover of three of five plant functional groups varied between moderately and heavily grazed plots. <strong>Plants: </strong>Plant diversity did not differ between moderately and heavily grazed plots (data not reported). Cover of tall annual grasses was higher in moderately, compared to heavily, grazed plots for two out three grazing timings (7–52% vs 2–23% cover, no difference for early-grazed plots). Cover of short grasses was lower in moderately, compared to heavily, grazed plots (1–30% vs 3–41%), with the biggest differences in continuously, rather than seasonally, grazed plots. Cover of tall perennial grasses was lower under moderately, compared to heavily, grazed plots for one of three grazing timings, but this difference had gone by the end of the study. There were no differences in cover of perennial or annual non-grass plants between grazing intensities. <strong>Methods: </strong>In 1993 eight plots were established with half grazed continuously (January–October) and half grazed seasonally. In seasonal plots, half the plot was grazed early (January–April/May) and half late (April/May–October). In addition, half the plots were subject to moderate grazing (0.55 or 1.1 cow-calf pairs/ha for continuous and seasonal respectively) and half to heavy (1.1 or 2.2 cow-calf pairs/ha). Plants were surveyed every spring every two steps along permanent transects.</p><p> </p>",
