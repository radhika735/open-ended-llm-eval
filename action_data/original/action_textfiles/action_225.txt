In winter 2005/6, 1,390-1,564 seed-eaters were recorded on barley stubbles compared to 48 on grass fields and 406 on maize. Large insect-eating birds (thrushes) were far more abundant on grass fields in winter (2,272 birds in total, compared to 28-789 on other field types. Winter wheat and spring barley were sown in 16 trial fields, each on a separate farm in Cheshire, Staffordshire and north Shropshire. Neighbouring maize or short-term grass silage fields were monitored for comparison. Plants, invertebrates and birds were monitored on each field, in summer 2005 and winter 2005/06.</p><p> </p>",

Maize planted for silage was little used by birds in summer or winter. These results are reported in more detail by Peach et al. (2011).

Each farm contained two CBWCS fields (autumn-sown wheat, 5.3 ha, and spring-sown barley, 4.4 ha), one maize field (6.1 ha) and one grass field (2.1 ha). During summer, a total of 1,535 seed-eaters and 1,901 swallows and martins were found on barley CBWCS fields, compared with 847 and 197 for wheat CBWCS fields; 441 and 95 for maize fields; and 41 and  480 for grass fields. Northern lapwing <em>Vanellus vanellus</em>, insect-eating species, and crows did not use CBWCS fields more than other types in summer. In winter, seed-eating species (seed-eating songbirds, Eurasian skylark <em>Alauda arvensis</em>, meadow pipit <em>Anthus pratensis</em>) used barley stubbles extensively, whilst insect-eating species used other crop stubbles more. The authors argue that CBWCS (with selectively applied herbicide, retention of over-winter stubbles and delayed harvesting) offer a practical conservation measure for seed-eating farmland birds. This study uses data from Defra report number BD1448 (Defra 2007).</p><p> </p>",
