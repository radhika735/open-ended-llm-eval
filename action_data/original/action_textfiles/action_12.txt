On five farms with the agri-environment scheme, researchers counted an average of around nine nest-searching queens/100 m on grassy field margins, compared to around seven nest-searching queens/100 m in species-rich grassland transects, five for conventional arable field margins, and four on unmanaged (abandoned) grassland transects. The study did not record the numbers of established nests later in the year.</p>",
