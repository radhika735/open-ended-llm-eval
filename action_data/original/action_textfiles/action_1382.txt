More water was used in plots with cover crops in one of three time-periods (budbreak–bloom: 2.1–3.3 vs 1.6–2.9 mm/day), but less was used in one of three time-periods, in one of two years (veraison–harvest: 0.83–0.89 vs 1.2 mm/day). <strong>Implementation options: </strong>Similar amounts of water were used by vines and other vegetation in plots with different types of cover crops (resident vegetation or sown grasses and legumes) between the vine rows (226–372 vs 241–383 mm/year). <strong>Methods:</strong> There were four plots for each of two cover-cropping treatments (resident vegetation or sown cover crops, both without tillage between the vine rows), and there were four control plots (with tillage between the vine rows; depth not reported). The plots were four vine rows each (100 vines/row). The sown cover crops were 60% grasses (<em>Lolium </em>and <em>Festuca </em>spp.) and 40% legumes (<em>Trifolium </em>spp.), sown in March 2002. The interrows of all plots were mown (treatments: twice/year, in February and May–June; controls: once/year, in February, height not reported). All plots were fertilized, and herbicide was used under the vines. Soil water content was measured between budbreak (early February) and harvest (capacitance probes, 10–100 cm depth, three samples/plot).
