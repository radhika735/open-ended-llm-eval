The number of newts captured at the site increased from 473 in 1992 to 892 in 1993 (1,063 released). Between one and 223 metamorphs were caught leaving created ponds and 1–197 leaving existing ponds each year from 1991 to 1993. In 1990–1991, three ponds were created and three others managed for amphibians within a mitigation area for works at the mine. Artificial egg laying substrate (plastic strips) was provided in new ponds. A total of 813 newts in 1991, 250 in 1992 and 625 in 1993 were translocated from mine to conservation ponds.

However, longer-term monitoring over 6–18 years showed that 53% of 15 translocations before 1990 failed. In 1990–1994, adults returned in subsequent years in 92% of 92 cases monitored, although newts were already present at 10 ponds. Seventy-two translocations from development sites involved adults (average: 197; total: 13,115), juveniles (57; 914), larvae (32; 501) and many eggs. Twelve translocations involved collecting eggs and rearing and releasing larvae (average: 643) and juveniles (63) for introduction purposes. Habitat enhancement (e.g. log piles, hibernacula, tree planting) was undertaken in 79% of 28 cases where there was partial habitat destruction. Where there was complete habitat destruction, newts tended to be moved to existing sites. Licenses for all translocation projects between 1990 and 1994 were reviewed and 74 licensees contacted for information. Extra monitoring information was obtained for translocations undertaken before 1990.</p><p> </p>",

Only 49% of projects monitored populations, most for two years or less. The average number of newts translocated per project declined significantly from 358 in 1990–1994 to 172 in 1995–2001. Most translocations were to areas within or adjacent to the development site (&lt;500 m). There was a net loss in overall area of aquatic habitat.
