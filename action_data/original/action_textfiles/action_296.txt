However, results in one fishery (for<strong> </strong>Pacific cod <em>Gadus macrocephalus</em> and walleye pollock <em>Theragra chalcogramma</em> fishery, southeast of the Pribilof Islands, USA) were due purely to reductions in northern fulmars <em>Fulmarus glacialis</em> caught, with shearwater <em>Puffinus </em>spp. bycatch remaining constant. In the second fishery (for Pacific halibut <em>Hippoglossus stenolepis</em> and sablefish <em>Anoplopoma fimbria </em>in the Gulf of Alaska and Aleutian Islands, USA), removing the single line set with the highest bycatch (of 27 birds) made the reduction in bycatch non-significant. A further trial in 2000 found no birds were caught on weighted or unweighted lines set under a streamer line (see ‘Use streamer lines to reduce seabird bycatch on longlines’. Weighted lines had 4.5 kg weights every 90 m. This study is also discussed in ‘Use a line shooter to reduce seabird bycatch’, ‘Set longlines at night to reduce seabird bycatch’ and ‘Set lines underwater to reduce seabird bycatch’.</p><p> </p>",
