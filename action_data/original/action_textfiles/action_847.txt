Overall, 55% of frogs left patches of trees within 72 hours of being released. However, frogs were less likely to leave with increasing patch size and stream density. Frogs did not tend to move towards patches unless released within 20 m. However, when given a choice, frogs moved towards large patches (0.8 ha) significantly more and small patches (0.3 ha) significantly less than expected. Forest blocks had been harvested two years previously with 5–30% of trees retained. Ten radio-collared frogs were released at the centre of 20 tree patches or at individual trees (canopy areas 1–3 ha) and monitored for 72 hours. Another 10 frogs were released at each of four randomly located tree patches and four other random locations and were monitored for six days. Seven frogs were released from each of four points equal distances from three different size patches (0.3–0.8 ha). Ten frogs were released at five distances (5–80 m) from two patches.</p><p> </p>",
