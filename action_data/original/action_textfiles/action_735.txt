Both trials determined that families of salmon, <em>Salmo salar</em>, bred with high resistance to infectious pancreatic necrosis, showed higher survivorship compared to salmon bred with lower resistance. Mortality levels in fry were 29.3% and 66.6%, respectively. The unexposed controls were 1.0% and 3.2%, respectively. The same result pattern was observed in smolt (32.0% and 79.0% mortality levels, respectively). Salmon used in the experiment were offspring from the 2001 and 2004-2005 breeding seasons. Families were selected either for high or low resistance to infectious pancreatic necrosis. The first experiment used fry in fresh water. Groups of high resistance and low resistance fish were exposed through bathing. One group of each remained unexposed as the control. Mortality levels were observed between 30-50 days after infection.</p><p> </p>",
