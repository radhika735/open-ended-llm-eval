Designs may include size-selective exits, preventing pests but allowing natural enemies (such as parasitoid wasps) to leave and disperse. Conventional practices of removing and destroying pest-infested crop foliage can reduce natural enemy numbers, but using the foliage in mass-emergence devices instead may relocate natural enemies back into the crop.</p>\r\n<p>We found no studies testing this action in a farmed environment, but one study of urban trees is presented here as preliminary evidence.</p>",

There was no effect of mass-emergence devices (or timing of application) at the second site (4-14% leafminers parasitised in treated trees vs. 5-15% in controls). Leaf loss caused by leafminers was similar in mass-emergence (3-54% defoliation) and control (3-63%) trees at both sites. Devices were placed in horse chestnut <em>Aesculus hippocastanum</em> trees to control leafminer damage using parasitoid wasps (Hymenoptera). Devices were 200 l plastic tubs with four openings covered in a tissue filter with 600 µm mesh size – allowing wasps (but not leafminers) to develop, emerge and disperse into the trees. Horse chestnut leaf litter containing leafminers and parasitoids was placed inside the tubs (10 kg/device). Ten blocks of horse chestnut trees were selected (five at each site) and devices were hung in three trees/block. Two trees had devices (1 device/tree, applied 20 March and 23 May, respectively) and a control tree had no device.</p>",
