They placed 'Checkmite strips' (containing the organophosphate coumaphos) in various positions inside or on the packages and intentionally introduced ten or twenty adult beetles. More than half the beetles escaped from the packages through a ventilation panel and were not trapped or recovered. A Checkmite strip hanging in the middle of the package killed 94% of the remaining beetles. Beetles were not lured out of the packages by light traps.</p>",
