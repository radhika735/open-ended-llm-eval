In total, 24 of 31 grassed riparian buffer strips were used by up to five snake species. Brown snakes <em>Storeria dekayi</em> (2.9 snakes/100 coverboards) and eastern garter snakes <em>Thamnophis sirtalis </em>(1.8 snakes/100 coverboards) were most abundant, followed by plains garter snake <em>Thamnophis radix</em> (0.8 snakes/100 coverboards), smooth green snakes <em>Lioclonorophis vernalis</em> (0.5 snakes/100 coverboards) and fox snakes <em>Elaphe vulpine </em>(0.4 snakes/100 coverboards). In May–August 2003, snakes were surveyed in 31 grassed waterways (&gt;400 m apart) in crop fields (corn <em>Zea mays</em> and soybean <em>Glycine max</em>) that were established as part of the US government’s National Conservation Buffer Initiative. Surveys were carried out using wooden coverboards (0.9 x 0.9 m) placed along each waterway (4–5 coverboards/waterway, 150 total coverboards). Observers checked each waterway for snakes weekly (12 checks/waterway, 1,800 total coverboard surveys).</p>",
