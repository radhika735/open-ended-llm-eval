In 1976, seven paddocks were established with fences (2.5–10 ha/paddock, 10 sheep/paddock), each with a different stocking rate (1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, or 4 sheep/ha).

Each block was split into eighteen plots and subjected to one of three treatments: no manipulation; mowing and trampling by cattle to simulate medium cattle grazing; mowing and trampling by cattle to simulate heavy cattle grazing. Soil nitrogen availability was measured in December 2009–March 2010 using ion exchange resin bags. Soil respiration was measured in February 2010.</p><p> </p>",
