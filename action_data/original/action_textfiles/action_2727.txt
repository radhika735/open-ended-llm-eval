        "background_definitions": "<p>Trawling is a method of fishing that involves pulling a fishing net (trawl) through the water behind one or more vessels. Trawls may be fitted with devices to allow unwanted catch to escape (often termed “bycatch reduction devices”). A variety of unwanted catch reduction devices have been developed aiming to enable specific sizes or groups of unwanted fish to escape the trawl net. These include rigid or flexible size-sorting or excluder grids, and also large square-, or diamond-mesh panels, fitted into the codend of a trawl net (Sinclair &amp; Valdimarsson 2003). Positioning of both types of devices as well as opening size, mesh size or bar spacing and orientation can affect the type and sizes at which fish can escape.</p>\r\n<p>Evidence for the individual effects of mesh escape panels/windows and size-sorting escape grids in trawl nets is summarized under ‘<em>Fishing gear modification - <a href=\"../../actions/2716\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fit mesh escape panels/windows to a trawl net</a>’</em>, <a href=\"../../actions/2720\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>‘Fit a size-sorting escape grid (rigid or flexible) to a fish trawl net’ </em></a>and <a href=\"../../actions/2721\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>‘Fit a size-sorting escape grid (rigid or flexible) to a prawn/shrimp trawl net’</em></a>.

In the first of two trials, catch weights of unwanted fish in nets with a square mesh window and a rigid grid (Nordmøre) were reduced by 29–39% relative to a conventional net. In the second trial (commercial conditions), a square mesh window and grid (Super Shooter) caught fewer sharks (3) and stingrays (0) compared to a conventional trawl net (sharks: 12, stingrays: 2). Shark and stingray data were not tested statistically. In addition, target prawn <em>Penaeidae</em> catches were reduced by 17–34% in the square mesh window/Nordmøre system and average catch weight decreased from 41 kg in conventional nets to 38 kg in the square mesh window/Super Shooter system. Catch data were collected from deployments of two modifications of a standard prawn trawl net with a diamond mesh codend, each with a square mesh escape window grid fitted behind a rigid size-sorting grid (Nordmøre or Super Shooter) (see original paper for gear specifications). The modified nets were towed in paired deployments with other modified net designs and/or standard unmodified nets in Australia’s Northern Prawn Fishery area; during experimental trials in October 1995 (73 paired tows, 2h duration) and in commercial trials in October 1996 (24 paired tows, 2–3 h duration).</p>",

Compared to a standard net, trawl nets with the square mesh panel located in the rear section of the codend further away from the grid, reduced the non-target catches of two of seven non-commercial, and two of three commercial fish species, by between 50–76% in number and 47–73% by weight (see original paper for species individual data). Catches of the five other species were similar between the nets. No differences in non-target catches of the 10 fish species were found between the net with a grid and panel located forward of the codend (nearer the grid) and the standard net (see original paper for species individual data). In addition, the total catch weights of the target prawns <em>Penaeidae</em> were reduced in both grid/panel nets, by 12–14%. In August 2000, two sets of 10 paired trawl deployments (40 min each) were done in Shark Bay using one of two designs of modified trawl and a standard trawl net (47 mm diamond mesh, no grid or panel) simultaneously. The modified trawl nets were standard nets fitted with a Nordmøre rigid grid (100 mm bar spacing) located in front of the codend, and a square mesh escape panel (47, 94 and 155 mm mesh sections) at either the rear or front section of the codend (see original paper for gear specifications).

Data were not statistically tested. The proportion (by number) of individuals of commercially targeted fish below their respective minimum landing sizes that escaped was 62–79% (grid) and 8–15% (square mesh window) for two bottom dwelling species; and 0–14% (grid) and 60–100% (window) for two pelagic commercial species. For non-target species, the percentage (by weight) of escaped individuals of one bottom dwelling species was 48% (grid) and 1% (window), and for two pelagic species the grid excluded 13–17% and the window 17–72%. In September 2003, a total of 26 trawl net deployments were done by research vessel off the north west coast of Portugal at 40–150 m depth. Trawl nets were fitted with either a Nordmøre grid (plastic, 1.5 × 1 m, 30 mm bar spacing) on its own (17 hauls), or a Nordmøre grid and a square mesh window (1.8 m long, 50 mm mesh size) inserted just behind the top section of the grid (9 hauls). A ‘flapper’ net guided catch to the bottom of the grid, the upper 40 cm of which had no bars to allow retained catch to pass into the codend, while catch that passed through the grid (excluded) was retained by an inner net. A cover attached over the square mesh window collected fish escaping through the meshes of the window (see original paper for gear specifications).
