        "background_definitions": "<p class=\"Background\">One potential problem with captive breeding is that it limits the effective population of a species to the number of captive individuals that are available to interbreed. This could lead to inbreeding depression and a loss of fitness. Similarly, the different selection pressures on individuals in captivity may alter the physiology of captive populations, as has occurred in domesticated species.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">It is important to note that low genetic diversity, inbreeding and changes due to captivity do not necessarily lead to reduced fitness. Care should therefore be taken in interpreting the results from the studies below.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",
