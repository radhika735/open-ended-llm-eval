Settlement preferences and competition lead to some species being more abundant than others on certain materials (Green <em>et al.</em> 2012; Iveša <em>et al.</em> 2010), but patterns vary by environmental conditions. Physical (lithology, hardness, porosity, colour, texture) and chemical (pH, mineralogy, toxicity) properties of rock and manufactured materials can affect how they weather over time and what communities develop on them (Coombes <em>et al.</em> 2011). </p>\r\n<p>Marine artificial structures are often made from hard quarried rock, concrete, wood, steel or plastic, according to engineering requirements, cost and/or availability. Synthetic materials can be associated with the presence of non-native species (Dafforn 2017), whereas structures made from natural rock may support more natural rocky reef communities. There may be opportunities to use more environmentally-sensitive materials in structures or in eco-engineering habitat designs added to structures to enhance their biodiversity. Concrete is commonly-used in eco-engineering since it is durable and easy to mould into complex shapes. Yet adding manufactured concrete habitats to structures to enhance biodiversity may not deliver a net environmental gain because of the large CO<sub>2</sub> footprint of concrete production (Heery <em>et al.</em> 2020). Concrete mixes can be manipulated to alter their physical and chemical properties (McManus <em>et al.</em> 2018; Natanzi <em>et al.</em> 2021) and environmental footprint (Dennis <em>et al.</em> 2018). Lower-footprint materials may be preferable, regardless of their effect on colonizing biodiversity; a neutral/no effect on biodiversity may still offer a higher net environmental gain (or lower net loss).</p>\r\n<p>It is often not possible to separate the effects of the various physical and chemical properties of materials on biodiversity. Studies that directly examine the effects of creating different surface textures are included under the action “<a href=\"../../actions/3466\"><em>Create textured surfaces (≤1 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>”; any other material comparisons are considered here. There are bodies of literature investigating the effects of material on settlement behaviour and ecological interactions in the laboratory and field (e.g. Anderson 1996; Iveša <em>et al.</em> 2010; Herbert &amp; Hawkins 2006) and for anti-fouling applications (e.g. Hanson &amp; Bell 1976). These studies are not included in this synopsis, which focusses on <em>in situ </em>conservation actions to promote colonization of biodiversity on marine artificial structures.</p>\r\n<p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href=\"../../actions/3466\"><em>Create textured surfaces (≤1 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>.</p>\r\n<p><sup>Anderson M.J.
