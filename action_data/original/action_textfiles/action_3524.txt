Of the total number of snakes found during the study (172 individuals), the percentage that were dead on the road was similar before (19% dead) and after signs were installed (24%) in summer, but lower after signs were installed in autumn (after 13%; before 32%). Road signs warning motorists of snakes were installed in 1981 (month not given). Surveys for snakes were conducted on a prairie and bordering roads and dykes, and trapping was carried out using drift fences with wire-mesh funnel traps (number and timing of surveys not provided). </p>",

After putting up road signs and running an awareness campaign, lesser Antillean iguana road mortality reduced by approximately 50% (0.3 fatal collisions/day) on coastal roads compared to beforehand (0.6 fatal collisions/day). An awareness campaign about protecting iguanas was carried out in May 2008–June 2010. On 1 July 2009, road signs asking people to slow for iguanas were put up on coastal roads near known nesting locations (see original paper for details). The campaign included lectures at schools, presentations to government employees, radio and television interviews and distributing bumper stickers across the island asking people to slow down for iguanas. Two coastal road segments (11–29 km long) were surveyed for iguanas during the nesting season from April 2008–June 2010, 122 days before signs were put up and 94 days afterwards.</p>",
