This practice can be extremely damaging for some slow-reproducing species (Ewins 1997) and is made more so by the greater value of, and demand for, rarer species’ eggs. This has led to the prohibition of egg collecting in many countries, but the practice still continues.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">Marking eggs in a non-damaging way may reduce the desirability of eggs because collectors are interested in eggs for their aesthetic appeal.</p>\r\n<p>Ewins, P.J.
