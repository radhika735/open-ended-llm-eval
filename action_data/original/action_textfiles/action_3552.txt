A similar number of turtles were caught when lines were retrieved immediately (immediate retrieval: 0.18 turtles/1,000 hooks) or left in the water for longer periods (1–2 hour soak: 0.34 turtles/1,000 hooks; &gt;2 hours soak: 0.49 turtles/1,000 hooks; 16 turtles in total). Mortality rates of turtles caught accidentally were lower when bottom longlines were retrieved immediately (0/3 turtles died) compared to when longlines were retrieved after 1–2 hours (2/6 turtles died) or after more than 2 hours (5/7 turtles died). Turtle data was collected by onboard observers in 38 bottom longline deployments during 20 randomly selected fishing trips (1–3 deployments/trip) in July–September 2007–2008. Longline deployments consisted of a 10–12 km longline anchored to the seabed with 1 m long branchlines with hooks (48,020 total hooks deployed). Frozen Sardinella <em>Sardinella aurita</em> or common cuttlefish <em>Sepia officinalis</em> were used as bait. Longline deployments took place at any time of day and lines were retrieved either immediately, after 1–2 hours, or after &gt;2 hours.</p>",

The amount of time lines were in the water did not affect the chance of catching turtles (data presented as statistical model results) over the range of durations surveyed (around 8–12 hours). Duration was measured as the time between the line being set and when it was hauled in and varied between around 8–12 hours. Pelagic Observer Program data from (1992–2015) was used to determine the number of turtles caught/1,000 hooks, and variation in the amount of time lines were deployed for was used to test its effect on bycatch.</p>",
