If seeds or individuals of non-native species escape into the wild, they may invade native ecosystems, altering habitat structure or directly competing with, predating or parasitizing native butterflies and moths. Regulating the sale of potentially problematic species may help to reduce the number which are accidentally released, and reduce the chances of an invasion happening.</p>",
