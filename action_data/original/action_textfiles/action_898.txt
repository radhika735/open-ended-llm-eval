Soil pore interconnectivity is a measure of how connected air spaces in the soil are. High pore interconnectivity is an indicator of good soil health. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are a group of fungi that live around the roots of plants. By living together, the fungi and host plant benefit each other: the fungi can live in a habitat without having to compete for resources and have a supply of carbon from the plant, while they provide an enhanced supply of nutrients to the plant, improving plant growth, the ability to reproduce and tolerance to drought. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonise a wide variety of host plants, including grasses, herbs, agricultural crops and legumes (Bardgett 2005). Measuring the level of arbuscular mycorrhizal proteins present in the soil enables us to estimate how abundant it is. Soil microbial respiration is the production of carbon dioxide (CO₂) when soil organisms respire (breaking down molecules to produce energy),and can be used to measure microbial activity.</p>\r\n<p>Bardgett (2005) <em>The Biology of Soil: A community and ecosystem approach</em>.

The study used six treatments in an old banana <em>Musa spp. </em>system: control without cover crop, a self-seeded cover crop, a grass <em>Paspalum notatum</em> cv. common, and three legumes (perennial soybean <em>Neonotonia wightii</em>, tropical kudzu <em>Pueraria phaseoloides</em>, and Brazilian Lucerne <em>Stylosanthes guyanensis</em>). There were three replicate plots of each treatment, giving a total of 18 plots. Four soil samples were taken from each plot twice, once at 16 and again at 20 months after the experiment was established. Soil samples were then mixed prior to analysis in the laboratory.</p><p> </p>",

There were three replicates of five management treatments including: residual herbicide use; ploughing (4 times a year to 20 cm depth); ploughing then sown oats (as before, then oats sown in spring); addition of oat straw mulch; land abandonment (control). Plots were 6 × 10 m. Soil under native vegetation was used as a reference. Six soil samples from each plot were taken annually to 5 cm depth. Five rainfall simulations were also conducted during the summer drought period on 1 m<sup>2</sup> plots. Simulations lasted one hour at 55 mm/h (simulating thunderstorm rain levels). The study measured soil organic matter, arbuscular mycorrhizal proteins, aggregate stability and soil erosion.</p><p> </p>",

Microbial respiration was highest in soil under the ryegrass-compost combination (282 μg carbon dioxide/g dry soil), compared to ryegrass/vetch with no compost (126 μg carbon dioxide). Tomato <em>Lycopersicon esculentum</em> yield was higher in soils after the ryegrass-compost treatment (44 kg/ha) than in ryegrass/vetch with no compost (22 kg/ha). It was not clear whether these effects were due to the cover crop or compost treatments. Two cover crop treatments were sown into soil between crops: ryegrass and ryegrass with vetch. Within these were two compost treatments: compost (25 t/ha dairy compost, but reduced to 12.5 t/ha in 2009) and no compost. There were four replications. Cover crops were mowed and incorporated into the soil before tomato seedlings were transplanted into 7.6 x 0.6 m beds. Four soil samples were taken to 15 cm depth from each treatment during the growing season.</p><p> </p>",
