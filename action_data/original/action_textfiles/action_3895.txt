The growth and survival of both eastern tiger swallowtail and spicebush swallowtail caterpillars exposed to a large quantity of genetically modified pollen (eastern tiger, survival: 83%, growth: 0.15 mg/mg/day; spicebush, survival: 81%, growth: 0.15) were similar to those exposed to the same quantity of non-genetically modified pollen (eastern tiger, survival: 88%, growth: 0.15 mg/mg/day; spicebush, survival: 83%, growth: 0.14 mg/mg/day), but both were lower than caterpillars which were not exposed to any maize pollen (eastern tiger, survival: 100%, growth: 0.30 mg/mg/day; spicebush, survival: 100%, growth: 0.30 mg/mg/day). The growth rates of caterpillars exposed to smaller quantities of genetically modified or non-genetically modified pollen were similar to those exposed to large quantities (data not presented). Forty-two eastern tiger swallowtail and 28 spicebush swallowtail caterpillars were fed tulip tree <em>Liriodendron tulipfera</em> or spicebush <em>Lindera benzoin </em>leaves dusted with either genetically modified or non-genetically modified maize pollen, at both 1% and 10% fresh leaf weight, or with no pollen dusting. Survival and growth rate were measured after 48 hours.</p>",
