The effects of fencing and predator control cannot be separated. The number of geckos and skinks were similar in the fenced area (with fox and cat control) and unfenced (fox control or no control) area (geckos: 1–2 individuals/trap grid; skinks: 2 individuals/trap grid). Dragon lizard numbers were lower in the fenced area with fox and cat control (fox and cat control: 2 individuals/trap grid) compared to unfenced areas with fox control (fox control only: 5 individuals/trap grid) and unfenced, no control areas (no predator control: 7 individuals/trap grid). In areas with predator control, there was no clear change in reptile numbers from before control began (0–24 individuals/group/year) compared to the three years after control began (0–12 individuals/group/year). In 1991, a mainland peninsula was divided into three areas: one area (12 km<sup>2</sup>) where cats and foxes were controlled (using electrified fencing, poison baiting, or secondary poisoning by poisoning European rabbits <em>Oryctolagus cuniculus</em>, trapping or shooting); one area (120–200 km<sup>2</sup>) where foxes were controlled by baiting but cats were not targeted; and one area where no control occurred. Reptiles were monitored with six pitfall-trap and drift fence grids in each area (18 in total). Each grid had eight pitfall traps, 30–50 m apart. Sampling was conducted over three consecutive days in March–April and June–July in 1990–1994 in predator control areas and 1992–1994 in the area without predator control. Reptiles captured included dragon lizards, skinks, geckos, snakes, and a species of monitor lizard and blind snake but only species that could be toe clipped (dragon lizards, skinks and geckos) were included in analysis.</p>",

            "paragraph_text": "<p>A study in 2009–2012 in an area of mixed shrub and grassland in Otago, New Zealand (Norbury <em>et al. </em>2014) found that survival of captive-bred Otago skinks <em>Oligosoma otagense</em> released into an enclosure was higher for those released when house mice<em> Mus musculus</em> had been eradicated compared to when skinks were released in the presence of mice. Authors reported that post-release survival was higher for skinks released with no mice present (44%) compared to survival of skinks released just prior to reinvasion by mice (15%; see paper for details). Survival of established skinks (2 years after their release) after the mouse reinvasion was higher (91%) than for newly released skinks in the presence of mice (17%). In 2009, a 0.3 ha area was enclosed within a mammal resistant fence (1.9 m high) and over a six month period, all mammals inside the enclosure were eradicated using a range of baited traps. After eradication, 12 captive-bred adult skinks were released in the enclosure following eight weeks in quarantine. In 2011, an additional 16 skinks were quarantined and released. House mice reinvaded during 2012 and were again eradicated using live capture traps and poison bait stations. In 2009–2012, starting 7–10 days after release, skinks were monitored every 15 days by a walking survey of the enclosure.</p>",

Gopher tortoise hatchling predation by vertebrate predators in enclosures with overhead netting was the same (3 individuals) as in enclosures with no netting. Enclosures with overhead netting had fewer signs of vertebrate predators (mammals, birds and snakes) compared to those without (signs included raccoon <em>Procyon lotor</em> digging and tracks, no data provided). In May–June 2014, wild-laid gopher tortoise nests were relocated to eight fenced 0.2 ha enclosures (four nests/enclosure, two eggs/nest, 64 total eggs). All nests were covered with cloth cages (30 x 30 x 12 cm). Four of eight enclosures were covered with game farm netting and UV twine to exclude aerial and terrestrial vertebrate predators (mammals, birds and snakes). Four enclosures (two with overhead netting; two without netting) were also treated with insecticide to reduce fire ant numbers. Nests were monitored weekly until two weeks before expected emergence, daily thereafter and excavated after 120 days. Hatchlings were radio tracked (16 individuals each from insecticide-treated and untreated enclosures) from August 2014 to March 2015.</p>",

Average reptile abundance doubled over two years in plots with exclusion fencing and fire suppression (2013: 0.3 reptiles/plot; 2015: 0.7 reptiles/plot; results standardised by sampling effort), compared to plots without fencing (2013: 0.6 reptiles/plot; 2015: 0.5 reptiles/plot; results standardised by sampling effort). The effects of fencing and/or fire suppression on species richness was inconclusive (see original paper for details). Cat density in the study area was 0.2 cats/km<sup>2</sup>. Cats were detected at all non-fenced plots during the study. Only one cat was found and removed from a fenced plot (within one week of fence completion). Data were collected from six plots (64 ha) with two each treated with: exclusion fencing and fire suppression; no exclusion fencing but fire suppression; and no exclusion fencing or fire suppression. Exclusion fences (installed December 2013) were 1,800 mm high with a curved floppy section 450 mm at the top of the fence above ground and 550 mm below ground. Fire suppression included 8 m wide firebreaks, early dry season fuel reduction burning around external perimeters, and active fire suppression inside the plots. Reptiles were monitored seasonally (March-April, June-July, October-November) in six transects/plot using drift fences and pitfall traps in 2013–2015. Cats were monitored using camera traps. Abundance of other carnivores and herbivores in/around the study site was not monitored.</p>",
