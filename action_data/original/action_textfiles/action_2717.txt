        "background_definitions": "<p>Most types of commercial fishing gear catch unwanted fish that are unable to escape before being brought to the surface. To minimise this, escape panels can be fitted to some types of fishing gear, usually traps and trawl nets. Trawling is a method of fishing that involves pulling a fishing net (trawl) through the water behind one or more vessels. Fish entering the net will either be retained by it or may escape through the gaps in the mesh of the trawl netting during fishing. Some trawls are fitted with escape panels to allow small fish to escape from the net and avoid being caught. These panels often have square mesh and tend to have larger mesh than the rest of the trawl net. Escape panels need to be positioned correctly, and the positioning depends on which species they are targeting (Suuronen 2005). The mesh size of escape panels, and size of the panel itself, can affect the size, and therefore quantity, of fish that can escape through it.</p>\r\n<p>Evidence for the related intervention is summarized under <em>‘Fishing gear modification - <a href=\"../../actions/2716\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fit mesh escape panels/windows to a trawl net</a>’.</em></p>\r\n<p>Suuronen P.

In twin trawl net deployments, fewer undersized (&lt;27 cm) whiting were caught with the panel 7 m in front of the codend (72 fish/h) than with the panel immediately in front (131 fish/h). However, in parallel net deployments undersized catch was the same (88 fish/h) between trawl designs. Catch of legally sized whiting (&gt;27 cm) was not statistically different between trawl designs in twin trawls (7 m panel: 40, 1 m panel: 50 fish/h) or parallel trawls (7 m panel: 85, 1 m panel: 83 fish/h). In summer of 1994 and 1995, a total of 43 twin and 40 parallel trawl net deployments were undertaken respectively, using two <em>Nephrops norvegicus </em>trawl nets fitted with a 3 m square mesh (75 mm) escape panel for 4–5 h each. In one trawl net, the panel was fitted 1 m ahead of the codend, consistent with UK regulations, and in the other trawl net it was fitted 7 m ahead of the codend, consistent with Irish regulations. Each trawl net was 70 mm diamond mesh. Twin trawl nets were towed by a single vessel and parallel net deployments were done by two vessels towing a single trawl each.

The length at which haddock had a 50% chance of escaping (selection length) was greater with a square mesh panel of 80 mm mesh located in the codend of the trawl (26 cm), compared to an 80 mm square mesh panel located in the extension piece ahead of the codend (23 cm), and no panel fitted (23 cm). Haddock selection length in a codend panel with a larger mesh size of 100 mm was not significantly higher than the other three cases (30 cm). The authors noted this was probably due to the low catch rates with the 100 mm mesh window. Trials were conducted from a commercial fishing vessel in June 1998, using a twin trawl net. On the starboard side, nets with a 100 mm diamond mesh codend fitted with either a 100 mm square mesh panel, an 80 mm square mesh panel, an 80 mm square mesh panel in the 100 mm diamond mesh extension, or no panel were deployed. A trawl net with a 40 mm codend was towed on the port side. Full details of the trawl designs are provided in the original paper.

There were no differences in escape rates between each panel/window codend for horse mackerel or blue whiting (see paper for data). In addition, there were also no differences in escape rate of all three species between a codend with no panel and a 100 mm window alone, and the 70 mm window in the 80 mm panel codend. Percentage escape of the commercial target species rose shrimp <em>Parapenaeus longirostris</em> and Norway lobster <em>Nephrops norvegicus</em> was similar between mesh sizes with the 120 mm separator panel, however rose shrimp catches varied between the 120 mm and 80 mm mesh panels (see paper for data). Four fishing trials were done in July and September 1993 and May 1994 by research and fishing vessels. In each trial one of four trawl nets was tested: three with different separator panel/escape window mesh size combinations and one with the window alone (see paper for specifications). For each net type, six or seven experimental hauls were done, 26 in total, and catches were retained in the upper and lower codends. Fish escaping through the square mesh window were collected in a small mesh cover mounted over the escape window. Codend and cover catches were sorted by species, weighed and lengths recorded.</p>",

The percentage total catch of unwanted haddock and whiting<em> </em>was lower in the trawl with a modified square mesh panel (haddock: 32%, whiting: 26%) than the trawl with a standard panel (haddock: 68%, whiting: 74%). In addition, capture of the target Norway lobster were the same (modified: 50%, standard: 50%). Trials were conducted in October 2008–March 2009 using a twin-rig vessel towing two trawl nets simultaneously. One was an experimental net with two 120 mm square mesh panels located 8.9 m from the codend and separated by a strip of 80 mm diamond mesh 12 meshes wide. The other was a standard 80 mm mesh net with a standard 80 mm square mesh panel 2.1 m from the codend. A total of 16 trawl deployments of 3–4 hours were completed, and nets were regularly swapped between port and starboard sides.</p>",

Overall, the length at which cod had a 50% chance of escape was similar between trawl types (bottom windows: 44.6–50.3 cm, top window: 49.3–50.3 cm, no windows: 48.0–49.3 cm). However, this decreased with increasing catch weights in bottom windows in one of two cases, and with no window in one of two cases. In addition, more cod escaped with bottom windows in one of two cases (top: 6,906 fish, bottom: 18,765 fish, none: 13,202 fish) and with a top window in the other case (top: 27,616 fish, bottom: 17,026 fish, none: 16,089 specimens). Trials were conducted on two commercial fishing vessels in April–June 2000. A total of 18 trawl deployments were completed using a trawl net with a 122 mm square mesh top window fitted into a 122 mm mesh codend, 16 tows with two 122 mm square mesh windows fitted into the bottom of a 122 mm mesh codend, and 17 tows using a trawl net with a standard 136 mm mesh codend. Full gear specifications are given in the original paper. Tow duration was 8–11 hours at a speed of 2.5–2.6 knots and depths of 91–95 m. A cover was applied to each codend to retain and sample escaped cod.</p>",

The length at which cod had a 50% chance of escape was similar in codends with small square mesh panels located either towards the back (30.2–40.3 cm) of the codend or at the front of the codend (30.6–41.7 cm), compared to the standard large square mesh panel codend (35.2–41.8 cm). For three of the four codends with the small square mesh panel at the front, the length at which cod had a 50% chance of escaping was smaller (21.3–41.7 cm) (two codends not tested for significance). Trials were conducted in March/April and September 2012 in the Arkona Basin. A total of 41 alternate haul deployments were done with six separate codends, comprising different combinations of size/position of square mesh panel, one of them the established Bacoma design, the other five with a 50% smaller square mesh panel, four of which had the panel at the front of the codend. A cover was applied to each codend to retain and sample escaped cod. Full gear specifications are given in the original paper. Catches from both the codends and the covers were sorted, and all cod counted and lengths measured.</p>",
