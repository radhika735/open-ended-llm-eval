Plant residues are typically incorporated into soils by ploughing or rotavation. In some cases allelopathic plants may be grown as cover crops prior to being incorporated into the soil (green manuring). We consider this to be part of the ecosystem service where these plants can be grown in the ecosystem in question (for example on farms in that region). Applying plant residues to the soil surface is part of the action 'Add mulch to crops' and incorporating plant residues for inducing soil suppression of pests and pathogens is considered part of 'Amend the soil with fresh plant material or crop residues' (actions for inclusion in future synopses).</p>",

Lambsquarters growth was significantly reduced in plots of crimson clover compared to fertilized plots, with reductions of 64-81% two weeks after emergence and 37-42% lower at the final sampling date. Less maize drymatter was lost to weeds in the crimson clover treatment than the fertilized treatment (1989: 14 vs. 36%; 1990: 0-2 vs. 19-21%). Maize was grown in 3 x 9.1 m plots, each split to contain maize only or maize with lambsquarters. Other weeds were removed. There were six treatments: crimson clover residue, no fertilizer or residue and four levels of ammonium nitrate fertilizer (45, 90, 135, 180 kg N/ha). Crimson clover was sown at 84 kg/ha in May, then mown and incorporated 10-15 cm-deep on flowering. Maize was sown within 2 days of clover incorporation. A second trial in 1989 tested the effect of crimson clover residue applied to plots of lambsquarters.</p>",

Plots with material incorporated 54 days before maize showed a 1.1% decrease in maize grain production compared to unweeded controls, while incorporating material nearer the time of maize sowing increased maize grain production (4.2-7.9% increase). However, grain production in weeded controls was 39.6% higher than unweeded controls. Rye was sown as a cover crop in November 2008 at three different seeding rates and cut down 21-28 days before the plant material was incorporated. Controls for testing weed density were not sown with rye. Maize was sown on 12th June with controls divided into weed free and unweeded plots. Treatments were tested in 3 x 4 m plots replicated four times. Weed biomass and density was surveyed in 50 x 50 cm quadrats 4, 6 and 8 weeks after planting. The study does not separate the effects of growing a cover crop and incorporating plant material into the soil.</p>",

Greenhouse pots with amended soil had lower weed germination and establishment than non-amended pots (17-47% vs. 71-75%). In field plots in 2000, rice crop residues reduced the dry weight of barnyardgrass <em>Echinochloa crus-galli</em> by 70-93%, depending on rice variety used. However, the rice crop dry weight was also suppressed by 66-85%. In 2001, a smaller amount of rice crop residue incorporated earlier in the season suppressed barnyardgrass by 21-32%, small umbrella sedge <em>Cyperus difformis</em> 15-23% and water primrose <em>Ludwigia octovalvis</em> 20-32%. Rice dry weight suppression was 1-6%. The field experiment ran in January-March 2000 and 2001. Residues of eight rice varieties were incorporated 0-10 cm deep. In 2000, barnyardgrass or rice was sown one week after 6 kg/plot crop residue was incorporated. In 2001, three weed species and one rice crop were sown two weeks after 4 kg/plot of crop residue. The greenhouse experiment used 16 plant lines and one non-residue control.</p>",

In the first experiment, growing and incorporating sudex reduced weed growth by 35% (136 g dry weight weed biomass vs. 208 g in control plots). In the other two experiments, weed growth was reduced by 61-89% compared to control plots 50 days after treatment, but after 57 days in the second experiment and 106 days in the third experiment this difference had disappeared. Sudex was planted in six rows in raised beds and shredded at 1.4-2.0 m tall. Experiment 1 had three treatments with four replicates in 1 m-long plots: sudex grown, shredded and left as a mulch; grown, shredded and incorporated; no sudex grown or residue added. Experiments 2 and 3 had four replicates in 4.5 x 1.5 m plots. Treatments included those from experiment 1, plus two additional treatments: shreddings added to fallow plot where no sudex had been grown; shreddings removed but roots and 3-5 cm stubble left in plots. Weed biomass was calculated by removing material from a 0.093-1 m² area.</p>",

In cotton, green manure reduced numbers of the weed common purslane <em>Portulaca oleracea</em> by 30-55% (55-85 vs. 121 plants/m²), barnyard grass <em>Echinochloa crus-galli</em> by 48-52% (23-25 vs. 48) and bristly foxtail <em>Setaria verticillata</em> by 43-86% (1-4 vs. 7). Maize plots with green manure had 0-45% fewer common purslane (71-128 vs. 129), 38-46% fewer barnyard grass (7-8 vs. 13) and 60-80% fewer bristly foxtail (1-2 vs. 5). The cotton yield was significantly lower in green manure treatments than in a weed free control, but not different to (and in once case higher than) an unweeded control. Maize silage and grain yields were similar between treatments. There were four oregano green manure treatments (plants from four locations, selected for high concentrations of potential allelopathic chemicals) and two controls without green manure (one weeded) replicated four times in 9 x 5 m plots. Oregano was incorporated 8-10 cm deep before flowering. Cotton and corn were planted five days later.</p>",
