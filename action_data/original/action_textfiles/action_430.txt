Exclusion plots had higher levels of native vegetation (dominated by muskgrass <em>Chara</em> spp. and sago pondweed <em>Potamogeton pectinatus</em>) but birds left as this became depleted. Control plots were dominated by (non-native) milfoil <em>Myriophyllum spicatum</em>. Exclusion plots were established to re-establish native species using netting (1.27 cm<sup>2</sup> mesh, 1.2 m tall) held in place by buoyant ropes and weighted with steel rods to create 0.1 ha plots (25 x 50 m). Identical plots (without netting) were created (? 25 m away from the native plot) in areas of 100% milfoil coverage.</p><p> </p>",
