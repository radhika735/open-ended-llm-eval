Sprays can be reduced or avoided during periods of natural enemy vulnerability to reduce impacts on the ecosystem service they provide, although many studies test different dates simply to time spraying with periods of likely pest abundance or crop damage. Some of the evidence relates to chemicals now widely removed from use, and readers should bear in mind that using more selective insecticides may also allow greater flexibility in the timing of applications (‘Use more selective pesticides’ will be included in future synopses). Using historical information on pest population characteristics and crop susceptibility to time insecticide applications is included here. Informing spraying decisions by monitoring pests or crop damage within the present cropping season is included in 'Use pesticides only when pests or crop damage reach threshold levels'.</p>\r\n<p>Here we present evidence from five of 13 studies testing this intervention.</p>",

The area of stunted patches (ranging 1,124-4,087 cm²) only differed between spraying dates in barley sown on 6 September rather than 18 or 27 September, and showed an increase with delayed spraying date. Effects of spray timing on English grain aphid <em>Sitobion avenae</em> (a carrier of the virus) depended on insecticide type. On all spraying dates, deltamethrin reduced aphids with no reinfestation later in the season. Demeton-S-methyl reduced aphids but limited reinfestation occurred (affecting &lt; 3% of plants) in plots sprayed earliest (23 October). Pirimicarb also allowed reinfestation (affecting up to 6% of plants), particularly when applied early (23 October) or to plots sown on 6 September.  The authors suggest that spraying early was effective for persistent insecticides, but spraying later (after aphid migration) was more effective for other insecticides. Yield (ranging 6.6-7.1 t/ha) was not consistently different between spraying dates. Three spraying dates were tested in plots of 2 x 24 m, replicated twelve times across three blocks testing sowing date effects.</p>",
