Whilst this may reduce the catch of unwanted fish, there is an increased potential for commercially valuable fish to also escape the trawl if hauling speed is too slow. Hauling at a slower speed may also reduce fish stress and physical damage which may result in higher survival if discarded.</p>\r\n<p>Evidence for similar interventions is summarized under <em>‘Deployment of fishing gear and mode of operation - <a href=\"../../actions/2686\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Reduce duration of fishing gear deployments</a>’ and <a href=\"../../actions/2687\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">‘Change the towing speed of a trawl net’</a>. </em>See also <a href=\"../../data/index?category_id=483\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>‘Handling of Catch’</em></a>.</p>\r\n<p>Eayrs S.
