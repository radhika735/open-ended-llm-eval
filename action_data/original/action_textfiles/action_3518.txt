Revegetated linear strips had similar reptile richness and abundance (richness: 0.1–0.5 species/strip, abundance: 0.1–0.4 individuals/strip) compared to cleared (0.2–0.3, 0.3–0.4) and remnant strips (0.4–0.5, 0.3–0.5). Revegetated linear strips also had similar richness and abundances to revegetated patches (data not reported). Reptiles were monitored in five locations in each of two regions on or bordering agricultural land. Drift fences with pitfall traps were set out in sites classified as: revegetated linear strip (using native plants 8–14 years before), cleared linear strip, remnant linear strip, and remnant patches (10 traps/site). Surveys were carried out for five consecutive days/month in January–March 2008 and 2009. Remnant patches and enlarged remnant patches revegetated with native vegetation were also surveyed in five different locations in the same two regions using the same methods.</p>",

From two separate surveys, uncultivated margins were occupied by slow worms (occupied 8% and 14% of surveyed margins), common lizards (occupied 5% and 32% of surveyed margins) and grass snakes (occupied 45% and 49% of surveyed margins), but adders were not found in any margins. One analysis method showed that slow worms and grass snakes were found less frequently in margins with taller vegetation, and common lizards were found more frequently in wider margins with deeper ditches (presented as model result; see paper for more details). In 2014, ten farms were selected and eight 100 m transects were established in uncultivated field margins on each farm (south, east or facing margins only). In 2015, a total of 80 transects (100m) were established on margins across six farms (facing any direction). Five groups of 2–3 refuges (roofing felt/corrugated sheets and carpet tiles; 50 x 50 cm) were set at 20 m intervals along the transects. Transects were searched 12–15 times in 2014 and 6–10 times in 2015 during April–November. Presence or absence of reptiles was recorded.</p>",
