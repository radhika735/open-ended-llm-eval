        "background_definitions": "<p>Wildlife barrier fencing aims to prevent animals from crossing roads. They are typically wire mesh fences 2–2.5 m high running parallel to the road. Although fencing may protect wildlife from traffic, it should not create an absolute barrier that prevents migration, isolates populations, fragments habitat, or causes injuries. Wildlife fencing is therefore usually combined with safe crossing opportunities such as wildlife underpasses and overpasses (see <a href=\"../../actions/2526\"><em>Install overpasses over roads/railways</em></a>, <a href=\"../../actions/2519\"><em>Install tunnels/culverts/underpass under railways</em></a>, <a href=\"../../actions/2514\"><em>Install tunnels/culverts/underpass under roads</em></a>). Wildlife escapes, such as one-way gates, are often integrated with wildlife fencing to allow animals that do manage to cross the fence to escape from the fenced road (see: <a href=\"../../actions/2558\"><em>Install one-way gates or other structures to allow wildlife to leave roadways</em></a>). Wildlife such as deer frequently try to pass through holes in fences and so fences must be well maintained (Ward 1982).</p>\r\n<p>Studies included here are those that specifically assess fence effectiveness, sometimes in combination with other collision reduction actions, but not where effects of fencing cannot be separated from effects of road underpasses. For these interventions combined, see <a href=\"Install%20barrier fencing and underpasses along roads\"><em>Install barrier fencing and underpasses along roads</em></a>.</p>\r\n<p>As well as the threat to wildlife from vehicles, fencing is often placed to reduce dangers and costs to motorists that can result from collisions with wildlife. Assessment of whether or not to install fences may be based on a cost-benefit analysis (e.g. Huijser 2009).</p>\r\n<p>Ward A.L.

The 2.3-m-high fences ran either side of a four-lane highway, with a top section angled 45° away from the highway. The study site comprised two 0.8-km control sections with a 1.6-km experimental section between. Fence defects included gaps under the fence and lowered or broken top wires. Tracks in snow and sand along the fence both sides of the highway were monitored before repairs, after repairs along the experimental section and after repairs were undone. This cycle was implemented once in both winter and spring 1975 and tracks were surveyed over five days during each period.</p>",

The number of deer on road verges fell by 34–55% following fence installation. In September 1994, four and five crossing points were installed along a two- and a four-lane highway respectively. Fencing, 2.3 m high, restricted access to roadsides and directed deer towards crossing points. At these points, deer could jump a 1-m-high fence into funnel shaped fencing (2.3 m high) with a narrow opening to the road. One-way gates allowed deer trapped along the road to escape. Three warning signs, spaced 152 m apart, and painted lines across the road at crossings, indicated to drivers that it was a crossing point.

Among deer that jumped the 1.2-m control fence, fewer jumped each subsequently taller fence (1.5 m: 92%; 1.8 m: 75%; 2.1 m: 42%; 2.4 m: 0%). In opaque fence trails, 90% jumped 1.2 and 1.5-m fences and 50% jumped the 1.8-m fence. With an outrigger, fewer jumped when this was angled towards deer (60%) than away (90%). Three treatment areas (0.1–0.2 ha) were bisected with a test fence. Designs were woven-wire fencing either alone (1.5, 1.8, 2.1 and 2.4 m high), covered with opaque fabric (fence 1.2, 1.5 and 1.8 m high), 1.2 m high with a 0.6-m 50% opaque plastic outrigger angled at 45°, or a 1.2-m-high control fence. Ten adult female deer were each tested with each design in each treatment area. After 48 hours habituation and limited food, deer were enclosed the opposite side of test fences from food. Deer were videoed throughout each 25-hour trial.</p>",

Fewer coypu were killed by cars after fencing was installed (3.6 coypu/100 km/day) than before (8.3 coypu/100 km/day). The total number of animal road-kills (including all mammals, birds and reptiles) after fencing was installed (10.3 animals/100 km/day) was smaller than before fencing (15.3 animals/100 km/day) (this result was not tested for statistical significance). Road-kill rates fell in fenced sections but increased in the unfenced section (see paper for details). Two sections of a two-lane highway, totalling 10.2 km long, were fenced in 1998. The fence was 50–100-mm mesh, 1.10 m high. Between these sections was a 5.5-km-long unfenced section. Nineteen underpasses in total were also installed along these three road sections. Road-kills were counted from a car from July 1995 to June 2002. Monitoring was conducted at an average speed of 50 km/h, by 2–4 observers, along 15.7 km of highway. A total of 619 monitoring runs were made before fence installation (July 1995 to September 1998) and 571 afterwards (October 1998 to June 2002).</p>",

Open each action in the <strong>Pending</strong> tab in turn by clicking on the title. Start by reading all the summarised evidence we have found. Each action with evidence available will have:</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>a) <strong>Background section</strong>, describing the intervention;</li>\r\n<li>b) <strong>Key messages</strong>, providing an overview of the evidence;</li>\r\n<li>c) <strong>Supporting evidence,</strong> containing summaries of each study that tested the action. Clicking on the link beside the number will take you to the reference details.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong><em>Based on the evidence provided </em>please enter scores</strong> for the effectiveness, certainty and harms of the action, using a scale from 0-100. It is critical that your answers are based on information in the synopsis. Your expertise is invaluable for understanding and interpreting the evidence, but please do not base your assessments on your own personal knowledge or anecdotal evidence about an intervention.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>EFFECTIVENESS</strong>: The ‘effectiveness’ scale is from 0 (ineffective) to 100 (highly effective), and should reflect how good an intervention is at benefitting the conservation of terrestrial mammal species. This could be evaluated in a variety of different ways. For example, we could measure the increase in numbers of a population following the introduction of a specific intervention, the reduction in mortality or the establishment of a new population following translocation. We would like you to score according to what we know about whether the <em>ultimate objective</em> of the intervention is being achieved, i.e. whether the intervention leads to an increase in the conservation of terrestrial mammals. </p>\r\n<p><strong>CERTAINTY</strong>: The ‘certainty of evidence’ is a rating of how confident we can be about the effectiveness of an action, from 0 (no certainty; no useful evidence) to 100 (complete certainty; high quality evidence). To assess this, consider the quality of the evidence for the action. You should think about the number of studies, their coverage and wider applicability (species, geographical), the similarity of results across studies and the robustness of the experimental designs (e.g. randomised, replicated, controlled experiments with a large sample size will give more dependable results than a single before-and-after comparison).</p>\r\n<p><strong>HARMS</strong>: Harms in this context refers to any undesirable effects for terrestrial mammal species as a consequence of these interventions. Harms on other species groups are not included as we did not search the literature specifically for this purpose. If there is no evidence of harms please score this 0. </p>\r\n<p>Remember, you can exit and return to the survey several times at your convenience. You can also move backwards and forwards between interventions if necessary.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Please add a <strong>Score Comment</strong> for any actions where you feel this is useful. This is particularly important if your score does not follow obviously from the evidence provided, for example if you have given some studies more weight than others because of your knowledge of the system.</li>\r\n<li>Once you have opened an action, and either scored it or skipped it, it will be moved to the corresponding tab. Until you submit your final scores, you can re-open actions that have been moved to these tabs to check them or alter your scores if you need to.</li>\r\n<li>When you have moved all the actions from the <strong>Pending</strong> tab to the <strong>Scored</strong> tab, and you are happy with your scores for the assessment, please submit your final scores. Do this using the link on the left hand side of the assessment page.</li>\r\n<li>Please complete the scoring by the end of 8<strong>th of December</strong>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><em>N.B. If you know about any evidence relating to specific interventions for the conservation of terrestrial mammal species that is missing from the synopsis, please email to let us know the reference details. This will be valuable in putting together future versions of the synopsis and ‘What Works in Conservation’.</em></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROUND 2</em></strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Your task is to review the group’s category of effectiveness for each action, based on the group median scores from the first round.</li>\r\n<li>You will receive a spreadsheet containing both your scores and the group median score for each action that has been assessed. Each of these will have been used to put the action into a category, one based on your scores, and one based on the group median score (see Table 1 above). <strong>The Group Category is the one you need to consider</strong> <strong>whether you agree with or not</strong>, as that will be the published assessment. This decision should be based on whether the category for an action reflects the evidence provided for its effectiveness, certainty and harms. Comments made by reviewers in the first round of the assessment are also available in the final columns next to each action. The URL for the evidence for each action is also provided if you wish to go back and check the evidence available.</li>\r\n<li>Please go through each of the actions in turn, and check if you are happy with the Group Category. It may be useful to read the reviewers’ comments to see if they aid in interpreting the scores that have been given, as well as checking the evidence online by following the URL. If there are any actions that you believe have been placed in the wrong category by the group please indicate this in the “<strong>Strongly disagree?</strong>” column. For any actions where you disagree you need to provide a <strong>Supporting comment</strong> in the next column to explain why you disagree with the category. Please remember that <strong>all assessments must be based solely on the evidence presented on the Conservation Evidence website</strong>.</li>\r\n<li>Please complete the scoring by the end of <strong>21st of December</strong>.<u></u></li>\r\n<li>Actions which at least two reviewers believe have been placed in the wrong category will be sent out for re-scoring in Round 3.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROUND 3</em></strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You will receive an email alerting you when the third round of the assessment opens.</li>\r\n<li>All the actions to be re-scored will be sent to you in a spreadsheet. Only a subset of actions, where a proportion of assessors have disagreed with the category, will be included in this round.</li>\r\n<li>Look at each action in turn. Each action will show your scores and the group’s median scores that the action received in the first round, as well as the Group Category of effectiveness (calculated from the median group score in Round 1). Next to this you can see the comments that were made by the reviewers who flagged this action for re-scoring, so please make sure you read them.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>You are now given the opportunity to adjust your scores for Effectiveness, Certainty and Harms if you feel that they do not reflect the evidence well. If you wish to do this please just type over your original scores in the spreadsheet. Alternatively, if after reading the comments, you are happy with your original scores please leave them.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Once you have checked your scores for all actions that have been flagged for re-scoring please finalise your scoresheet.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Thank you very much for your help, we know that this is a substantial task. We expect that this will be a very influential piece of work. We will inform you when the results of the assessment have been made available online, and also when the new edition of <em>What Works in Conservation</em> is published.</p>\r\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>QUERIES: </strong>If you have any questions about the process, please don’t hesitate to get in touch: <a href=\"mailto:sop21@zoo.cam.ac.uk\"><strong>sop21@cam.ac.uk</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>",
