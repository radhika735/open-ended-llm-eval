Non-towed or static fishing gear (various types of nets, longlines, pots and traps) are usually considered less damaging than mobile gears (Broadhurst <em>et al</em>. 2006). However, they can be deployed in areas inaccessible to towed gears and some types can catch large quantities of fish, including unwanted species and sizes. Ceasing or prohibiting all static gears in an area can remove the direct fishing pressure on marine fish and may reduce unwanted fish catch.</p>\r\n<p>Broadhurst M.K., Suuronen P. &amp; Hulm A.

Overall shark abundance across bays was higher in longline samples in areas closed to gillnets compared to open (closed: 1.8, open: 1.3/100 hook hours), but not in gillnet samples (closed: 0.9–1.8, open: 0.6–1.4/100 m net hours). Length was greater for blacktips <em>Carcharhinus tilstoni/Carcharhinus limbatus </em>and pigeye <em>Carcharhinus amboinensis</em> in closed compared to open areas, and for Australian sharpnose <em>Rhizoprionodon taylori</em> in longline but not gillnet samples, and similar for scalloped hammerhead <em>Sphyrna lewini</em> and spot-tail <em>Carcharhinus sorrah</em> (data reported as statistical results). Commercial gillnet fishing was prohibited within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park across 38% of the total area (date of implementation not reported), whilst being permitted in other areas. In January 2012 - March 2013, eight 0.9 km wide transects were sampled in one closed and one open area in each of three bays. A minimum of five longline and four gillnet samples were done in each area and bay over four days, eight times each. In total 277 longlines 800 m long and 209 gill nets ≤400 m long were deployed. Sharks were identified, length recorded then released.</p>",
