There was no difference in species richness between any other grazing intensities (15–30%, 45–60% or 60–75%). Grazing intensity did not affect butterfly density or community evenness (data not provided). Butterflies with grass host plants were more abundant along transects with 0–30% grazing intensity than 30–45% intensity, but there were no differences between abundances at any of the other grazing intensity categories (data presented as log abundance). See paper for individual species results. Twenty-seven butterfly transects of varying lengths were conducted in April–September 2003 and 2004 either in oak woodland and shrubland or in meadows in areas dominated by mixed-conifer forest. Sites were cattle-grazed from May–November. Each transect was surveyed for butterflies 0–7 times in 2003 and eight times in 2004. In 2004, at each transect, cattle grazing intensity (0–75%) was estimated by measuring the height of that transect’s dominant cattle-palatable plant at every metre for 50 m, calculating the average height across the transect’s sampling points, and comparing this to the height of a reference ungrazed plant of that species from the same transect to calculate a grazing intensity percentage.</p>",

After 6–10 days of autumn grazing, fewer caterpillar nests had signs of damage in a lightly grazed (2/25 nests damaged) and ungrazed (2/24 nests damaged) site than nests in a heavily grazed site (15/25 nests damaged). Two months later, the number of nests with signs of damage was similar in lightly grazed (3/25 nests damaged), ungrazed (6/24 nests damaged) and heavily grazed (6/25 nests damaged) areas. All 24 nests in the ungrazed area, and 24/25 nests in the lightly grazed area, survived until spring, compared to 22/25 surviving in the heavily grazed area (statistical significance not assessed). In July–August 2009, a lightly grazed 0.52-ha grassland and a heavily grazed 4-ha grassland were searched three times for caterpillar nests. At the larger site, half of the area with the most nests was fenced to create a 0.15-ha ungrazed site. The 24–25 largest nests (&gt;1 m apart) in each site were selected, and their location marked on GPS. In September 2009, the 0.52-ha grassland was grazed by 26 sheep for six days, and a 1.23-ha area of the larger site was grazed by 114 sheep for 10 days, after which an expanded 1.76-ha area was grazed by 15 sheep for 50 days. In October and December 2009, nests were checked for damage, and in March 2010 the survival of each nest was recorded.</p>",

After 8–9 years, plots grazed at reduced density had a higher abundance (18.7–30.6 individuals/transect) and species richness (6.0–8.4 species/transect) of butterflies than plots grazed at moderate density (abundance: 8.1–20.0 individuals/transect, richness: 3.3–5.3 species/transect). However, on plots grazed at very low density butterfly abundance (16.3–34.1 individuals/transect) and species richness (5.4–7.8 species/transect) were similar to the reduced density plots. Over nine years, the abundance of marbled white <em>Melanargia galathea</em> increased more on reduced density plots (2002: 0–1 individuals; 2011: 4–12 individuals) than on moderate density plots (2002: 0–1 individuals; 2011: 1–5 individuals). From 2002–2011, three 3-ha paddocks were each divided into three treatments, each grazed annually from April–October: moderate density (3–6 cattle/ha, target sward height 6 cm), reduced density (1–3 cattle/ha, 12 cm sward) and very low density (2 cattle/ha, 18 cm sward, from 2005 only). Target sward heights were maintained by varying numbers of Simmental cattle in each paddock following biweekly sward height measurements.

In the first year, the abundance of “bird food invertebrates” was higher on grassland grazed at a reduced density (202 individuals/plot) than on grassland grazed conventionally (112 individuals/plot). However, after two and three years, there was no significant difference between reduced (two years: 97; three years: 48 individuals/plot) and conventionally grazed plots (two years: 78; three years: 42 individuals/plot). From April 2010–September 2012, six permanent pasture fields were divided into two 1-ha plots. One plot/pair was grazed by cattle at reduced stocking density, managed to keep sward height between 9–12 cm, and the other was grazed at conventional stocking density, keeping the sward at 6–8 cm.
