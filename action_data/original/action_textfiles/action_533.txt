Fed pairs also had more fledglings in successful nesting attempts than controls (5.6 fledglings/successful nesting attempt for nine fed pairs vs. 4.0 fledglings/successful nesting attempt for 15 controls). There were no differences in egg dimensions or the weights of parents and fledglings between fed and control nests. The author notes that the study took place in a peak vole year, when naturally-occurring food was extremely plentiful.</p><p> </p>",

First laying dates, clutch sizes and chick survival rates were no different between owls in 13 fed and 16 unfed boxes (fed nest boxes: first eggs laid on 22<sup>nd</sup> March, 3.0-4.5 eggs/clutch and 77% nestling survival; unfed nest boxes: first eggs laid on 20-22<sup>nd</sup> March, 3.0-4.5 eggs/clutch and 75% nesting success), but owls in fed boxes had higher fledging success than those in unfed boxes, due to greater hatching success (93% of eggs producing fledglings in 13 fed boxes vs. 74% in 16 unfed boxes). Food provided was either 9 g/day or 26 g/day of dead laboratory mice <em>Mus musculus</em> and began approximately 30 days before first laying date and continued through first laying.</p><p> </p>",
