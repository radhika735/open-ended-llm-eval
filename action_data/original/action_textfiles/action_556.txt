Numbers were higher in a burned area with perches (56 males/ha vs. 27) but not when dickcissel <em>Spiza americana</em> and red-winged blackbird <em>Agelaius phoeniceus</em> (attracted to a stream in the former area) were excluded. Twenty three perches (1.5 and 2 m long wooden stakes) were added to a 35-ha area of annually burned prairie and 17 to an adjacent 25-ha unburned area. A 12-ha area of burnt and a 39 ha unburnt prairie with no artificial perches served as controls. Eight species used 48% of perches in the burned area, compared with 29% used by four species in the unburned area.</p><p> </p>",
