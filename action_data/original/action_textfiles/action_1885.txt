By feeding prey a diet rich with vitamins or nutrients (gut loading) before they are fed to amphibians, nutritional deficiencies could be avoided.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">In captivity, metabolic bone disease can be an issue in amphibians. It develops as a result of an imbalance of vitamin D3, phosphorous and calcium. Amphibians cannot process calcium without vitamin D, which is activated by ultraviolet light. Health problems may affect reproduction in captive animals.</span></p>",
