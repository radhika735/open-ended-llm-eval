        "background_definitions": "<p>Abandoned, lost or otherwise discarded fishing gear (or ‘ghost’ gear) is a major threat to aquatic reptiles. Sea turtles in particular are at risk of becoming entangled in ‘ghost’ gear, such as nets, lines and ropes resulting in injury or death (Stelfox <em>et al.</em> 2016). Attempts may be made to remove derelict gear from reptiles found entangled to improve survival. This may require specialist techniques, tools and training. Injuries or wounds caused by entanglement may also require treatment.</p>\r\n<p>For studies that look at the release of rehabilitated reptiles that were injured see <em>Species management – <a href=\"../../data/index?terms=Rehabilitate%20and%20release%20injured%20or%20accidentally%20caught%20individuals&amp;yt0=\">Rehabilitate and release injured or accidentally caught individuals</a></em>.
