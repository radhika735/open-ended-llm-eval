In two restored wetlands, the proportion of marked butterflies which were recaptured in the area (26 out of 32 butterflies) was higher than at an unrestored site (3 out of 16 butterflies). However, the survival of eggs to large caterpillars in restored, flooded sites (2 out of 84 eggs) was lower than in unrestored, unflooded sites (7 out of 46 eggs). In the late 1990s, two wetland prairies (16–26 ha) were partially restored by planting a wetland prairie vernal pool native seed mix, and flooded annually. Unrestored parts of both sites, and a third, 76-ha, unrestored site, remained dominated by non-native grasses and did not flood. From late summer 2004–June 2005, eggs on 24 willow dock <em>Rumex salicifolius</em> plants in either restored, flooded areas or unrestored, unflooded areas, were revisited monthly to record survival to large caterpillars. From July–August 2005, every 3–4 days, butterflies were caught, marked, released and recaptured in a 1–2.9 ha area with a high density of willow dock at each site.</p>",

From 0–8 years after creation, wetlands contained 6–51 aquatic macroinvertebrate species, and the estimated addition to regional species richness ranged from 1–33 species/created wetland. Species richness increased with wetland age (data presented as model results). Species richness in created wetlands (32 species/pond; 176 species total) was similar to existing mature ponds (37 species/pond; 178 species total). From 1996–2004, about 300 ha of wetlands (each &lt;2 ha) were created in natural depressions of former pasture, crop or fallow land by soil excavations and damming existing waterways or drainage systems. In three sub-regions with low, moderate and high densities of created wetlands, 15% (i.e. 13, 8, and 15 wetlands) were surveyed in May 2004, by sweeping a D-shaped hand-net twice at 15 points along each wetland margin. Sampled wetlands were all permanent, flow-through water bodies. Ten mature ponds (&gt;50-years-old) in the region had been sampled at intervals in April 1996–2003.</p>",

In restored, seasonally flooded wetlands, great copper eggs were present on more of the available willow dock plants (10 out of 14 plants) than in degraded, unflooded areas where plants were surrounded by tall, non-native grasses (6 out of 37 plants), and the number of eggs/plant was higher (restored: 0–9 eggs/plant; degraded: 0–3 eggs/plant). However, the authors noted that egg survival was lower in flooded areas than in unflooded habitat (see 1 - Severns et al. 2006). In the late 1990s, several thousand willow dock were seeded in two 0.8-ha, seasonally flooded, restored wetlands. Each restored area was surrounded by degraded, unrestored, unflooded habitat. In August 2007, every willow dock plant at each site was searched for great copper eggs. Plants were categorized as growing in either flooded or unflooded habitat.</p>",
