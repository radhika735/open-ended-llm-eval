Sowing in autumn may result in early germination of plants allowing them to become established before other non-grassland species. However, sowing in autumn may also result in more seeds dying as a result of waterlogging in winter and so, in some cases, spring sowing may produce better results.</p>",

More species that were sown were present in areas where seeds were sown in spring than areas where seeds were sown in the autumn, and the same pattern was true for cover of sown forb and grass species (no data reported). Similarly, there were fewer non-sown species in areas where seeds were sown in spring compared to areas where seeds were sown in autumn, and their cover was also lower (no data reported). Before seeding, sites were ploughed and harrowed. In May 1994, seeds of 18 species were sown at a rate of 4 g/m<sup>2</sup> in four 3 x 9 m plots, and seeds were sown in another four plots in October 1994 at each site. Plant cover and species richness were estimated in June/July 1995 and 1996 using a 1 x 1 m quadrat placed in each plot.</p>",

Plots sown in spring contained 18–32 seedlings/m<sup>2</sup>, while those sown in winter contained 14–24 seedlings/m<sup>2</sup>. Six 15 x 20 m plots were sown with 23 native forb species at a rate of 350 seeds/m<sup>2</sup> in November 1998 (winter seeding), and six plots were sown in April 1999 (spring).
