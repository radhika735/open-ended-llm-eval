There was a negative relationship between a combined intervention (scrub control, rough grazing and the restoration of various semi-natural habitats) and the ratio of young to old partridges in 2008. The study does not distinguish between the individual impacts of scrub control, rough grazing and the restoration of various semi-natural habitats. Spring and autumn counts of grey partridge were made at 1031 sites across England as part of the Partridge Count Scheme.</p><p class=\"\\\"> </p>",
