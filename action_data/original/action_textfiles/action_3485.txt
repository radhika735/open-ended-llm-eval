Volunteers can also make a valuable contribution to the management of habitats for reptiles, on private and public land. In some cases, the long-term success of habitat management can depend on the involvement of local people.</p>\r\n<p>As well as the direct effects from habitat restoration, volunteer programmes help raise awareness about reptiles and the threats that they face. For example, a study found that participants with high levels of engagement in conservation projects learned more (Evely <em>et al.</em> 2011).
