Over three years, woody plant cover declined in plots where they were cut (by 79%), but increased in plots where they were not cut (by 20%). This is despite no significant effect on woody plant survival in the first year after cutting (cut: 60%; uncut: 83%). Changes in forb cover also significantly differed between cut and uncut plots, although the precise effect depended on whether forbs were native (cut: 167% increase; uncut: 77% decrease) or non-native (cut: 45% decrease; uncut: 28% increase). Plots under each treatment experienced statistically similar increases in overall vegetation cover (cut: 42%; uncut: 31%) and cover of the dominant herb species, tussock grass <em>Deschampsia cespitosa </em>(cut: 8%; uncut: 31%; see original paper for data on other individual plant species). <strong>Methods:</strong> In 1994, five pairs of plots (each 56–140 m<sup>2</sup>) were established in a degraded, seasonally flooded prairie. Woody plants had grown over 200 years of fire suppression. In autumn 1994 and 1996, all woody vegetation was cut with pruners or loppers, then removed, from one plot/pair. Vegetation was surveyed before (summer 1994) and after cutting. Survival of six tagged woody plants/plot was recorded in summer 1995.

Statistical significance was not assessed. Over four years after intervention, there were slight increases in the area of reedbed/marsh vegetation (from 10 to 14%) and herbs typical of disturbed areas (from 45 to 50%) and a slight decrease in the area of meadow and pasture vegetation (from 45 to 36%).

Areas which are only briefly or rarely wet (e.g. drier parts of floodplains or riparian areas) are also not included in this synopsis.</p>\r\n<p>There will be three parts to the assessment exercise, which will be carried out entirely online. <strong><u>Please scroll down to read the relevant instructions before beginning to score/review each round.</u></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Round 1: Score each action for effectiveness, certainty and harms based on the available evidence. These scores contribute to the overall “effectiveness category” of the action.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Round 2: Review the effectiveness category assigned to each action.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Round 3: Re-score any actions that have been flagged up as being in the wrong effectiveness category.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Table 1. </strong>Effectiveness categories and thresholds used in this assessment</p>\r\n<p> <img src=\"../../images/scoring_table_CE.bmp\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROUND 1</em></strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>All the actions to be assessed will be listed on the <strong>Pending</strong> tab of the assessment page. There are 179 actions to assess, but don't panic! Only 16 of these have more than 10 evidence paragraphs, and most have fewer than three paragraphs, so most actions should be fairly quick to assess.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>These instructions are always available from the link on the left hand side of this page (Read Instructions), and we encourage you to refer to them whenever you need to while taking part in the assessment.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Aim to assess all of the actions if possible. Open each action in the <strong>Pending</strong> tab in turn by clicking on the title. Start by reading all the summarised evidence we have found. Each action with evidence available will have:</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>a) <strong>Background section</strong>, describing the action;</li>\r\n<li>b) <strong>Key messages</strong>, providing an overview of the evidence for the action;</li>\r\n<li>c) <strong>Supporting evidence,</strong> containing summaries of each study that tested the action. Clicking on the link beside the number will take you to the reference details.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong><em>Based on the evidence provided </em>please enter scores</strong> for the effectiveness, certainty and harms of the action, using a scale from 0-100. It is critical that your answers are based on information in the synopsis. Your expertise is invaluable for understanding and interpreting the evidence, but please do not base your assessments on your own personal knowledge or anecdotal evidence about the effects of an action.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><strong>EFFECTIVENESS</strong>: The ‘effectiveness’ scale is from 0 (ineffective) to 100 (always effective), and should reflect how good an intervention is at benefitting marsh or swamp vegetation. This could be evaluated in a variety of different ways. For example, studies might have measured the change in number of wetland-characteristic plant species following a specific action, or they may have measured the cover of plant groups (e.g. reeds or shrubs). We would like you to score according to what we know about whether the <em>ultimate objective</em> of the action is being achieved, i.e. does the intervention make the vegetation more like the desired marsh or swamp vegetation?</p>\r\n<p>We realise that success of an intervention might look different in different locations and in different kinds of wetlands, and might depend on the aim of the intervention. All studies were aiming to conserve their focal wetland vegetation in a natural or semi-natural state, and the actions are generally split into freshwater marshes, freshwater swamps, brackish/saline marshes and brackish/saline swamps, so the assessment should just be for that specific habitat type in most cases. So if a study reports that the vegetation becomes more like a <em>different</em> habitat type (this will take a bit of expert judgement), then the study suggests the intervention is <em>ineffective</em>. If most studies suggest the action is effective in their situation, then the intervention overall would get a high effectiveness score.</p>\r\n<p><strong>CERTAINTY</strong>: The ‘certainty of evidence’ is a rating of how confident we can be about the effectiveness of an action, from 0 (no certainty; no useful evidence) to 100 (complete certainty; high quality evidence). To assess this, consider the quality of the evidence for the action. You should think about the number of studies, their coverage and wider applicability (species, geographical), the similarity of results across studies, and the robustness of the experimental designs (e.g. randomised, replicated, controlled experiments with a large sample size will give more dependable results than a single before-and-after comparison). Where actions are split into different types of wetlands (freshwater marshes, freshwater swamps, brackish/saline marshes and brackish/saline swamps), the certainty score only needs to consider the scope with respect to the focal vegetation type.</p>\r\n<p><strong>HARMS</strong>: Harms in this context refers to any negative effects for marsh or swamp vegetation as a consequence of the action. If there is no evidence of harms please score this 0. Note that this does not include harms to anything other than wetland vegetation (e.g. animals living within the wetland) as we did not search the literature specifically for this purpose. Such harms may have been flagged up in the background section for each intervention (you could comment if you think there is a major harm we have missed).</p>\r\n<p>Remember, you can exit and return to the survey several times at your convenience. You can also move backwards and forwards between actions if necessary.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Please add a <strong>Score Comment</strong> for any actions where you feel this is useful. You can write comments to justify your scores. This is particularly important if your score does not follow obviously from the evidence provided, for example if you have given some studies more weight than others because of your knowledge of the system.</li>\r\n<li>Once you have opened an action, and either scored it or skipped it, it will be moved to the corresponding tab. Until you submit your final scores, you can re-open actions that have been moved to these tabs to check them or alter your scores if you need to.</li>\r\n<li>When you have moved all the actions from the <strong>Pending</strong> tab to the <strong>Scored</strong> tab, and you are happy with your scores for the assessment, please submit your final scores. Do this using the link on the left hand side of the assessment page.</li>\r\n<li>Please complete the scoring by the end of <strong>27th August</strong>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><em>N.B. If you know about any evidence relating to specific actions for the conservation of marshes and swamps that is missing from the synopsis, please email to let us know the reference details. This will be valuable in putting together future versions of the synopsis and ‘What Works in Conservation’.</em></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROUND 2</em></strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You will receive an email alerting you when the second round of the assessment opens.</li>\r\n<li>Your task is to review the category of effectiveness for each action, based on the assessment panel's median scores from the first round.</li>\r\n<li>For each action that has been assessed, you will be presented with your scores and the group median score. Each of these will have been used to put the action into a category: one based on your scores, and one based on the group median score (see Table 1 above). <strong>The Group Category is the one you need to consider</strong> <strong>whether you agree with or not</strong>, as that will be the published assessment. This decision should be based on whether the category for an action reflects the evidence provided for its effectiveness, certainty and harms. The anonymised comments made by all reviewers in the first round of the assessment are also available for you to view by clicking on the “comment(s)” link.</li>\r\n<li>Please go through each of the actions in turn, and check if you are happy with the Group Category. It may be useful to read the comments to see if they aid in interpreting the scores that have been given, as well as re-reading the evidence.
