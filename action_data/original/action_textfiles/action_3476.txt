        "background_definitions": "<p><strong>Definition:</strong> ‘Rock pools’ are depressions with a length to width ratio ≤3:1 and depth ≥50 mm that retain water during low tide (modified from “Intertidal water retaining features” in Strain <em>et al.</em> 2018).</p>\r\n<p>Rock pools provide organisms refuge from desiccation and temperature fluctuations during low tide in intertidal rocky habitats (Williams &amp; Morrit 1995). They are important nursery habitats (Seabra <em>et al.</em> 2020) and can extend the vertical range of species along intertidal gradients (Metaxas &amp; Scheibling 1993). They can also, however, become stressful environments under extreme conditions, such as extreme high/low temperatures or salinities (Firth &amp; Williams 2009; Waltham &amp; Sheaves 2020). The size, shape, density and shore level of rock pools is likely to affect the size, abundance and variety of organisms that can use them (Bugnot <em>et al.</em> 2018). Large, deep rock pools provide more stable environments than small pools and fishes tend to be more abundant in them. Macroalgae and invertebrates, however, show variable species-specific responses to pool size and depth.</p>\r\n<p>Rock pools often support species that are absent from emergent rock surfaces in both natural and artificial habitats (Firth <em>et al.</em> 2013), but are relatively uncommon on artificial structures (Aguilera <em>et al.</em> 2014). Water-retaining features mimicking rock pools can be created on intertidal artificial structures by adding or removing material, either during construction or retrospectively.</p>\r\n<p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href=\"../../actions/3435\"><em>Create natural rocky reef topography on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3467\"><em>Create hole habitats (&gt;50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>.</p>\r\n<p><sup>Aguilera M.A., Broitman B.R. &amp; Thiel M.
