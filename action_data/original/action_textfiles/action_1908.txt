When fed a supplemented animal-based protein diet, average plasma taurine was higher (91.18 nmol/ml), and within target domestic canine reference ranges, compared to no supplement (animal-based protein: 18.79 nmol/ml; plant-based mean: 4.03 nmol/ml). Four wolves were maintained on the commercial diet (animal-based protein) and two were maintained on an experimental diet (plant-based protein). Four weeks prior and at the end of the trial, animals were restrained and sedated to collect a 12 ml blood sample. Due to clinical signs including weight loss and decreased appetite, the diet trial was terminated early and taurine supplementation (0.3% concentration) was deemed necessary. Taurine concentrations were monitored over a four-month period.</p>",
