Of 1,819 turtle encounters when the turtle was on the sea floor, 60% were able to flee a slow-moving boat (416 of 694 turtles fled), 22% at a moderate speed (136 of 620 turtles fled) and 4% at a fast speed (20 of 505 turtles fled). This trend was statistically significant only when turtles were within 6 m offset of the vessel (see original paper). Turtles in the water column or on the surface also tended to show a reduced flight response at faster vessel speeds (small sample size precluded statistical analysis, see original paper). A 6 m aluminium boat with a 40 hp outboard motor was driven at three speeds (4, 11 and 19 km/h) on a transect 5 km parallel to the shoreline about 200–450 m from the shore in &lt;5 m of water in the 3 hours before and after noon. The behaviour of turtles sighted within 10 m of the boat were recorded by a spotter.</p>",

No injured spectacled caiman were caught in waterways with enforced speed limits (injured: 0 individuals; non-injured: 24 individuals), whereas 37% of spectacled caiman caught in waterways without enforced speed limits had boat-related injuries (injured: 11 individuals; non-injured: 19 individuals), of which two died. Caiman were surveyed in April–June 2006 in three waterways with enforced speed limits (idle–slow) and three without enforced speed limits (high speeds up to 40 km/hour). Adult caiman (1.0–2.5 m long) were caught at night and checked for scars or injuries. Mortalities from boat propellers were recorded.</p>",

Catastrophic injuries to artificial turtle shells occurred less frequently at lower speeds than higher speeds on unmodified vessels (7 km/hr: four of 10 turtles; 40 km/hr: 10 of 10 turtles) and vessels with propeller guards (7 km/hr: one of 10; 40 km/hr:  nine of nine). With a jet outbound motor or an inboard jet motor (on a jet ski) none of 40 turtles were damaged at 7 or 40 km/hr. Injury rates were similar regardless of the position of the artificial shell in the water. A 90 hp, 4-stroke outboard motor with a three-bladed stainless-steel propeller was mounted on a 5.8 m skiff and driven at 7 or 40 km/h over surface level or propeller-depth (48 cm) fibreglass model loggerhead turtle shells (5 trials/speed/turtle depth). One of two propeller guard designs were then added to the same skiff: a horizontal-fin (Hydroshield®), or a stainless-steel cage (Prop Buddy®) and driven over propeller-depth artificial turtle shells (7 km/h: 5 trials/guard; 40 km/h: 4–5 trials/guard). A personal watercraft (jet ski) with an inboard jet motor and the 5.8 m skiff modified with an 80 hp, jet-drive outboard motor were also both driven at 7 and 40 km/h over surface-level or propeller-depth artificial loggerhead turtle shells (5 trials/speed/vessel/turtle depth). Injuries to artificial shells were classified as catastrophic if they would have killed a real sea turtle.</p>",
