Minimizing lighting on roads, either by reducing the number or intensity of lights, restricting the timing of lighting, or using motion-sensitive lighting which only activates when required, may help to reduce the impacts on moth populations.</p>\r\n<p>For studies on reducing the impacts of lighting generally, see actions under “<em>Threat: Pollution</em>”.</p>",
