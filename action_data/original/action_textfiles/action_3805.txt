The net of a beam trawl is kept open horizontally by a steel beam, the length of which varies between 4 and 12 m depending on the size of the vessel. Limits on the width of the beam trawl would reduce the area swept by the gear and may reduce the effects on fish communities, particularly flatfish, by limiting unwanted fish catch and mortality, as well as help reduce effects from impact to the seabed.</p>\r\n<p>Jennings S., Lee J. &amp; Hiddink J.G.
