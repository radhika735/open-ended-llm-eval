        "background_definitions": "<p>Trawling is a method of fishing that involves pulling a fishing net (trawl/seine) through the water behind one or more vessels. In many fisheries, particularly edible crustacean fisheries (e.g. prawns), trawls often retain unwanted small non-target or non-commercial fish species. Behavioural differences between species can be exploited to reduce the amount of unwanted catch retained in a trawl net. In trawl nets with a smaller circumference, the lateral openings of the netting mesh are larger than in larger circumference trawls, which allows more fish to pass through the netting (Armstrong <em>et al. </em>1990). This may be due to different hydrodynamic pressures in the codend, which may stimulate a behavioural response in fish and contribute to their escape, which may not occur in crustaceans and other groups of species (Broadhurst &amp; Kennelly 1996).</p>\r\n<p>Related interventions describing other modifications to the overall design of different types or parts of trawl gear are summarized under ‘<em>Fishing gear modification - <a href=\"../../actions/2704\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Modify the design or configuration of trawl gear (mixed measures)</a>’</em>,<a href=\"../../actions/2705\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em> ‘Change the size of the main body of a trawl net’</em></a>,<a href=\"../../actions/2707\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em> ‘Modify the design or configuration of trawl doors’</em></a>,<a href=\"../../actions/2708\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em> ‘Modify a bottom trawl to raise parts of the gear off the seabed during fishing’ </em></a>and<a href=\"../../actions/2709\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em> ‘Modify design or arrangement of tickler chains/chain mats in a bottom trawl’</em></a>.</p>\r\n<p>Armstrong D.W., Ferro R.S.T., MacLennan D.N. &amp; Reeves S.A.

Average catch numbers of unwanted pink-breasted siphonfish <em>Siphamia roseigaster</em> decreased with decreasing codend circumference (small: 8 fish/haul, intermediate: 20 fish/haul, large: 25 fish/haul). However, for three other unwanted fish species (silver biddy <em>Gerres subfasciatus</em>, southern herring <em>Herklotsichthys castelnaui</em> and Ramsey’s perchlet <em>Ambassis marianus</em> – see original paper for species individual data) there were no statistical differences in average catch rates between codend circumferences (small: 7–25 fish/haul, intermediate: 4–18 fish/haul, large: 5–9 fish/haul). Average catch weights of all commercial target prawns <em>Penaeidae</em> were similar across codend designs (all 5 kg/haul). Experimental fishing was done in October and November 2007 on commercial prawn trawl grounds in Lake Wooloweyah on the Clarence River estuary using a local twin-rigged trawler. Three square mesh codends (27 mm nominal mesh) of varying circumference (standard 90 meshes, 150 meshes and 200 meshes) were deployed simultaneously with a small mesh (9 mm) codend, 18 deployments for each paired comparison. After each tow, codend catches were separated by species and numbers or weights recorded.</p>",

For five of five fish species (see original paper for species individual data), average catch numbers discarded were similar between small and large codend circumferences (small: 2–284 fish/haul, large: 54–502 fish/haul).

In addition, the number (small: 305 fish/haul, large: 685–1,468 fish/haul), but not weight (small: 94 kg/haul, large: 156–158 kg/haul) of commercial retained catch (fish and invertebrates) was lower in the smaller codend compared to the larger.

For diamond mesh codends, the predicted length at which fish had a 50% chance of escape was similar for a standard mesh circumference compared to a larger circumference for blue whiting <em>Micromesistius poutassou</em> (standard: 10.6 cm, large: 10.6 cm) and poor cod Trisopterus minutus (standard: 6.3 cm, large: 6.3 cm), but lower for European hake <em>Merluccius merluccius</em> (standard: 8.7 cm, large: 10.1 cm). However, escape of all three species was not affected by diamond mesh codend circumference (data reported as statistical results). A codend of square mesh with similar or larger circumference as the diamond mesh codends, resulted in greater 50% escape lengths for all three species compared to the diamond mesh codends (blue whiting: 13.6 cm, poor cod: 9.2 cm, hake: 12.6 cm). Gear trials were done on a research vessel in May and September 2005 in the Western Pomo pit area (a Norway lobster <em>Nephrops norvegicus</em> fishing ground, 210 m depth). Two diamond mesh codends (standard 280 and larger 326 mesh circumference) and one square mesh codend (70 meshes) were tested during 19, 13 and 20 deployments, respectively.

For all three areas combined, there was no statistical difference in average total discard between modified and regulated trawl gears (modified: 52 kg/tow, regulated: 65 kg/tow).
