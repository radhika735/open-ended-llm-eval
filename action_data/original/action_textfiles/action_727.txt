Planthopper and leafhopper species richness was also similar with 16.1 species in July-cut plots and 15.9 species in May-cut plots. More planthoppers and leafhoppers were found when pasture was cut only once (860 individuals/treatment), or not at all (595 individuals), compared with pasture cut twice (485 individuals). Cutting took place in July (a hay cut) or in May (a silage cut to 10 cm grass height) in permanent pastures. Plots were 50 x 10 m and treatments were replicated 12 times. Planthoppers and leafhoppers were collected in April, June, July and September in each year using a Vortis suction sampler, taking 75 ten-second suction samples/plot. June and September sampling occurred at least two weeks after cutting.</p>",
