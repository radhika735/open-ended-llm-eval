Egg and pupae abundance of the three ladybird species (Coccinellidae) and common green lacewing <em>Chrysoperla carnea </em>was similar between intercropped (12.5-13.0 eggs and 1.5-1.7 pupae per plant) and monoculture (11.5 eggs and 1 pupa) plots. Aphid (Aphidoidea) abundance was significantly lower in intercropped (110-125 per lettuce plant) than monoculture (160 per plant) plots. Natural predator and aphid numbers were similar between plots intercropped with wormwood <em>Artemisia vulgaris</em>, tansy <em>Tanacetum vulgare</em> or stinging nettle <em>Urtica dioica</em>. The attractant plants were tested separately in three blocks inside a 6 x 50 m field. Each attractant plant species was grown in nine plots of 1 x 0.3 m, placed in a 3 x 3 grid among 20 lettuce rows.</p>",

Parasitism differed for only one of four seasons (in 1998), when pupal parasitism was higher in monoculture plots. The spotted borer <em>Chilo partellus</em> was less abundant in intercropped plots (2,750 individuals) than in monoculture plots (3,601). Intercropped plots contained one row of molasses grass for every three sorghum rows. Plots were 9 x 10 m with the treatment replicated in 11 blocks over three fields. Laboratory studies of odour choice found that volatiles from sorghum or maize <em>Zea mays</em> with molasses grass were not more attractive to the stem borer parasitoid sp. <em>Cotesia sesamiae </em>than maize or sorghum volatiles alone. The parasitoid <em>Dentichasmias busseolae</em> was repelled by molasses grass volatiles.</p>",

The pest citrus red mite <em>Panonychus citri</em> was also less numerous in orchards containing tropical whiteweed (0.03 mites/leaf) than control orchards (0.18 mites). Odour choice tests in the laboratory found that <em>Amblyseius newsami</em> was strongly attracted to volatiles from fresh leaves (61% of choices versus a control) or essential oils (95% of choices) from tropical whiteweed. The study compared an orchard with a tropical whiteweed understorey grown for two years, and a control orchard with a groundcover of naturally growing weed species (but with tropical whiteweed removed).
