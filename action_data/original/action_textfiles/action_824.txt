For example, it was estimated that 15 million live, wild-caught amphibians entered the USA legally in 1998–2002, millions of which were for the pet trade (Schlaepfer <em>et al.</em> 2005). Removal of large numbers of amphibians from the wild can have significant effects on populations.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">The movement of animals also increases the risk of spreading infectious diseases. For example, there is increasing evidence that trade is partly responsible for the recent spread of chytridiomycosis <em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</em> and amphibian ranaviruses (e.g. Daszak <em>et al</em>. 2003; Gratwicke <em>et al.</em> 2009; Schloegel <em>et al.</em> 2009).</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">Evidence for interventions designed to reduce the threat from diseases is discussed in ‘Threat: Invasive alien and other problematic species – <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"../../data/index?category_id=140\">Reduce parasitism and disease</a></span>’.</p>\r\n<p class=\"References\">Daszak P., Cunningham A.A. &amp; Hyatt A.D.

Both species were categorized by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as stable in the 2010 IUCN Red List. Populations of both species had crashed in India and Bangladesh following unsustainable use in the frog leg trade. Over three years of monitoring in India, it was estimated that 9,000 tonnes of frogs were removed from the wild for frogs’ legs. In 1985, green pond frogs and Indian bullfrogs were listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES). India banned export of frogs’ legs in 1987 and Bangladesh followed in 1989.</p><p> </p>",
