However, nesting success remained between 40-60% in mowed strips, whereas it fell from &gt;70% to &lt;30% in unmown strips due to an increase in mammalian nest predation. Alternate mowed and unmown 1.6 km strips of roadside vegetation were compared along 37km of Interstate 94. The 23 mowed strips (totalling 123 ha) were mown once in autumn. Six duck species nested over the four years: blue-winged teal <em>Anas discors</em>, mallard <em>A. platyrhynchos</em>, gadwall <em>A. strepera</em>, northern shoveler <em>A. clypeata</em>, pintail <em>A. acuta </em>and lesser scaup <em>Aythya affinis</em>.</p><p> </p>",
