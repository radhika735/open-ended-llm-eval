Species studied were capercaillie <em>Tetrao urogallus</em>, black grouse <em>Tetrao tetrix</em>, hazel grouse <em>Bonasa bonasia</em> and willow ptarmigan <em>Lagopus lagopus</em>, with adult capercaillie and black grouse counts increasing by 56-80% after predators had been controlled for two years, and counts at leks increasing by 166-174%. Predators (European pine martins <em>Martes martes </em>and red foxes <em>Vulpes vulpes</em>)<em> </em>were trapped and shot.</p><p> </p>",
