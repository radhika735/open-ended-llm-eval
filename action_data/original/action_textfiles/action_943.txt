The first experiment showed there was no difference in total phosphorus removed between sludge loading. The second experiment found that phosphorus leaching from sludge drying beds was 5 μg TP released per gram of total phosphorus regardless of sludge loading. For the first experiment, four sludge drying beds were set up at a rainbow trout farm; each consisted of a 1m<sup>2</sup> reservoir filled with different types of river gravel (20cm) and a top layer of sand (20cm). <em>Typha latifolia</em> was planted on the sludge drying bed one year before the experiment at a density of 8 plants m<sup>2</sup>. During the experiment, the sludge drying beds were fed once a week with sludge from the fish farm at two concentrations (32 or 18 kg of dry matter per m<sup>2</sup> year). The second experiment in a laboratory aimed to determine phosphorus leaching using 2L beakers containing 0.5L of sludge and 1.4 L of filtered pond water. Phosphate concentrations in sludge and pond water were monitored.</p>",
