Given the poor dispersal ability of many species, and the highly fragmented nature of many landscapes, the transportation of individuals to suitable sites may be the only means by which a species is able to recolonize. Releases could be composed of captive-bred animals (bred from captive populations over one or more generations) or translocated animals (caught in the wild at another site, see “<a href=\"../../actions/3909\"><em>Translocate to re-establish populations in known or believed former range</em></a>” and “<a href=\"../../actions/3911\"><em>Translocate to establish populations outside of known range</em></a>”), and individuals at any life stage (adult, egg, caterpillar or pupa) may be used for capture and release.</p>\r\n<p>Note that restoring habitat quality prior to the release of captive-bred butterflies and moths is likely to be an important factor determining the success of reintroduction projects (Schultz <em>et al.</em> 2008).

            "paragraph_text": "<p>A study in 1977–2005 in an alpine meadow in Colorado, USA (Boggs et al. 2006) reported that a captive-bred and translocated population of Gillette's checkerspot <em>Euphydryas gillettii </em>released outside the species’ native range survived for 28 years, but only increased in size and colonized new sites after 22–25 years. For 21 years after the release of 83 egg clusters, the population size fluctuated between 24 and 143 adults, and remained confined to the release site. However, four years later, the population was estimated at &gt;3,000 adults, and covered 70.4 ha. After a further three years, the population had declined to 150 adults at the release site, but two other habitat patches (0.3 and 0.6 ha) remained occupied (13–153 adults/ha). In July 1977, eggs and adult females were collected in Wyoming, and kept in a laboratory where more eggs were laid. In July–August 1977, eighty-three wild- and captive-laid egg and caterpillar clusters (~10,000 individuals from ~40 females) were released on to bearberry honeysuckle <em>Lonicera involucrata</em> in a 2.25-ha meadow. Details of the translocation taken from Holdren &amp; Ehrlich (1981). In June–July 1978–1989 and 2002–2005, adult butterflies at the release site were caught and uniquely marked every 1–7 days. Recapture rates of marked butterflies were used to estimate the population size in years with sufficient data (1981–1986, 2002–2005). In 1978–1989, 2002 and 2004–2005, egg clusters and/or caterpillar webs were counted throughout the season at the release site, and in 2003–2005 at two newly colonized sites. The relationship between number of egg clusters and adult population was used to estimate the population size in the remaining years. From 1978–1987, areas surrounding the release site were searched for egg clusters or caterpillar webs, and from 2002–2005 a larger area was searched for adults.</p><p>Holdren C.E. &amp; Ehrlich P.R.

Eleven years after the release of captive-bred butterflies began, a population of Apollo butterflies contained ~1,000 individuals, compared to 30 individuals the year before the first release. The number of sub-populations increased from one to more than 12. However, when the number of butterflies in a sub-population was high, the sub-population size in a given year was lower when more captive-bred butterflies had been released the previous year (data presented as model results). In 1991, butterflies from a remnant population were taken into captivity and bred (number captured not specified). From 1992–2001, between 22 and 658 butterflies/year were released across four areas (2,917 butterflies released in total). In 1995, the captive population was supplemented with butterflies from another population to increase genetic diversity. The species’ host plant, stonecrop <em>Sedum maximum</em>, was abundant at the release sites. From 1991–2003, suitable sites were visited twice/week for 1–3 hours during the flight period, and population size was estimated by marking and recapturing all butterflies observed.</p>",

Results were not tested for statistical significance. Three years after the release of 3,500–22,900 caterpillars/site at three sites, the number of caterpillar webs was 47–240 webs/site, compared to 16–112 webs/site one year after release. However, at a fourth site where 11,000 caterpillars were released, the number of webs remained low (1–10 webs/year). From before 2004, four sites were managed by a combination of scrub control (all sites), removal of trees (one site), reinstating cattle or pony grazing at 0.4 livestock units/ha (all sites), water level management (two sites) and cutting and removal of course grasses (one site) to increase the area of suitable habitat for marsh fritillary (estimated at 7.4–20.0 ha/site in 2007). In March–April 2007, a total of 42,000 caterpillars were released at four sites (3,500–22,900 caterpillars/site). Caterpillars were placed in groups of ~100 on clusters of devil’s-bit scabious <em>Succisa pratensis</em>. From mid-August 2007–2009, every patch of devil’s-bit scabious at each site was searched for caterpillar webs.</p>",
