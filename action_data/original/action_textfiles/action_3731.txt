Mitigation translocations may be carried out as a preventative measure to protect individuals but have been criticized for prioritising the process of removing individuals above establishing viable populations of translocated individuals in the destination location (Sullivan <em>et al</em>. 2014). A number of issues should be carefully considered before carrying out such translocations, including whether the proposed release site contains suitable habitat; whether the release of additional animals at an occupied site could negatively impact on the resident population; and whether a translocation alone can mitigate the impact of losing suitable habitat due to a development or other threat.</p>\r\n<p>Due to the number of studies found, this action has been split by species group, though no studies were found for amphisbaenians.

Five and zero gravid females were observed in 1996 and 1997 respectively, and two juveniles were presumed to be born at the release site. Translocated lizards had lower body mass for a given length than wild lizards (reported as condition index). Although 136 slow worms were originally captured in a development area and placed in a temporary enclosure, only 103 were recaptured and moved to the final release site. Slow worms (136 individuals) were relocated in 1994 from a housing development site to a 1,000 m<sup>2</sup> holding enclosure of grass and scrub with added hibernacula (rubble and log piles). Slow worms were recaptured under sheets of corrugated iron and translocated from July–October 1995 to a 1.7 ha island in a river that was recently cleared of overgrown vegetation; seeded with grass and native trees; and provisioned with log- and vegetation-piles and a new pond. Translocated lizards were monitored from March–October in 1996–1997 (280 visits) using corrugated iron sheets and photographs for identification and compared to a natural population 1.5 km from the island population.</p>",
