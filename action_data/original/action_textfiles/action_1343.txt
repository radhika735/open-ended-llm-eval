Time spent feeding and foraging as a group may be important for reinforcing social structures (Brennan &amp; Anderson, 1998) and for the development of natural feeding behaviours in young animals (Lefebvre 1995). Captive primates can be fed in social groups or given visual access to animals in other enclosures, with the aim of allowing natural group dynamics and social learning of feeding behaviours.</p>\r\n<p>Brennan, J &amp; Anderson, J.R.

The average number of food samples the capuchins ate averaged six as individuals, but 15 in a social condition. After the first encounter, consumption of the unfamiliar foods became equivalent to when they encountered the food alone. Capuchins were presented with eight novel food types in one of two conditions: individual and social. Each animal received four food types individually and another four with groupmates.    (CJ)</p><p> </p>",

In each of two groups, 12 of 24 monkeys were randomly assigned to the solo condition and 12 to the social condition. One monkey was in the left side of the test chamber, and either the right remained empty (solo condition), or contained a second monkey with a cup of cereal and peanut butter (social condition). Each left-hand monkey was given food in a clear 28cm square box with a protruding wheel to turn, aligning a hole with a chute that released food into a cup. Each test was measured as the number of seconds it took from presentation of the apparatus to completion of 20 attempts.    (CJ)</p><p> </p>",
