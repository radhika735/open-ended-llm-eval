They can also be connected to land water through rivers, and as such host both marine, brackish, and freshwater invertebrate species. However, coastal lagoons are highly threatened by eutrophication, pollution, urbanization, and diverse forms of modification in their watersheds, caused by high levels of human activity in the coastal zones of all continents (Esteves <em>et al</em>. 2008), resulting in biodiversity loss. Coastal lagoons could be restored through various means, including re-salination, hydrological modifications and algae harvesting (Ghosh <em>et al</em>. 2006; Lenzi <em>et al</em>. 2003). Restoring coastal lagoons can potentially help promote local biodiversity and recover lost or declining species of subtidal benthic invertebrates (Mohapatra <em>et al.</em> 2007).</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"> </p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><sub>Esteves F.A., Caliman A., Santangelo J.M., Guariento R.D., Farjalla V.F. &amp; Bozelli R.L.

There were reductions in the number of prawn species (before: 24; after: 18 but four were new) and crab species (before: 28; after: 14 but seven were new), and an increase in lobster species (before: 0; after: 2). Abundance (as four-year averages of commercial landings) increased by 1,200% for prawns (before: 187; after: 2,430 t), and 1,135% for crabs (before: 10; after: 130 t). No commercial landings were reported for lobsters. Authors report that increases in landings were correlated with increases in salinity after restoration. The ecological status of the Chilika lagoon declined throughout the 20<sup>th</sup> century. In 2000, channels were dredged or extended to increase connections to the sea and rivers and improve the hydrology. Data were obtained from Orissa state Department of Fisheries for 1996–2000 (pre-restoration), and by the authors for 2000–2004 (post-restoration), following the same sampling methods. Thirty-four landings centres were visited monthly and prawn and crab catches, including the commercially valued species <em>Penaeus monodon, Penaeus indicus, Metapenaeus monoceros, Metapenaeus dobsoni, Macrobrachium sp. </em>and<em> Scylla sp., </em>were recorded (see study for details).</p>",

Sixteen molluscan species were recorded across the lagoon. Species richness in Moon Pond (13 species; highest salinity; closest to the sea) was significantly higher than in the central lagoon (9 species; intermediate salinity and distance to the sea) and the northwest cove (2 species, lowest salinity and furthest from the sea). Total mollusc abundance varied spatially within the lagoon, from 0.3 to 3,470 individuals/m<sup>2</sup>. Abundance of four selected species (softshell clam <em>Mya arenaria</em>; northern quahog <em>Mercenaria mercenaria</em>; blue mussel <em>Mytilus edulis;</em> periwinkle <em>Littorina sp.</em>) followed the same spatial pattern as species richness (see paper for details).  In 2002, tidal flow was partially restored to East Harbor lagoon (dominated by freshwater) by opening a culvert connecting to Cape Cod. Previously, no molluscan species were reported. In summer 2005, locations within three areas of the lagoon were surveyed twice (Moon Pond: 10 locations; central lagoon: 30 locations; northwest cove: 10 locations) using cores (0.79 m<sup>2</sup>) and quadrats (0.45 m<sup>2</sup>). Molluscs (&gt;2 mm in cores; &gt;0.64 cm in quadrats) were identified and counted. Salinity was measured at each location.</p>",

Although it is possible to skip actions, we encourage you to score them all using the evidence provided.</li>\r\n<li>Open each action in the <strong>Pending</strong> tab in turn by clicking on the title. Start by reading all the summarised evidence we have found. Each action with evidence available will have:</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>a) <strong>Background section</strong>, describing the intervention;</li>\r\n<li>b) <strong>Key messages</strong>, providing an overview of the evidence;</li>\r\n<li>c) <strong>Supporting evidence,</strong> containing summaries of each study that tested the action. Clicking on the link beside the number will take you to the reference details.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong><em>Based on the evidence provided </em>please enter scores</strong> for the effectiveness, certainty and harms of the action, using a scale from 0-100. It is critical that your answers are based on information in the synopsis. Your expertise is invaluable for understanding and interpreting the evidence, but please do not base your assessments on your own personal knowledge or anecdotal evidence about an intervention.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>EFFECTIVENESS</strong>: The ‘effectiveness’ scale is from 0 (ineffective) to 100 (highly effective), and should reflect how good an intervention is at benefitting the conservation of benthic invertebrate species. This could be evaluated in a variety of different ways. For example, we could measure the increase in numbers of a population following the introduction of a specific intervention, the reduction in mortality or the establishment of a new population following translocation. We would like you to score according to what we know about whether the <em>ultimate objective</em> of the intervention is being achieved, i.e. whether the intervention leads to an increase in the conservation of subtidal benthic invertebrates. </p>\r\n<p><strong>CERTAINTY</strong>: The ‘certainty of evidence’ is a rating of how confident we can be about the effectiveness of an action, from 0 (no certainty; no useful evidence) to 100 (complete certainty; high quality evidence). To assess this, consider the quality of the evidence for the action. You should think about the number of studies, their coverage and wider applicability (species, geographical), the similarity of results across studies and the robustness of the experimental designs (e.g. randomised, replicated, controlled experiments with a large sample size will give more dependable results than a single before-and-after comparison).</p>\r\n<p><strong>HARMS</strong>: Harms in this context refers to any undesirable effects for benthic species as a consequence of these interventions. Harms on other species groups are not included as we did not search the literature specifically for this purpose. If there is no evidence of harms please score this 0. </p>\r\n<p>Remember, you can exit and return to the survey several times at your convenience. You can also move backwards and forwards between interventions if necessary.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Please add a <strong>Score Comment</strong> for any actions where you feel this is useful. This is particularly important if your score does not follow obviously from the evidence provided, for example if you have given some studies more weight than others because of your knowledge of the system.</li>\r\n<li>Once you have opened an action, and either scored it or skipped it, it will be moved to the corresponding tab. Until you submit your final scores, you can re-open actions that have been moved to these tabs to check them or alter your scores if you need to.</li>\r\n<li>When you have moved all the actions from the <strong>Pending</strong> tab to the <strong>Scored</strong> tab, and you are happy with your scores for the assessment, please submit your final scores. Do this using the link on the left hand side of the assessment page.</li>\r\n<li>Please complete the scoring by the end of 24th of February.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><em>N.B. If you know about any evidence relating to specific interventions for the conservation of subtidal benthic invertebrate species that is missing from the synopsis, please email to let us know the reference details. This will be valuable in putting together future versions of the synopsis and ‘What Works in Conservation’.</em></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROUND 2</em></strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Your task is to review the group’s category of effectiveness for each action, based on the group median scores from the first round.</li>\r\n<li>You will receive a spreadsheet containing both your scores and the group median score for each action that has been assessed. Each of these will have been used to put the action into a category, one based on your scores, and one based on the group median score (see Table 1 above). <strong>The Group Category is the one you need to consider</strong> <strong>whether you agree with or not</strong>, as that will be the published assessment. This decision should be based on whether the category for an action reflects the evidence provided for its effectiveness, certainty and harms. Comments made by reviewers in the first round of the assessment are also available in the final columns next to each action. The URL for the evidence for each action is also provided if you wish to go back and check the evidence available.</li>\r\n<li>Please go through each of the actions in turn, and check if you are happy with the Group Category. It may be useful to read the reviewers’ comments to see if they aid in interpreting the scores that have been given, as well as checking the evidence online by following the URL. If there are any actions that you believe have been placed in the wrong category by the group please indicate this in the “<strong>Strongly disagree?</strong>” column. For any actions where you disagree you need to provide a <strong>Supporting comment</strong> in the next column to explain why you disagree with the category. Please remember that <strong>all assessments must be based solely on the evidence presented on the Conservation Evidence website</strong>.</li>\r\n<li>Please complete the scoring by the end of 9th of March.<u></u></li>\r\n<li>Actions which at least two reviewers believe have been placed in the wrong category will be sent out for re-scoring in Round 3.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROUND 3</em></strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You will receive an email alerting you when the third round of the assessment opens.</li>\r\n<li>All the actions to be re-scored will be sent to you in a spreadsheet. Only a subset of actions, where a proportion of assessors have disagreed with the category, will be included in this round.</li>\r\n<li>Look at each action in turn. Each action will show your scores and the group’s median scores that the action received in the first round, as well as the Group Category of effectiveness (calculated from the median group score in Round 1). Next to this you can see the comments that were made by the reviewers who flagged this action for re-scoring, so please make sure you read them.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>You are now given the opportunity to adjust your scores for Effectiveness, Certainty and Harms if you feel that they do not reflect the evidence well. If you wish to do this please just type over your original scores in the spreadsheet. Alternatively, if after reading the comments, you are happy with your original scores please leave them.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Once you have checked your scores for all actions that have been flagged for re-scoring please finalise your scoresheet.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Thank you very much for your help, we know that this is a substantial task. We expect that this will be a very influential piece of work. We will inform you when the results of the assessment have been made available online, and also when the new edition of <em>What Works in Conservation</em> is published.</p>\r\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>QUERIES: </strong>If you have any questions about the process, please don’t hesitate to get in touch: <a href=\"mailto:sop21@zoo.cam.ac.uk\"><strong>sop21@cam.ac.uk</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>",
