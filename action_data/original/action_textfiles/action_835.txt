        "background_definitions": "<p class=\"Background\">Captive breeding involves taking wild animals into captivity and establishing and maintaining breeding populations. It tends to be undertaken when wild populations become very small or fragmented or when they are declining rapidly. Captive populations can be maintained while threats in the wild are reduced or removed and can provide an insurance policy against catastrophe in the wild. Captive breeding also potentially provides a method of increasing reproductive output beyond what would be possible in the wild. The aim is usually to release captive-bred animals back to natural habitats, either to original sites once conditions are suitable, to reintroduce species to sites that were occupied in the past or to introduce species to new sites. Some captive populations may also be used for research to benefit wild populations.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">Amphibians possess a number of traits that make them potentially suitable for captive breeding programmes. They reach breeding age relatively quickly and are fertile and so captive populations can, in theory, be expanded quickly. Also their small body size and low maintenance requirements allow viable populations to be managed much more cost-effectively than many larger animals. However, captive breeding can result in problems associated with inbreeding depression, removal of natural selection and adaptation to captive conditions.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">Studies in which amphibians were treated with hormones to induce sperm or egg release, or eggs were fertilized artificially are discussed in separate sections below.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">Studies that investigate the effectiveness of releasing of captive-bred amphibians are discussed in ‘<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"../../data/index?category_id=152\">Release captive-bred individuals</a></span>’. Those studies are not included in this section, unless specific details about captive breeding were included.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

Following five months quarantine, adults were housed at 12–27°C in a glass tank (70 x 30 x 45 cm) with a water dish and plants. Tanks were misted once or twice a day and before breeding an ultra-sonic fogger was turned on for 10 hours overnight three times a week.
