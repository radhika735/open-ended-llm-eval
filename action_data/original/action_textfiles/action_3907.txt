However, more species of the family Notodontidae were found in organic than conventional farms (data not presented). Of 126 species collected only once, 91 were found on organic farms compared to 35 on conventional farms (statistical significance not assessed). See paper for species results. Eight organic farms had no chemical inputs for at least three years. Eight conventional farms had chemical fertilizers and herbicides applied. From June–September 2001, macro-moths were sampled on six nights/site. Each night, one fluorescent UV black-light funnel trap was set halfway along a hedge, and one was set ~50 m away in the middle of the adjacent crop field. Two organic and two conventional farms were sampled each night, and all sites were sampled within five nights every two weeks.</p>",

Butterfly abundance was 60% higher on organic (average: 68 individuals) than conventional farms (42 individuals). Species richness was 23% higher on organic (average: 10 species) than conventional farms (8 species). Butterfly abundance increased steadily with years since land was converted from conventionally-managed to organic farming, but time since conversion to organic did not affect species richness (data presented as statistical results). In June–August 2009, butterfly surveys were carried out in 40 organic and 20 conventionally-managed farms. Organic farms varied in time since conversion from conventional management (1–25 years). On each farm, three 250 m transects were completed 5–6 times - one in an uncultivated margin of a cereal field, and two within the field at 50 m and 200 m from the margin transect.

Twelve species of moth were associated with new organic farms (see paper for details), but no species were associated with old organic or conventional farms. Six farms had been in organic management for ≤6 years, six had been in organic management for 15–23 years, and six were still managed conventionally. In early August 2010, moths were sampled for four consecutive days using three bait traps/farm.

Each transect ran diagonally through a single crop or habitat type, with all available crops and habitats represented.
