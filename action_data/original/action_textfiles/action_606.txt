Techniques can be extremely complex, with precision humidity and temperature control and turning of the eggs to ensure correct development Hand-rearing can be used with chicks from artificially-incubated eggs or with chicks removed from parents after hatching and involves manually feeding chicks until independence. Both techniques can be used to encourage parents to produce more offspring, or when naturally-raised chicks and eggs have low survival.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

In 1964, 11 of 12 eggs transported in the incubator hatched. In 1965, nine of 14 eggs hatched. Egg collections each year were treated similarly (all eggs partially incubated on the nests) and were in transit for 10 hours (across 300 miles) before they were set under bantam hens for final incubation. The temperature varied only 0.3<sup>o</sup>c and was constant most of the time. The custom-designed incubator consisted of three main elements: the plywood housing, the electrical heating element, and the thermo-switch. A small glass window was installed in the centre of the upper door to observe the eggs and temperature without opening the door.</p><p> </p>",

A total of 42 goslings were tested: 12 were reared in an outdoor pen adjacent to a pen with a pair of adult geese, allowing interaction from 16-30 days after hatching; eleven chicks reared in a large outdoor pen with no adults present; nine chicks were raised in three groups, in sight of adults for the first 14 days after hatching; ten chicks in four groups were reared by parents in either a large pen with 90 other geese, or a small pen with just the family present.</p><p> </p>",
