A total of 55 nests were found in the canals, and the number of nest/year increased in the period from 1986–1993 (1983: 3 nests; 1993: 11 nests). The number of non-hatchlings crocodiles increased by an average of 9% each year from 1983–1993, and authors estimated that the populations consisted of 24–30 non-hatchling crocodiles. The Turkey Point power plant site (2,388 ha) had a large canal system acting as a closed loop system for cooling water discharged from the plant. Water temperatures in the canals averaged 38°C, and salinity was 36 ppt. Eight other non-connected canals are also located adjacent to the cooling canals. In 1983–1993, night surveys were conducted of the whole area twice/week to monitor crocodile distributions and survival of hatchlings and juveniles. In 1984–1993, nest surveys, night surveys for hatchlings and periodical day surveys were conducted within the cooling canal system and hatchlings were individually marked.</p>",
