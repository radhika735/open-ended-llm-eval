Techniques to maximise survival may therefore be an important part of ensuring the overall success of translocations. In addition, ensuring higher survival can help to reduce the impact of translocations on source populations by requiring fewer individuals to be taken.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

When the new technique was used, 88% and 96% warblers (1987 and 1988 respectively) adapted, significantly more than when using the standard technique. A total of 188 trips (612 km one-way) were made without fatality.</p><p> </p>",

Birds kept overnight without thermal support had significantly higher mortality rates (4/10 birds in both species) than those provided with thermal support (0/10 common amakihi and 1/10 Japanese white-eyes), and birds that lost the most weight had the highest mortality. Birds were captured, transported by car for four hours and kept in captivity for 48 hours before release.  All birds suffered weight loss, and fat and protein store depletion, with all deaths occurring within the first 24 hours following capture, regardless of whether the birds were quarantined and then transported or transported and then quarantined. Bird age, capture weight, or fat score did not affect survival rates.</p><p> </p>",
