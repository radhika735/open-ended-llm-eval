Results were not statistically tested. After the tool was deployed, 0–0.03 loggerhead turtles/1000 hooks (12 total turtles) were caught compared to 0.01–0.04 loggerhead turtles/1000 hooks (17 total turtles) in the previous year and 0–0.05 turtles/1000 hooks (9 total turtles) two years earlier. Fishers did not remain south of the fishing boundary line recommended by the tool, instead the whole fishery moved further north than previously and remained north for a longer time than in the two preceding years (see paper for details). ‘TurtleWatch’ combined historical fishing, environmental and turtle behavioural data to recommend areas to avoid fishing. In January–March 2007, information from the tool was disseminated daily in electronic and paper format to industry professionals and fishers. The fishery also had a legal catch limit of 17 turtles/year, after which fishery closures were imposed. In January–March 2005–2007, line deployments (2005: 520 deployments; 2006: 842; 2007: 797), number of hooks put out (2005: 429,580 hooks; 2006: 670,914; 2007: 689,486), and loggerhead turtle interactions were monitored.</p>",
