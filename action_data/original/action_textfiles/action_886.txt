Many ants form mutualistic relationships with insect pests (e.g. feeding on honeydew secreted by bugs (Hemiptera) such as aphids), defending them from predators and parasitoids. Excluding these ants may therefore increase predation and parasitism rates by beneficial invertebrates. See also 'Isolate colonies of beneficial ants' for managing ants that act as natural predators and improve pest control.</p>",
