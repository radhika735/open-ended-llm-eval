The offal (waste) is then normally discarded overboard. Discarding offal overboard during fishing may attract aquatic reptiles and increase the risk of entanglement or capture in gear. Retaining offal on board or disposing of offal at locations and times away from fishing operations may reduce this risk.</p>",
