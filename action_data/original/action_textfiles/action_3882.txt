        "background_definitions": "<p>Open habitats, such as grassland, heathland, peatland and fynbos, require disturbance processes to prevent them undergoing succession to scrub or woodland. One option for preventing succession and opening up areas of habitat is to use prescribed burning. Although destructive in the short-term, with likely loss of butterflies and moths through direct mortality or reductions in food availability (Glaves <em>et al.</em> 2013), burning may have long-term benefits by creating a more favourable, open habitat (Bubová <em>et al.</em> 2015), with increases in structural diversity (Glaves <em>et al.</em> 2013) or flower density (Vogel <em>et al.</em> 2010). In particular, fires which move quickly across the site and burn some areas more than others may be important for creating a diverse habitat structure (Kwilosz &amp; Knutson 1999). However, the impact of fires can vary depending on their exact characteristics, such as the frequency, temperature, ground surface intensity, time and size of burning compared to the surrounding unburned areas (Swengel 2001, Tucker 2003, New <em>et al.</em> 2010) and caution should be taken before instigating fire in place of alternative management options such as grazing or cutting.</p>\r\n<p>For studies on further manipulations to burning regimes, including using different frequencies or timing of prescribed burning, see “<a href=\"../../actions/3883\"><em>Use rotational burning</em></a>”, “<a href=\"../../actions/3878\"><em>Change season/timing of prescribed burning</em></a>” and “<a href=\"../../actions/3879\"><em>Leave some areas unburned during prescribed burning</em></a>”.

In late May 1988–2003, caterpillars were counted once/year, at night, in seven 15 × 1 m plots in the burned area and seven in the unburned area.</p>",

There were fewer regal fritillaries on prairies which had been burned since the last growing season (0.9 individuals/100 m) than on prairies which were unburned in that time (3.2 individuals/100 m). However, the presence of fritillaries at a site was similar between burned (16/21 sites) and unburned (54/66 sites) prairies. Eighty-seven tallgrass prairie remnants (0.9–53.9 ha) were managed by either burning (usually in April), cutting once/year in July, or grazing. In June 2005, signs of recent fire were used to classify sites at recently burned (since autumn 2004) or unburned in that time. In June 2005, regal fritillaries were surveyed along transects (130–1,300 m long), &gt;30 m from the edge of the prairie.</p>",

The abundance and species richness of 18 disturbance-tolerant butterfly species was similar on burned (abundance: 4–11 individuals; richness: 6–7 species) and undisturbed (abundance: 4–14 individuals; richness: 6–8 species) grass field margins. The abundance and species richness of 14 grassland butterfly species also remained similar in burned (abundance: 0.3–1.3 individuals; richness: 1–3 species) and undisturbed (abundance: 0.5–1.3; richness: 1–3 species) margins. See paper for details of individual species. In spring 2004, grass margins were sown with a seed mix of common prairie species. Ten fields (containing 26 margins) were randomly assigned to one of two treatments: burning and no disturbance. Within each burning field, one margin was burned in spring 2008 and a different margin was burned in spring 2009. From June–August 2007–2009, butterflies were surveyed six times/year along three 50-m transects in the centre of each margin.</p>",

In undegraded uplands with diverse vegetation, by one type of average (mean) Poweshiek skipperling abundance was higher at sites managed with burning (17 butterflies/km) than haying (4 butterflies/km) or those left idling (3 butterflies/km), but by another type of average (median) abundance was lower at sites with burning (0 butterflies/km) than haying (2 butterflies/km) or idling (3 butterflies/km). However, in undegraded moist prairie, abundance was lower at sites with burning (0–7 butterflies/km) than haying (2–11 butterflies/km) (no data was provided for idling sites). In undegraded uplands with burning management, abundance was highest two to six years after burning (22–36 butterflies/km), and  lowest in the year of burning up to three years after burning (0–3 butterflies/km). Butterfly and habitat management surveys were conducted at 37 sites in northern Iowa, western Minnesota and eastern Dakota in June–August 1988–1997. Not all sites were surveyed for the whole period or every year. Surveys were of varying lengths and conducted simultaneously along one set of parallel transects (5–10 m apart) in each site. These butterfly counts were combined with a butterfly survey dataset from another researcher team, which overlapped in location, and adjusted to account for differences in survey methods (survey details and sites for this dataset were not provided).</p>",

The authors suggested that negative short-term impacts of burning can be reduced by leaving small areas of land unburned, and by burning in winter or early spring (data not presented). Meadows were burned in different patterns and at different times of year. The review focussed on 67 butterfly species of conservation concern. The available information was biased towards studies in Northern and Western Europe.</p>",

Patch-burning did not affect butterfly community composition compared to other management (data presented as model results). One out of nine species (purplish copper <em>Lycaena helloides</em>) was more abundant in patch-burned pastures, while three species (meadow fritillary <em>Boloria bellona</em>, regal fritillary <em>Speyeria idalia</em> and small pearl-bordered fritillary <em>Boloria selene</em>) were less abundant in patch-burned pastures than other management, and five species had a similar abundance between management types (see paper for details). Twenty-six butterfly species were recorded in patch-burned grazed pastures, compared to 30 species in rotationally grazed pastures, 25 species in rotationally grazed pastures with mowing and 22 species in season-long grazed pastures (statistical significance not assessed). Eight pastures (54–484 ha) managed under one of four management practices (patch-burn grazing, rotational grazing, rotational grazing with lowland mowing, season-long grazing) were selected. One-third of each patch-burn pasture was burned in the dormant season, but prior to April 2015 these sites were rotationally grazed. All other sites had the same management for at least a decade. Rotational pastures were sub-divided into four paddocks, each grazed twice/season. In mown pastures, sedge-dominated patches were cut once/summer. On season-long pastures cattle were free to select grazing areas. Pastures were stocked with cattle (0.5–0.75 cow-calf pairs/ha) from May–October. From June–August 2015 and 2016, butterflies were surveyed three times/year along twelve 100-m transects/pasture.</p>",

In the first spring after burning, fewer Kincaid’s lupine <em>Lupinus oreganus</em> and spur lupine<em> Lupinus arbustus</em> plants had damage from Fender’s blue caterpillars, per egg found the previous June, in burned plots (0.1 leaves/egg) than in unburned plots (0.3 leaves/egg). However, the following year, there were more damaged leaves in burned (1.2 leaves/egg) than unburned (0.7 leaves/egg) plots, but there was no difference by the third year after burning (burned: 0.3 leaves/egg; unburned: 0.3 leaves/egg). For two years after burning, there were also more eggs in June, per caterpillar found in April, in burned plots (67–68 eggs/caterpillar) than in unburned plots (48–49 eggs/caterpillar), but by the third year after burning the number was similar in burned (26 eggs/caterpillar) and unburned (25 eggs/caterpillar) plots. However, the population declined by 78% in the burned areas and 83% in the unburned areas (statistical significance not assessed). In October 2011, half of each of four prairies was burned (0.07–0.21 ha burned), and the remaining area was not burned. In June 2011–2014, Fender’s blue eggs were surveyed in twenty 1-m<sup>2</sup> plots/patch (160 plots total) with ≥30% cover of lupine. In April 2012–2014, the number of caterpillars was estimated by counting the number of lupine leaves with characteristic Fender’s blue feeding damage.</p>",
