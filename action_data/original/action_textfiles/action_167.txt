Similarly, a randomised, repeated and controlled choice experiment in a flight cage found that dark-eyed juncos <em>Junco hyemalis</em> did not consistently avoid windows marked with wind chimes, silhouettes of falcons, plants, stickers of eyes or model owls. However, birds tended to avoid windows that were completely covered by white cloth, or covered by closely spaced cloth strips and meshes. Widely spaced cloth strips and flashing lights partially increased avoidance.</p>",

The same study found that, when platform feeders were placed at varying distances in front of the windows (see ‘Provide supplementary food - Place feeders close to windows to reduce collisions’), only four of 52 fatal collisions (8%) occurred with tinted windows, the rest with clear glass windows. However, the authors note that the tinted glass was of a poor reflective quality and they believe this may have resulted in fewer fatalities than a highly reflective tinted glass. Experiments used six plate glass, wooden framed windows (1.4 x 1.2 m, 1.2 m off the ground, 15-43 m apart) on the edge of deciduous woodland and farmland.</p>",
