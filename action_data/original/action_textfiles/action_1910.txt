        "background_definitions": "<p>The diets of many wild carnivores change across different seasons but this may not be reflected in their captive husbandry. There is evidence to suggest stereotypic behaviours in captivity can alter seasonally due to innate urges to mate and forage at different times of the year [1]. Not only this, weight management can also be an issue due to a lack of understanding of the yearly feeding ecology as well as food availability in each zoo [2]. Altering food type seasonally aims to maintain the health of the animal as well as encourage natural annual feeding cycles.</p>\r\n<p>Â </p>\r\n<p>[1] Carlstead, K., Seidensticker, J. 1991.
