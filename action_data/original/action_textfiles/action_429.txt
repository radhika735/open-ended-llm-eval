There were no changes in either species richness or abundance of ground-nesting or upper canopy-nesting species. Threshold densities for songbirds not found with high deer densities (eastern wood pewee <em>Contopus virens</em>, indigo bunting <em>Passerina cyanea</em>, least flycatcher <em>Empidonax minimus</em>, yellow-billed cuckoo <em>Coccyzus americanus</em>, cerulean warbler <em>Dendroica cerulea</em>, eastern phoebe <em>Sayornis phoebe</em> and American robin <em>Turdus migratorius</em>) appeared to be between 7.9 and 14.9 deer/km<sup>2</sup>.</p><p> </p>",

However, all but two showed short-term declines. In a closed forest from which grazers were excluded, only two species showed an increase, with the rest either stable or declining. Birds were monitored between 1987 and 2007 in the open forest and 1999 and 2007 in the closed forest.

The proportion of territories in exclusion plots also increased, from 0% in 2000 to 70-80% in 2005-7. A total of 48 territories were mapped. Native roe deer <em>Capreolus capreolus</em> and introduced fallow deer <em>Dama dama</em> and Revves’ muntjac <em>Muntiacus reevesi</em> were excluded by erecting 1.8 m steel fences. The authors argue that differences are due to the area of optimal-age coppice (3-8 year old) within plots.</p><p> </p>",
