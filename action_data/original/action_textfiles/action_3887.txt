        "background_definitions": "<p>Butterflies and moths may be vulnerable to non-native diseases, parasites, predators or competitors introduced by international trade, in particular of live plants and fresh food. Since many problematic species will themselves be small invertebrates, detecting and removing them after they have been released into a new location is likely to be almost impossible. Therefore, increasing biosecurity checks on shipments may help to identify and remove potentially invasive species before they arrive in new locations, preventing them from having the opportunity to survive and spread.</p>",
