In one of two regions, the proportion of tinder fungus <em>Fomes fomentarius </em>fruiting bodies in which <em>Scardia boletella</em> was found was higher at sites with a long history of deadwood presence (33–36% of 133 fruiting bodies) than at sites with a short history of deadwood presence (0–10% of 177 fruiting bodies) or with little deadwood (0% of 28 fruiting bodies), but there was no significant difference in the other region (long: 0–54% of 172 fruiting bodies; short: 0–38% of 260 fruiting bodies; no sites with little deadwood). The proportion of red-belted conk <em>Fomitopsis pinicola </em>and tinder fungus fruiting bodies on which <em>A. yildizae</em> moths were found was not significantly different at sites with a long (conk: 3–17% of 239 fruiting bodies; tinder: 0–29% of 305 fruiting bodies) or short (conk: 1–6% of 628 fruiting bodies; tinder: 0–10% of 437 fruiting bodies) history of deadwood presence, or with little deadwood (conk: 0–3% of 104 fruiting bodies; tinder: 7% of 28 fruiting bodies). Twenty-five forests were managed with one of three strategies based on the availability of deadwood: 10 sites had large amounts of deadwood which was likely to have been continuously available for &gt;100 years; 12 sites had large amounts of deadwood which was not likely to have been available 100 years earlier; and three sites were managed conventionally for timber production, with little deadwood available. From 1992–1995, a total of 976 fruiting bodies of red-belted conk were collected from 11 sites, and 770 fruiting bodies of tinder fungus were collected from 20 sites. These were collected by walking a random route through each site, and sampling 1–8 fruiting bodies from every second tree trunk which contained some. Fungi were kept in sealed boxes with a glass vial inserted to collect emerging insects, and kept outdoors from September to February to experience natural temperatures.</p>",
