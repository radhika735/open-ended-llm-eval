There were no differences in clutch size between treatments, so the authors suggest that differences in productivity were due to failure rates, with 11% of 105 nests close to water failing, compared to 38% of 74 nests far from water. The increase was greatest in years of low natural rainfall but apparent in all years.</p><p> </p>",
