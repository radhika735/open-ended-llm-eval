It may have advantages over natural insemination through mating if, for example, captive birds will not form pair bonds, or if males in some pairs are infertile. The ability to transport frozen sperm between geographically isolated populations can also substantially increase the genetic diversity of species. However, the methods used may be very species-specific and research may be needed before it can be adopted for any one species.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

The sperm was taken from one wild-bred male and one captive-bred male and mixed and the female was inseminated within an hour. The authors suggested that repeated inseminations would have been preferable, but that the disturbance caused by capturing and inseminating the female risked disturbing other breeding birds nearby.

Extracting good quality sperm is a major barrier, with the ‘abdominal massage technique’ being the most practical and widely applicable method (although it is prone to urine contamination).  Trained birds are more likely to accept insemination. The authors found that fertility is up to 400% higher when sperm are deposited into the vagina compared to the cloaca.  However, this constraint can be overcome by boosting sperm volume and insemination frequency (2-3 times/week), which has resulted in 80% fertility in crane species using cloacal insemination. Multiple, deep inseminations improves fertility and can help to overcome poor semen quality. Even when eggs are mostly fertile, artificial insemination can increase fertility by an additional 5-10%.</p><p> </p>",
