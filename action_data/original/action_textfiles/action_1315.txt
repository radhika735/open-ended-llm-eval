When food was thrown onto the bare floors, foraging time ranged between 1% and 7% of the total time in comparison to 35% when sunflower seeds were scattered in woodchips over the floor. Two groups of rhesus macaques (n=15) were housed continually in bare tiled enclosures with food thrown onto the floor. Woodchips and sunflower seeds were then scattered over the floors of both enclosures for four weeks. Each animal was observed for 10 minutes twice each week between 09:00 h and 10:00 h and between 13:00 h and 14:00 h over nine months.    (CJ)</p><p> </p>",

The average abnormal behaviour observations were reduced from 10% when food was presented in one place to 4% when it was scattered. Repeated eating of regurgitated food was reduced from 5% to 1% and other abnormal oral behaviours from 4% to 1%. Non-oral abnormal behaviours were not reduced. No evidence of habituation was found over nine weeks. Chimpanzees were housed in five enclosures in groups of two or three. Two cups of mixed seeds and nuts were scattered in the straw of each of the enclosures twice daily. For each chimpanzee (n = 13), behaviour was recorded every 15 seconds over five minutes/day. Observations were carried out on 60 occasions (total of five hours) over three months both during the control and when food was scattered.    (CJ)</p><p> </p>",

When food was dispersed within a one metre radius, feeding males submitted to female aggression 42 times, within a two metre radius they submitted 38 times and within a four metre radius they submitted 19 times. Feed was scattered in a circular area to simulate a two dimensional food patch. Food patches with a radius of 1, 2, and 4m were created. All aggressive behaviours were recorded in nine adults and two infant lemurs from when the food was given to the end of the group’s feeding session. Each radius length was tested eight times, during different feeding times.    (CJ)</p><p> </p>",

Inactivity was reduced from 23 minutes (out of 30) to 15 minutes in the yard toss, five minutes when food was scattered and four minutes when feeders were used. Behaviour of all six individuals housed in the same enclosure was observed every minute for 30 minutes before and after each treatment for five days.    (CJ)</p>",
