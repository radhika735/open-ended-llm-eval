        "background_definitions": "<p>Former mining and quarrying sites are often hostile environments for butterflies and moths, as large areas of bare ground may remain sparsely vegetated for many decades (Rowe <em>et al.</em> 2006). However, many former extraction sites have been turned into important nature reserves over time since their abandonment (e.g. Turner <em>et al.</em> 2009). Restoration of such sites may involve a number of different actions, such as introducing soil or nutrients, planting desired vegetation communities, flooding areas or landscaping new features. A common approach for the restoration of post-mining sites is “technical reclamation”, whereby the uneven surface is flattened by heavy machinery, before fertile soil is added and sown with grasses and herbs, and planted with trees. However, by accelerating succession, such an approach can reduce habitat availability for species which depend on disturbed, early successional habitats (Moradi <em>et al.</em> 2018).</p>\r\n<p><sup>Moradi J., Potocký P., Kočárek P., Bartuška M., Tajovský K., Tichánek F., Frouz J. &amp; Tropek R.

On fertilized birch and willow trees in a former quarry, the number of caterpillars (1.3 individuals/m<sup>2</sup> leaf) was not significantly different from the number on unfertilized trees in the quarry (1.0 individuals/m<sup>2</sup> leaf) or on trees in undisturbed woodland (2.0 individuals/m<sup>2</sup> leaf). Twenty birch <em>Betula </em>spp. and 20 willow <em>Salix </em>spp. trees were selected in an area of nutrient-poor slate waste which had been partly colonized by trees over 40–100 years since quarrying. The site was grazed by sheep at low density (0.1 ewes/ha). On 23 May 2000 and 2001, fertilizer (175 kg nitrogen/ha, 53 kg phosphorus/ha, 188 kg potassium/ha) was applied to a 2.25 m<sup>2</sup> plot around 10 trees of each species. In May, June and July 2000 and 2001, a small branch (4–5 mm diameter) from the top of each birch tree was enclosed in a bag and cut, and the caterpillars collected in the bag were counted. In 2001 only, caterpillars were sampled from willow trees using the same method. Each year, caterpillars were also sampled from 10 trees of the same species from an adjacent, undisturbed woodland.</p>",

In technically restored quarries, the species richness of all butterflies and day-flying moths (17 species/plot) was lower than in naturally restored quarries (24 species/plot). In addition, the species richness of xeric habitat specialists, and species of conservation concern, was also lower in technically restored quarries (xeric: 5–6; conservation: 0–2 species/plot) than in naturally restored quarries (xeric: 8–15; conservation: 3–7 species/plot). Five pairs of plots (0.2–0.3 ha, 0–150 m apart) were monitored in five quarries which had been abandoned for 10–60 years. In each pair, one plot had been “technically restored” (site covered with topsoil, fast-growing herbs sown, trees planted) and the other had been left to develop naturally (“spontaneous succession”). From May–August 2007, butterflies and day-flying moths were surveyed five times along two perpendicular transects through each plot (50 m/5 min).</p>",

Eleven to 15 years after restoration from mining, a restored peat bog had a similar density of Fred the thread caterpillars (1–2 caterpillars/m of stem) to three undisturbed sites (1–2 caterpillars/m of stem). The caterpillars were a similar size in the restored (9–11 mm) and undisturbed bogs (5–10 mm). Within a 150-ha peat mine, mined strips (45 m wide, 950 m long) had been restored 11–15 years earlier by creating raised islands of processed peat (5 m diameter, 30 cm high, 30 m apart) which were seeded with mānuka <em>Leptospermum scoparium</em>, which was eventually outcompeted by bamboo rush <em>Sporadanthus ferrugineus</em>. The islands reached 100% vegetation cover in two years. The restored areas were adjacent to 40 ha of unmined peat. From March–April 2013, twenty 60-cm-long sections of bamboo rush stems were collected from a 33-cm-diameter plot on each of two islands (20 m apart, 600 m from unmined peat) in each of three restored strips, and from 6–14 plots in each of three undisturbed bogs (114–10,201 ha).
