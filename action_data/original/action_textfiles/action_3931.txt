However, as a perennial species which grows naturally in the forest understorey, coffee can also be grown among other, taller trees, which may or may not also provide a commercial product (“shade-grown coffee”). By retaining a more diverse forest structure, shade-grown coffee may allow a more diverse forest ecosystem to develop or persist, including communities of butterflies and moths. However, some species of moth, such as the coffee leaf miner, are a coffee pest, and growers may want to reduce their abundance (Borkhataria <em>et al.</em> 2012).</p>\r\n<p><sup>Borkhataria R.R., Collazo J.A. &amp; Groom M.J.

The rustic plantation had higher species richness of fruit-eating butterflies (25) than traditional polyculture (10), commercial polyculture (10–11) and shaded monoculture (10) plantations. The rustic plantation had similar species richness to a nearby intact area of forest (27) but lower species richness than a further away forest (36). In two areas of Mexico, one rustic, one traditional polyculture, one shaded monoculture and two traditional polyculture plantations were surveyed. In summer 1998 at four points in each location (28 points in total) two fruit-baited traps were set, one in the understory and one in the canopy, for eight days. Estimated species richness was calculated statistically from numbers of butterflies caught in traps.</p>",

In shade-grown coffee plantations, the abundance of caterpillars (1.3 individuals/tree) was higher than in sun-grown plantations (0.6 individuals/tree). However, the abundance of a coffee pest species (coffee leaf miner <em>Leucoptera coffeela</em>) was not significantly different in shade-grown (2.0 individuals/tree) and sun-grown coffee (1.7 individuals/tree). In April 1999 and March–April 2000, caterpillars were surveyed in two or three randomly-located plots (&gt;120 m apart) in each of three shade- and three sun-grown coffee plantations (1.35–5.95 ha). Caterpillars were surveyed by turning 100 leaves (&gt;10 cm long, 0.5–2 m high) in each of 12–14 coffee trees/plot.</p>",

On four polyculture and shaded monoculture coffee plantations, the abundance (124–212 individuals) and species richness (83–129 species) of caterpillars was higher than in a sun-grown coffee monoculture (abundance: 47 individuals; richness: 46 species). In addition, the amount of damage found on coffee leaves was not related to either caterpillar abundance or species richness (data not presented). The management intensity of five coffee plantations was measured based on 10 vegetation characteristics (including canopy cover, epiphyte cover, area of shade trees and presence of herbs) and the frequency of six external inputs (fertilizers, insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, irrigation and ploughing). In July, September and December 2016, all caterpillars were collected by hand from all plants along three 30 × 2-m transects in the centre of each plantation, and reared to adults for species identification.</p>",
