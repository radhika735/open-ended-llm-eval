For example, 12% of all British butterfly and moth species were recorded in a single summer in three small, traditionally managed orchards grazed by cattle (Smart &amp; Winnall 2006). However, traditional wood pastures have been lost due to conversion into more intensive forms of agriculture or pasture, or abandonment. Restoring management may therefore benefit a wide range of butterflies and moths.</p>\r\n<p><sub>Runquist E.
