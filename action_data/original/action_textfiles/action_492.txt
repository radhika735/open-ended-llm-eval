It was not possible to compare this success with natural nests, because the author was not confident they had found all unsuccessful natural nests. Nests consisted of cones of black or green roofing paper 17.8 cm at the widest and 5.1 cm deep. This study also examines nest use by American robins <em>Turdus migratorius</em>, and the effect of different coloured nests in ‘Use differently-coloured artificial nests’.</p><p> </p>",
