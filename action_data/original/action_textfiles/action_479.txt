In addition, great-crested grebes used sparsely covered islands and platforms at inland sites, and well-vegetated ones at coastal sites. Neither species used either type of nesting site in Scotland. The review also examines island and platform use by divers, rails, ground-nesting seabirds, waders and wildfowl.</p><p> </p>",
