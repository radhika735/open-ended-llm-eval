In 1990-4 the population had been showing a 4%/year decline. In addition, following the start of intensive anti-poaching activities, the young-to-adult ratio (which is related to recruitment rate) was 9% in 1995-6 (compared to an average of 6% for 1990-2003). However, the intensity of the anti-poaching effort could not be maintained and when it was reduced the ratio fell back to 6%.</p><p> </p>",

Before this, a series of severe harvesting events by Portuguese and Spanish fishermen in 1975-6 had reduced the population from 130,000-150,000 in the early 1900s, despite the <em>de jure</em> protection of the island from 1971.
