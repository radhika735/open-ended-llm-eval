Species richness (perches: 0.6-2.0; no perch: 0.2-0.8/m<sup>2</sup>) and abundance (perches: 0.7-2.7; no perches: 0.2-1.7) were higher under perches. Data were collected in 2002 in four pairs of perch and control plots (1 × 1 m) in each of 10 blocks randomly located inside a 2 ha area. Perches were 2 m tall with a 16 cm diameter pole and were placed in the centre of each perch plot.</p><p> </p>",
