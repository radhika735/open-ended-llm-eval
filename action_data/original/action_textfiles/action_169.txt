It focuses on integrating beneficial natural processes, by using efficient soil management and crop rotations for example, into modern farming techniques. Practitioners of Integrated Farm Management need to be able to clearly demonstrate improvement to the quality of soil, water, air, wildlife habitat and the landscape<em>.</em></p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">We have not included studies describing the effects of Integrated Farm Management because farms are able to use a variety of different management interventions and which were used in any particular case is not always recorded. Where individual interventions are recorded, studies are described in the appropriate section.</p>",
