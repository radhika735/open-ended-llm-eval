Most of these results were not tested for statistical significance. Between four and twenty years after grazing was stopped, average vegetation cover and height increased (data reported as graphical analyses) whilst the number of plant species decreased (from 43 to 34). For these measures, the previously grazed meadow became more like a never-grazed meadow and less like a heavily grazed meadow.

In 1977 and 1997, three sedge meadows were studied: one previously grazed (heavily grazed until 1973, when grazing stopped), one that remained heavily grazed, and one effectively never grazed (lightly grazed until the 1960s). Sedge meadows are sedge-dominated peatlands, fed by ground water. Cover and height of every plant species were recorded in 20–28 quadrats (0.2 m<sup>2</sup>) per meadow.</p>",

Deadline: Friday 19<sup>th</sup> January.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Round 2: Review the effectiveness category assigned to each action (online). Deadline Monday 29th January.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Round 3: Re-score any interventions that have been flagged up as being in the wrong effectiveness category (online). Deadline Wednesday 7th February.</strong></p>\r\n<p>I appreciate these are quite tight deadlines, but it's easier for everyone if we get the scoring done in a short timeframe. The longer the interval between rounds, the more time you all have to forget what you've read and scored!</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><strong>Some useful additional links:</strong></p>\r\n<p>(1) See <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V-WpNr5Ff__8s83QurtvV59JR5ILn6Gs/view?usp=sharing\">the document here</a> for further information about the scope of the synopsis, methods, and a complete list of interventions. Note that you have only been given around half of the interventions to score - there are other interventions for which we found no evidence.</p>\r\n<p>(2) Hyperlinks within the key messages should link to the relevant paragraphs, but don't work on the scoring system. You may want to read the evidence on the main Conservation Evidence website: all interventions are live at <a href=\"../../data/index/?synopsis_id[]=33\">https://www.www.conservationevidence.com/data/index/?synopsis_id[]=33</a></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><strong>Table 1. </strong>Effectiveness categories and thresholds used in this assessment</p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"line-height: 1.3;\"><em><img src=\"../../images/scoring_table_CE.bmp\" alt=\"Table 1 Effectiveness categories and thresholds\" /></em></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"line-height: 1.3;\"><em><br />ROUND 1</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>All the actions to be assessed will be listed on the <strong>Pending</strong> tab of the assessment page. There's 66 actions to assess but don't panic! 2/3 of the actions have three or fewer evidence paragraphs, so they should be very quick to assess.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>These instructions are always available from the link on the left hand side of this page (Read Instructions), and we encourage you to refer to them whenever you need to while taking part in the assessment.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Aim to assess all of the actions. Although it is possible to skip actions, we encourage you to score them all using the evidence provided.</li>\r\n<li>Open each action in the <strong>Pending</strong> tab in turn by clicking on the title. Start by reading all the summarised evidence we have found. Each action with evidence available will have:</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>a) <strong>Background section</strong>, describing the intervention;</li>\r\n<li>b) <strong>Key messages</strong>, providing an overview of the evidence;</li>\r\n<li>c) <strong>Supporting evidence,</strong> containing summaries of each study that tested the action. Clicking on the link beside the number will take you to the reference details.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong><em>Based on the evidence provided </em></strong><strong>please enter scores</strong> for the effectiveness, certainty and harms of the action, using a scale from 0-100. It is critical that your answers are based on information in the synopsis. Your expertise is invaluable for understanding and interpreting the evidence, but please do not base your assessments on your own personal knowledge or anecdotal evidence about an intervention.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>EFFECTIVENESS</strong>: The ‘effectiveness’ scale is from 0 (ineffective) to 100 (always effective), and should reflect how good an intervention is at benefitting peatland vegetation. This could be evaluated in a variety of different ways. For example, studies might have measured the change in number of cover of peatland-characteristic plant species following a specific intervention, or they may have measured the cover of plant groups (e.g. mosses or shrubs). For some interventions, studies might have measured knowledge or behaviour change that might ultimately benefit peatland vegetation – in this case, perhaps it is more difficult to judge effectiveness of the intervention for peatland vegetation.</p>\r\n<p>We would like you to score according to what we know about whether the <em>ultimate objective</em> of the intervention is being achieved, i.e. does the intervention make the vegetation more like the desired peatland vegetation?</p>\r\n<p>We realise that success of an intervention might look different in different locations, different kinds of peatlands and might depend on the aim of the intervention. All studies were aiming to conserve their focal peatland vegetation in a natural or semi-natural state. So if a study reports that the vegetation becomes more like a natural bog, fen or peat swamp or a semi-natural fen meadow (this will take a bit of expert judgement), then the study suggests the intervention is effective. If most studies suggest the intervention is effective in their situation, then the intervention overall would get a high effectiveness score.</p>\r\n<p><strong>CERTAINTY</strong>: The ‘certainty of evidence’ is a rating of how confident we can be about the effectiveness of an action, from 0 (no certainty; no useful evidence) to 100 (complete certainty; high quality evidence). To assess this, consider the quality of the evidence for the action. You should think about the number of studies, their coverage and wider applicability (species, geographical), the similarity of results across studies and the robustness of the experimental designs (e.g. randomised, replicated, controlled experiments with a large sample size will give more dependable results than a single before-and-after comparison).</p>\r\n<p><strong>HARMS</strong>: Harms in this context refers to any negative effects for peatland vegetation as a consequence of these interventions. If there is no evidence of harms please score this 0. Note that this does not include harms to anything other than peatland vegetation (e.g. birds or damage to the peat itself). These should have been flagged up in the background section for each intervention (you could comment if you think there is a major harm we have missed).</p>\r\n<p>Remember, you can exit and return to the survey several times at your convenience. You can also move backwards and forwards between interventions if necessary.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Please add a <strong>Score Comment</strong> for any actions where you feel this is useful. This is particularly important if your score does not follow obviously from the evidence provided, for example if you have given some studies more weight than others because of your knowledge of the system.</li>\r\n<li>Once you have opened an action, and either scored it or skipped it, it will be moved to the corresponding tab. Until you submit your final scores, you can re-open actions that have been moved to these tabs to check them or alter your scores if you need to.</li>\r\n<li>When you have moved all the actions from the <strong>Pending</strong> tab to the <strong>Scored</strong> tab, and you are happy with your scores for the assessment, please submit your final scores. Do this using the link on the left hand side of the assessment page.</li>\r\n<li>Please complete the scoring by the end of Friday 19<sup>th</sup> January.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><em>N.B. If you spot any factual mistakes or important omissions, feel free to add comments and we may be able to correct them. Major changes, such as adding more evidence, would affect the scoring so cannot be made at this point. If you feel inclined to suggest missing evidence, this can be incorporated into future updates.</em></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROUND 2</em></strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Your task is to review the group’s category of effectiveness for each action, based on the group median scores from the first round.</li>\r\n<li>You will receive a spreadsheet containing both your scores and the group median score for each action that has been assessed. Each of these will have been used to put the action into a category, one based on your scores, and one based on the group median score (see Table 1 above). <strong>The Group Category is the one you need to consider</strong> <strong>whether you agree with or not</strong>, as that will be the published assessment. This decision should be based on whether the category for an action reflects the evidence provided for its effectiveness, certainty and harms. Comments made by reviewers in the first round of the assessment are also available in the final columns next to each action. The URL for the evidence for each action is also provided if you wish to go back and check the evidence available.</li>\r\n<li>Please go through each of the actions in turn, and check if you are happy with the Group Category. It may be useful to read the reviewer’s comments, and/or check the original evidence (following the URL). If there are any actions that you believe have been placed in the wrong category by the group please indicate this in the “<strong>Strongly disagree?</strong>” column. For any actions where you disagree you need to provide a <strong>Supporting comment</strong> in the next column to explain why you disagree with the category. Please remember that <strong>all assessments must be based solely on the evidence presented on the Conservation Evidence website</strong>.</li>\r\n<li>Actions which at least two reviewers believe have been placed in the wrong category will be sent out for re-scoring in Round 3.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>UPDATE 23/01/18</p>\r\n<p>To clarify the scoring system (which many of you have queried):</p>\r\n<p>The question you are effectively answering for each intervention is: <em>On the basis of the evidence presented here, what are the effectiveness/certainty/harms of each intervention for benefitting peatland vegetation?</em></p>\r\n<p>High <strong>effectiveness</strong> means that the studies only ever report effects that benefit peatland vegetation. I'd save the very highest effectiveness when there are multiple metrics reported. Note that the effectiveness score can be high even if there is only one study: if this one study reports really positive effects on peatland vegetation.</p>\r\n<p><em>I'd reduce the effectiveness score if some studies report no effect, or negative effects on peatland vegetation in the context of their study system. An intervention where all studies report no or negative effects would be given an effectiveness score of 0%. Note that the harms score is used to distinguish interventions that have <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">no</span> effect and interventions that have <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">negative</span> effects.</em></p>\r\n<p>High <strong>certainty</strong> means there are lots of studies, of good quality, with a good geographical spread, and a good spread across peatland types for which this intervention is relevant (e.g. I wouldn't penalise cutting/mowing because there are no studies in peat swamps). </p>\r\n<p><em>I'd reduce the certainty score if any of these elements are lacking. </em></p>\r\n<p><strong>Harms</strong> are any negative effects on peatland vegetation reported in the summarised evidence. These might also contribute to your effectiveness score, but they are explicitly scored here.</p>\r\n<p>You are scoring the effectiveness of the interventions in the presented studies. If all of these are in bogs but the intervention could be used in fens and peat swamps, effectiveness might be high but the <em>certainty</em> would be low. Note there is an explanation alongside the scores when published to explain this: <em>\"The assessments are based on the available evidence for the target habitats for each intervention. The assessment may therefore refer to different habitat to the one(s) you are considering. Before making any decisions about implementing interventions it is vital that you read the more detailed accounts of the evidence in order to assess their relevance for your study species or system.\"</em></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROUND 3</em></strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You should have received a spreadsheet with actions to be rescored. <span style=\"line-height: 1.3;\">Only a subset of the actions, where a proportion of assessors have disagreed with the category, have been included in this round.</span></li>\r\n<li>Look at each action in turn. For each action, you can see the group’s median scores that the action received in the first round, as well as the Group Category of effectiveness (calculated from the median group score in Round 1). <span style=\"line-height: 1.3;\">Next to this you can see the comments that were made by the reviewers who flagged this action for re-scoring, so please make sure you read them.</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.3;\">Finally, you can see your scores from Round 1 (red text). </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.3;\">You are now given the opportunity to adjust your scores for Effectiveness, Certainty and Harms if you feel that they do not reflect the evidence well. If you wish to do this please just type over your old scores. Alternatively, if after reading the comments, you are happy with your original scores please leave them.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Once you have checked your scores for all actions that have been flagged for re-scoring please e-mail your scoresheet to <strong><u><a href=\"mailto:taylor@tourduvalat.org\">taylor@tourduvalat.org</a></u></strong>.
