This observation has led to the use of nurse plants – where the seeds of plants are sown underneath other existing plants in the hope that this will improve their chances of establishment. Adding woody debris for protection is a modification of this idea, where woody debris is added to increase the likelihood that plants sown underneath the debris will survive.</p>\r\n<p><sub>Brooker, R.W., Maestre, F.T., Callaway, R.M., Lortie, C.L., Cavieres, L.A., Kunstler, G., Liancourt, P., Tielbörger, K., Travis, J.M.J., Anthelme, F., Armas, C., Coll, L., Corcket, E., Delzon, S., Forey, E., Kikvidze, Z., Olofsson, J., Pugnaire, F., Quiroz, C.L., Saccone, P., Schiffers, K., Seifan, M., Touzard, B. &amp; Michalet, R.

At the end of the first growing season, there was no significant difference in survival between buffel grass seedlings planted next to piles of thorn branches (9%) and those without protection (6%). Survival in the second and third growing seasons after planting also did not differ significantly between seedlings with (91–98%) and without (95–100%) thorn branches. In April 2002, prior to seasonal rains, nine rows of 14 holes (14 cm diameter and 25 cm deep) were dug in bare ground. Seven holes in each row were piled with thorny Acacia branches, and seven holes were refilled as untreated controls. Buffel grass seeds (0.2 g) were sown in furrows 5 cm deep, 20 cm long and 10 cm away on either side of the rows of holes, and covered with soil. The site was grazed at a density of 0.8 sheep and goats/ha. Seedling survival was monitored from April 2002–November 2003, which included three complete growing seasons.</p>",
