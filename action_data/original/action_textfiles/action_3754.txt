Turtle abundance was statistically similar in restored streams (9 turtles/site) compared to pristine streams (4 turtles/site). Overall, turtle communities were statistically similar between restored and pristine streams, although turtle community composition was correlated with habitat characteristics (water quality and habitat structure) that were significantly different between restored and pristine streams (see original paper for details, including abundances of the eight turtle species captured). Turtle abundance and species richness was compared in six restored and six natural, undegraded streams by trapping turtles using hoop nets in May–July 2009 (12 total trap nights/site). Restored streams were in their second to fifth growing season after restoration and shared similar characteristics (see original paper for details of restoration approach). Pristine streams were selected based on biological integrity and proximity to restored streams. Captured turtles were weighed, individually marked (or assessed for distinguishing scars) and released.</p>",

Trapping surveys indicated that overall lizard abundance was similar in restored stands (127–171 lizards/site/100 trap nights) compared to unrestored stands (62–74), whereas visual encounter surveys found that overall reptile abundance was greater at restored sites (results reported as statistical results). See original paper for the effects of restoration on individual species. In winter–spring 2012–2013, restoration of saltcedar-cottonwood/willow <em>Salix </em>spp stands was carried out along the Virgin River, including: introducing/redirecting water flows by trenching, mechanically removing 50% of saltcedar and Russian olive <em>Elaegnus angustifolia</em>, spraying stumps with herbicide and transplanting native plants. Saltcedar in Utah was subject to biocontrol by northern tamarisk beetles <em>Diorhabda carinulata </em>from 2006 (see original paper for details). Reptiles were monitored in two restored and six unrestored stands in May–July 2013–2014 using drift fences with pitfall and funnel traps (1,060 total trap days) and visual encounter surveys (3 transects/site, see original paper for details).</p>",
