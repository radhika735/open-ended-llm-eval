        "background_definitions": "<p>Captive breeding involves taking wild animals into captivity and establishing and maintaining breeding populations. It tends to be undertaken when wild populations become very small or fragmented or when they are declining rapidly. Captive populations can be maintained while threats in the wild are reduced or removed and can provide an insurance policy against catastrophe in the wild. Captive breeding also potentially provides a method of increasing reproductive output beyond what would be possible in the wild. However, captive breeding can result in problems associated with inbreeding depression, removal of natural selection and adaptation to captive conditions. The aim is usually to release captive-bred animals back to natural habitats, either to original sites once conditions are suitable, to reintroduce species to sites that were occupied in the past or to introduce species to new sites. Some captive populations may also be used for research to benefit wild populations.</p>\r\n<p>Due to the number of studies found, this action has been split by species group, though no studies were found for amphisbaenians.

Over five nesting seasons, captive Galápagos giant tortoise females laid 19 nests in artificial nesting sites, two in natural nesting sites, and six clutches were laid on the surface of their enclosure (tortoises were unable to construct nests). For eggs that were collected and artificially incubated, 75% (24 of 32) were fertile and 63% (20 of 32) hatched successfully. In comparison, 80–86% (519 of 653 total eggs) of eggs from wild, undisturbed nests (of two other giant tortoise subspecies) were fertile, and hatching success was 76–82% (494 of 653 eggs) (results were not statistically tested). One male and ten female Galápagos giant tortoises were brought into a captive breeding enclosure to mate and nest from the 1967/1968 nesting season. In 1969/1970, 1970/1971 and 1971/1972 nesting seasons, artificial nest sites were provided (fine soil, minimum 3 m<sup>2</sup> and 35–40 cm deep). Nests were excavated the day after being laid and moved for artificial incubation. Hatching success was evaluated for six clutches in the 1970/1971 nesting season (1–7 eggs/clutch) and compared to 81 clutches of <em>Geochelone elephantopus porteri</em> (520 total eggs) and <em>Geochelone elephantopus ephippium </em>(133 total eggs) laid in 1969/1970–1970/1971.</p>",
