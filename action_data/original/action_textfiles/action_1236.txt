Total plant cover was similar between treatments (unseeded: 41%; seeded: 48%). Thirty-two plots (15 × 15 m) were established in each control (unseeded) and seeded area (seeded in September 1994 with seed mix containing 80% annual grass, 15%, short-lived perennial species and 5%  nitrogen-fixing legumes).
