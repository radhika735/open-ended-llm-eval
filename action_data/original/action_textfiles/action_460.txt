Organic fields possessed a significantly greater diversity of nesting species (1.6 vs. 0.9 species/field) and higher nest densities than conventional fields (0.12 vs. 0.05 nests/ha). Although organic fields did not differ in bird abundance from other field treatments, nest density of three special concern species (northern pintail <em>Anas acuta</em>, grasshopper sparrow <em>Ammodramus savannarum</em> and lark bunting <em>Calamospiza melanocorys</em>) was greatest in organic fallow fields. There were no significant differences in nest loss or daily survival rate between treatments. The effects of reduced tillage are discussed in ‘Reduce tillage’.</p><p> </p>",

This held true for all crop types for which there was a large enough sample for statistical comparison (cereals: 0.16-0.38 territories/ha for organic fields vs. 0.06-0.17 territories/ha for conventional fields; silage: 0.22-0.24 territories/ha vs. 0.03-0.08 territories/ha; grazed pasture: 0.05-0.10 territories/ha vs. 0.00-0.02 territories/ha). Set-aside fields on organic farms had higher territory densities, but this difference was not significant (0.33-0.56 territories/ha for organic vs. 0.26-0.36 territories/ha). Estimated nest survival was higher on organic fields than conventional fields (approximately 35% survival to fledging on organic fields vs. approximately 25% for conventional fields), but this was not significant, possibly because sample sizes were too small. This study also describes the impact of set-aside on skylarks, discussed in ‘Provide or retain set-aside areas in farmland’.</p><p> </p>",

In upland areas, of 37 species recorded, one was more abundant on farms, 4 more abundant in wild areas, whereas the rest showed no distinct preference. Organic farms on uplands exhibited greater species richness and abundance than conventional farms. In wetland areas, of 79 species recorded, seven were more abundant on organic or wild sites while the rest displayed no preference. Organic farms were government-certified as not having used agrochemicals for at least four years.  This study is discussed in more detail in ‘Reduce tillage’.</p><p> </p>",

However, this was only due to a higher breeding density, as nest success was (non-significantly) lower on organic farms (39-54% of 161 nests surviving on organic farms vs. 45-67% of 95 nests on conventional farms), mainly because more lapwing nests were lost to agricultural activity on organic farms (62-65% of losses due to farming activities on organic farms vs. 38-50% on conventional).</p><p> </p>",

Three species were more abundant on organic fields than conventional, whilst four non-farmland species were more abundant on conventional fields. Omnivores were more abundant than insect-eating birds on organic, compared to conventional fields. The authors point out that organic fields were less disturbed than other managements.
