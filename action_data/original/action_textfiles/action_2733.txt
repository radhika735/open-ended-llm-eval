Removing fish that are carrying/brooding eggs (females or males) or live young (such as many sharks) not only kills the adult but prevents successful spawning or rearing of the young and limits the overall reproductive potential of the population. Releasing fish with eggs or live young may help sustain fish populations and protect the hatching or rearing of young fish.</p>",
