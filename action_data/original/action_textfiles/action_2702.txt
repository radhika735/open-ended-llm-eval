        "background_definitions": "<p>Fishing traps are a widespread traditional method for catching fish and crustacean species. They are passive gears, relying on bait or tidal currents to catch the desired species. Traps vary widely in design and are commonly in the form of portable pot- or bottle-shaped cages. However, some fishing nets are also called fish traps (e.g. fyke nets) and consist of much larger fixed or semi-fixed structures involving several sections of staked netting leading to a collecting bag/basket. The type and location of traps depends on the species being targeted. Types that target adult fish and eels (e.g. pound nets or fyke nets) or certain crustacean species like prawns/shrimps, may also catch considerable quantities of immature fish. In certain conditions (e.g. shallow estuaries in summer), trapped immature fish may die before they are released. Fish caught in crustacean traps may also suffer damage and mortality caused by the commercially targeted species. Modifications to traditional trap designs may help to prevent unwanted fish species or sizes from being retained in traps and thus reduce fish mortality.</p>",

The first of two modifications, submerging the pot net (the last enclosure in the net before the fyke net – akin to a codend), reduced catches of all species: by 91% for brown trout; 86% for salmon; and 75% for rainbow trout. The second, raising the guard net (located at the entrance to the pound net) to the surface using floats reduced numbers of brown trout (raised: 5–25 fish, not raised: 14–60 fish) but not salmon (raised: 6–18 fish, not raised: 13–15 fish) or rainbow trout (raised: 2–4 fish, not raised: 1–2 fish). In addition, catches of legal-sized individuals of the target eel <em>Anguilla anguilla</em> were similar for both comparisons. Pound net fishing was done in April/May 1992 and 1993 at five locations in the Randers Fjord estuary (22 km<sup>2</sup>), eastern Jutland, in 2–4 m depth. Every one or two days, pound nets were changed from a standard configuration to a modified one, either with a surface floating guard net or with submerged pot net, and vice versa. For the submerged nets, three different depths were fished: 55, 75 and 100 cm below sea level. The daily catch in each pound net was recorded as the number of each species from both the pot and fyke net sections within a 24 h period.</p>",

Across sites, catch numbers of unwanted eel and flounder (the two main unwanted fish species caught) were lower in modified nets (eel: 3, flounder: 7) than unmodified nets (eel: 37 fish, flounder: 43). The species composition (fish and invertebrates) was different between nets (for fish, flounder and mummichog <em>Fundulus heteroclitus</em> accounted most for the reduced catch in modified nets) and the number of unwanted species was lower in modified nets (modified: 5 species, unmodified: 12 species). In addition, numbers of target catch of green crab <em>Carcinus maenas</em> were reduced in modified nets (modified: 1,791, unmodified: 6,637). Data were collected at four sites in Murray Harbour off Prince Edward Island in July 2016. At each site, a removable ‘bycatch reduction device’ was randomly assigned to one of two conventional fyke nets (used to target green crab) and both nets set 100 m apart for three sets of four consecutive 24 h deployments, the device being switched between nets/set. After each individual 24 h deployment, fyke nets were fished at low tide. The ‘bycatch reduction device’ consisted of a sloped barricade ramp attached to a removable hoop with an entrance slit designed to prevent entry of non-target species (see paper for gear specifications).</p>",
