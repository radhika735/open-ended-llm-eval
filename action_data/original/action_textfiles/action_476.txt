Rehabilitating birds that have been injured may therefore be an important conservation action, particularly if it occurs on a large scale. In 1978, there were approximately 225 active wildlife or raptor rehabilitation programmes in the USA (Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 1988), showing that if they are effective, such programmes could make a real difference to bird populations.</p>\r\n<p>Hamilton, L.L., Zwank, P.J. &amp; Olsen, G.H.

Of these, 2.4% were recovered (i.e. were injured or killed), with 55% of these recoveries being within six weeks of release. Release rates for owls were lower (175 of 551 birds, 32%) and a higher proportion of owls (8%) were recovered after release. However, only 21% of these were within six weeks of release. Two of nine turkey vultures <em>Cathartes aura </em>released and neither was recovered. Size of bird did not seem to affect possibility of release and the severity of the original injury did not appear to affect post-release survival.</p>",

This implies that these four releases were successful as starvation normally occurs within two to three weeks if hawks do not feed. The remaining three red-tailed hawks could not be successfully tracked. The birds had been admitted to a rehabilitation centre for a range of reasons, from confiscation by officials to gunshot wounds and had been in the centre from a few weeks to over a year.</p><p> </p>",
