        "background_definitions": "<p class=\"Background\">As trees reach old age, they become smaller and their canopy becomes sparse because of the dieback of their outermost branches. As a result, ancient trees in dense forest stand the risk of being overtopped by younger, taller trees. Haloing involves the removal of these young, competing trees from around the ancient tree. This may release ancient trees from competition and allow them to survive for longer. However, sudden changes in environmental conditions (such as light availability) due to the removal of the surrounding canopy may also damage or kill ancient trees.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",
