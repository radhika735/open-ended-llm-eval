        "background_definitions": "<p>Intensive agriculture constitutes a major source of pollution to marine and freshwater environments. Agricultural waste and pollutants can enter rivers and other watercourses and be discharged into the sea. Excess nutrients from agricultural waste can lead to diminished water quality and eutrophication events, including harmful algal blooms. Some species used in aquaculture can naturally improve water quality through feeding (e.g. filter feeding species, such as mussels) or through photosynthesis (e.g. algae species). Establishing certain types of aquaculture near polluted areas may help to remove excess nutrients (Duarte &amp; Krause-Jensen 2018).</p>\r\n<p><sup>Duarte C.M. &amp; Krause-Jensen D.
