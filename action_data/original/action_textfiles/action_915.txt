Three experimental feeds were fed to fish; high-fish meal diet (20% of total feed ingredients), medium-fish meal diet (15% of total feed ingredients) and low-fish meal diet (10% of total feed ingredients). Salmon were stocked in 60m circular sea cages and fed using automated feeders for a period of 275 days. Weights were recorded.</p><p> </p>",
