After 112 days, fish fed a diet containing 6.25 % bacterial protein weighed more (3.69kg) than fish fed diets containing 12.5 %, 25 % and 50 % bacterial protein (3.24kg, 3.03kg and 2.63kg, respectively) or the control diet (3.44kg). From days 113 to 364, growth rates in fish fed the control diet and bacterial protein replacement diets up to 25% were similar. In the 50% replacement diet, growth rates were lower. Salmon were fed diets in which bacterial protein made up 6.25%, 12.5%, 25% and 50% of total dietary amino acids, replacing fish meal or a control diet made up of 100% fish meal.
