This can reduce the risk of inbreeding; help safeguard small populations from extinction due to catastrophic events and/or increase the occupied range. Translocations can also be used to move reptiles to areas where threats have been removed, such as islands where invasive predators have been eradicated. However, translocations are typically expensive and may risk spreading pathogens to previously unexposed areas.</p>\r\n<p>Release techniques vary considerably, from ‘hard releases’ involving the simple release of individuals into the wild, to ‘soft releases’ that involve a variety of adaptation and acclimatisation techniques before release or post-release feeding and care.</p>\r\n<p>This action includes studies which may combine different release techniques, but studies that explicitly test these different techniques are summarized separately under <em><a href=\"../../actions/3724\">Use holding pens or enclosures at release site prior to release of wild reptiles</a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3774\">Use holding pens or enclosures at release site prior to release of captive-bred reptiles</a> </em>and <a href=\"../../actions/3725\"><em>Release reptiles into burrows</em></a>.</p>\r\n<p>This action includes the translocation of wild juvenile or adult reptiles.

Trapping success ranged from 0.4 skinks/100 trap days (2.5 year after release) to 3.1 skinks/100 trap days (5 years after release, but larger area trapped). On another predator free island 25% of marked skinks were recaptured and trapping success was 0.3 and 0.9 skinks/100 trap days. In 1987, twenty-eight skinks (15 adults, 3 gravid females) were captured using pitfall traps on a predator-free island and translocated to the release island from February 1988 to March 1990. Each skink was released into an artificial burrow and stacks of plywood were provided as extra cover. Pitfall traps were placed in the release are (initially 49, increased to 69 traps over 580 m<sup>2</sup>) and were monitored twice/year.</p>",
