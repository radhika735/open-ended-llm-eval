Tortoises in irrigated and non-irrigated enclosures had similar hatching success (irrigated: 67% across 5 nests; non-irrigated: 77% across 7 nests) and juvenile survival (90% of 15 tortoises). Growth rate was higher in the first year in irrigated enclosures (15% increase/year) than in non-irrigated enclosures (4% increase/year). For tortoises hatched in 2003, those from irrigated enclosures were larger than those from non-irrigated enclosures after four years (irrigated: 81 cm; non-irrigated: 55 cm; 3 from each treatment; data from other years not provided). Enclosures were constructed in a natural habitat setting, of which six were irrigated (25–38 mm of water delivered through a sprinkler system three times in late winter-spring) and nine received only natural rain. Wild, adult females (number not given) were brought into the pens to lay eggs before being re-released. Hatching success was determined by counting hatchlings and un-hatched eggs, and hatchlings were marked, measured and re-measured after a year.</p>",

Hatchlings from watered nests had higher mass (watered: 17 g; un-watered: 16 g), straight carapace length (watered: 42 mm; un-watered: 40 mm) and straight carapace width (watered: 33 mm; un-watered: 32 mm) compared to those from un-watered nests. Growth in straight carapace width over 10 weeks was higher for hatchlings from watered compared to un-watered nests (watered: 65 mm; un-watered 62 mm after 10 weeks), though there was no significant difference in growth in mass (watered: 89 mm; not watered: 79 mm after 10 weeks) and straight carapace length (watered: 76 mm; not watered: 72 mm after 10 weeks). In one nesting season, eggs from 10 nests were divided in half and reburied 1 m apart (10 pairs of nests, buried 60 cm deep). One received 45 minutes of daily watering, while the other received no additional watering. Hatchlings (67 from watered, 55 from un-watered nests) were transferred to tanks supplied with fresh seawater, and measurements of mass, straight carapace length and width were taken weekly for 10 weeks.</p>",
