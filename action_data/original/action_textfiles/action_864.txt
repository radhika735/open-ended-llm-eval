Overall, the population on the islands increased from 1,112 to 3,520 toads over the seven years. Numbers were similar on islands with just pond creation and restoration (1,020 to 952) and increased on the two where cattle grazing was also reintroduced (92 to 2,568). Overall, pond occupancy increased from 23 to 51 and the number of ponds with successful breeding increased from nine to 15. In 1989–1997, ponds were created or restored by removing plants and dredging. Cattle grazing was reintroduced to 73 ha of coastal meadows and abandoned fields on two islands. Populations were monitored annually in 1990–1997 during 2–3 call and visual surveys and dip-netting surveys. One population was also monitored in 1987–1989.</p><p> </p>",
